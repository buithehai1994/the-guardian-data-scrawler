What’s most revealing is that few seem to careJohn HarrisThese vital spaces have been the first targets of cuts in a nation that favours age over youth – despite being the remedy for blights such as social division, polarisation and lonelinessSun 12 Oct 2025 09.12 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareAconsensus seems to have recently settled in UK politics: that young British lives are not as they should be, and something must be done. Our teens and twentysomethings, we are told, arelonely, phone-addicted, “overdiagnosed”, and too oftenjobless, which entails a great blizzard of proposals – from welfare reform to thescaling-back of universityeducation – that seem to have more to do with older voters’ prejudices than the real-life problems of other generations. At the next election, the extension of the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds may do something to correct that, but I wouldn’t count on it. There is, after all, something deep within the British psyche that favours age over youth, and consequently misrepresents and ignores the latter in a way that sometimes looks almost pathological.If you want a vivid example, consider a drastic loss from millions of young lives that is still bafflingly overlooked. During the first 10 years of the spending cuts that began in 2010, councils’ funding for youth services in England and Wales suffered areal-terms cutof 70%. By 2023, about 1,200 publicly run youth centres hadclosed, and more than 4,500 youth workers hadlost their jobs. Villages, towns and cities still bear the scars: empty buildings that look just as forlorn as any shuttered library or Sure Start centre. But while other aspects of the austerity disaster have at least been acknowledged, this one still seems to be a strange kind of guilty secret, with seemingly no chance of all that lost provision ever being restored.For anyone who wants to understand how tragic that is, there is now aset text: a recently published book titled Up the Youth Club, by the journalist and writer Emma Warren, is both a superb work of social history, and a passionate call for a newly energised, modern version of everything she writes about. Her story goes back 150 years, and is split between the state and voluntary sectors. What ties everything together is the provision of what she describes as “warm and welcoming” spaces, where “those who are in their second decade of life can gather regularly … to do things they like doing … where restorative ‘hanging out’ is welcome”. There is fascinating material about trailblazing meeting places for LGBTQ+ people, the centrality of youth clubs to the music scenes of cities such as Bristol and Coventry, and their role as connection points in postwar new towns. And one theme recurs time and again: the plain fact that youth services ought to be thought of as one of the public realm’s most basic elements.As 21st-century Conservatives renew their faith in blindly shrinking the state, the book also contains a timely example of why they ought instead to reflect on how their party came to loseany semblance of a social conscience. In 1958, the Tory government led by Harold Macmillan commissioned a watershedreport about youth services, put together by an aristocratic social reformer called Lady Diana Albemarle. From the vantage point of 2025, much of what it portrayed is grimly familiar: she found youth services “in a state of acute depression”, with the people who provided them “neglected and held in small regard, both in educational circles and by public opinion generally”. Youth provision, it said, was “dying on its feet”. But as Warren describes, Conservative politicians then made huge changes: 3,000 new buildings, 160 new sports projects, and newly expanded and professionalised youth services.Years later, many of us enjoyed the remaining legacy of all that: dependable places, open most nights of the week, where we could find out who we were. We learned how to relate to adults who were not our parents and teachers and therefore tended to treat us as their equals, and let us organise our own time. For me and my friends, that meant precious rehearsal time for us and our fellow teenage musicians, and the chance to play in front of our peers. But for others, youth clubs represented something much more important: what we now call safe spaces, where they could be gently pointed towards the kind of help that was often urgently needed.Though the decline of youth clubs began in the Thatcher years, this is what austerity so cruelly snatched away, and we are now living with the consequences. Back in 2014, Ireported oncrushing local austerity in Newcastle, and drastic cuts to its youth centres. One youth worker based in the middle of the city told me about what that meant for drug and alcohol advice and programmes focused on teenage pregnancy. He also mentioned Alexis Jay’sreport on child sexualexploitation in Rotherham, and one of its most pointed sentences: “We met several experienced and skilled youth workers who voiced serious concerns about the severity of the cutbacks in the youth services and specifically how it was impacting on their work with vulnerable young people.”There is, moreover, striking evidence that cuts to youth clubslead toincreased teenage crime and measurably poorer educational outcomes. But spending cuts have one particularly pernicious effect: the way that they sooner or later start to twist many people’s thinking, so that yesterday’s crucial service is suddenly reframed as today’s faded throwback. In that sense, it may be easy to think of youth clubs as old-fashioned spaces, synonymous with trite jokes about table tennis and flat Coke. But that, once again, is an old person’s perspective, and they actually remain vital places, as no end of research proves.In 2009, just before austerity began to blitz London’s youth services, the Greater London authority’s Young Londoners’ Survey found that 41% of respondents aged between 11 and 16 attended youth clubs at least once a week. Last year, anotherpiece of research– commissioned by the London-based organisation Legacy Youth Zone – focused on what it called “isolation through screens”, and a corresponding “need for connection”. More than half of the young people involved said they would like to reduce screen time, but 46% felt “unable” to. And then came the kicker: “93% of young people who have attended a youth centre say it has made a positive difference to their lives.”Even if some of our politicians grasp this point, they have yet to convincingly respond to it. Labour has made a fewannouncements about boosted spending, but the funds are unlikely to stretch as far as youth services. And thesums involvedremain comparatively small. Austerityhacked almost£1bn a year from youth services, and deep problems will remain, even though they answer so many 21st-century questions – about social division, polarised attitudes, and much more besides.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has likened herself to Thatcher, telling Tories at their annual conference that she too was being written off like Thatcher once was.While Thatcher’s face was a constant presence at this year’s Tory conference, party sources say even many on its rightwing pay lip service to her memory while regarding her small-state philosophy as out of kilter with Britain in 2025.“She is very important though when it comes to mobilising donors,” they added.Many of those donors and those who were close to Thatcher are preferring to go to more private dinners. Among those is Sir Rocco Forte, the Brexit-backing hotelier who helped to fund Johnson’s election win and knew Thatcher. He remains tentatively supportive of Badenoch.He said: “I don’t think there really is a standard bearer for [Thatcher] at the moment in politics. I would say the Conservative party itself now is divided between a big faction which I would not even call Conservative and Kemi Badenoch, who I do still think is a serious believer in what Margaret Thatcher advocated.”Tickets for the sold-out Guildhall event ranged in price from £195 for an individual up to £3,000 for a VIP table. While there will also be Tory grandees such as Michael Howard at the dinner this year, they will be joined by Reform UK figures including its deputy leader, Richard Tice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The key thing is that she was a transformational leader of a country that was in trouble then, as it is now.”Events elsewhere include a dinner at the Carlton Club and an 80s-themed disco thatConservativesare holding on Monday at a location described as an ‘‘iconic central London nightclub”.Organisations that have been putting on events include the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the thinktank Thatcher co-founded and which provided the intellectual stimulus for her policies.Its director, Robert Colvile, said the Tory conference had probably gone “too far” by displaying her dresses in glass boxes. But he insisted that her political echoes remained powerful, pointing to a CPS event that was packed out by delegates.“If you look at the polls, she is consistently viewed as the most effective leader we have had. Her self-appointed mission was to turn around a Britain that was in decline and we are pretty obviously in that situation again now. Even people like Keir Starmer, while disagreeing with her policy, admit that they admire her for bringing change.”Explore more on these topicsConservativesMargaret ThatcherKemi BadenochfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They usually follow certain rules – either an attempt at a toughened-up R&B sound, replete with at least one single featuring a guest appearance by an American rapper, or a lunge towards “grownup” Radio 2-friendly smooth pop-rock territory – and they usually amount to a dimly remembered placeholder, the sight and sound of someone gamely killing time in the years before the inevitable reunion tour.It’s a state of affairs that makes the idiosyncratic path thus far followed by Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall oddly invigorating. She’s certainly not above doing the kind of things that former talent show band members are wont to do, among them loudly underlining that she’s no longer subject to the media-trained constraints of the manufactured pop industry – judging by tonight’s crowd, the most popular item on the merchandise stall is a fan emblazoned with the legend “TINA SAYS YOU’RE A CUNT”, a lyric from Gossip, her collaboration with dance duo Confidence Man – but nevertheless, the music she’s opted to make is pop of a noticeably more intriguing stripe than usual. She opened her solo account with last year’s superb Angel Of My Dreams, a deeply odd, jolting and disjointed melange of big pop balladry, noisy synthesisers and samples from Sandie Shaw’s Puppet On A String.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Headache melds an Abba-esque chorus with verses that are offer a borderline atonal brand of funk or are enfolded by cavernous echo. She dedicates Unconditional to her mum: it has a fabulous melody, early 80s syndrums, and crashing rock guitar allied to clanging industrial drums. IT Girl unexpectedly reanimates the sound of early 00s electroclash, or rather the thrilling strain of early 00s pop that was heavily influenced by electroclash, while Natural at Disaster starts out like a piano ballad before unexpectedly swerving into a malevolent electronic grind. The woman at its centre is a hugely appealing, cheerily unvarnished presence: she is, she announces at one point, “shaking like a shitting dog”; shouting out her LGBTQ+ fanbase, who are here in force, she suggests thanking them by adding a branded jockstrap to the merch stand.It may well end the way these kind of solo careers end – the enmity towards former bandmate Jesy Nelson expressed in Natural at Disaster patched up, a press conference to announce that Little Mix are back – but the fact the entire audience seem to be word-perfect as they sing along to an album that only came out a month ago makes you wonder. And even if it does, the closing Angel Of My Dreams underlines that Thirlwall’s solo career is unlikely to recede into the realms of the dimly remembered placeholder.Jade plays the O2 Victoria Warehouse in Manchester tonight and istouring the UKuntil 23 October.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockLittle MixreviewsShareReuse this content"

Usually if they want to win an Oscar, however, they have to reach for more serious roles. The late Diane Keaton, whodied unexpectedly this week, followed a reverse trajectory and made it look disarmingly natural. Her first major film role was in The Godfather, about as serious an American masterpiece as has ever been made. But that same year, she reprised the part of Linda, the object of a nerdy hero’s affection, in a film adaptation of Broadway’s Play It Again, Sam. (Keaton originated the role opposite playwright Woody Allen on the stage.) She continued to alternate serious dramas with romantic comedies throughout the ’70s, and it was the latter that won her an Oscar for best actress, changing the genre permanently.Diane Keaton, Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, dies aged 79Read moreThat Oscar was for Annie Hall, co-written and directed by Allen, with Keaton as the title character, one half of the movie’s fractured love story. Allen and Keaton had been in a romantic relationship before making the film, and remained close friends for the rest of her life; in interviews, Keaton had characterized Annie as an idealized version of herself, through Allen’s eyes. It would be easy, then, to assume Keaton’s performance involves doing what came naturally to her. But there’s too much range in Keaton’s work, both between her Godfather performance and her Allen comedies and within Annie Hall itself, to dismiss her facility with romantic comedy as simply turning on the charm – though she was, of course, tremendously charming.Annie Hall famously served as Allen’s transition between more gag-based broad comedies and a more naturalistic style. As such, it has plenty of gags, fantasy sequences, and a freewheeling patchwork of a relationship memoir in between some stinging insights into a doomed romantic relationship. (The script even included a murder mystery, presumably repurposed to some degree in Allen and Keaton’s 1993 reunion, Manhattan Murder Mystery.) Keaton, similarly, presides over a transition in American rom-coms, playing neither the screwball-era speed-talker or the bombshell ditz popularized in the 1950s. Instead, she mixes and matches aspects of both to create something entirely new that still reads as oddly contemporary today, interrupting her own boldness with her own false-start hesitations.View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton in Annie Hall.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarWatch, for example, the scene where Annie and Alvy Singer (Allen) first connect after a tennis game, fumbling over ping-ponging invitations for a ride (despite the fact that only one of them has a car). The banter is fast, but zig-zags around unpredictably, with Keaton soloing around her own discomfort before winding up in a cul-de-sac of “la di da”, a phrase that encapsulates her nervous whimsy. The movie physicalizes that sensibility in the next scene, as she makes blasé small talk while driving recklessly through Manhattan streets. Later, she centers herself singing It Had to Be You in a nightclub.These aren’t examples of Annie acting erratic. Throughout the movie, there’s a dimensionality to her light zaniness – her hippie-hangover willingness to try drugs, her panic over lobsters and spiders, her refusal to be manipulated by Alvy’s attempts to shape her into someone more superficially serious (which for him means death-obsessed). At first, Annie might seem like an odd character to win an Oscar; she’s the romantic lead in a movie seen from a man’s point of view, and the central couple’s arc doesn’t bend toward either changing enough accommodate the other. Yet Annie does change, in ways both observable and unknowable. She just doesn’t become a more suitable partner for Alvy. Plenty of later rom-coms stole the superficial stuff – neurotic hang-ups, quirky fashions – without quite emulating Annie’s ultimate independence.Diane Keaton: a life in picturesRead moreMaybe Keaton was wary of that tendency. After her working relationship with Allen ended, she took a break from rom-coms; Baby Boom is really her only one from the entirety of the 1980s. But during her absence, Annie Hall, the character perhaps moreso than the loosely structured movie, became a model for the genre. Meg Ryan, for example, owes most of her rom-com career to Keaton’s ability to play smart and flibbertigibbet simultaneously. This made Keaton seem like a permanent rom-com queen even as she was actually playing more wives (whether happily, as in Father of the Bride, or less so, as in The First Wives Club) and/or moms (see The Family Stone or Because I Said So) than single gals falling in love. Even in her reunion with Allen, they’re a long-married couple brought closer together by comic amateur sleuthing – and she slips into that role easily, beautifully.View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton and Jack Nicholson in Something’s Gotta Give.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarBut Keaton did have another major rom-com hit in 2003 with Something’s Gotta Give, as a playwright in love with a younger-dating cad (Jack Nicholson, naturally). The result? Her final Oscar nomination, and a whole subgenre of romances where older women (usually played by movie stars, but still!) reassert their romantic and/or social agency. Part of the reason her death seems like such a shock is that Keaton was still making those movies as recently as last year, a constant multiplex presence. Now audiences will be pivoting from taking that presence for granted to realizing what an enormous influence she was on the romantic comedy as we know it. If it’s harder to think of present-day versions of Meg Ryan or Goldie Hawn who similarly follow in Keaton’s footsteps, that’s probably because it’s rare for a performer of Keaton’s skill to dedicate herself to a genre that’s mostly been streaming fodder for a while now.Consider: there are 10 living female actors who received at least four best actress nominations, including Nicole Kidman, Jane Fonda and Ellen Burstyn. It’s rare for one of those roles to originate in a romantic comedy, let alone half of them, as was the case for Keaton. Because her persona became so familiar, it may have been easy to overlook just how much nuance and care Keaton brought to a genre better known for its star turns. She had the requisite star quality too, and depended on it plenty in movies like the Book Club series (where she lives the obvious dream of the Adam Sandler crew and literally plays a character called Diane). But she also played characters like Annie Hall, Erica in Something’s Gotta Give, and the more aloof Mary in Manhattan with a passion, at once comic and touching, missing from more plastic imitations of Annie or Nancy (Meyers, who only directed Keaton once, but through her writing became as associated with her later period as Allen was with her earlier stuff). Maybe she was able to carry that disappointment and disillusionment from the Godfather movies with her, subtly grounding her later roles. Or maybe comedy really is more complicated to play than drama. Regardless, it’s no wonder she was so associated with romance, despite a greater range. Keaton’s characters may have been deceptively difficult to pin down, but like her, they were easy to love.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonRomance filmsComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How would the introduction of a price path target help to address it?”After reading the question three times, I still couldn’t make sense of it. I groaned, went back to the textbook, tried to read, made a cup of tea, and tried again. Nothing improved my focus. Then my phone lit up with a message from my friend Anisa: a picture of my name spelled out in Scrabble letters.On my way. Stay there, I replied.Perhaps a little break was what I needed. It was only 10.30pm, early by my standards. And, maybe, if I asked nicely and she was in a good mood, Anisa would come back to my room and explain the essay question to me. I left the textbook on my desk and grabbed my coat.Outside, the moon lit up rows of daffodils, and the fresh cut grass stuck to my shoes as I crossed the playing fields. At the farther-most edge of Lady Margaret Hall’s gardens sat my destination – an old potting shed that the college calls “the summerhouse” and students call “the shack”. It had three walls clad in clapboard siding, small rectangular windows, and a wood-shingled roof covered in moss. The builders had left the fourth wall open to nature. Sometimes I sat in the shack alone and listened to the rain splashing off the roof or watched otters play on the riverbank. It was one of my favourite places on campus, like something out of a storybook.Inside was a wooden bench, chairs and two small tables. On one wall, shelves held broken plates, green and blue glass bottles, and a bowl of old keys – treasures dug up by the gardeners. On the opposite wall, three old mirrors hung above a bookshelf containing weather-beaten board games, pillar candles and the occasional book. Dozens of loose Scrabble letters were scattered around the shack; students used them to spell out their names, an impermanent version of writing “X was here” on a bathroom wall.Anisa was sitting with two boys I recognised from the business course, around an unusual object on the table between them. The clear glass container had a smaller glass tube poking out at the base and looked like something nicked from the chemistry lab.“Hi guys,” I said, nodding to the room. “What’s that?”Without answering, one of the boys picked it up and hovered a lighter over the smaller tube. I heard a bubbling sound and he disappeared behind a cloud of smoke. The smell answered my question.I knew this feeling, the terror of being trapped inside my body. This had happened beforeIt wasn’t the first time I’d been around people smoking weed. I’d even tried it myself; my friends shouted confusing instructions like “You have to inhale! Swallow and then breathe out at the same time! No, breathe with your mouth, not your nose!” As far as I knew, I’d never been high, but it felt cool and grown-up to blow smoke in the air and lazily pass the joint to the next person.“Your turn,” the boy said.“Nah, I’ve done it before and it doesn’t work on me,” I replied.“Chalk and cheese,” Anisa said. I gave her an exasperated look; she knew very well by now that I never understood her Britishisms. “What I mean is,” she continued, “a bong is totally different from a joint. Much more effective, fit for purpose.”Fine, why not? I’m already out here, might as well have a new college experience. The boy to my right held the lighter while I lifted the bong to my face. Then my face filled with smoke, and I doubled over, coughing. Anisa laughed. Everyone took a turn while we chatted about our holiday travels.Eventually it came back around to me. “OK, one more, but this is it,” I said. I held the lighter myself this time, brought the mouthpiece slowly up to my face, and didn’t cough. I sat back in my chair and zoned out while the others continued their conversation.At some point, I looked at my phone and saw it was past 1am. How is that possible? I’ve only been here for a few minutes. My mind tried to fill in the gaps, to find a logical explanation for where all the time went, but everything was blank. How did I just erase two hours of my life without realising it?“I have to go,” I said.“I’ll walk with you,” Anisa offered.The short path back to the dorms seemed to stretch out for miles. My legs felt heavy and rooted to the ground. What’s wrong with me? I thought. Walking required a conscious effort, and it seemed like another hour had passed before I managed a single, stumbling step. “Sorry,” I said to Anisa. “Just … feeling wobbly.”Then the muscles around my legs started to twitch and then my knees locked up. I couldn’t move. Just take a step. One foot in front of the other. My brain was sending signals into a void. Again and again, no response, no movement. I balled up my fists, dug my nails into my palms, and tried again, more forcefully this time: Keep walking, Malala! When nothing happened, a cold, sharp fear climbed up from my stomach and settled in my shoulders. Then everything went black. As I started to pass out, the truth hit me: I knew this feeling, the terror of being trapped inside my body. This had happened before.Suddenly I was 15 years old again, lying on my back under a white sheet; a tube running down my throat, eyes closed. For seven days, as doctors tended to my wounds, I was in a coma. From the outside, I looked to be in a deep sleep. But, inside, my mind was awake, and it played a slideshow of recent events:My school bus.A man with a gun.Blood everywhere.My body carried through a crowded street. Strangers hunched over me, yelling things I didn’t understand.My father rushing toward the stretcher to take my hand.As the images repeated in the same sequence over and over, I raged against them, trying to beat them away. This isn’t true! I told myself. The real Malala is the one trapped in this nightmare, not the girl on the stretcher. Just wake up and it will stop. Wake up!I had tried to force my eyes open, to see something other than this carousel of horrors. Inside, I screamed; outside, my lips stayed closed, motionless. I was awake and buried alive in the coffin of my body.And now, on a garden path in Oxford, it was happening again: my mind telling my body to move, my body turned to stone. “I can’t walk!” I finally cried out to Anisa. “Please help me!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Strong from years of competitive sports, she lifted me up and carried me back to her dorm. I crumpled to the floor, exhausted and dizzy, struggling to catch my breath.Everything was still for a moment. I felt relieved to be inside, in the comfort of my friend’s room. Then, out of nowhere, the images I had seen in the coma flashed before my eyes again:Bus. Man. Gun. Blood. It was like seeing it all for the first time, fresh waves of panic coursing through my body. There was no escape, no place to hide from my own mind.“I need to go to a hospital,” I gasped.Anisa sat down next to me. “You’re having a bad reaction, but this will be over soon – 30 minutes, an hour at most. If you go to a doctor, they might run tests. It stays in your blood.”Seconds later I felt something caught in my throat, cutting off my air supply. I instantly remembered the pressure of the intubation tube, the sensation of choking every time I tried to swallow or speak. Gathering all my strength, I lunged into Anisa’s bathroom, leaned over the toilet, and vomited.We stayed on the floor for what seemed like hours, until the screaming and shaking had stoppedAfter a few minutes lying on the cold floor, I grabbed the sink and pulled myself up, catching sight of my pale, terrified face in the mirror. What is happening to me?“Did that help?” Anisa asked. “Sit back down and let me get you some water.”I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. It’s over, lean back, just relax. As soon as I closed my eyes, the slideshow began again. The images came faster now, relentlessly attacking me. My mind was freefalling deep inside my body. I opened my eyes and screamed.“Malala, snap out of it!” Anisa yelled, shaking me by the shoulders. She ran down the hall and woke up a friend. They sat on either side of me, bracing my body upright. Anisa gave me a pillow to muffle the screams and wiped the sweat off my face with a damp washcloth.We stayed on the floor for what seemed like hours, until the screaming and shaking had stopped. “Let’s get some sleep,” Anisa said. “You take the bed, I’ll pass out here. In the morning you’ll feel better, OK?”I got in bed, but I didn’t sleep. I could still see a familiar world around me – her books on the desk, polo mallet in the corner, the waning moon shining through the window. If I closed my eyes, it would all be gone for ever. The nightmares would hold me hostage in an endless loop of terror. I drifted off only to jerk myself back to consciousness, jolting my body upright and slapping my own face. Wake up, Malala! If you fall asleep, you will die!I was still awake in the morning when Anisa got up from the floor and stood over me. “I’m so relieved you’re OK now,” she said, tousling my hair. She stepped into the washroom and turned on the shower. I slipped out the door, hoping I wouldn’t run into anyone on the walk to my dorm.Attempting to wrest control of my thoughts made me seasick. I sat at my desk all morning, trying to distract myself – social media, news sites, Candy Crush – but the replay of the previous night, the helplessness I felt collapsed on Anisa’s floor, kept creeping to the front of my mind and overwhelming me. I was nauseated, unable to stand up without feeling dizzy or sit down and be calm without shaking.In the hospital, when I had finally come out of the coma, I had no memory of what had happened. Later I’d seen news footage of myself from the day of the shooting, bandaged and bleeding, carried through the street on a stretcher. In the video, the sun hits my face and my eyelashes flutter. Over the years, I’d seen that clip hundreds of times, but it never felt like part of my life. Those moments were a glitch in my timeline.People always asked me what I remembered of the shooting. “My brain just erased it,” I told them. “One moment I was at school and the next I woke up in Birmingham.” I told myself that same story over and over – but now, I knew it wasn’t true. I had seen it all, and the memories were still lurking in my brain, years later. What had Anisa said?It stays in your blood.It stays in your blood.It stays in your blood.This is an edited extract from Finding My Way by Malala Yousafzai, published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson on 21 October at £25.

The remains of deceased hostages are expected to be sent to the national Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification.An unnamed Hamas official told Al Jazeera that living hostages had been gathered inGazaand the militant group would meet the Red Cross on Sunday night to agree the logistics of their release.There are 48 hostages still in Gaza,20 of whom are believed to be alive.An international taskforce will work on finding the remains of hostages not released on Monday, with many believed to be buried under the rubble somewhere in the devastated Gaza Strip.Israel will also release nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the vast majority of whom will be sent to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, once Israeli hostages are back on Israeli soil.Several Hamas commanders, prominent Palestinian political figures and detained doctors whose releases were requested by Hamas were not on the list of Palestinians to be freed. The doctors Hussam Abu Safiya and Marwan al-Hams, who were detained in Gaza during the war, as well as the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, were not on the list.Hamas said it was still in talks with Israeli negotiators to secure their release.View image in fullscreenMunicipal workers hang a sign near the airport in Sharm el-Sheikh, as the Egyptian Red Sea resort prepares to host a US-brokered international Gaza peace summit.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesThe hostage-detainee swap is the first step in Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire has been in place since Friday afternoon, but most of the details of the US president’s proposals need to be negotiatedbefore a lasting end to the war is established.The US president will visit Jerusalem on Monday to speak at the Knesset, as well as meeting families of the hostages.Trump will then fly to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where he will co-chair a “peace summit” attended by the leaders of more than 20 countries aimed at finalising a permanent truce in Gaza.Donald Trump and Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to chair Gaza peace summit on MondayRead moreAs he boarded Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump said that the “war is over” and “everybody’s cheering”.“There are 500,000 people yesterday and today in Israel and also the Muslim and Arab countries all cheering … That’s never happened before,” he said.Palestinians are desperate to see the ceasefire extend into a permanent end to the war, after two years of an Israeli campaign that destroyed most of the strip, killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel stands accused of conducting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies.View image in fullscreenPalestinian flags flutter on top of rubble in Gaza City.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael denies the claim of genocide and says its conduct in the war, launched in retaliation for an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, constitutes self-defence.In Israel, preparations were under way to receive the hostages, who will be taken to a military base to undergo an examination before being taken to hospitals, which have run drills to prepare for the releases, using actors in place of hostages to practise.“We are very excited, waiting for our son and for all the 48 hostages,” Hagai Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages still held in Gaza, told Reuters.On Sunday night, tens of thousands of people cheered in “Hostages Square” in Tel Aviv as the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, spoke alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.“I dreamed of this night. It’s been a long journey,” Witkoff said. The crowd yelled praise for Trump, but booed when Witkoff mentioned the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Families in the occupied West Bank also prepared to receive loved ones who were being let out of Israeli jails. Israeli authorities instructed families not to be vocal in their celebrations and warned them to limit their interaction with the media.Roughly 2,000 Palestinian detainees are due to be let out around the same time as the hostages are released. About 1,700 were detainees from Gaza, while 250 were longtime prisoners of Israel, among them Palestinian leaders. About half of the 250 are to be released to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, while the other half will be released to the West Bank or East Jerusalem.As preparations continued for the hostage swap, humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza.View image in fullscreenHumanitarian aid trucks enter the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesCogat, the Israeli military agency that oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said it expected about 600 trucks to enter the strip each day, starting on Sunday. This would restore aid to about prewar levels, after months of severely restricted aid into the strip.The UN said about 170,000 metric tonnes of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid was ready to enter Gaza once Israel permits its entry. Tents, high-energy food for malnourished children and menstrual hygiene supplies were among the prioritised aid items.A spokesperson for the World Food Programme, Abeer Etefa, said that roads were being cleared and repaired on Sunday to help facilitate future aid deliveries.The restoration of aid follows months of Israeli siege on Gaza, which resulted in famine in parts of the territory, according to the world’s leading authority on food crises. At least 459 people have died of hunger over the past two years and starvation has spread through the territory since May.The restoration of regular aid is mandated by the Trump plan. The UN will once again coordinate supplies into Gaza after months of being barred by Israel from doing so.1:20Drone footage shows destruction as Gazans reflect on returning back home – videoThe role of the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was meant to replace the UN in aid distribution in Gaza, remained unclear. The foundation’s logistics sites in Gaza had stopped operating after the ceasefire deal started.The GHF was widely seen as a failure, with its model of distribution marked by overcrowding and death. More than 1,000 people were shot to death by Israeli soldiers during the daily scramble to access food at the GHF sites, chaos that aid groups said was brought on the foundation’s militarised model of provision. The GHF consistently denied any wrongdoing.A spokesperson for GHF told Reuters there was a temporary closure of aid sites during the hostage transfers, but that there was “no change to our long-term plan”.The US will deploy up to 200 troops in Israel to help establish a taskforce to assist with stabilisation efforts in Gaza. No US troops will be deployed within Gaza, but will advise the taskforce, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), from within Israel.The head of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper, met the Israeli military chief, Eyal Zamir, while travelling to Gaza alongside Witkoff and Kushner. Cooper said his visit was in service of the establishment of the CMCC.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

For cabinet ministers this equates to just under £17,000.Under the new system, those who serve for fewer than six months will be expected to not take the payment, while those who get a new ministerial job within three months will be asked to not take a salary until the end of that three-month period.With Acoba abolished, Sir Laurie Magnus, Starmer’s independent adviser on ministerial standards, will adjudicate on job appointment rules for ex-ministers. The Civil Service Commission, which regulates recruitment into the civil service, will do this for former civil servants and government special advisers.TheEthicsand Integrity Commission is, however, not an entirely new organisation, but takes on the work of the existing Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), which was tasked with giving the prime minister advice on broader ethical standards.The commission will be headed by the CSPL’s existing chair, Doug Chalmers, a former soldier who ended his military career as deputy chief of defence staff.In a letter to Chalmers marking the new commission, Starmer said one of the organisation’s tasks should be to make sure ministers and civil servants help other public servants meet their responsibilities under the still-to-be-passedHillsborough law, which obliges them to act with honesty and candour and avoid cover-ups.The announcement said: “The prime minister has made clear public service is a privilege and is committed to showing how politics can be a force for good. The government’s manifesto pledge to set the highest standards in public life to restore trust between the public and politics.”Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister of state for the Cabinet Office, said the Ethics and Integrity Commission “will play a central role” in ensuring the government delivers its pre-election promise to uphold the highest standards in public office.It remains to be seen how big an impact will come from a minor reorganisation of the framework for monitoring ethical standards, and the creation of a new, top-level watchdog, the job of which is not to enforce rules but to help make sure others to do so.As well as Magnus’s office and the Civil Service Commission, other ethics-related bodies for public life include the parliamentary standard commissioner, parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Service, the House of Lords Appointments Commission, the Electoral Commission, the UK Parliamentary Standards Authority and the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRegulatorsCivil serviceEthicsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries – although there isfierce debateover its use, with claims that heat pumps powered by electricity are much more efficient.Gary Smith, the general secretary of theGMB union, said: “The success of this trial is a significant moment for our country’s energy future. It highlights the vital role that innovation across our industrial heartlands can play in creating highly skilled unionised jobs in working-class communities, an essential part of any credible plan to meet our net zero obligations.”Centrica and National Gas are urging the government to back the use of hydrogen blends of up to 5% in the UK’s gas system.Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of NationalGas, said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries which caused an increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs, which led to irreversible lung damage and heart failure.Mitchell had her combined transplant at Royal Papworth hospital in September 1987, a procedure so rare that only about five are carried out in the UK each year.“Thanks to organ donation, I was given the gift of a normal life,” she said.“I think about my donor a lot, especially on the anniversary of the transplant. I think about their family and what their family must have felt at the time.“I just know my donor was a young female. Her family made that decision at a terrible time in their lives. I am so grateful.“It’s quite difficult to put into words how it feels to know I am now the longest-lived heart-lung recipient in the UK. It’s mixed feelings.View image in fullscreenKatie Mitchell on a treadmill during her recovery after her transplantPhotograph: NHSBT/PA“People I know who had the same transplant have passed away in front of me, but it’s a blessing and amazing to feel I’ve had all this extra time.“I don’t really know why it has worked so well. Perhaps the immunosuppressants suit me well. Everybody has so many different reactions to the medications, and everyone has their own regimen.”There are currently 8,124 people on the UK transplant waiting list, including 12 waiting for a heart and lung transplant.Mitchell’s transplant is functioning well. She also had two kidney transplants from deceased donors in 1994 and 2015.Mitchell, from Sidcup in south-east London, said: “I went to an event at Papworth and there were a couple of young women who had their heart-lung transplants recently.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even so, some have clearly fared better, and millennials are leading the charge in buy-to-let investment, according to analysis of Companies House data by the estate agent Hamptons.Buy-to-let firms become biggest single type of business in UK, data showsRead moreFor the first time, millennials made up 50% of all new shareholders in buy-to-let companies set up so far this year. Five years ago, they made up 40% of buy-to-let shareholders.So far this year, three-quarters of shareholders in new companies were under 50 – up from 68% a decade ago. While tax rises and tighter regulations have prompted some landlords to sell up, the influx of younger investors has helped sustain landlord purchases.The share of homes bought by a landlord acrossEnglandand Wales remained unchanged from the same time last year, despite an increase in the second home stamp duty surcharge. Landlords now pay a 5% surcharge as of April, up from 3% previously.Across the country, landlords accounted for 11.3% of property purchases in the third quarter, a small uptick from 11.2% a year earlier.Hamptons estimates that millennial landlords will create 33,395 new buy-to-let companies this year – more than twice the number incorporated in 2020.These purchases are increasingly concentrated outside the south of England, previously a property hotspot. Together, London, the south-east, south-west and east of England accounted for 34% of investor purchases across EnglandWalesin the July-to-September quarter. In 2016, these regions accounted for 50% of purchases.Investors are increasingly trying to buy in the north of England, where yields are higher and cheaper properties mean stamp duty costs are lower. More than a quarter (28.4%) of homes sold in the north-east were bought by a landlord, compared with 8% in London.The average rent for a newly let home in Britain fell by 0.3% in the year to September – down £4 a month from £1,402 to £1,398, Hamptons said. This marks a notable shift from the 4.2% annual growth recorded a year earlier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In inner London, rents declined by 4.6%, bringing the average to £2,766 a month, which is £165 below the October 2024 peak.In contrast, rents for renewed contracts continued to rise, outpacing inflation, and increasing by 4.6% over the past 12 months.Buy-to-let businesseshave become thelargest single type of business in the UK this year– with nearly four times the number of fast-food takeaways or hairdressers.The shift reflects that baby boomers, now in their 60s and 70s, are less likely to be setting up new portfolios. Instead, they are more likely to be winding them down or passing them on to the next generation. The number of Gen Z-led companies, with people aged between 13 and 28, overtook new incorporations from baby boomers for the first time this year.Explore more on these topicsBuying to letRenting propertyHousing marketPropertyReal estateEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

He told Epstein to “keep in close touch” and expressed a wish to “play some more soon”.In 2019, Andrew told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that he broke off his friendship with Epstein in December 2010, after the two men were photographed together strolling in New York.But he wrote to Epstein in the message after the photo was published: “I’m just as concerned for you! Don’t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!”He is said to have signed off with: “A, HRH The Duke of York, KG.”Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide.In 2008 he pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, for which he served time in jail.In January this year, a section of the email from the Duke of York emerged in court documents. At the time it was reported to be from a “royal family member”.It related to a claim made by the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK banking regulator, and appeared in court documents for a legal case involving the former Barclays chief executive Jes Staley. Staley was appealing against a finding by the watchdog that he had given a misleading account of the nature of his relationship with Epstein.In a November 2019 interview with Newsnight, Andrew told the journalist Emily Maitlis: “I ceased contact with him [Epstein] after I was aware that he was under investigation and that was later in 2006 and I wasn’t in touch with him again until 2010.”He later said that in December 2010 “I had to show leadership and I had to go and see him and I had to tell him ‘that’s it’.”Buckingham Palace and the Duke of York’s office have been contacted for comment.Also this weekend, it emerged thatTony Blair met Epsteinin Downing Street while he was prime minister after a recommendation by Peter Mandelson, who last month was sackedas US ambassadorafter new information emerged about how close he had been to the convicted child sex offender.Blair’s meeting emerged in papers released at theNational Archivesand predated Epstein’s criminal conviction. Epstein visited Blair on 14 May 2002.Mandelson was then a backbench Labour MP, having resigned from government for asecond time amid controversy. He had described Epstein to Blair’s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, now the UK national security adviser, as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Global heating is now at about 1.4C.Without rapid and unlikely cuts to greenhouse gases, the upper threshold of 1.5C would be hit in the next 10 years, the report says.“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “The first tipping of widespread dieback of warm water coral reefs is already under way.”He said this was already impacting hundreds of millions of people who depend on reefs. The report points to reefs in the Caribbean, where marine heatwaves, low diversity and disease outbreaks have pushed reefs “towards collapse”.View image in fullscreenExperts agree that coral reefs need ‘aggressive’ action on climate change and improved local management.Photograph: Glenn Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, Prof Peter Mumby, a leading coral reef scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, said he accepted reefs were in decline but there was emerging evidence corals could adapt with some reefs remaining viable even at 2C of global heating.He said coral reefs needed “aggressive” action on climate change and improved local management, but he was concerned some would interpret the report as saying coral reef habitats were heading for collapse, which was a position he did not support.He said he was worried society would “give up on coral reefs” if people think they can no longer be saved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game has changed and the response has to be really urgent.”He said there were some coral reefs that were known as refugia – places where climate impacts were not as pronounced – and protecting these places was paramount.“We have to make sure we have the seeds of recovery for a future world where we have managed to stabilise the climate,” he said.Dr Tracy Ainsworth, the vice-president of the InternationalCoralReef Society, said in many places reef ecosystems were changing and were either no longer dominated by corals, or were losing diversity.“The future of coral reefs is one of transformation, ecosystem restructure and new challenges,” she said. “Our challenge now is to understand how all of these different ecosystems are reorganising and how we can ensure they continue to support diverse marine life and communities.”In a statement, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said interpretation of global figures “should be taken with care” for two reasons – they masked significant regional variability and global temperatures had not stabilised “indicating there remains a narrow window of opportunity to act”.Earth entering a ‘danger zone’Lenton said parts of the west Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet were “looking perilously close” to their tipping point, as they were losing ice at an accelerating rate. Loss of ice that is still attached to the land causes sea levels to rise.“We are going to overshoot 1.5C of global warming probably around 2030 on current projections,” Lenton said.“This puts the world in a greater danger zone of escalating risk of further damaging tipping points.”The Amazon – under pressure from the climate crisis and deforestation – was closer than previously thought to reaching a tipping point, he said.The report does offer some hope, saying there are likely “positive tipping points” in society – such as with electric vehicle adoption – that could also have runaway effects to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“The race is on to bring forward these positive tipping points to avoid what we are now sure will be the unmanageable consequences of further tipping points in the Earth system,” Lenton said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCoralGlaciersAmazon rainforestnewsShareReuse this content"

Tory party membership figures are not made public, but recent reports say the total is slightly above 120,000.Such numbers do not necessarily translate into electoral success, with Labour having had a peak of more than 500,000 members under Jeremy Corbyn, who lost two general elections. And while one recent poll put the Greens at 15%, most such surveys have put the party nearer to 11% or 12%, not much changed since Polanski took charge.But the influx of members does point to Polanski’s apparent ability to galvanise attention and enthusiasm for a party that has often struggled to get its message across, with a mass of interviews, social media videos and TV appearances.The Greens’ surge has caused worries among some senior Labour figures, who believe it could take votes and seats from the party in next May’s local elections in England, particularly in some London boroughs.Polanski has repeatedly set out what he sees as the Greens’ ambition to supplant Labour. Ina speech this monthto the party’s annual conference, he said that without action Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK.Responding to the new membership figure, Polanski said: “More than 100,000 people have now joined the Green movement. That’s 100,000 people who believe politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again.“When I was elected leader last month, I said that we’re not here to be disappointed with Labour but that we’re here to replace them. I was serious. Because while Labour talks about change, people can see in their weekly shop, their utility bills and crumbling services, Labour are offering more of the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His father, known for being stubborn, refused. Their argument was never finished – an Israeli airstrike hit his father’s home, burying his parents beneath the rubble.On Sunday, two days after the ceasefire was announced, Khadr returned to search through the ruins of his parents’ home. He spent the day sifting through shattered concrete and twisted metal for any sign of them. All he managed to find were some shards of their skulls and parts of their hands.View image in fullscreenGhali Khadr.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian“My father, a retired ambulance driver, was known for his strong will and patience. He did not know fear and was always optimistic,” said Khadr, 40, of Jabaliya in northernGaza.Khadr took the remains of his parents to the graveyard, but found that it too had been destroyed. He decided to bury them next to the few graves that were still intact.View image in fullscreenThe destruction left by Israel’s offensive on Gaza City.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianLike Khadr, thousands of Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza since Friday’s ceasefire with a grim task ahead of them: searching for loved ones killed weeks or months earlier in Israeli airstrikes and whose bodies are buried under the rubble.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that the bodies of about 10,000 people are trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The halt in the fighting has given the ambulance service the chance to finally start the search for the dead and give their families a chance at closure.The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.View image in fullscreenBodies unearthed by Israeli bulldozers in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianMost roads have been destroyed or blocked by debris. Civil defence workers are short of heavy equipment and have to use pickaxes and sledgehammers to break through collapsed buildings. Rescue crews have to move slowly. The debris is also full of unexploded bombs and ordnance.“At first, we are focusing on collecting the corpses lying in the streets to preserve what remains of them, especially with the presence of stray dogs that have been attacking bodies,” said Khaled al-Ayoubi, 64, the civil defence chief for northern Gaza.Other rescuers are forced to dig through rubble with their bare hands. So far, they have only recovered a fraction of the 10,000 missing people and have yet to begin searching through the ruins of multistorey buildings.View image in fullscreenPeople searching for the remains of their loved ones in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianIf Israel permits the entry of heavy equipment in the coming days, all the bodies should be recovered within six months to a year, said Dr Mohammed al-Mugheer, 38, the director of humanitarian support and international cooperation at the Gaza civil defence agency.Many residents of northern Gaza cannot bear to wait that long. They have begun to return to their ruined homes to search for their loved ones on their own.Yahya al-Muqra, 32, from Jabaliya, believes his brother, Sharif, is dead. He lost contact with him after an Israeli airstrike on their home on 25 July. He managed to visit the razed buildingbut found no sign of Sharif’s body.“We went to check the area, but found no trace of him, as if he had vanished, the house and everything around it had turned to rubble,” Muqra said. “Witnesses said they last saw him near the house.” His brother suffered from epilepsy, and he worries that even if the airstrike did not kill him, he would have died without his medication.On Sunday, Muqra finally had the time to search for his brother, but working by himself he could find no sign of him.View image in fullscreenPalestinians search the rubble in Khan Younis.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images“I was hoping to find something that proves Sharif was there, a piece of clothing, any trace. We really need heavy machinery to search under the rubble, but these machines are unavailable,” he said.For many families, the pain of not knowing where, when or how their loved ones died is immense. They have spent months in exile from their homes, waiting in limbo for the chance to find even a fragment of those they lost, something to say goodbye to.Providing families with that chance is what drives Gaza’s rescue workers, who labour painstakingly under the intense sun while anxious families wait by their side.“Families feel that recovering the bodies of their martyrs is a way to honour them and preserve their souls, and it reassures them that their loved ones truly became martyrs and are no longer alive,” said Fadi al-Salibi, 35, a civil defence employee.Muqra hopes that the coming days will reveal something about his brother’s fate. With the cemeteries in his neighbourhood destroyed, he plans to bury Sharif in the garden of his home.“My heart is broken because my brother has not been buried yet. Even a single bone would allow us to lay him to rest and feel some relief,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

I might say, ‘look, if this war is not going to get settled, I’m going to send them Tomahawks,’” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the Middle East. The US president said Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy had asked for Tomahawks in a call on Saturday when they were discussing a fresh supply of weapons for Kyiv. “Tomahawks are a new step of aggression,” added Trump. “Do they [Russian forces] want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don’t think so.” Trump has been mulling potential supplies of the long-range missiles to Kyiv via European allies ever since his meeting with Putin in Alaska in August failed to produce a peace deal. Putin has previously warned against supplying Kyiv with Tomahawks, saying it would be a major escalation and affect relations between Washington and Moscow. Trump said last week that he has“sort of made a decision”on whether to send Tomahawks to Ukraine, without elaborating.Zelenskyy said “we will see” when asked on Fox News whether Trump had approved the supply of Tomahawks.After his call with the US president, Zelenskyy told the Sunday Briefing: “We work on it … And I’m waiting for president to yes. Of course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.” He said Friday that he was in talks with US officials about the possible provision of various long-range precision-strike weapons, including Tomahawks and more ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles. A senior Ukrainian delegation is set to visit the US this week.Moscow expressed “extreme concern” over the US potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in remarks published on Sunday that “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern”. “Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,” he told Russian state media. Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, also said in comments released on Sunday that he doubted the US would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles. “I think we need to calm down in this regard. Our friend Donald … sometimes he takes a more forceful approach, and then, his tactic is to let go a little and step back. Therefore, we shouldn’t take this literally, as if it’s going to fly tomorrow,” Lukashenko told Russian state media.Russia attacked Ukraine’s power grid, part of a campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said two employees of Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, were wounded in Russian strikes on a substation. Ukraine’s energy ministry said that infrastructure was also targeted in the regions of Donetsk, Odesa and Chernihiv.“Russia continues its aerial terror against our cities and communities, intensifying strikes on our energy infrastructure,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, saying that Russia had launched “more than 3,100 drones, 92 missiles, and around 1,360 glide bombs” over the past week. Ukraine’s energy sector has been a key battleground since Russia launched its fullscale invasion more than three years ago.Zelenskyy called for tighter secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil.“Sanctions, tariffs, and joint actions against the buyers of Russian oil – those who finance this war – must all remain on the table,” he wrote, adding he had a “very productive” phone call with Trump, in which they discussed strengthening Ukraine’s “air defence, resilience, and long-range capabilities,” along with “details related to the energy sector”. Their discussion followed an earlier conversation on Saturday, Zelenskyy said, during which the leaders agreed on Sunday’s topics.A Ukrainian counteroffensive had made gains in southern Zaporizhzhia region as well as in Donetsk region, Zelenskyy said. Donetsk is the focal point of the conflict and where Kyiv has been reporting successes.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussia-Ukraine war at a glanceVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUS militaryexplainersShareReuse this content"

It’s rich, plot-packed, and perfectly seasoned with humourLucy ManganSun 12 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareSally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT. Alongside oestrogen and progesterone tablets, patches, gels and sprays to counter the myriad ills female flesh is heir to, doctors could prescribe a weekly dose ofScott & Baileyfor those who are just beginning to feel that Summat’s Up, moving on toLast Tango in Halifaxfor the lightly but definitely perimenopausal, followed by a daily hour ofGentleman Jackto alleviate more intense symptoms and culminating in a nightly binge ofHappy Valleyonce you’re fully entangled in menopause’s proliferating tentacles and need to bring out the big guns before they drag you under for good.Now we have an addition to the arsenal: her new drama Riot Women, about a quintet of menopausees facing the question of when all this shite is going to stop and how they are going to manage until it does.First, we meet Beth (Joanna Scanlan), who has decided that the only answer to this question is to take her own life. A note is written to her beloved but thoughtless son, Tom (Jonny Green), and propped on the piano and she is getting prepared – when the phone rings. It’s her brother, Martin, selfish to the point of viciousness, calling to berate her for putting their mother in a home that will eat up the inheritance he was looking forward to instead of continuing to care for her by herself. Beth roars back at him, but not cathartically enough to turn her from her chosen path. She only stops trying to see her plan through when her friend Jess (Lorraine Ashbourne) rings. “D’you want to be in a rock band?”And we’re off. The call has gone out to their friend Holly (Tamsin Greig) too. She has just ended 30 years in the police force by arresting a drunk and disorderly woman – further disoriented by a hot flush – in a supermarket and giving her a bed for the night as she has no home to go to. The next morning, Holly recognises the magnificently obstreperous felon as Kitty (Rosalie Craig), daughter of local gangster Keith. She will be even less delighted in episode two when Beth discovers Kitty doing karaoke in a bar and brings her along to the first band rehearsal as their new and soon indispensable singer. Though Holly has also invited her joyless sister, Yvonne (Amelia Bullmore), to play guitar so they are roughly equal on the potentially bad decision-makinge.Add in a thick sprinkling of unrewarding children, parents at various stages of dementia, weak men, bad men, bosses who cannot or will not address the suffering of employees whose problems run deeper than hurt feelings, mounting physical problems in the face of medical indifference, a baby given up for adoption in the 90s and now looking for his birth mother and you have a rich and moreish stew that is offered up in generous portions. And it is, of course, in Wainwright’s customary manner, perfectly seasoned with humour, from the lightest (“Rocco was a tree in assembly. Before and after an explosion. It was heartbreaking”) to the darkest. Kitty was expelled from the posh school she was sent away to at 13 after her mother died and her father couldn’t stand the sight of her. “It was an education in all sorts of way. Apart from … education.”Like all Wainwright’s best work (and work by the likes ofDebbie HorsfieldandKay Mellorbefore her), Riot Women covers a lot of ground without getting bogged down or leaving the viewer feeling shortchanged. As the band fights to get into a fit state to play at the local fundraiser in six weeks’ time, Beth learns to stand her ground and fight against the invisibility that did so much to make her miserable. She bonds with Kitty partly through admiration of her talent and their shared interest in writing original material for the Riot Women (“Old Bags’ Department” was considered as a band name but ultimately vetoed) but also because she needs to mother, and Kitty, whatever she thinks, needs mothering.It is a drama that, like Happy Valley, looks at the multitudinous roles women manage, the caring responsibilities that accumulate and how they evolve over a lifetime. Children leave home but never stop taking. Mothers become children and take some more. What do you do if you are caught between the two, alone, and no one is around to give you anything? You turn to your equally depleted friends, dig deeper and give what you can to each other. You become a self-supporting circle, which itself becomes a link in the chain that can keep an entire society going. There will be merry hell to pay when that breaks, of course, but TV with this sort of pedigree and cast will buy us a little more time.Riot Women aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSally WainwrightTamsin GreigreviewsShareReuse this content"

Seamlessly revived by Rachael Hewer, it not only looks good, it does full justice to Puccini’s classic weepy while finding novel ways to raise the odd goosebump.Dieuweke van Reij’s set – a metaphorical highway to heaven – serves for all four acts with more than a nod to Brassaï’s noirishphotos of 1930s Paris. Bare walls and glistening cobblestones are breathtakingly lit by Alex Brok, while Jon Morrell’s monochrome costumes ooze couture. Visser’s bohemians inhabit a kind of twilight zone, a world of fogs, gendarmes and prostitutes, where the spectre of Death stalks the streets with the consumptive Mimì firmly in his sights.Whenever Aida Pascu’s spook-haunted seamstress appears, he’s there, a pallid man in black, sitting and staring. Rodolfo senses him, perhaps, but Mimì increasingly sees and fears him. It’s a chillingly effective conceit, played with consummate stillness by Christopher Lemmings. He pops up again as the toy-maker Parpignol, this time grasping an ominous bunch of blood-red balloons. When the lovers declare they will not part until the flowers return in springtime, he draws back a tarpaulin to reveal them already in bloom. Mimì’s final, agonsed cry of “Come here, my love” is delivered not to Rodolfo but to Death himself.Visser paints precise and visually alluring stage pictures. His endearing students engage in spirited horseplay that for once is tightly crafted and easy to follow. The street scene crackles with energy; Café Momus does a fine line in comedy waiters; crooked policemen turn more than a blind eye to the activities of the local sex workers.View image in fullscreenCrackling with energy … La Bohème.Photograph: Marc Brenner/Glyndebourne Productions LtdIn the pit, musical standards are high. Adam Hickox, son of the late Richard Hickox, has clearly inherited the conducting gene, delivering an incisive account of Puccini’s score that’s crisply alert. A palpable, well-judged elasticity heightens the emotional stakes without ever becoming syrupy. The Glyndebourne Sinfonia responds enthusiastically, as do the lively Glyndebourne Chorus and the fresh voices of Glyndebourne YouthOpera.Pascu’s abject Mimì is a tender creation, pale, agitated and desperately fragile. Her soprano has just the right degree of mid-register creaminess, although top notes could use a little more body. Andrés Agudelo’s Rodolfo doesn’t always spark. His voice blossoms and fades, sometimes within the same phrase, and he’s inclined to resort to stock operatic gestures.Aksel Daveyan’s vocal swagger brightens his otherwise taciturn Marcello, making him an excellent foil for Camilla Harris’s assured, feisty and ever-so chic Musetta. Markus Suihkonen shines as Colline, his performance culminating in a moving Coat Aria, with Darwin Prakash a firm-toned, puckish Schaunard and Darren Jeffery turning in delicious cameos as Benoît and Alcindoro.At Glyndebourne, Sussex,until 2 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGlyndebourneOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events.View image in fullscreenA Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in Oakland, California, on 23 September.Photograph: Denise HerediaThe talks come as the global movement againstSpotifyedges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background.Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNTpulledtheir music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.)View image in fullscreenMood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly.Photograph: HodderIn Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired.Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift,boycottedthe service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playingWill Anderson of Hotline TNTNeil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.View image in fullscreenManasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.Photograph: Eva TuffOthers such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too. Her album Year of the Slug came out only on vinyl and Bandcamp, inspired by Cindy Lee’s Diamond Jubilee, which was initially available only on YouTube and the filesharing site Mega. “I find it pretty lame that we put our heart and soul into something and then just put it online for free,” Rose says.Khruangbin, again? I quit Spotify for a month to escape samey algorithms – this is what I learnedRead moreRose is a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), an advocacy group formed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect music workers. Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”.“What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashida Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists.The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”This article was amended on 12 October 2025. The Bathers library event was in Oakland, not San Francisco.Explore more on these topicsSpotifyDigital music and audioMusic streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But these are also the brightest of times,”María Corina Machadotold supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night.Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebratewinning the Nobel peace prizefor her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro.“We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,”Machado declaredafter hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.”For all Machado’s relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday’s surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado’s tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat’s feared security forces?International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.Carlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela’s collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community…asthe one credible opposition leader” in the South American country.“A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year’s rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck.Others are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it.“But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict.Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded.Krebs citedLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese poet and activist whoreceived the prizein 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an“anti-China farce”. Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping.In 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for herstruggle for democracy and human rights. Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said.Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”Allies hope Machado’s prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change.Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro’s mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela’s authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign.Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year’s election from Machado’s ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change.Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There’s never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said.But the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump’s pressure campaign would “break” Maduro’s regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it’s a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials.“This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don’t want forever wars. They don’t want Vietnam. They don’t want Iraq,” Izarra said.Perhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubbornMargaret Thatcher-admiring conservativeknown as Venezuela’s “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn.“She’s a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaMaría Corina MachadoNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She became a mainstream name playing Gwen Cooper in Torchwood, the BBC’sDoctor Whospin-off, from 2006 to 2011, and later won acclaim for her lead performance as Faith Howells in the thriller Keeping Faith/Un Bore Mercher. She lives in Cardiff with her husband, the actor Bradley Freegard, and their three daughters. She stars in ITV’s drama series The Hack this autumn.This photo, taken at my third birthdayparty, reveals that I was brought up on pork-based foods. For this special occasion, it was sausage rolls and chipolatas on sticks – very posh, and the marker of any good celebration. My mother had obviously gone to town on that icing to hide the atrocity of the sponge cake that was buried under there. I would have been high as a kite after taking one bite.At this age I was an extrovert, a storyteller and a thief. My parents had to employ a slew of babysitters, because every time one would come over, something would go missing from her bag and she wouldn’t want to come back. It was always the same thing: lipstick. I was obsessed with it, even though I couldn’t even say the word. I’d say “triple click” instead.My mother would always find it stashed underneath my bed or stuffed inside a pillowcase. I’d pretend that I had no idea what it was, even though I’d have come downstairs, having also stolen eyeshadow and blusher from Mum, and appeared nonchalantly in front of my family fully done up, looking like a clown. Mum would subtly say: “Have you put a little bit of makeup on, Eve?” I would reply: “No, no, nothing at all.”This went on for a while. Mum would often get a phone call from the teachers at school, saying: “Eve’s gone to use the toilet and come back looking like she’s ready for a night out in Swansea.” Everyone allowed it, so eventually I must have got bored and the fixation did die down. For a long time, I just couldn’t resist the kind of transformation and creativity that makeup gave me. Maybe I was partly inspired by Mum – she was a glamorous woman, and I wanted to be like her. Mainly, I just liked wearing a mask, which is what I now do for a living. It must have been my destiny screaming out.My parents separated about six monthsafter this was taken, and I was brought up by my mum predominantly. I grew up in a miners’ village, in a community where the door is always open. The entire town looked after each other. It was a luscious place to live – not in a monied, extravagant way, but full of decent, kind people. There was nothing there, just a lovely river, so I found escapism in culture. I remember going to see Starlight Express in London when I was a kid – it was my first experience in the theatre and I felt as if someone had turned on a switch and set me alight. There was this heat from inside out. Mike’s Video Store also fuelled the fire. Mum would get a video out every Friday, and she and I would watch it twice the first night and twice on Saturday. I would watch it twice again on my own on Sunday. I was captivated by the arts and always felt this yearning to see the world outside my village.The three-year-old me is always tapping me on the shoulder, going: 'Isn’t this great? Aren’t you lucky?'I had an amazing teacher at school, an actor called Hazel Williams. One day she said: “Fancy auditioning for the Welsh youth theatre?” I thought it was in a pub, but after some research realised the magnitude of what was on offer. Acting hadn’t been top of the agenda because it seemed so out of reach. I dabbled with wanting to be a speech therapist for a long time, or to go into the police or midwifery. But after a while, the enormity of the dream ended up being frightening – the fear of failing was too much to admit. Luckily, as well as Hazel, Dave Bond from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama reassured me that, no matter where I came from, I belonged. They both impressed on me the message: “This industry is for anybody. If you work hard, you can stay in it, but you’ve got to respect it.” So that’s what I did because, really, acting was my first love.I’ve never been a fan of the auditionprocess. If they reworded it to “a workshop” it might feel less intimidating. But, fortunately, I was able to bypass my nerves and I started working as an actor in my second year. It was a blessing in a way, because me and Mum had already talked about our financial situation and we realised that we couldn’t afford to keep me living the student life for the whole of the three years at university. Having an income was brilliant – it meant I was out of my overdraft, I wasn’t constantly owing rent, and I could buy books. An opportunity at the Royal Shakespeare Company arrived, then everything changed when I met Russell T Davies. He gave me the role of Gwyneth inDoctor Whoand then wrote Gwen Cooper for me in Torchwood. It was as if my whole world opened up.I had a good start in my career, but I wish I’d known that whatever I thought my imperfections were, I should celebrate them rather than try to change them. I wasn’t the typical telly leading lady and I got told that early on in my career after auditions. But now I realise all of my idiosyncrasies are exactly what makes me different and authentic. I worry there’s a struggle in this industry for perfection. All the way through my 20s, I was frightened of getting things wrong and had so many comments from people in the industry that would affect me, a lot of it focused on looks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m not a fan of confrontation and am far more gentle than the characters I tend to play. Often they take a while to shed, like Fran in[BBC drama] The Guest. She’s seven different people in one scene – powerful, scary, cutting, childlike, adolescent, vulnerable, then back into an assassin. At the end of a day of filming, I would come to the kitchen island and stare into space until Brad put a big fat glass of red wine in front of me and told me to cut it out and have a bath.Runninghelps me to decompressfrom the intensity of a character; plus, there’s nothing like having a 15-, 11- and three-year-old at home to pull you back into the present. From the outside, I’m often trying to appear in control, but I’m kicking like hell under the surface.Despite the juggle of family and work, I will never not be ecstatically happy with my lot. That’s because the three-year-old me is always tapping me on the shoulder, going: “Isn’t this great? Aren’t you lucky? Don’t take it for granted and try to enjoy every second of it.” I work with people who inspire me, and I’ll never not be profoundly grateful that I get to put a mask on every day. Thankfully, now it’s considered a career, not a crime.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyDoctor WhoTorchwoodTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Macron and his counterparts need to find a different answer fastSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 10.31 EDTShareEmmanuel Macron sounded like a man in grief. Not angry, not defiant, just a littletriste. Europe, he lamented, was suffering a “degeneration of democracy”. Many threats emanated from outside, from Russia, from China, from powerful US tech companies and social-media entrepreneurs, France’s president said. “But we should not be naive. On the inside we are turning on ourselves. We doubt our own democracy … We see everywhere that something is happening to our democratic fabric. Democratic debate is turning into a debate of hatred.”Squeezed between vituperative extremes of right and left, Macron knows of what he speaks. But “ungovernable” France is not alone in its bitter,intractable divisions. Across Europe, in the UK and the US, distrust and grievance daily deepen political dysfunction and social discord. Macron’s words apply, in fact, to almost any country espousing democratic principles. Belief that democracy is the form of governance best suited to the modern world is dwindling, especiallyamong younger people. Meanwhile, the public space grows coarser and more violent. Macron was speaking at an event marking the 35th anniversary of Germany’s 1990 reunification, a moment of great optimism. Yet, like France, today’spolarised Germanyfaces an acute crisis of political faith.Just look around. In elections last weekend, theCzech Republicfollowed Poland, Austria and other EU states in lurching towards the populist hard right, swept along on a rising tide of anti-establishment negativity. Support for opportunistic bigots who feed on fear, resentment and loss – while lacking credible policies on complex issues such as migration – is not an endorsement of democracy but its despoliation. This ugly rush to extremes is a vote of no confidence in thedemocratic systemitself, exacerbated by reduced levels of participation and turnout among disadvantaged social groups.In all these countries, a national democratic consensus is woefully lacking. In declining, despairing Britain, wherenational flagsare worn like comfort blankets, both leading mainstream parties are flailing; yet the alternatives are implausible or downright pernicious. In the US, the “home of democracy”, effective opposition to Republican one-party rule has all but collapsed, at least at national level. Striving togerrymander congressional districts, Donald Trumpincreasingly resemblesa dictator.Lack of genuine democratic choice and economic opportunity, fuelling alienation and revolt, beset countries as diverse asMorocco,KenyaandBangladesh, all of which have witnessed recent upheavals. In the Philippines, Nigeria, Turkey,Indonesiaand Madagascar, corruption and abuse of power have triggered anti-government protests. InNepallast month, young people powered a “gen-Z revolution”. All these countries, in Europe and beyond, are different – except in one vital respect. Compared with authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia, their societies remain relatively open and free, for now.This is the fundamental challenge each faces: democracy isn’t working, or it is working so badly it risks being jettisoned. The once exemplary US – a paradigm lost – and fractious western Europe are faltering. And once again, less established democracies in the global south, and in central and eastern Europe, are frontline states in a reviving cold war of influence and values fought against the Beijing-Moscow axis. LikeMoldovaandGeorgia, to name two recent battlegrounds, they could go either way.A crunch is coming. In its annual report, Freedom House, the US-based rights watchdog, found that violence, poll manipulation and repression marredmore than 40%of national elections held in 2024. Global freedom, assessed in terms of political liberties and civil rights, declined for a 19th consecutive year. “Conflicts spread instability and thwarted democratic progress around the world,” the report concluded.In the US, arecent surveyfound a record 64% of Americans believe their democracy “is too politically divided to solve the nation’s problems”. In the UK, a poll of people aged 16-29 found 63% thinkdemocracy is in trouble. While young people “preferred to live in a democracy over a dictatorship by 57% to 27%”, only 35% said they would consider getting involved in organised politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Short- and long-term economic issues – the cost of living, inflation, lack of good jobs, de-industrialisation, shattered communities, institutional failures, wealth inequality, globalisation, mass migration linked to the climate crisis, the busted myth of infinitely sustainable growth – are all factors. Untrustworthy leaders, reflecting falling moral standards, is another. Insidious election meddling and online fakery by Russia and others hasten breakdown. Younger generations are pitted against ageing populations. And there is hopelessness, as well as anger, about the mess the world is in, environmentally and geopolitically.For Andreas Reckwitz of Humboldt University of Berlin, all this discontent is rooted in an overall, profound and ubiquitous sense of loss. “Western modernity’s foundational lie” – the post-Enlightenment belief that human progress is constant and inevitable, that everything gets better over time, that life improves – has been brutally exploded by the experience of recent decades,Reckwitz argues. “Loss has become a pervasive condition of life … The question is no longer whether loss can be avoided but whether societies bound to ‘better’ or ‘more’ can learn to endure ‘less’ and ‘worse’.”Seen this way, rejection of failing democratic structures and the advance of demagogic throwbacks pledging a return to “the way things were” are more easily understood. “If politics continues to promise endless improvement, it will fuel disillusionment and strengthen populisms that thrive on betrayed expectations,” Reckwitz writes. “Populism channels anger over what has disappeared but provides only illusions of recovery. The crucial question then becomes: how to deal with loss?”Reckwitz has his own suggestions, involving resilience and redistribution. If anyone has a definitive answer, Macron, with much to lose, would surely love to hear it.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionEmmanuel MacroncommentShareReuse this content"

It turns out I was right to be afraidCarys AfokoI eventually signed up in the hope that buying and selling secondhand clothes would help me fight fast fashion. It just made me cheapSun 12 Oct 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 14.28 EDTShareIdownloaded Vinted for the first time this year. I’m incredibly late to the party, since the app has more than 16 million UK users and launched here in 2014. My not-so-conscientious objection was rooted in a hatred of secondhand clothes. My inner (teenaged) self said I’d worked my way to being able to afford nice (ie new) things, and I didn’t want my wardrobe to look like I’d raided a jumble sale. Shopping secondhand would make me feel poor again.Two things changed. Every other time I asked a well-dressed friend where her jumper, bag or trainers were from, she would say Vinted. Then, as I emptied my wardrobe from the storage unit it had been living in for a year, I was greeted by my secret shame: two unworn shirts from a cult (ie expensive) brand that I bought years ago and missed the window to return.I got the app, snapped a few pics of the shirts and wrote what I considered to be an enticing sales pitch. I sold my first shirt on the same day and received a five-star review from my buyer. I was an ethical entrepreneur! I was saving the planet! I was spreading joy and getting paid! Riding a dopamine high of “free” money, I listed more clothes and waited for the cash to roll in.To my utter dismay, my extremely fashionable, hardly worn clothes were no longer flying off the shelf. A friend explained I had probably priced the shirts too cheaply and my other clothes too high. The app’s pricing algorithm agreed. Still, it felt like a personal rejection, like the internet was saying I had bad taste.It’s not just selling that gives you a dopamine hit. The app can generate endless pings and updates to keep you engaged. I have notifications turned off on my phone, but I got 21 emails from Vinted the first week I started using it. You get told when someone “likes” an item you’ve listed (a way of saving something they might buy later). Meanwhile, as a buyer, if you like an item, the seller often slides into your inbox offering it at a discounted price. I found this very stressful at first, like the digital equivalent of making eye contact with a slightly desperate salesperson.Fast fashion rightly gets a bad rap but Vinted’s platform was built using the same digital tricks that keep us scrolling on Instagram or TikTok. There’s an algorithm that predicts what you want, gamification and variable rewards that keep you hooked. Six months in, it’s easily one of the most used apps on my phone.My smug sense that I was participating in the circular economy was undermined when I told a climate-conscious friend how cheap secondhand books are on Vinted (I don’t understand how anyone is making money selling them). She pointed out there’s a pretty big environmental cost to shipping books around the country, and that perhaps my local library was a more sustainable option. And that’s before you factor in thepay and conditionsfor delivery drivers at most of the big delivery companies.Not only have I lost hours scrolling, Vinted has also made me petty. As I switched from selling to buying, I learned how small-scale haggling is built into the platform. Vinted automatically calculates a 5% or 10% discount on something you like so you can offer less than it’s listed for. I spent an entire month “negotiating” the price down on a summer dress. In the end we were haggling over less than a pound and when it arrived I got three wears out of it before it became too cold. I punched the air when I got £2 off a slightly worn winter coat. It turned up with a tear in the lining that wasn’t in the listing. I felt simultaneously outraged and delighted – surely I could squeeze some more money off from the seller? She called my bluff and suggested I post it back so she could sell it to someone else. Pay for postage twice? Over my dead body.Vinted has saved me money and brought me joy. But I’ve definitely spent more than I earned from those shirts. It’s probably time to take a break, but if you’re interested in a hot pink wool coat from Cos (good condition) I’m still open to offers.Carys Afoko is a communications strategist, writer and host of the Over the Top, Under the Radar podcastExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinionVintage fashionAppscommentShareReuse this content"

But sharing their tantrums and pain on social media is not a ‘teachable moment’. It’s cruelSun 12 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThere’s a song that’s been in my head all week, and no, it’s not from Taylor Swift’s new album. It’s by a far more sophisticated songwriter than Swift:Ms Rachel. The song is called Big Feelings and it goes: “Big feelings are OK / I’m here to stay with your big feelings.”Thanks to the trend for gentle parenting, the concept of “big feelings” has become big money online, and for the most part I welcome that (Big Feelings isn’t the only song that reflects this cultural shift; the animation Small Potatoes on CBeebies has a song that goes “Feelings / I’ve got so many feelings”, which my husband likes to sing to me when I’m premenstrual). As a parent, strong emotions are hard to escape: you’re feeling them, the small child in your home is feeling them and, in one of the biggest departures for us as a species, so are myriad other children on your social media feed.Indeed, footage of babies and children crying is so commonplace on some platforms that many parents don’t even question it. I don’t have TikTok and my Instagram algorithm is mostly fixated on soup and witchcraft, but when a colleague told me that she found the trend disturbing, not to mention morally dubious, I watched some of the videos myself.What I found was video after video of children at their most vulnerable. Crying, shouting, screaming, and sometimes lashing out physically. I have of course been witness to these moments in my own house, but seeing someone else’s child going through it feels excruciatingly uncomfortable, especially when that child is not being comforted by their own parent. Least forgivable is a genre of video in which mothers subject their children to sinus clearing while their baby or toddler cries and screams directly to camera. It should be said that most of the videos are not like that, and yet there is still something horrible about them all.Of course, “big feelings” aren’t always wholly traumatic. When your child is lying on the pavement distraught at the realisation that cake isn’t infinite it can be hard to keep a straight face. Many of us have been regaled with tales of particularly iconic tantrums of our own. Mine involved screaming “GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY!” in the lobby of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in central London. Playfully teasing your child about a time they had a meltdown, or laughing about it with your partner once they have gone to bed, is one thing. Filming a child in a moment of vulnerability and uploading it to the internet for all to see without their consent is a different matter altogether.Then you have the trends that are simply unpleasant, such as one that involved shocking babies out of crying bythrowing a slice of cheeseat their foreheads, orcracking an eggon them. Such content seems geared towards humiliating children. In a piece for the New York Times,Amanda Hess wrote: “The eeriest part of these videos [is that] the parents are barely interacting with their kids. Instead they are relating to a mirror image of their children that they are spreading online. And they are revelling in their power over that image.”There are video creators who would abhor this sort of content. They claim that they are filming their children at their most vulnerable not to mock them, but because they are trying to create teachable moments – “just look at how calmly and wonderfully I was able to defuse this child’s outburst using these techniques”. Some even try to stave off inevitable criticism. “This video is shared to educate and raise awareness – not for approval or opinions”, one video,posted by @babybearhealth(run by a paediatrician, apparently) reads. The message that follows is some of the most self-congratulatory horseshit I have read on the internet. “If you don’t live the life, don’t judge the moment.”How about you don’t post the moment? I find myself thinking. Because I do judge these people. What I see, when I watch a video of a small child in distress, whether their parent is performing comfort or not, is a dereliction of duty – the duty to be present for your child. And I wonder what message it sends, if when your child starts expressing a “big feeling”, you get your phone out. What does that say to your baby about their wholly natural emotions? “Sharing real moments is part of the learning”, apparently.As my husband and I begin touring schools for our son, it’s difficult not to reflect on how approaches to child development have changed since we were small. There is an increased understanding of the fact that “big feelings” are par for the course for small children. These days many adults try to validate those emotions and offer children a safe space in which to express themselves. Yet despite what the gentle parenting influencers claim, I don’t believe you can truly provide a safe space for your child if you are filming their moments of vulnerability and invading their privacy and dignity in the process. If I’m honest, I don’t think these people have much to teach any of us about parenting.There are some who will find that extreme, who would balk at the fact that in some ways I’d rather put a cheese slice on my boy’s forehead for a laugh than exploit his distress as a teachable moment for clicks. But to them I would say this: if, as the parental truism goes, “all behaviour is communication”, what, exactly, are these adults trying to say?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there are worrying signs the test may come.”As the new row withChinashows, Trump is continuing to wield tariffs as a weapon, creating fresh shocks in financial markets. The impact has been especially tough in developing countries, some of which, as Unctad pointed out, have faced some of the highest tariffs.Away from trade policy, the White House continues to pursue unfunded tax cuts and trash the economic institutions usually considered the cornerstones of credibility – including the Federal Reserve.Over time, that must surely undermine market confidence, including in US Treasuries (government bonds) – an important benchmark against which assets in global markets are valued. There is little sign of that yet; but once lost, economic credibility is hard to rebuild.Part of the reason markets have not responded more skittishly to this and other concerns is that the economic picture is being flattered by another extraordinary and unpredictable phenomenon: the AI boom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A wall of funding continues to pour into the tech industry as investors bet on the future of generative AIand battle to build the massive datacentres required to train and run the models.Data from the World Trade Organization last week showed that a full 20% of the growth in global goods trade in the first half of the year was accounted for by “AI-related goods – including semiconductors, servers, and telecommunications equipment”, much of it flowing from Asia to the US.As Ben May of Oxford Economics said recently: “The surge in US capital spending to develop AI capability has been masking weakness in other parts of the domestic economy.”However, a growing number of observers have begun to fret that generative AI may not deliver the extraordinary gains that would justify Wall Street valuations of the tech companies.Andthe increasingly complex web of cross-shareholdings between some of the key firms involved has raised eyebrows.The Bank of England last week became the latest body towarn about the risk of a “sudden correction”in global markets if the AI boom goes into reverse.“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” it said.Georgieva echoed that caution, comparing the AI boom to the dotcom bubble around the turn of the millennium. “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” she warned, raising the spectre of a “sharp correction”.The dollar and dollar-denominated assets remain the lifeblood of much of global finance, despite efforts since the financial crisis to build up the importance of other currencies – so an AI crash would reverberate worldwide.Perhaps it is fitting that Trump has unleashed a new round of destabilising threats just as policymakers fly into town to take the temperature of the world economy. It certainly drove home Georgieva’s central message to them: “Buckle up.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyEconomics viewpointInternational tradeKristalina GeorgievaInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)World BankEconomicsArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

Anotherreport from Gartnerfound that more than half of consumers don’t trust AI searches, with most reporting “significant” mistakes.AMcKinsey studyfound that 80% of companies using generative AI have seen “no significant bottom-line impact”, with 42% of them literally abandoning their AI projects. AnMIT studyfound that 95% of the AI pilot projects at the big companies they surveyed “failed”.And now there’s workslop!A new study published in theHarvard Business Reviewsays that more than 40% of US-based full-time employees reported receiving AI-generated content that “masquerades as good work but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task”. This “workslop” is “destroying productivity”, according to the study’s researchers.Who is really to blame for workslop? Sure, blame big tech companies for yet again releasing untested and unproven products before they’re ready for prime time. Or the media and tech community who, for the past three years, have been writing pieces likeYahoo Japan wants all its 11,000 employees to use Gen AI to double their productivity by 2028orAI will replace doctors, teachers, and make humans “unnecessary for most things”. All of this creates a lot of unnecessary hype and unfounded expectations.But in the workplace, the buck always stops with the boss. The responsibility for AI’s “workslop” lies fully at the feet of the employer.For more than 20 years, my company has implemented customer relationship and financial management applications at hundreds of small and mid-sized businesses across the country. We’ve worked with thousands of employees. We’ve had good projects and straight-out failures. As a technology consultant, we’ve made our share of mistakes. But the most common root cause of technology disappointments, failures and letdowns can always be found with the people who are buying and implementing the product.So before throwing shade at software companies rolling out AI, I think it’s fair to ask employers a few questions.For example, did you invest in training for your employees? Do your employees truly understand how to create the right prompts in order to get the best answers? Has your company standardized on an AI assistant or is it just a free-for-all mess of apps?Do you have an AI policy that formalizes what AI can and cannot be used for and who can and cannot use it? Do you have a designated person in your company who is responsible for your AI-based applications? Has this person been trained and provided technical support to do this job? Are you working with a competent partner, consultant or developer to provide these kinds of services?Most importantly, do you actually have a plan for using this technology effectively or are you just leaving it up to your employees to figure it all out? Do you have specific metrics for measuring AI’s effectiveness, or are you just relying on vague assumptions of “productivity”?Unfortunately, many employers are duped by big tech into thinking that they just press a button and their software starts doing magical things that spew out money for their business. But, in order not to scare people away, these same tech companies don’t warn their customers of all the other things that need to happen – and money that needs to be spent – in order to maximize the use of their product. In most cases, the software is not the problem. It’s the lack of investment in the people using it.AI can be a powerful tool if deployed the right way and with the right expectations. But in the end it’s just that: a tool. And new tools require thought, training, processes and investment. In the end, AI doesn’t produce “workslop”. Employers do.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

It’s these subtle interior design lies that keep a relationship goingSun 12 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 03.10 EDTShareGame recognises game. A new, recently engaged friend of mine let slip this week that he has someLord of the Ringsmemorabilia in the flat he shares with his fiancee, including a huge map of Middle-earth that is currently not on the wall, because they’re “looking for the right frame.” Well played, that fiancee. Chef’s kiss.This couple are in their extremely early 30s, so hats off to her even more, for already being so skilled at an essential long-term relationship manoeuvre that not only has she pulled it off perfectly, BUT her future husband is blissfully unaware it’s even happened. The right frame for that map is, clearly, a bin. However, she can’t come right out and tell him that, as there is a delicate language involved in negotiating the interior design … let’s call them “compromises” you are required to make when sharing a home with your significant other.When I met my husband, in pride of place in his bachelor pad living room was the only “proper” piece of art he has ever bought. It’s a painting of an apparently iconic football moment between a couple of men called Bobby Moore andPelé, who are embracing, topless. It appears homoerotic but supposedly isn’t. The background is a colour that must surely be called Wince Turquoise, because it’s so bright and lurid that your eyes narrow and your teeth bare involuntarily when you see it. We have been looking for the right frame for this great work for nearly two decades now.It’s endearing how long my sweet, trusting husband took to grow suspicious and question whether there was perhaps a chance I didn’t like the picture as much as he did. When we first moved in together, we watched When Harry Met Sally, but, luckily for me, the scene where the titular pair’s respective best friends Jess and Marie debate the wagon wheel coffee table went right over his head. Even the life-imitating-art bit where Jess asks what’s so awful about it, and Marie replies: “It’s so awful there’s no way to even begin to explain what’s so awful about it.”She’s upfront with her opinion, which is one way to go, but it could be dangerous. You are ostensibly accusing your other half of having bad taste, ie insulting them, and they may well react by digging their heels in, and bringing their awful furnishings along for the ride. A far more subtle strategy – not for the impatient – is stealth redecoration. (Disclaimer: no responsibility accepted for any partners who read this column, pause, have a think, then say, “Hang on a minute, whatever happened to my *insert questionable item here*?” or any disputes that may arise as a result of this inadvertent memory jog.)Surreptitious Changing Rooms (commission it! Millions would watch!) is playing the long game. You can’t get carried away, or become overconfident – any sudden moves and the whole jig will be up. True professionals will transfer things from room to room before getting rid of them altogether, in the manner of that magic trick where there’s a ball under one of three cups but it’s swapped round so often people end up losing track.You don’t have to feel bad about doing any of this, because all you’re guilty of is helping. Educating. At absolute worst, being cruel to be kind. It’s bordering on philanthropic to relieve somebody of what does not serve them, even if they haven’t realised that yet.There are of course exceptions here – the closest we will probably ever experience to genuine saints: those who accept aesthetically upsetting objects as part of the person they love.My friend has a fluffy orange rug in her living room, like a Muppet died on the floor and they just left it there. She is a better person than I could ever be, although it must be noted that she greets first time visitors by saying, “That’s not my rug” even before she’s said “Hello”.Maybe she’s being smart. Could it be that she has acquiesced on the rug in order to gain the upper hand in all other discussions? There’s so much about co-habiting that necessitates meeting halfway, when you’ve already made an ultimate sacrifice that’s constantly in your mutual eyeline, it might mean you enjoy free rein everywhere else.Should I follow suit, free Bobby Moore and Pelé from their dusty cupboard prison, and allow them to fulfil their destiny? Think of the money we’d save on electricity, that radioactive background would light up the whole house.

Voters want homes built, but not at any costSun 12 Oct 2025 12.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,tolda conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them.No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewagepollution. But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums.The scheme was given thego-aheada day beforedroughtwas declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Trussrailedagainst an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle.But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “nimby” or “yimby”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public,62% prioritised nature protection while 18%sided with building at any cost.The Treasuryreportedlyplans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle,slashingspecies protections and curbinglegalchallenges. The bill, currently in theLords, already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers coulddisapplyenvironmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years.Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of theDasgupta review. This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated bydismissing concernsaround conservation. TheWildlife Trustspoints out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages,hoardedland and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier.Many of Labour’syounger votersare alreadytemptedby the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t theplanning system. It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build1.5m homes, it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.Explore more on these topicsConservationOpinionHousingPlanning policyRachel ReevesAnimalsLabourWildlifeeditorialsShareReuse this content"

TheOne Piecemanga series, of which he is the freedom-fighting hero, had becomethe bestselling of all time, with more than 500m copies bought. The anime was a similar hit, with viewers immersing themselves in over a thousand episodes following his struggle against the World Government, a corrupt and tyrannical oligarchy.Yet Luffy has now found a new lease of life as inspiration to protesters in awave of youthful unrestacross continents. Hiscrew’s flag– a skull and crossbones crowned with his jaunty straw hat – has appeared fromMoroccotoMadagascarin recent days. Indonesians enthusiastically adopted it this summer, in a riposte to the president’s urging to fly the national standard. Officials were so alarmed that they threatened to jail those using it. It was perhaps the first time that Amnesty International hashad to defendusing an anime motif.The flag was attached to the railings of Nepal’s parliament building as it burned andthe government crumbledlast month, and has flown in the streets of the Philippines, Kenya and Peru. Last Friday, legislators in Limavoted to impeachthe president, Dina Boluarte,reluctant to be seento be protecting such an unpopular figure ahead of imminent elections.Protests have been sparked by specific grievances, including anger at regularwater and electricity cutsinMadagascar, where unrest is escalating; demands for education and healthcare improvements in Morocco; and fear of rising crime in Peru. The uprising in Nepal follows successful anti-government movements elsewhere in south Asia: Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024. Yet a common thread is evident. Leaderless movements are explicitly branding themselves as gen Z and adopting the emblems of protesters elsewhere as a statement of solidarity.The recently released Egyptian writer and activistAlaa Abd el-Fattahexpressedconcern, in 2019, that online culture had seen the degeneration of discussion and debate: “You are in these circles of people sending gifs and heart emojis … This medium is stifling.” The accelerated spread of ideas and symbols can restrict the imaginative spaces in which protest movements exist. But it can also extend them.Protests have always been contagious – as in Europe in 1848, or 2011’s Arab spring, or 2020’s Black Lives Matter movement. Pop culture has provided images of resistance such as thethree-fingered salute from Hunger Games– banned by Thai authorities. A few years ago, young pro-democracy activists in Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Myanmar spoke of a “Milk Tea Alliance”: each place had a different version of the drink, but it acted as shorthand for their shared struggle against autocracy, as the historian Jeffrey Wasserstrom notes in anew book.The current protesters are consciously borrowing symbols andcultivating linksbecause they perceive similar commonalities, even outside their region. Gen Z is coming of age amid widening inequality, economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability and climate pressures. Its members resent the gap between government propaganda and promises – like the Moroccan government’s huge spending on sports infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup – andinadequate deliveryfor the people. The cost of living, the corruption and nepotism of leaders, and the thuggishness of security forces are persistent themes. That, rather than an addiction to memes, is what these movements really have in common.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s understandable – but completely wrong, 6 October). One-nation Tories became extinct the minute Margaret Thatcher took office.The true old-schoolConservativeswere the Macmillan generation, and they were possibly a one-off. That generation had seen two world wars (Macmillan was wounded in the first), they’d witnessed the great slump of the 1920s and 30s, and consequently they’d had their eyes opened and had to question their often privileged upbringings.They largely continued the Keynesian social democratic policies established by Labour’s Clement Attlee (also public school educated and wounded in the first world war) and this continued until Thatcher established the wrecking ball of Friedmanism, which has now had 45 years to demonstrate its legacy of record inequality, tottering public services and our companies departing abroad in ever increasing numbers.But don’t hold your breath for a change in the party. The English electorate, at least, have always shown a healthy appetite for masochism and being told their place. There may be life in Thatcherism yet.David RedshawSaltdean, East SussexKemi Badenoch says that she will scrap stamp duty on primary residences if elected (Report, 8 October). The “party of fiscal responsibility” proposes to create a tax deficit while the country’s debt is running at100% of GDPand we pay almost as much in debt interest as we do on education. How is this responsible?Does she understand nothing about the factors driving house prices? People’s ability to buy is limited by their ability to borrow, and part of the borrowing needs to cover the cost of paying stamp duty. Cut out the stamp duty and all that will happen is house prices will rise to close the gap. The economic illiteracy of the Tories continues to astound me.Des SeniorAylesbeare, DevonThe Conservative leadership now regrets that the size of our civil service has increased in the last nine years.

A few years ago, I found myself procrastinating a little too much each morning rather than getting on with my writing. Scrolling through social media and the news cycle was slowly eating into more of that precious time.Then I recalled an article about “morning pages”, a daily ritual involving contemplation and free-form writing, and wondered if I could use this to develop better habits. I wrote down two questions: “What did I read this morning?” and “What do I think about what I read this morning?” Not only does this give me more purpose for my scrolling, it also serves as a warm-up before I focus on my word count for the day. Without this structure, I don’t think I’d be so productive.Rachel AmphlettPoole, DorsetI write down and look up the meaning of unfamiliar words, which makes me tortuously slow at reading. I also like to reread certain phrases or sentences and think about them for a while. I enjoy books that are not mainstream too, although one of my favourites has been Orbital, which deservedly won the 2024Booker prize.I recently joined a book club, where I suspect we will be reading one book a month – a challenging task for me as I enjoy slow reading.Pam ConnorBelconnen, AustraliaI have a similar practice to Emma Loffhagen, but rather than noting down words I don’t know, I create flashcards from nonfiction. Will I ever need to know why medieval Florence banned buildings over a certain height? Probably not, but the flashcards keep small facts in mind for context.James Mitchell-WhiteNottinghamHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Yet when this door was nudged open, the backlash was swift and ugly. The Reform UK MPRupert Lowecalled the scheme “racist filth”, and aSpectator articlelabelled it “racist”, ignoring the fact that the programme does not reduce opportunities for others.The Legal Services Board recently warned that the profession may be breaching its duties to protect minorities, citing risks of exclusionary and unhealthy practices. A 2022 report,The 1% Study, revealed that fewer than 1% of partners in major law firms are Black – just 90 out of 13,403. Astudy by Nuffield Collegeconfirmed that ethnic-minority candidates must send 60% more CVs than white counterparts to get the same opportunities – a statistic unchanged in 50 years. The Bar Standards Board has found that Black and minority-ethnic candidates are less likely to secure pupillage, even with similar academic credentials.We need to stop pretending the field is level.

But Fields was sacked by Jonathon Cooper and Justin Strnad on fourth-and-eight from the Denver 44 after Aaron Glenn opted to go for it rather than send out Nick Folk for a long field-goal attempt. Folk had successfully converted all three of his field goals.Fields struggled all game, completing nine of 17 passes for just 45 yards. The Jets finished with minus-10 net yards passing, the fewest in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1998.“Our passing game was non-existent,” Glenn said after the game.Dallas Cowboys 27–30 Carolina PanthersRico Dowdle went over 200 yards from scrimmage for the second straight week – this time against his former team – and rookie Ryan Fitzgerald kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired as the Carolina Panthers (3-3) defeated the Dallas Cowboys (2-3-1) in a wild back-and-forth. Bryce Young completed 17 of 25 passes for 199 yards and threw two of his three touchdown passes to rookie Tetairoa McMillan. The Panthers improved to 3-0 at home. Dowdle ran for 183 yards on 30 carries and caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown for the Panthers.San Francisco 49ers 19–30 Tampa Bay BuccaneersBaker Mayfield’s heroics came early in the fourth quarter instead of the final minutes. Mayfield threw two touchdown passes and had a spectacular scramble to help the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-1) beat the San Francisco 49ers (4-2). After winning four games with scores in the last minute, the Buccaneers didn’t have to come back late to secure this victory. The injury-riddled 49ers lost four-time All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner to a serious right ankle injury in the first quarter. Mayfield made a critical play when he scrambled for a first down on third-and-14.Los Angeles Rams 17–3 Baltimore RavensThe Los Angeles Rams (4-2) finished the first half with a goalline stand and then Matthew Stafford guided them to a pair of touchdowns to begin the third quarter in their victory over the Baltimore Ravens (1-5). The Rams weren’t at their best, but they didn’t have to be against a spiraling Baltimore team who were without injured quarterback Lamar Jackson for a second straight weekend. The Ravens managed a field goal on their first drive and nothing more. It was tied at 3-3 late in the first half when the Ravens had first-and-goal from the four-yard line. The Rams stopped four straight runs.Arizona Cardinals 27–31 Indianapolis ColtsDaniel Jones threw two touchdown passes and Jonathan Taylor ran for the go-ahead score with 4:32 left, giving the Indianapolis Colts (5-1) victory over the Arizona Cardinals (2-4). Jones finished 22 of 30 for 212 yards with one interception. He also ran for a score. Taylor had 21 carries for 123 yards, and rookie tight end Tyler Warren caught six passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. Indy remained perfect at home by winning their sixth straight at Lucas Oil Stadium. Arizona lost their fourth straight, blowing a fourth-quarter lead for the second consecutive week.Seattle Seahawks 20–12 Jacksonville JaguarsSam Darnold threw touchdown passes to Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp, and Seattle dominated both lines of scrimmage on their way to victory. Smith-Njigba finished with eight receptions for 162 yards as the Seahawks (4-2) rebounded from a last-second loss to Tampa Bay at home. They had few issues traveling cross-country for an early start, controlled most of the way and improved to 22-6 over the last decade in 1pm kickoffs on the East Coast. The Jaguars (4-2), meanwhile, looked every bit like a team that spent the week reveling in a Monday night victory against Kansas City.Cleveland Browns 9–23 Pittsburgh SteelersAaron Rodgers passed for 235 yards and two touchdowns, and the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-1) had little trouble with the Cleveland Browns (1-5). The Steelers strengthened their early grip on the AFC North by continuing their home mastery of the Browns. Cleveland’s regular-season losing streak at Acrisure Stadium hit 22 games after another lifeless performance by its offense. Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel passed for 221 yards but couldn’t lead the league’s second-lowest scoring offense to the end zone as Cleveland failed to crack the 17-point barrier for the 11th consecutive game. Rodgers threw TD passes to Connor Heyward and DK Metcalf.Los Angeles Chargers 29–27 Miami DolphinsJustin Herbert escaped the Dolphins’ pass rush and connected with Ladd McConkey for a 42-yard catch-and-run in the final minute. That set up Cameron Dicker’s fifth field goal of the game, and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-2) rallied to beat Miami. The Dolphins overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter and took the lead when Tua Tagovailoa threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining. Nyheim Hines set the Chargers up at Miami’s 35 with a 40-yard return of the ensuing kickoff. Then Herbert found McConkey and Dicker’s 33-yard kick won it for Los Angeles, who snapped a two-game skid. The Dolphins (1-5) were booed off the field at Hard Rock Stadium.Cincinnati Bengals 18–27 Green Bay PackersJosh Jacobs rushed for two touchdowns and the Green Bay Packers (3-1-1) held off Cincinnati (2-4) for a victory in Joe Flacco’s Bengals debut. Jacobs had a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and opened the fourth by scoring on a 14-yard burst up the middle. Jordan Love went 19 of 26 for 259 yards with an interception and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Tucker Kraft. Lucas Havrisik sealed the win by making the second of his two field goals, a 39-yarder with 1:52 remaining. Flacco went 29 of 45 for 219 yards with two second-half touchdown passes five days after the Bengals acquired him from Cleveland.New England Patriots 25-19 New Orleans SaintsDrake Maye passed for 261 yards and three touchdowns and the visiting New England Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints. Maye completed 18 of 26 passes as the Patriots (4-2) matched their win total from last season while improving to 3-0 on the road. Spencer Rattler completed 20 of 26 for 227 yards but no touchdowns and Blake Grupe kicked four field goals for the Saints (1-5).Tennessee Titans 10-20 Las Vegas RaidersGeno Smith passed for 174 yards and a touchdown, and Devin White led a suffocating Raiders defense as Las Vegas defeated the Tennessee Titans. The Raiders (2-4) ended a four-game skid, and the Titans (1-5) missed an opportunity to win consecutive games for the first time since November 2022. Neither of the struggling teams did much on offense. They combined for 451 yards. Las Vegas won fairly easily despite pedestrian numbers from Smith and Ashton Jeanty, who rushed for 75 yards and a touchdown on a 3.3-per-play average. The Raiders set the tone in the first half, when they shut out the Titans.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool have a game in hand on the teams around them but sit joint-bottom of the table.Arsenal get back on track in WSL after Olislagers’ own goal scuppers BrightonRead more“I’m disappointed for the group because they worked tremendously hard today and deserved more,” said Taylor, who was appointed in August.“At this moment we’re not getting what we deserve, and it’s tough but it’s fine; I think it’s close to working, it’s close to coming. It takes time. There has been a lot of change but we [will] keep working in the same way.“The results are tough at the moment because we’ve probably felt a little bit hard done by in a couple of games especially. But no one has consistently opened us up.“We have changed a lot of things. We have been asked to come in and play a new way. Sometimes it takes time, and certainly with how late we came into the door [late in pre‑season], it’s been really tough. More time with the girls would be what every head coach wants, more time to implement your way and your style.”City created all of the first-half opportunities but were fairly wasteful in the final third. Kerstin Casparij did hit the target when the ball rolled to her after Khadija Shaw was tackled in the box, but her left-footed shot went straight at Rafaela Borggräfe – who produced a one-handed save to keep out an Aoba Fujino strike, after the winger had raced on to Vivianne Miedema’s slick pass into the penalty area.In contrast to their lack of adventure into the City area during almost the entire first half, Liverpool were more attack-minded at the start of the second and they went in front with an excellent team goal as Ceri Holland’s right-wing cross found the back-post run of Cornelia Kapocs, who headed home in front of the Kop. Kapocs has scored both of Liverpool’s league goals this season.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Cornelia Kapocs (centre) celebrates scoring against Manchester City.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesThe hosts gifted the equaliser in unnecessary fashion through a mistake from Borggräfe; Shaw’s header was bouncing comfortably wide of goal but the keeper still tried to save it, only diverting the ball into the path of Iman Beney, who gratefully tucked in the leveller.Shaw did have a 79th-minute effort well saved, after shooting powerfully from the edge of the penalty area, as the City pressure began to intensify. It felt as though the winning goal was coming for the visitors, though, and it eventually did through Fujino. She was fed into space in the box and lashed in a clinical, low finish that had too much pace for Borggräfe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not until Liverpool scored. It was almost as if then we woke up and thought we need a little bit more, and that’s why we turned the game around.”There was a worry for Liverpool earlier in the game, when Marie Höbinger limped off with an injury. The midfielder appeared to be in tears of pain as she was substituted after treatment on the pitch.Jeglertz said: “Liverpool showed they are better than the position they have. They will definitely cause problems for other teams. They have good players and I think they showed in this game that they are very structured, organised and can make it difficult for us, so I am 100% sure they will soon climb the table.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLiverpool FC WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This week has been so tough, but now I’ve picked the trophy up it’s one I can tick off and there’s not many left.”The match was closer than the scoreline suggested but Littler was flawless in deciding legs, winning each of the first four sets from 2-2.In the first leg of the third set, he came agonisingly close to a rare nine-dart finish in the format but missed his final dart at bullseye.In the fourth set, Humphries roused himself from 2-0 down with two big checkouts only for Littler to come up trumps again in the decider, leaving the world No 1 able only to smile and shake his head.A 154 checkout from Humphries gave him the fifth set and hopes of at least making it competitive, but Littler responded superbly and dominated the final two sets.On his precision when it counted, the teenager said: “That’s what I’ve learned from the past in the matchplay. I’ve got to perform the big out shots, the big scores when Luke does put me under pressure.“I think I played very well tonight. Luke was always behind me, I couldn’t step off the gas. I’m very happy to win.”Humphries was disappointed by his own display, saying: “He’s so clinical and the first four sets I missed darts to get in. Double 16 was my friend for the last three years and tonight it wasn’t.“When I was 4-0 down, I just wanted to give the crowd something. It’s hard to take, it’s disappointing because I felt like I was going to give him a lot better game than I did.

Hull KR are the first new winners of the competition since 2004, and only the fifth in history to be crowned at all.For the Robins this is a watershed moment. Without a major trophy in 40 years before this season, they have now completeda historic treblein 2025 and are arguably Super League’s premier club side. For the wider competition as a whole, though, their success could not have come at a better time.Hull KR secure treble with dominant display against Wigan in Super League Grand FinalRead moreSport thrives on unpredictability so the fact that three teams have dominated the past 20 years ofSuper Leaguehas left many feeling the need for a new force to rise. With the competition expanding to 14 teams in 2026 – the new-look lineup will be announced in the coming days – there is a need for fresh stories and fresh clubs to dominate the airwaves.Rovers have not only ended a closed shop this year, they have hammered down its doors with a Robin-shaped battering ram. That feels fitting after a season that has delivered the promise of several new clubs coming to the fore and looking as if they can now emulate the new champions and themselves smash Super League’s glass ceiling.Castleford, Catalans Dragons, Hull FC, Warrington and Salford have reached at least one grand final, fallen short and then fallen back into the mire: all five finished in the bottom half this season. But withHull KRnow on top, there is a clear belief that a new, expanded Super League can yield more new champions.There has been that long-craved unpredictability and feeling of freshness throughout this year that, aside from the obvious story of Hull KR’s rise to greatness, is an immense positive for Super League going into 2026. Leigh Leopards’ third-placed finish shows they are not too far behind the Robins, while Leeds rose from eighth last year to fourth this season.Wakefield Trinity were playing in the Championship in 2024 but they made the Super League playoffs after promotion, underlining that clubs – including Toulouse and York, who are vying for promotion this time around – do not simply have to be content with scrambling to avoid finishing bottom of Super League.View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Jez Litten celebrates scoring his team’s third try against Wigan.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesBut good luck wrestling the title away from a Hull KR side in no mood to be regarded as a flash in the pan. “We’ve got a saying at the club that your rent is due every day,” their captain, Elliot Minchella, said. “No matter what you’ve achieved up to that point, you’ve still got to pay your rent and work hard.“Regardless of what you’ve done, you don’t sit back and take your foot off the gas. If anything, you’ve got to work even harder because you’re there to be chased. We’ll be chased next year but I’m looking forward to it.”The majority of this squad is contracted long term and their biggest problem is how long they can keep their coach, Willie Peters, from the lure of the National Rugby League. Peters’s stock has risen further with this triumph but his immediate focus in 2026 will be a World Club Challenge against Brisbane Broncos. That has been pencilled in for 20 February but the venue is yet to be determined. It will be in England, with Rovers’ Craven Park home and the MKM Stadium, home of Hull FC, options at this stage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They finished bottom of Super League as recently as 2020 but players such as Minchella and the final’s undoubted star, Mikey Lewis, have heralded a new era not only for Hull KR but for Super League as a whole. Suddenly, anyone has the right to believe it could be their year in 2026.The action is not over this year, though; in fact, it is just beginning. Several players from the Super League champions look likely to be included in Shaun Wane’s 24-man England squad for this autumn’s Ashes. The squad will be revealed on Monday lunchtime, with the first Test at Wembley on 25 October.Lewis is certain to be selected and based on what he has done this year – especially in the grand final – it would be a major surprise were he not in the side for the first match of the series. Should England manage to win the Ashes for the first time since 1970, it could catapult league to new heights in this country after Rovers’ domestic success.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueHull KRWigan WarriorsRugby leaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The victory, their third in four matches, lifted Australia to the top of the standings while the hosts, India, are third after a second straight defeat, having lost to South Africa earlier in the tournament. The top four teams qualify for the semi-finals .Australia chase down record score to beat India in Women’s Cricket World Cup – as it happenedRead moreHealy set the tone for the chase, sharing a brisk opening stand with Phoebe Litchfield and later a crucial partnership with Ashleigh Gardner (45), before falling, with Australia still needing 66 from 68 balls. Perry, who had earlier retired hurt with cramps, returned late in the innings to guide Australia over the line.“Really proud of the group,” said Healy. “A little bit tight at the back end. We have been preaching about the depth in our lineup, the fact that we could chase 330 [proved it].“Full credit to our bowlers for pulling it back; we could have been chasing 360-plus. I was trying to lock in for a big day. To contribute heavily was great, I would have liked to stay a bit longer but the girls got the job done.”The chase eclipsed the 302 made by Sri Lanka to beat South Africa at Potchefstroom in April 2024. Earlier, Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal shared a 155-run opening stand to put India on course for a huge total before a collapse in which they lost nine wickets for 138 to finish on 330. Annabel Sutherland’s five-wicket haul had triggered their slide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A failure to flag any issues by March would still be deemed a breach of the rules.The standard mechanism for avoiding an MCO breach is to set up a blind trust to manage one club, as Manchester City and Manchester United have done in the past with Girona and Nice, but Palace and Lyon failed to make such provisions last season.Uefa’s initiative is a response to a tumultuous summer dominated by MCO disputes particularly the Palace saga, during which Forest gave evidenceagainst their Premier League rivalsat the disciplinary hearing and in their subsequent appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne. Elsewhere, the League of Ireland side Drogheda and Dunajska Streda, from Slovakia, were expelled from European competition altogether after qualifying for the Conference League, alongside clubs from the same ownership group.Palace were demoted to the Conference League after Uefa’s club financial control body ruled that they had failed to meet the March deadline for putting the club in a blind trust, which was deemed necessary as the then-shareholder John Textor’s French club Lyon also qualified for the Europa League.In a decision upheld subsequently by Cas, the CFCB ruled Textor’s joint shareholding at Palace and Lyon at the time of the deadline gave him a decisive influence at both clubs, despite the fact that he subsequently sold his 44.9% stake at Selhurst Park to Woody Johnson before this season’s competition started. Lyon were awarded the Europa League place, as Uefa’s qualifying criteria state that league position trumps a domestic cup win, a decision that could end up costing Palace more than £20m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wales’s fate is in their hands after Belgium were held against Group J leaders North Macedonia and victory in Cardiff would keep alive the hosts’ hopes of qualifying automatically.Wales are seeking to bounce back from a3-0 friendly defeatagainst England at Wembley, which the captain, Ben Davies, who is poised to win his 100th cap against Belgium, said provided a “wakeup call” and prompted a “quiet journey back to Cardiff” on Friday, hours before the squad were boosted by watching their next opponents draw in Ghent.World Cup qualifying roundup: Neves stuns Republic of Ireland with late goalRead moreBellamy discussed the importance of heading into Monday’s game in a positive mindset. “I always believe there is a special moment coming, I can’t and won’t allow myself to feel the other way,” the Wales manager said. “Positivity is something I have to have around me, from my coaches, players; body language, I’m very big on that, how you present yourself, it’s so important. I only ever see good. Trust me, there was a period where I only ever saw the other side. I know which side I want to see. Being positive is everything.”Bellamy said Wales can use their previous experience of big nights in the capital to their advantage. “Players have been in this situation so many times over the last 10 years, especially Cardiff nights. The crowd are used to these moments.“When we’ve managed to qualify it’s been here. I didn’t get to experience that [as a player] – usually at this stage I was out of the group – so it’s nice to be able to get to three games left and a huge game on Monday that if we win, it’s a nice start to the remaining games.”Bellamy added thatdefeat against Thomas Tuchel’s Englandonly fuelled his determination to improve Wales. “How can I close that gap? How can I get to where he is?

And while the England star dazzled in patches with ball in hand, it was his composed kicking that was the difference asHarlequinsbeat Saracens 20-14 in a scrappy but enjoyable London derby.Smith launched raking kicks into space. He hoisted contestable spirals into pale blue skies. He dinked over the top of rushing defenders. His first‑half try came off a hoof into Saracens’ red zone, one that caused chaos in the backfield. Chandler Cunningham-South gathered the loose ball and bulldozed over the gain line. Shortly after, Smith, on the front foot, wriggled past a tackler to score from five metres out.Anthony Belleau turns the screw as Northampton see off rivals LeicesterRead more“He’s a British & Irish Lion,” Smith’s coach, Jason Gilmore, pointed out. “He gives us that game management. It’s something we’ve struggled with in the past two weeks.”Saracens were pinned in their own patch and struggled to get out. The mood of the match was summed up when another Smith bomb was shelled by Owen Farrell on the Saracens 22. Though the home side could not convert from the scrum, they maintained their territorial hold over their guests.Despite their dominance, Harlequins were not stretching their lead and it was wiped out when Saracens scored a screamer from their own half. At first receiver off the back of a scrum, Farrell pirouetted and delivered a gorgeous offload for Lucio Cinti who galloped up field. The Argentinian jinked left then right before stitching an offload of his own for the supporting Fergus Burke.Smith thought he had a second try after selling a dummy pass and bursting through a gap close to the Saracens line. Quins had nicked the ball off a defensive scrum but the ball had squirted out the side rather than through the No 8’s feet. Fin Baxter won a penalty off the very next scrum and Smith nudged over the penalty to take a 10-7 lead.Neither side managed to find much fluency in attack. At the 30-minute mark a packed Stoop witnessed 30 kicks from hand. Scrums needed restarting. Lineouts misfired. A brief exchange of shoves between Cunningham-South and Farrell brought one of the loudest cheers of the first half.View image in fullscreenTyrone Green shows his delight after scoring Harlequins’ second try.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PASmith belted a high kick with his first touch after the break. Tyrone Green chased after it and put enough pressure on Burke for the ball bobble away. Green was first to react, hacking ahead and winning the race to the line. Smith’s extras opened up a 17-7 lead.“We got what we deserved but maybe we were lucky to get what we got,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, who gave his supporters some joy when he confirmed the return of Maro Itoje for next week. “Marcus kicked beautifully and put us under a lot of pressure. We probably didn’t prepare the team in the way we should have for what came today and that’s the coach’s fault. But we expect the playing group to react to that better than we did. We lost intent in all of the important things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the forwards hammering away in the left corner, Harlequins defenders were sucked into the morass. Ben Earl was the one heavy who kept his distance, prowling the right wing. The cross‑field kick from Farrell could not have been better placed and in a flash the gap was reduced to three after a tough conversion from the tram.Harlequins had the game won when the debutant Boris Wenger burrowed over from close range following a lineout five metres out. But, for the second time in the game, the home crowd booed a chalked‑off try as replays showed the replacement prop had committed a double movement.More kicking took the game’s total tally beyond 50 with seven minutes remaining. Crucially it was Smith dictating the tempo in the closing stages. Men in white were kicking in desperation. Smith had it on a string, ensuring the clock ticked down with all the action taking place in Saracens’ third. A penalty for Smith on the final hooter was a fitting end.“It was a different way to win a game,” said Gilmore, who deserves credit for moving away from the club’s ingrained desire to play free‑flowing rugby. It might not have been a vintage show from the league’s entertainers, but it got the job done against their bitter city rivals.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyHarlequinsSaracensRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The last time a president called on it was in 1992 when the governor of California requested military aid from George HW Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles.In Sunday’s Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn’t felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities.Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday afederal judge prohibitedthe deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”.National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by theTrump administrationfrom both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets.Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places inChicagowhere people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”.In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”.In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America’s biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with thehighest murder rates– all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans.As Vance did the rounds of Sunday’s political talkshows, tension between the Trump administration and the Democratic states it is targeting exploded across TV screens. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump’s “political enemies”.Vance skirted the question until he was pressed into saying: “He should suffer consequences. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.”Pritzker responded to the veiled threat by accusing Vance of coming out with a “tidal wave of lies”. The governor told This Week that he was not intimidated by the prospect of prosecution as has befallen the former FBI directorJames Comeyand the New York attorney generalLetitia James, who have both been indicted in recent days.US immigration enforcement using military hardware and tactics on civiliansRead morePritzker said: “I am not afraid. Do I think he could do it? He might. But as I have said before, come and get me. I mean, you’re dead wrong, Mr President and Mr Vice-President, and I will stand up for the law and the constitution.”Raw emotions were widely on display across the TV studios as thefederal government shutdownentered day 12. The Republican House speaker,Mike Johnson, told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”.He said that after eight attempts to reopen the government had all failed in votes in the Senate, the shutdown was causing “real pain for real people – and the Democrats don’t seem to care”.On the same program, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, denied that the Democratic stance was partisan. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said.The Democrats’ aim, Jeffries added, was to “improve the quality of life of the American people and address the healthcare crisis that threatens tens of millions of people across the country”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryDonald TrumpJD VanceUS politicsChicagonewsShareReuse this content"

There’s more to do. I will make that happen.”Phillipson argued that as a cabinet minister she could make sure members’ concerns were heard directly at the top of government. In a subsequent pledge, her team said she would formally solicit views from members and trade unions every three months to present in this way.She said: “The Labour party draws its strength from its members. That’s why I want to give them a stronger voice in how the government delivers its agenda, with more avenues for our movement to tell us about their priorities.“Only under my deputy leadership will members have their voices heard loud and clear at the cabinet table.”Electronic voting among party members began last Wednesday and will run until 23 October, with the result announced two days later.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipLucy PowellBridget PhillipsonLabournewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.”Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.”Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did.The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions,wrote tothe chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts.This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government.Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said.In a letter to the prime minister on Sunday evening, Kemi Badenoch urged Starmer to address “key questions which remain unanswered” about the case, claiming the government’s “account of what has happened has changed repeatedly”.She added: “This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on members of parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The union will say that “multiple” staffers have described parliament as a “very white and middle-class” environment.The paper is expected to add that employees with multiple protected characteristics are hardest hit by pay disparity, saying its data suggests women of colour in parliamentary jobs earn on average almost £6,000 less annually than white men.It will say that transgender, non-binary and gay staff also appear to suffer pay discrimination, and that constituency caseworkers are poorly compensated compared with their counterparts in Westminster, despite often being at the “frontline” of parliamentary work. It will add that these pay gaps appear to widen over time, suggesting those with protected characteristics progress more slowly in parliamentary careers.The union said it analysed a sample of 174 cases from staff across theHouse of Commonsand House of Lords who agreed to share pay and equality information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only employers with more than 250 staff are required to publishgender pay gapdata. There is no legal requirement at present to publish information on pay disparities based on other protected characteristics, such as race and disability, although the government plans to introduce this.The report is expected to recommend a range of measures aimed at addressing pay discrimination, including mandatory pay gap reporting.The Guardian understands the GMB data does not indicate how parliamentarians from each of the major parties compare, as part of a desire by the union to present the research as “apolitical”.The GMB report adds that, of the staff in its sample who raised concerns about pay or discrimination, just 17% felt their issue was adequately addressed. The union said it had found evidence that many MPs had “not even taken minimal action” to address pay equality issues.Kartik Sawhney, a senior parliamentary researcher and the race officer for the parliamentary branch of the GMB union, said the findings of the report were “stark and inexcusable”.He added: “Parliament should be a model for equality, not a mirror of inequality. Talented, hard-working staff are being left behind because of their gender, race or disability. That’s unacceptable. We need more robust data monitoring, fairer systems and structural change to end this injustice.”Holly Williamson, the union’s parliamentary equalities officer, added: “This report confirms what many of us already know: women, non-white and disabled colleagues work just as hard, but are paid less. The most emotionally demanding roles, often held by those from protected groups, are also the lowest paid. Parliament must do better.”Explore more on these topicsIncome inequalityGender pay gapRaceGMB unionHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsInequalitynewsShareReuse this content"

The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%.“It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too.The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry.It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks.China insisted on Sunday thatits latest export controls on rare earthssuch as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate.“China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One study estimated our cerebral organs alone may contain 5g of the stuff, or roughly a teaspoon. If true, plastic isn’t just wrapped around our food or woven into our clothes: it is lodged deep inside us.Now, researchers suspect these particles may also be meddling with our gut microbes. When Dr Christian Pacher-Deutsch at the University of Graz in Austria exposed gut bacteria from five healthy volunteers to five common microplastics, the bacterial populations shifted – along with the chemicals they produced. Some of these changes mirrored patterns linked to depression and colorectal cancer.“While it’s too early to make definitive health claims, the microbiome plays a central role in many aspects of wellbeing, from digestion to mental health,” says Pacher-Deutsch, who presented his work at the recent United European Gastroenterology conference in Berlin. “Reducing microplastic exposure where possible is therefore a wise and important precaution.”Such discoveries raise unsettling questions: how much plastic do we each carry, does it really matter and can we do anything about it?Microplastics are shed from packaging,clothes, paints, cosmetics,car tyresand other items. Some are tiny enough to slip through the linings of our lungs and guts into our blood and internal organs – even into our cells. What happens next is still largely unknown.View image in fullscreenMicroplastics come in different types and shapes, which may influence their harmful effect.Photograph: Maxshoto/Alamy“Designing a definitive experiment is hard, because we’re constantly being exposed to these particles,” saysDr Jaime Ross, a neuroscientist at the University of Rhode Island in the US. “But we know microplastics are in almost every tissue that has been looked at, and recent studies suggest we’re accumulating far more plastic now than 20 years ago.”Ross first grew curious about plastics as a teenager, watching her mother’s spaghetti-sauce containers corrode. “Many of us assumed plastic was inert – that it wouldn’t shed or react – but I realised it wasn’t,” she says.Fast-forward several decades and she began studying what microplastics might be doing to the mammalian brain. Her firststudy, published in 2023, offered a hint: mice drinking water laced with microplastic particles started behaving differently.Usually, if you place mice in a brightly lit box, they hug the walls defensively. But those exposed to plastics restlessly ventured into the open – a behaviour more often seen with ageing and neurological disease.When the mice were dissected, plastic was found in every organ, including the brain, where a key protein linked to brain health, GFAP, was depleted – mirroring a pattern seen in depression and dementia.Since then, human studies have added to the unease. Microplastics have been detected in the brains ofdementia patients, and inarterial plaquesfrom people with heart disease. Those with plastic-laden plaques were almost five times more likely to suffer a stroke, heart attack or die within three years.Such findings gave me pause. Like Ross, I’d long assumed plastics were harmless, thinking little of chewing ballpoint pen ends, wearing synthetic clothes and reheating leftovers in takeaway containers. So when I heard about a £144 test fromPlastictoxpromising to reveal how many microplastics were circulating in my blood, I pricked my finger and sent off a drop.We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmfulProf Stephanie WrightAlan Morrison, the chief executive ofArrow Lab Solutions, the US company behind the test, said its goal was to provide people with an estimate of their microplastic exposure, allowing them to make lifestyle changes if they wished. “Sometimes this test is the kick in the butt that they need to get some of this [plastic] stuff out of their house and reduce their exposure,” he says.My test detected four microscopic particles – equivalent to about 40 per millilitre of blood. Based on their size, one probably got there through my gut while the other three were likely inhaled, the lab said. Although this places me in the lowest quarter of the 4,000-odd tests it has done so far, “it still represents about 200,000 plastic particles in your bloodstream”, Morrison says. “But considering the average person has over a million, you’re doing comparatively well.”Yet, as other experts point out, no one really knows what a “safe” level of microplastic looks like. The research field is extremely young and consumer tests are “very premature”, saysProf Stephanie Wright, a microplastics researcher at Imperial College London: “Your test results suggest you’ve got 40 particles per ml of blood – but we don’t know if that’s bad or good, what type of plastic, where they’ve come from, what they’re doing or where they’re going.”Scientific studies have used a variety of methods, making comparisons between them difficult. Some techniques – including the one used to quantify microplastics in human studies of dementia and heart disease – can suffer from interference from biological tissues. Because of this, their results are far from conclusive and should “be taken with a pinch of salt”, Wright says.Even if it is possible to accurately quantify the particles in blood or other tissues, it is uncertain whether all microplastics pose the same level of risk.“Plastics are quite heterogeneous. There are different types, but they also have different shapes, which may influence their harmful effects,” saysDr Vahitha Abdul Salamat Queen Mary University of London. The size of the particles also matters; the smaller they are, the more likely they are to cross biological barriers into organs or cells.View image in fullscreenThe Plastictox blood test showed that Linda Geddes scored low for plastic particles – but there were still about 200,000 in her bloodstream.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThere are further challenges before we know for sure if microplastics are harming us: rodent studies may not translate to humans; because they’re so much smaller, the same-sized plastic particles may be taken up and processed very differently, says Salam.So where does that leave us? We’re continually exposed to these particles, and “historically, we know that exposure to too many particles is bad”, says Wright, pointing to air pollution as an example. “We just have to understand whether there’s anything about these particles that makes them disproportionately harmful.”Another pressing question is whether some subjects might be more vulnerable than others. A recentfollow-up studyby Ross suggested that mice carrying the Alzheimer’s-associated APOE4 gene experienced more severe cognitive decline in response to microplastic exposure than those with less risky genes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDespite these gaps, many researchers are quietly changing their own habits. “Minimising exposure is probably going to have a benefit overall,” says Wright.If there’s a silver lining, it’s that although research suggests levels of microplastics in our bodies appear to have sharplyrisen in recent years, older people don’t seem to contain more than younger ones. “I found that positive, because it tells me we might be able to get them out of our bodies,” says Ross. Identifying ways to expedite this natural process – if it exists – is likely to be a significant research focus in the coming years.As for me, I can’t unsee those 200,000-odd particles. Whether or not that figure is accurate, it’s hard not to look around my plastic-coated life and wonder how I might start to unwrap it. Reheating leftovers in glass instead of plastic is a good place to start. And I’ll definitely stop chewing ballpoint pens.How to reduce your exposureAlthough it is impossible to avoid microplastics entirely, scientists say there are practical ways to reduce your personal exposure.Start in the kitchen. “The thing you definitely want to avoid is heat with plastic,” says Ross. “So not cooking your food with plastic utensils, not putting hot beverages or food into plastic.”View image in fullscreenAvoid microplastics getting into food by using a wooden rather than a plastic chopping board.Photograph: fotostorm/Getty Images/iStockphotoSalam says she has stopped microwaving food in plastic containers: “When you expose plastic polymers to heat or direct sunlight, this is what transforms or degrades them into microplastics.”Ross suggests examining everyday rituals such as making a cup of tea or chopping onions: “Teabags can release a lot of nano and microplastics. Even if the teabag is paper, they can be sealed with a plastic glue, so perhaps try loose-leaf tea. Are you cutting on a plastic board? Because this could also contaminate food.”Opt for glass or stainless-steel containers, utensils and coffee ware, and use wooden chopping boards instead.Although tap water contains some microplastics,UK tap wateris treated to remove almost all of them and studies suggest that many brands ofbottled watercontain far more.‘Inhaling the microplastics’: what is in British children’s school uniforms?Read moreBeyond the kitchen, Ross recommends thinking about bedding and personal care products. “Try to have more natural fibres, especially for the things you’re sleeping in – bed sheets, blankets and pillows, because you can inhale nano and microplastics,” she says.Check the labels on personal care products and cosmetics: although plastic microbeads in, for example, face washes, are now banned, some cosmetics and items such as lotions, lipsticks and eyeshadows may still contain nano or microplastics under names such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane or acrylates. Also look out for hidden plastics in menstrual products, and opt for those made from 100% cotton or silicone cups.Airborne plastics are another concern. Although indoor environments generally have higher levels owing to synthetic textiles and furnishings, “tyre-wear from high-traffic environments is another source of microplastics exposure”, says Wright. “In the same way that you’d avoid air pollution by walking down quiet streets, trying not to walk next to traffic and having your windows closed in the car. This should theoretically minimise exposure to microplastics.”Finally, think about your environmental footprint.Plasticstossed into landfill will slowly degrade, shedding more microplastics. “If you have any plastic items in your house, like plastic containers, repurpose them to store sewing materials and other non-food items,” says Ross. “If you put them in the recycling, they may not get recycled and you’re just adding to the wider problem.”Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionHealthMicrobiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In addition, the construction firm Balfour Beatty has landeda £1.2bn contractto build roads connecting to the tunnel.However, funding for the full project has been delayed while the chancellor searches for a partner that could contribute as much as £2bn to the scheme in return for charging a toll. Work is expected to get under way before the end of the decade.The site lies east of the Dartford crossing, which takes traffic from the M25 and lorries travelling to and from the ports of Dover and Folkestone.A map showing the Lower Thames Crossing routeEnvironmental campaigners argue that vital habitats on Kent’s north shoreline and the southEssexcoast will be lost if the tunnel goes ahead. It will also increase carbon emissions without solving congestion on existing roads, they added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Between five and 10 people typically work in a betting shop. Evoke, which also owns the 888 and Mr Green brands, has 10,000 staff in total.The FTSE 250 company is struggling under a debt pile of £1.8bn after its largely debt-funded acquisition of William Hill, and made a pre-tax loss of nearly £78m in the first half of the year.A spokesperson for Evoke said: “We are mindful of potential tax increases in the forthcoming budget which would impact investment in the UK and drive more customers to the black market.“As part of our ongoing planning, we are assessing the potential impact of different overall tax scenarios on our UK operations. This includes the difficult but necessary consideration for shop closures.”The company stressed that no decision had been taken yet.It is the second big gambling company to warn of the impact of tax rises within a week. Stella David, the chief executive of Entain, the FTSE 100 owner of Ladbrokes and Coral, also said higher gambling taxes could lead to shop closures and investment being diverted to other countries.The government has been consulting on gambling taxation, and wants to simplify the various rates of duty applied to gambling products – a move the sector fears would raise its overall tax bill.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are consulting on bringing online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. It is not about increasing or decreasing tax rates, and we welcome all views.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as her tuition fees, her scholarship from a charity, the Council for At Risk Academics (Cara), covers housing and living costs for her and all family members.She completed visa applications for the family, but last month, just before her studies were due to start, she received an email from the UKForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO), saying that her family would not be allowed to travel with her.As part of a UK crackdown on immigration, most international students are not allowed to bring their dependants with them. However, there areexceptions for full-time PhD studentssuch as Houbi, whose scholarship and visa permit her to bring her family.When questioned about Houbi’s caseduring a recent BBC interview, David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, said: “It’s important to understand that we are actually dependent on Israeli permissions to bring those people out, and that has not been easy to get.”But Israeli officials said they had not blocked Houbi leaving Gaza.“It should be clarified that Israel does not impose any limit on the number of residents exiting Gaza and relies solely on the requests submitted by the receiving countries,” said a spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli government department responsible for approving evacuations.The news has left Houbi devastated. “The fact that the UK government hasn’t even bothered to make a request on my family’s behalf is heartbreaking,” she said.Houbi and her family are now living in a tent in Khan Younis, after their home in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was destroyed by Israeli airstrikes early in the war.Houbi’s PhD research will explore how media and education can combat violence against women and promote peace. She said she hopes to return to Gaza after completing her PhD to teach, empower women and develop programmes that drive awareness and transformation.“She is such an excellent candidate for a scholarship that she was able to pick the scheme that allows her to bring dependants,” said Prof Alison Phipps, academic supervisor at the University of Glasgow. “No parent should be forced to choose their studies over their family, not least when this is a firm criterion of the scholarship itself.”Last month, thefirst group of university students from Gaza arrived in the UKafter months of campaigning by politicians, academics and activists on behalf of Palestinian students holding offers from UK universities.View image in fullscreenHoubi and her family are living in a tent in Khan Younis, as their home in Rafah was destroyed by an airstrikeMatt Foster, chief executive at Cara, which awarded Houbi her scholarship, said the charity “is ready and waiting to support this family and we call on the UK government to support their evacuation immediately”.Scottish education secretary Jenny Gilruth said she had requested an urgent meeting with the foreign secretary.An FCDO spokesperson said:“The government is working with universities to identify eligible students and to assist them to leave Gaza and take up their studies in the UK.

It went on to blame NHS waiting lists, a shortage of social housing and even traffic on “the rising population”.“There we go again, blaming us for everything and causing division,” she thought at the time. But instead of ignoring it, her neighbours came together to figure out a response. “That’s what gave me hope, that people stood together and said ‘not in our names’.”They decided to fight back with their own words by creating a poster with the message: “Brummies united against racism and hate crime”. They were placed in the windows of homes all along the street. “Not long after, a neighbouring street said: ‘Oh, we had those leaflets. Can we have your posters?’” Mus said.View image in fullscreenMus was horrified to find far-right propaganda on her doorstep.Photograph: Andrew FoxThe campaign continued to grow and last year was endorsed by Birmingham city council. Now it has found renewed salience after a number of alleged hate crimes carried out in the city. Last month a Sikh woman wasallegedly rapedin a park in Oldbury, in what police are treating as a hate crime. A few weeks later in another park, a 12-year-old boy was allegedlybeaten upin what his father described as a racist attack. A man in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of assault.“Operation raise the colours” in which St George’s and union jack flags have been erected across the UK has also caused fear and anxiety.Hope Not Hateand Stand Up to Racism said it had been organised by well-known far-right figures.The Birmingham campaign has been inundated with people who want to show solidarity with people of colour and religious minorities under increasing threat. “People are literally begging us on WhatsApp, can we have a poster?” said Anthony, who lives on the same street as Mus. To meet the demand, afundraiserhas been launched to print out 10,000 posters and distribute them across the city.“Birmingham is a multicultural city and I think it’s important to stand in solidarity with our neighbours, regardless of race, culture or religion,” he said. “Recent events such as flagging and rise of Reform UK are not things I feel comfortable with.”The campaign also hopes to spread beyond the city. According to Mus, activists in Worcester want to mobilise a similar, poster-led initiative. Like Birmingham, the city has recently had a number of racist incidents. Last month, swastikas and the words “no Jew” werepaintedon garages and on Friday a man and child weresprayedwith an unknown substance in an attack described by police as “racially aggravated”.Mus said since the attacks she had avoided visiting parks for fear of being attacked. She is not alone. As a Muslim woman, Raiza* said she felt like a “walking target” in the city. She said her area was full of lamp-posts adorned with the St George’s flag. “I felt quite intimidated by it. I thought, how am I going explain this to my young kids?”View image in fullscreenOne woman felt that Robert Jenrick’s attitude was ‘irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community he is commenting on’.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/GettyShe has also stopped taking her children to the park after the alleged assault on the 12-year-old boy. “You don’t know who’s hostile towards you or who’s completely fine. My kids are fourth-generation British, so we’re pretty established here, but I haven’t felt like this in the past.”She feels that politicians have “done nothing to stop this”, adding “if anything, it’s been encouraged”. Earlier this week, comments by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, complaining about visiting an area of Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face” wererevealedby the Guardian.I know the real Handsworth – it’s a far better place than Robert Jenrick’s toxic vision of Britain | Nazia ParveenRead moreRazia called the comments by Jenrick, who is seen as still harbouring ambitions to become the next leader of the Conservative party, “unhelpful, irresponsible and indicative of someone who doesn’t take part in the day-to-day life of the community that he is commenting on”.She has a poster, but she is hesitant to display it in her window for fear of being marked as a target. “We don’t know if we have any allies where we are living,” she said.“I think it’s important for white people to actually stand up and say, ‘no, I’m not having it’, now more than ever,” said Anthony. “If people want to wave flags and be patriotic, I have no problem with that, but the way that it’s being used now is to stir up resentment. It intimidates people, which I don’t think some seem to understand.”It is hoped that the posters will draw lines in the sand to fend off the far right and show solidarity to those feeling under threat. “People are really behind the idea.

In part, he responded: “It seems your piece is an attempted hit job meant to punish Meta for working with me on AI fairness. Nothing I’ve said has been on behalf of Meta – they work with people from every political background.”He added: “My role is simple: work to make AI fair for everyone, regardless of their views. That’s a goal anyone who believes in fairness should support. What you’re really trying here looks like cancel culture and activism dressed up as journalism, and I won’t cower for holding the same views as the political party that won the popular vote less than a year ago in America.”Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said: “It is appalling that Robby Starbuck was given a hand in Meta operations in any capacity. He peddles lies and pushes extremism, and it is hard to believe any of this will help make their platforms safer or better.Eric Bloem, vice-president of corporate citizenship at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said: “People should be able to find safe, welcoming communities online. Robby Starbuck pushes a dangerous anti-LGBTQ agenda, spreading disinformation and denying the very existence of transgender people.”Starbuck’s appointment to Meta via lawsuitStarbuck, formerly a music video director, has gained attention as an opponent of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. His pressure campaigns have frequently been directed at companieswho are perceived as having conservative customer bases, and have induced major American firms to abandon internal DEI measures, or to end their relationships with pro-LGBTQ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign.Starbuck won his role in the aftermath of one such campaign.In the midst of a summer 2024 campaign aimed at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Starbuck threatened Meta with a lawsuit over claims its Meta AI chatbot apparently made about him. In August 2024, Starbuck posted a screenshot purporting to show Meta AI’s summary of a Facebook thread of Harley riders angry that the “company chose to go woke “.A screenshot in reply from a Harley-Davidson dealer appeared to show Meta AI asserting that Starbuck was, among other things, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and had participated in the January 6 attack at the Capitol.Starbuckresponded: “Wow thanks for sending, Meta will hear from my lawyers since I was never at J6 and have been a longtime critic of QAnon.”That lawsuit was filed last April. Starbuck’s appointment to work with Meta waspart of the settlement. Other details of the settlement – including whether or not Starbuck was paid or is receiving ongoing compensation for the role – were not made public.On 8 August, Meta’s chief of global affairs Joel Kaplanposted on Xa joint statement with Starbuck.In part, the statement read: “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias.”The statement continued: “Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.”Bloem said: “There’s nothing unbiased about [Starbuck’s appointment].” He added: “Coupled with its January rollback of protections against hate speech across its platforms, this decision calls into question Meta’s commitment to keeping LGBTQ+ people and others safe online.”‘Portland is working with the terrorists’Starbuckhaslongpushed vaccinedisinformation, and he has amplified false claims made by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.In July, he boosted adebunkedclaim made by Kennedy in an interview with Tucker Carlson, in which he claimed that hepatitis B vaccinations led to a 1,135% increase in autism risk, adding: “This is absolutely criminal. The people behind this belong in jail and the hep B shot should be pulled immediately from the childhood vaccine schedule.”As part of his anti-DEI push, Starbuck has also spreadoverheated claimsandfalsehoodsabout transgender and LGBTQ people.He has also boosted such claims made by members of the Trump administration.In March, boosting a claimDonald Trump made in an address to Congressthat the government had spent “$8m for making mice transgender”, Starbuck wrote: “Democrats are trying to pretend that Trump was wrong about the government funding a study to turn mice transgender. He was NOT wrong. This is the study and it’s vile. Eighty female mice were ‘sacrificed’ after their last injection. Democrats funded this.”In fact, the mice studies sought to gauge the effect of hormone therapy on maladies such as wound-healing, HIV, and infertility.Starbuck’s online demeanor has continued largely unchanged since he was appointed, with him backing far-right figures in America and around the world and posting dubious pro-Trump narratives.Starbuck recently expressed support for authoritarians and he posted a video of Stephen Miller’s speech on theMemphis Safe Task Force, which has seen federal officers and national guard troops making arrests in there.Starbuck added the caption: “I’ve been advocating for us to make Memphis safe again for YEARS now by carrying out similar initiatives @nayibbukele executed successfully in El Salvador and finally… It’s happening.”El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, self-styled as the “world’s coolest dictator”, is celebrated by the far right in the US for his unconstitutional crackdown, which has seen up to more than 1.5% of the country’s population imprisoned, almost a quarter of those without trial,according to World Prison Brief.Starbuck also baselessly asserted that city officials in Portland were working with anti-fascists, and appeared to urge a violent response. Starbuckclaimedthat injuries to rightwing online personality Katie Daviscourt indicated that “the leftist government in Portland is working with the terrorists”, adding: “It’s time to treat Antifa cells like we would treat Isis cells.”In a comment on this allegation, Starbuck wrote: “The record is not in dispute. Portland councillors Angelita Morillo and Candace Avalos both publicly defended an antifa activist charged with assaulting a federal officer. Morillo has even posted tips to help antifa evade law enforcement. “He added: “When elected officials openly side with violent extremists, they are enabling them.”Morillo told the Guardian: “When influencers like Robby refer to ‘terrorists’, I’m not sure who they’re talking about – the guy in the frog suit? The people doing the Cha-Cha Slide outside the Ice facility in Portland? I can’t take anyone seriously who relies on sensationalized clips, AI content and outright lies to inform their thinking.”Avalos said: “People are free to say what they like on social media. That doesn’t make their statements true, and it doesn’t mean we have to take them at face value.“As a federal judge found in her recent ruling against the administration, the idea that there are coordinated attacks from ‘antifa, and other domestic terrorists’, as Trump alleged on Truth Social, is simply ‘untethered to the facts’. Who should we listen to: a sitting federal judge or someone with a Twitter account?”She added: “When I advise my constituents on how to protect themselves from federal agents acting unlawfully, I am speaking to the vast majority of Portlanders, who rightfully oppose fascism and are certainly not terrorists.”Starbuck also claimed that a high profile Trump detainee who was once incarcerated in Bukele’s brutal Cecot prison that “Kilmar Abrego Garcia [is] almost certainly an MS-13 member”.Twofederal judges this yearrejectedthe administration’s claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS13, and the government was ordered to facilitate his return from El Salvador.Commenting on his allegation, Starbuck wrote: “This is simple: an immigration court, DHS, and the president of the United States all identified Garcia as an MS-13 member. Denying it is no longer reporting – it’s spin in the pursuit of your own make-believe narrative. So once again, my language was perfectly appropriate.”‘This is domestic terrorism’In recent weeks, Starbuck has energetically attempted to connect the alleged perpetrators of high-profile shootings to the Democratic party.These claims culminated in avideoposted to X in which he claimed that “in less than 2 weeks there have been 5 domestic terrorism attacks by leftists”, citing the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the armed attack on an ABC affiliate in Sacramento, California; the attack on a wedding reception in Nashua, New Hampshire; and the attack on an Ice facility in Dallas. Another example he offered were purported chants of “Fuck Charlie Kirk!” by leftists in New York in the wake of Kirk’s death.In anearlier post, he cited the same events and claimed: “This is domestic terrorism”.The manaccused of the Sacramento ABC attackdoes have a long history of posting anti-Trump messages on social media, according to prosecutors, and spent two decades as “a lobbyist for healthcare, tribal and labor interests”, according to the New York Times.Evidence for connections between the other perpetrators and the Democratic party, or even the broader left, is either tenuous or non-existent.The claim about chanting demonstrators appears to arise frommid-September videos of counterprotesterswho, according to videos taken by independent journalists, disrupted a memorial vigil for Charlie Kirk in New York’s Washington Square. The identities, allegiances, and organizational affiliations of the counterprotesters are unspecified, and few media outlets reported on the story exceptRussian outletPravda.However, Joshua Jahn, who turned his gun on himself after the Dallas Ice attack, wasreportedly registeredas an independent in Oklahoma, and was described by friends as someone with “a vaguely libertarian bent who despised both major parties and politicians generally, including Trump, but who didn’t engage with politics beyond that”,according to reportingby journalist Ken Klippenstein.Hunter Nadeau, accused of killing one and wounding two others in an attack on a country club in Nashua, New Hampshire, reportedly yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack. But state attorney general John Formella said Nadeau “made a number of statements during the shooting and appeared to be attempting to cause chaos in the moment as opposed to showing a hate-based motivation”,according to NPR.Formella added: “We don’t have any evidence to indicate that this was a hate-based act.”Tyler Robinson, the man accused of Charlie Kirk’s murder, was reportedlyregistered as a non-partisan voter in Utah, although family members indicated he had moved politically to the left, according to prosecutors.Nevertheless, investigatorsreportedly told NBC Newsthat “thus far, there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any leftwing groups”.All of the reporting clouding the political allegiances of the shooters was on the public record on 25 September, when Starbuckrepliedto an X user who challenged him that “every single one of the cases I just pointed out are leftists”, blaming “left wing leaders … and their crazy followers”.Starbuck reiterated his claims about each shooter to the Guardian and linked to four sources he claimed supported him, including aDaily Mail storyabout Facebook posts by Joshua Jahn’s mother, and aprotest footage videopublished to YouTube by one of the previously cited independent videographers.He further responded with accusations about the Guardian, writing: “Why is the Guardian fixated on trying to downplay leftwing violence instead of investigating the clear surge of it?”He added: “I don’t have the luxury of ignoring this reality – my security team and the FBI are actively handling ongoing death threats against me. The dismissiveness from outlets like yours makes you complicit in emboldening this violence.”Meta adviserThe lawsuit that took Starbuck to Meta was carried out by a firm with Trump administration connections.Dhillon Law Group (DLG) filed suit in Delaware on behalf of Starbuck. In apress release, the firm said Meta’s chatbot had made “provably false and defamatory statements” about Starbuck.Between the original posts and the lawsuit, DLG founder Harmeet Dhillon was nominated and confirmed as Donald Trump’s assistant attorney general for civil rights. Trump named her as his pick in December and she was confirmed in April, weeks before Starbuck’s settlement.According to Office of Government Ethics filings, Dhillon divested her ownership in Dhillon Law Group in the firm in favor of her brother, a non-equity partner in the firm.In her 27 February ethics agreement, however, Dhillon wrote that she would “retain an interest in a portion of future recovery in 21 contingency fee cases based upon a fixed percentage of compensation”.The Guardian contacted the justice department to ask whether Starbuck’s case was one of the 21 that Dhillon retained an interest in. Initially, an automated response warned that “during the current lapse in appropriations, this inbox will not be monitored on a regular basis”.A spokesperson subsequently responded in an email, writing: “AAG Dhillon does not currently have any role in cases involving Mr Starbuck and their relationship is one of friendship and former client.”The Guardian then asked whether or not she had a role in his case at the time it was settled in April.The spokesperson said no.The Guardianpreviously reportedthat Dhillon earned a six-figure salary as CEO of a nonprofit, the Center for American Liberty (CAL), according to filings from 2021, 2022 and 2023. During that period, Dhillon Law Group received more than $1.3m as a contractor to the organization over two years. Dhillon, several CAL clients and Dhillon Law attorneysalso shared the servicesof the same Republican-aligned PR operative.During Dhillon’s leadership, the CAL pursued a myriad of culture-war lawsuits on behalf of rightwing influencers, “de-transitioners” and parents of transgender children, and churches that had been subject to California’s pandemic restrictions.Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “This is just another example of Meta caving to Trump and his allies, and bogus charges of political bias, and makes a mockery of fair content moderation on Meta’s various platforms.”Elsewhere in his comments to the Guardian, Starbuck wrote: “You should be honest with Guardian readers about the fact that you’ve been accused of extremely close ties with antifa.”Explore more on these topicsMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Forcing countries to pay debts in full is leading to deepening crises in health, education and vital public services.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Opposition parties have accused the electoral commission, Elections Cameroon, of being subservient to the ruling party, and the most credible opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, has had his candidacy barred by the courts.Other candidates include former ministers Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who recently defected from the presidential camp and has gathered several thousand people at meetings around the country, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was Biya’s first prime minister in 1982. Observers say their individual campaigns lacked the cohesion necessary to mount a significant challenge to Biya’s long-standing rule.Cameroon faces significant socioeconomic challenges; a third of the population lives on less than $2 (£1.50) a day, youth unemployment is rampant, and many young people have expressed disillusionment with the electoral process, citing a lack of economic opportunities and political representation.View image in fullscreenSupporter of opposition politician Issa Tchiroma Bakary, one of the candidates contesting Sunday’s poll.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersVoter turnout has declined dramatically over the years, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts with jihadists in the Far North region andanglophone separatistsin the west.The world’s oldest president is running again: can anyone stop him from winning?Read moreThe latter crisis, which began in 2017, has led to thousands of deaths in the country’s two English-speaking regions and forcibly displaced over 700,000 people.Kah Wallah, the leader of the Cameroon People’s party and founder of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, said the anglophone crisis is one of the reasons why the movement has not supported elections since 2018. “We still believe it is unconscionable for the Biya regime to go to elections without ensuring the security of citizens in #NOSO,” she said, referring to a common abbreviation for Cameroon’s anglophone North-West and South-West regions.The government has been criticised for its heavy handed response, which has left many in the anglophone regions feeling marginalised and open to boycotting the vote.Biya, who is rarely seen in public, held his first and only campaign rally on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, he promised to step up security in the region, curb youth unemployment, and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if reelected.“I am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,” Biya said in his speech. “Based on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.”This year’s election cycle has featured striking appeals for him to step aside. First came the Catholic archbishop Samuel Kleda, who went on French radio last Christmas to say it was “not realistic” for Biya to keep doing the job. Then came the defections of Tchiroma and Maigari, both of whom openly challenged Biya’s fitness to lead.Finally, the president’s daughter Brenda Biya, 27, said on TikTok last month that her father “has made too many people suffer” and urged Cameroonians not to vote for him. She later recanted, but the post continues to circulate widely among Biya’s detractors.Theophile, an artist in the economic capital, Douala, called the vote a “scam”. The 24-year-old had hoped to vote for Kamto, who came second to Biya in the 2018 election. “As long as the system remains in place, there is nothing that can be done. There has to be a change,” he said.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCameroonAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This will have a disproportionate impact on smaller businesses and charities with high energy demands because energy intensive industries such as steel, cement and glass-making have been granted exemption.A Bristol-based community arts organisation,Spike Island, has been told to expect a hike of £1,ooo a year from the nuclear levy alone. The company, which provides subsidised studios for underrepresented artists, expects the extra costs to put a strain on its work.Kate Ward, the deputy director at Spike Island, said the rise in electricity costs would prevent the charity from switching to low-carbon heating, such as heat pumps, while increasing its overall running costs and putting its work with artists at risk.“The government needs to rethink how they approach electricity bills to make it viable for more charities and small businesses to make the right decisions for the planet,” Ward said.Business groups have also said that the costs are a “huge concern” for smaller companies, which they say will be forced to carry a disproportionate cost burden because larger companies were given exemptions.Craig Beaumont, the executive director of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: “Small businesses are already feeling the strain from increasing utility bills, with many saying it’s now holding back their growth. Further increases to non-commodity costs will only add to this pressure.“The government is protecting high-intensity users against these hikes, but as a result small firms’ bills are due to shoot up. This is in effect a cross-subsidy. Local small businesses should not shoulder such a high proportion of the costs themselves.”Kate Nicholls, the chair of the trade body UKHospitality, said: “This is yet another example of hospitality businesses subsidising other sectors. It’s not just the nuclear levy, but also the energy discounts for large, energy-intensive manufacturers, which will be offset by higher bills for community pubs and neighbourhood restaurants.“The constant focus on the needs of the industrial strategy sectors is having real-world impacts for the other 70% of the economy. Adding yet another cost on to hospitality businesses will only put further pressures on prices at the bar, which will fuel inflation.”A government spokesperson said: “Thriving small businesses and charities are at the heart of our communities, which is why we have extended business rates relief, supporting economic growth across the country and support for those who need it most.“The only way to bring down energy bills for good is with the government’sclean energy superpower mission, which will also secure thousands of good, skilled jobs and billions in investment.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsHousehold billsCharitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

As his fans will know, they are part of tradecraft practised by the spies he wrote about so evocatively. Now, almost five years after his death, an exhibition, with the title Tradecraft, reveals the techniques and motivations of the characters’ real creator, David Cornwell.As you enter the exhibition inOxfordUniversity’s Bodleian library you are greeted with a large portrait of Cornwell, wearing a black bucket cap, looking straight ahead with piercing eyes, his chin resting on his gently clasped hands. Accompanying the photo are two of his quotes. “I am not a spy who writes novels, I am a writer who briefly worked in the secret world,” one says. The second, after questioning whom, if anyone, we can trust, continues: “What is loyalty – to ourselves, to whom, to what? Whom, if anyone, can we love? And what is the caring individual’s relationship to the institutions he services?”They are questions that had confronted him since childhood, with a mother who abandoned and lied to him and a father, Ronnie, a conman and fantasist who spent time in prison. Among the books that feature in the exhibition is A Perfect Spy, which he called the most autobiographical of his novels, whose central character, Magnus Pym, is obsessed with his father, Rick, a seductive fraudster.View image in fullscreenDraft manuscript page of The Constant Gardener, including stapled sheet labelled with arrows and signs to indicate to Cornwell’s wife, Jane, where her typing was to include his inserted amendments.Photograph: Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesBetrayal and spying are, of course, the dominant themes of his cold war novels featuring his hero George Smiley – themes which Cornwell experienced first in fact, then in fiction. After spending national service in the army’s intelligence corps, he was offered a place at Lincoln College, Oxford. The exhibition includes caricatures he sketched for the college publication, the Lincoln Imp. There are articles written for the journal Oxford Left. His fellow contributors were among those on whom Cornwell passed information to MI5, one of his first tasks for the agency, one he said later he regretted.A handwritten note shows how uncomfortable he was amid early speculation about his own spying. “Why do people want me to have views about spying? If I wrote about love, or cowboys, even sex, people would take it that this was my interest and therefore I made up stories about it,” he wrote.His college fellow and rector was Vivian Green with whom Cornwell developed a close relationship (he sketched Green for the Imp). Green had been Cornwell’s tutor at Sherborne school and presided over Cornwell’s marriage to his first wife, Ann Sharp. A reference from Green reveals that he described his former pupil as “congenial, pleasant and loyal”. A Lincoln tutor later recorded: “Mr Cornwell has done his medieval texts very intelligently,” adding: “He must make more of his facts.” It was advice Cornwell, unknowingly at the time, was to seize with astonishing results.View image in fullscreenJane Cornwell, David Cornwell’s second wife, typing a le Carré manuscript. She typed everything that he handwrote – through a series of cut, stapled, sellotaped and annotated drafts.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesAlthough Smiley, portrayed by Alec Guinness in the BBC television series Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley’s People, was a composite character, correspondence between the actor and the novelist featured in the exhibition shows how much Cornwell was inspired by Green. Cornwell, as le Carré, oncewrote: “George Smiley must have all the qualities I lacked: Vivian’s patience, his sagacity, his discretion, his memory. And that peculiar loneliness that comes from knowing and seeing a lot that you can’t do much about.”Fact and fiction seemed to merge when a younger Smiley is described at Oxford as “donnish” but “much slimmer”. In a letter to Cornwell, Guinness questioned whether he was suitable for the role of Smiley. “Although thick-set I am not really rotund or double-chinned,” he wrote.The exhibition includes what he called an “observation”. “From the very first book,” Cornwell wrote, “my central characters have been forced to ask themselves what they owe to Caesar, and what they owe to their consciences.” After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war Cornwell turned his attention to contemporary issues that struck his conscience.View image in fullscreenPen and ink sketches, titled Oxford Gesichte (Oxford Faces). Circa 1953.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesThe exhibition shows the extent to which Cornwell, much like a journalist, relied on sources – they included his former colleagues in MI6 – and how he travelled extensively to research his plots. He consulted widely on the arms trade for The Night Manager, and the pharmaceutical industry for The Constant Gardener. He accused the industry – the subject of much controversy now – of “obsessive secrecy at all levels”. He noted: “Pharma Speak … Be grateful for our brilliant successes and pay whatever we tell you and shut up.”View image in fullscreenThis hand-painted ‘to fix’ pebble sat atop piles of le Carré’s writing to indicate further work needed.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesDrafting The Mission Song, about a western coup plot in eastern Congo, Cornwell described “corporate responsibility” as “the other Heart of Darkness”. The main character of A Most Wanted Man was based on the real story of Murat Kurnaz, a Turk brought up in Germany and rendered to Guantánamo Bay. Cornwell checked with the manager of the Hotel Bellevue Palace in Berne, Switzerland, to ask whether he could name the establishment in the money-laundering and mafia plot Our Kind of Traitor. He met the former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat while writing The Little Drummer Girl, in a plot with striking contemporary resonances.Some former ministers and spy chiefs have expressed regret, and some concern, about what they criticised as a cynical tone and negative message in Cornwell’s novels. Others have welcomed the debates he has provoked. Cornwell mentioned some years ago how he had been invited by MI5 to give a talk to their officers. He was welcomed but told them he was unlikely to be accepted if he applied to join the agency again.Tradecraft at the Weston library, the Bodleian, Oxford, runs until 6 April.Explore more on these topicsJohn le CarréUniversity of OxfordOxfordEspionageExhibitionsThrillersFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

I remember where I was when this feeling, so heretical to me, arrived: it was early morning in London, and having come down Fleet Street on my way to work, I was standing at the till of a newsagents to pay for a Diet Coke, a flapjack and a pack of Silk Cut. There were no children there and no pregnant women; nothing had been said or done to change my mind. It had simply landed on me, and more or less immediately – because I’ve never known how to control an impulse, and because I was 30, which seemed to me then a great age – my husband, Robert, and I set about trying to have a child.When for some months nothing happened, I turned to the websites where women who’ve never met scrutinise their bodies for signs of pregnancy or fertility or miscarriage, and my vocabulary changed. I became able to communicate in acronyms impenetrable to anyone who hadn’t held a dozen ovulation sticks in a dozen urine streams, and it is all so long ago now that I only remember one: 2WW. At first I took this to be some dry reference to the second world war, since they did seem to be always in battle, these women, or in flight – but in fact it refers to the “two-week wait”, the fearful, hopeful days between sex and ovulation, and the first signs the uterus had succeeded or failed (that these signs can be identical sometimes invokes a kind of madness, to which I also briefly succumbed).During this time, I began to picture myself raising a boy as sweet and funny as my husband, and became prone to sentimental visions; one morning I imagined a row of small socks drying on a radiator and burst into tears. My desire to conceive became equal to my prior horror of conception, and when I failed to become pregnant I was indignant, as if for the first time in my life I’d flunked an exam. When eventually I did conceive, it was soon after my mother-in-law, Jenny, had died quite suddenly, and it seemed a recompense for our grief – both my husband’s and mine, and that of his father, David, who’d been not only Jenny’s husband but her carer during a life made difficult by rheumatoid arthritis. That pregnancy was only brief, and I’ve few memories of that time – though I do recall once lying in Victoria Park, east London, and lifting my shirt to allow the sun to reach my belly, saying “there we are – there we are!”, patting the skin over my womb and basking with my child in the late-afternoon light. I quickly miscarried, and for some days sat on the upper deck of London buses weeping steadily, to the visible sympathy of fellow passengers.A room with sunlight illuminating ranks of books was as desirable to me as a nursery might be to another womanSubsequent investigations diagnosed unexplained infertility, and IVF was indicated as our likeliest route to parenthood. But already the surge of maternal longing was fading, replaced by sober consideration of what fertility treatment entailed. I was by then pursuing a full-time PhD during full-time employment, while writing my first book: there seemed insufficient hours in the day for hospital appointments, and injections, and whatever undignified tinkering about with my fallopian tubes they’d deem necessary. With horror I understood that I wanted to publish novels more than I wanted to raise a child – or at any rate that I wanted to write more than I wanted to endure years of interventions that might not produce a baby, but would almost certainly diminish my capacity for study. I pictured those small white socks drying on the radiator, and that was a lovely image – but I also pictured, down the other path, a room with sunlight illuminating ranks of books and a glass of wine and possibly a telescope, and it was as desirable to me as a nursery might be to another woman. One afternoon, over gin and tonic, I announced to a friend (herself happily a mother) that we’d decided not to pursue fertility treatment, and she grasped my hand: “Congratulations!” she said, “I’m just as pleased as if you told me you were pregnant!” – a piece of understanding for which she’ll be forever loved.What that friend knew – and what she’d always let me say – was that until that startling moment on Fleet Street, I’d always regarded the wanting of children, and the having of them, to be absolutely insane. Possibly you’d imagine this makes me a cold sort of person, who flinches from children on public transport and dines on the olives in her martini. In fact, I resemble an illustration of, say, a motherly badger in a children’s book: I’m sturdy and broad-hipped, flour frequently dusting the hem of my pinafore; I make patchwork quilts, windfall jam and my own pastry. I never met a baby I didn’t love, and though I’m not good with children (I’m incapable of silliness and don’t know how to play), I like them no more and no less than any other living soul, that is: according to their merits. Nor do I dislike mothers. Some of my best friends are mothers, and their children are my friends, too (for this reason I call myself childless, which represents mathematical fact, rather than child-free, which casts children of whom I’m very fond as burdens).I feared not that I would be forced to abandon my fierce literary ambitions in service of my child, but – far, far worse – that I would actually want to.The trouble is this: I began to observe motherhood when very young and with the fascination of an anthropologist. As family members began producing their babies, I was aghast: never could I imagine actually choosing such a state. Familiar girls became haggard women who wept as their children screamed upstairs (these were the days when it was fashionable to abandon babies to their sorrow); familiar homes became tautly silent in case the mercifully sleeping infant was woken by a footstep; marriages were strained to snapping by insomnia, and by a deadening of spirits I later recognised as postnatal depression, or the effects of a hopeless co-parent. In time I watched with equal confusion as women willingly gave up their pursuits and careers and – at their own estimation, not mine – their identities, consumed by atavistic emotions that caused them to abandon their most basic needs. One friend became painfully thin, having failed to eat enough to compensate for the demands of breastfeeding; another went about with her blouse transparent with leaking milk, and told me her nipple had a wound that could accommodate a two-pence piece, “just like a slot-machine!”Then there was the contradictory mental state that seemed to me to entail the loss of reason: mothers declared they’d never felt so wretched but also never so fulfilled; none ever suffered like them, but equally (and at precisely the same time!) none ever knew such happiness. Motherhood was a maligned and undervalued condition, but also it was an exalted state that almost every woman I knew either anticipated as inevitable, or sought with a desperation that left their sanity and bank accounts depleted. My attachment to logic and reason – better suited to a mathematician than a novelist – caused me to view all this with a sort of bewilderment, as if I were a student who couldn’t solve an equation.It occurs to me now that I underwent a kind of neurological version of the social media algorithms that turn an idle interest into an obsession: I’d clicked on unhappy mothers early on, and for decades could see little else. Perhaps because I had no dog in the race, new mothers confided in me, and I found that common to them all was guilt: endless, particular, and to my mind nonsensical. Guilt if the baby was not breastfed, but then again guilt if it was breastfed only for three months, or six months, or 12; guilt if the birth was caesarean, or assisted by any of the interventions for which millennia of women would have given their right arm; guilt if the child would not eat peas, or would eat only peas, or was left unattended and put a pea up their nose. “What I would like,” I often said, “is to be a father”, noting how often men (their bodies and careers intact) would regard their partners with simpering gratitude and say that, really, it was all down toher,concealing within the compliment a refusal of such indignities as, for example, the daily preparation of a packed lunch.Above all (it is this that causes me to feel most shamefully unnatural), I feared not that I would be forced to abandon my fierce literary ambitions in service of my child, but – far, far worse – that I would actuallywantto.Soon I will be 46. I never did conceive again: I never will. I have the study of which I dreamed – I have a piano, a telescope, a microscope and a little printing press; my many thousand books flank an open fire, and my time is largely my own. I never grieve my lack of children, but now and then I wonder how things might have been, had I, as that watchful and too-rational child, seen not motherhood’s troubles, but its joys. Once, overlooking the river that divides Namibia from Angola, I ate lunch with a clever and vital woman whose merry nature seemed not contrary to her motherhood, but part of it – she loved her children and she loved her work: it was as simple as that. To the mortification of us both, I burst into tears: “If I’d known you when I was young,” I said, “I might be a mother now – but you see: I had no idea I could have been happy!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’m fortunate to have godchildren, and innumerable nieces and nephews; one of these – though considerably smarter than me and gainfully employed at the British Museum – still calls me “Auntie Sarah”, and I’ve never asked her to drop the honorific, since the tie of blood is precious. Some years ago, a tall, coltish girl from the American south arrived at the house to look after our sensitive rescue hound, and never quite left. Her cleverness showed itself in a thousand surprising and sometimes ludicrous ways; she bred fancy mice that resembled animated pearls, occasionally modelled, and painted beautiful representations of fish guts. Immediately I liked all these things about her, and felt I would have liked them very much in any daughter of mine; these days I suspect my house is as familiar to her as her own, and if you asked me to explain why I love her, I could say only that I like having her about the place. When recently she said, more or less in passing, that since she disliked the idea of speaking at my funeral when the time inevitably came, there was nothing for it but to train as a stonemason, in order to carve my tombstone, I only said “very sensible”, and concealed tears as best I could.And then, in the autumn of 2023, I experienced a curious echo of that time when I’d briefly tried to have a child, as I encountered the NHS policy of leaving patients with suspected cancer for no longer than two weeks before seeing a specialist: another “two-week wait”, if sometimes at the other end of life. David, my father-in-law, having previously seemed in good health, was found to have a suspicious growth in his oesophagus: cancer was suspected, and would be confirmed within 14 days. So his two-week wait ticked away in the bungalow where he lived, as he put the kettle on and made himself porridge he could never quite eat, and set about phoning friends and family members to give them news that was not quite news, because it would be two weeks before the possible became certain. Then the possible did become certain: cancer was confirmed, and he lived for just less than nine days. Those days consumed my husband and me, as we nursed David to his death in his own sitting room, stunned by the speed and rapacity of the disease. There were no hours then but those hours, no world but the bungalow, no object but a dying man’s comfort – and often it occurred to me that we performed our acts of care with something like the instinctual, loving competence of a new mother.Now, those two times of waiting have got muddled up for me – 14 days until signs of life, or the possibility of life; 14 days until signs of death, or the possibility of death. And in the many fortnights since then, I’ve often thought that in fact those days were really no different from any other days – that David and Robert and I had always lived with the possibility and even the proximity of death, as well as life, and that what had changed wasn’t the land, but the view.Death of an Ordinary Man by Sarah Perry is published by Jonathan Cape.

Twenty two years since its debut, withrevivalsnow in double figures,David McVicar’s production of The Magic Flute is back, overseen by revival directorRuth Knight.The lighting is as beautiful as ever: there’s no mistaking the Enlightenment’s visual metaphors here. Notwithstanding a technical hitch that delayed the start of act two on opening night, the opera’s sequence of mysterious non-places glides along, dreamlike and atmospheric. The opera has long outlived itsgenre of Singspiel– a kind of 18th-century musical – and its edutainment moralising unavoidably harks back to another age. Whether you agree with the programme that an opera insisting that women always need male guidance is “very suitable for children” will depend on your parenting style. But it’s hard to imagine the plot making more sense in the 21st century than it does in McVicar’s hands.This revival is also a lot of fun, weaving a vital thread of panto-ready physical comedy through the earnest lessons of Sarastro and his pseudo-masonic initiates. The German dialogue is so fluently delivered you’ll overlook the absurdity of a London audience listening to a non-German cast chattering auf Deutsch. The opera’s “noble” couple of Tamino and Pamina can be a bore – all head prefect goody-goody – butAmitai PatiandLucy Crowewere far too vivacious for that. Crowe sparkled from the get-go, her tone warm, her phrasing exquisitely controlled. Pati (the brother of acclaimedSamoan-born tenor Pene) gleamed heroically up top yet blended sensitively in the various ensembles: an extremely fine Royal Opera debut.View image in fullscreenSteely soprano … Kathryn Lewek as the Queen Of The Night.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHuw Montague Rendallis a born Papageno, sympathetic as he struts and strops, his singing easy, his comic timing acute.Gerhard Siegel’s Monostatos (the character stripped of its most explicit racism) was a thoroughly kitsch baddie, whileKathryn Lewekwas a relatively un-histrionic Queen of the Night, her soprano steely and laser-accurate, the leaps of her most famous aria ringing out, bell-like. As Sarastro,Soloman Howardhad easy authority, his high register sumptuous, his lowest notes dense velvet. The three boys boasted exceptional intonation and angelic tone; the three ladies agile, luminous ensemble singing.Holding it all together with an utterly musical, utterly assured sense of pace, was young French conductorMarie Jacquot. She drew ultra-stylish playing from the orchestra: tutti heft remained translucent, chorale passages were sublimely well-tuned, solos artfully sculpted. At one point her hand shot up, releasing the end of a phrase as if she’d been grasping it in her fist, such was her intimate involvement with the music. Remember Jacquot’s name: this Royal Opera debut suggests we’ll be needing it.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 3 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Like Alabama’s 13 other prisons, Easterling largely prohibits media access, but allowed the documentarians to film its annual volunteer-run barbecue, a sunny day in which incarcerated men, most of them Black, ate fresh roasts to live music and sermons. On camera, men danced and smiled. But off camera, many more told a different story – horrific beatings, unreported stabbings, unimaginable violence swept under the rug and appalling conditions that “ain’t fit for human society”. Cries for help emerged from inside the sweltering, filthy dorms. When Jarecki approached the voices, a prison official shut down filming, claiming that it was unsafe for him to speak to the men without a police chaperone.‘The world needs to know what happened to my baby’: inside devastating new police-body-cam film The Perfect NeighborRead more“It was very clear that there were areas of the prison that we were not allowed to see,” Jarecki, whose credits include Capturing the Friedmans and The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, recalled recently. “They use the idea that it’s all about safety and security, because they don’t want you to understand what they’re doing. These prisons are like black sites.” In the short visit, the crew received the same message over and over: “We don’t have access to the outside world. Please share this.”That thwarted barbecue meeting opens The Alabama Solution, a stunning new documentary, made over the course of six years, on the hell known as the Alabama department of corrections (ADOC). Co-directed by Jarecki and Kaufman using a decade’s worth of evidence covertly filmed by incarcerated men, the two-hour film reveals a gallingly corrupt system rife with unchecked abuse, forced labor and unimaginable cruelty, and documents prisoners’ herculean efforts, under constant physical threat, to improve conditions deemed “unconstitutional” by the US justice department in 2020.Following their abruptly terminated Easterling visit, Jarecki and Kaufman got in touch with men inside ADOC, a system that incarcerates 20,000 people with the highest overdose, murder and suicide rates in the nation, at 200% capacity with one-third of the required staff. Led by two long-incarcerated activists Melvin “Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun” Ray and Robert Earl “Kinetik Justice” Council, a network of sources provided the film-makers with years of evidence recorded on contraband cell phones. The footage is ghastly: rat-infested cells, piles of human waste, rotting food and blood-streaked floors; routine officer beatings and men carried out in body bags; hallways of men near-catatonic on drugs sold by officers on the black market. The first-person testimony recounts unbelievable abuse and just as unbelievable fortitude. Council begins the film in five years of solitary confinement as punishment for his organizing; later in production, he isnearly beaten to death by guardsand loses sight in one eye.Such brutality is, we learn, standard within ADOC. While incarcerated sources continued to collect evidence, the film-makers investigated the death of Steven Davis, who was beaten beyond recognition by officers inside the William E Donaldson correctional facility in October 2019. The Alabama Solution, which premiered atSundanceand is now available on HBO Max, follows Davis’s mother, Sandy Ray, as she pursues answers from a recalcitrant ADOC, who would not even allow Davis’s family to bring their phones to his deathbed, lest they take a photo of his face with every bone broken (his brother managed anyway). She learns of the state’s explanation – that Davis threatened officers with a knife, necessitating physical force as self-defense – on the news. But multiple incarcerated witnesses told Ray’s lawyer that Davis wielded only a plastic knife and yielded immediately, only to be beaten by four officers anyway; one of them, Roderick Gadson, stomped Davis’s head off the concrete floor “like a basketball”.After three years enduring nothing but obfuscation, Sandy Ray met with Alabama’s “tough on crime” attorney general Steve Marshall, who informed her that the state would not press charges. (It latersettleda civil suit for $250,000, never admitting wrongdoing.) Gadson, who faced more than 20 separate lawsuits alleging excessive force, was promoted. The state paid for his legal bills, as well as those of all other officers – part of the $51m spent by the state of Alabama in the past five years to defend officers from misconduct lawsuits.Together, the collective footage and Ray’s case demonstrate justhow little the state’s prisons have improvedsince the justice departmentsuedthe ADOC in 2020 over “systematic” violence and abuse. “It feels like a fever dream. It’s Orwellian,” said Kaufman. “This system that is called corrections, and then you start peeling back the layers and you realize how it’s anything but.” Every day during production, “there would be a new discovery of: ‘How is this possible? How is this happening at this volume, and no one really talks about it?’ It was like having an ice bucket poured on our heads, just constant astonishment.”Even more astonishing is Alabama’s solution. The film takes its name from Governor Kay Ivey’s response to the federal mandate for reform: “An Alabama problem deserves an Alabama solution,” a line that recalls the state’s long history of resisting federal mandates on civil rights. Montgomery, Alabama, served as the first capital of the Confederacy, which seceded rather than end chattel slavery during the American civil war; the state required federal intervention to enddebt peonagein the early 20th century, todesegregate the state’s schoolsin 1963 and to preventdiscriminatory voting practicesin the 1960s. In several interviews, state officials reject the US justice department reform mandate as federal overreach. The Alabama Solution under Ivey was to constructthreenew prisonsby diverting$400min federal Covid-19 relief funds – 20% of the money for the state worst hit by the virus – as well as $100m from the state’s education budget. Meanwhile, parole ratesplummetedby 72%, with the overwhelming number of parole requests denied.View image in fullscreenA still from The Alabama Solution.Photograph: HBOThat solution comes packaged in “tough on crime” rhetoric and a belief, at least as expressed by Marshall and others, that criminality is a fixed, immutable quality rather than a confluence of circumstances. The hardline lack of access to state prisons – all ADOC facilities can refuse or restrict all visits, even from federal monitors, under the guise of “security” – allows that convenient fiction of incarcerated people, justly punished, to persist. “One of the problems is that a lot of people who speak about prisons in Alabama have not visited the prisons,” said Jarecki. “And if you ask them, they’ll give you a blurry answer: ‘Oh, yes, of course I visited the prisons.’ What that often means is: ‘Three years ago, when the DoJ sued us, we did a tour of one of the prisons where they showed us about 3% of it, so I’ve been.’”“Maybe that’s a little hopeful, that when people see the film, even legislators and people in power in Alabama, they will have to confront the reality of what’s there,” he added. “I think a lot of these people do have a conscience, and it’s just been easier for them to say ‘tough on crime, and therefore I don’t care what happens to these people’, or to make it about retribution.”But it is indisputable that the state benefits financially from continued mass incarceration without oversight. The Alabama Solution details the shocking scope and hypocrisy of the ADOC’s labor program, a forced-labor system that essentially operates as a modern-day mutation of chattel slavery,providing $450min goods and services to the state each year for virtually no pay. Under the program, incarcerated laborers, overwhelmingly Black Alabamians deemed unfit for society, make $2 a day – the same daily wage rate set by Alabama for incarcerated labor in 1927, at the height of Jim Crow – to work upwards of 12 hours for private companies or public sites including the state capitol, the governor’s mansion, the Alabama supreme court and local government entities and youth services. As one incarcerated man puts it in the film: “They trust me to work in the community, but they don’t trust me to give me parole to get out and go home to my family.” It plays over footage of a forced laborer warmly greeting a child while working at an Alabama zoo.Such laborers are statistically less likely to be paroled than those who are not, even those considered a higher security. “That gives you an idea of how valuable this free labor is to Alabama, and how important it is for them to keep people locked up,” said Jarecki. “There’s a financial incentive to keep people locked up for longer than many states and certainly longer than one would imagine for the kinds of things they were convicted of.” One film participant, a Black man, was given 15 years at a maximum-security prison for breaking and entering an unoccupied building.The Alabama Solution culminates in an incredible feat of organizing: astate-wide prisoners’ strikedemanding better conditions in October 2022, led by Council and Melvin Ray, which demonstrated both the state’s reliance on forced labor and the lengths to which it would go to keep it. (Ivey deemed their demands “unreasonable”.) Contraband cell phone footage shows how ADOC broke the strike in 11 days by starving prisoners en masse, choking out Council, sending soldiers to intimidate and beat others and cutting off contact from strike leaders.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Kaufman and Andrew Jarecki.Photograph: Dave Allocca/Starpix/ShutterstockThe strike may have failed, but the message was clear, and beyond the state of Alabama. Council ends the film with a call to action: “The things that are taking place in Alabama are taking place inyourstate and in your name.” And while the Alabama Solution may be specific to the state, “all of the conditions that allowed for Alabama to deteriorate into the humanitarian crisis it is today exist in every state across the country – secrecy, limited accountability”, said Kaufman. “A lot of states are already experiencing what Alabama is, and the only difference is we just can’t see it. The reason our film focuses on Alabama is that there was an opening. There was a chance to actually be able to see it.”From thedocumented abusesat New York’s Rikers Island, to California’sdeployment of 1,100 incarcerated firefightersto the frontlines of the LA fires forless than minimum wage, “you see similar things in most states in the union”, said Jarecki, referring to even supposed liberal bastions. “You just don’t know about it because they’re treated in secret.”“This isn’t just Alabama,” said Kaufman. “We’re witnessing a new wave of ‘tough on crime’ policy and rhetoric, and a punitive approach to everything.” The second Trump administration’s approach to immigration “enforcement” looks a lot like ADOC’s vision of crime and punishment –erosionofdueprocess, prisons as“black holes”where people disappear,punitive tactics,blatant non-compliance with federal law,endless obfuscation.The cruelty is the point.“We hope that people will see this as an urgent call to reconsider how we approach these things, and also a reminder of what’s at stake,” said Kaufman. “The Alabama solution in Alabama could become – I mean, in many cases, it already is the American solution.”The Alabama Solution is now available onHBOMax in the US and elsewhere at a future dateExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAlabamaUS prisonsHBOfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gel polish, dip powder, acrylic overlays … whatever the method, the demand for durable, chip-resistant, manicured nails is so strong that salons nowoften outnumber high street bank branchesin the UK.But behind the glossy finish lies a more complicated story. Last month, the European Unionbanned TPO– an ingredient that helps gel polish to harden under UV light – after animal studies suggested it could harm fertility or a developing foetus. The UK is expected to follow next year. It’s not the first safety red flag: Hema, another common ingredient, was restricted in DIY nail kits in 2021 after a surge in cases of allergic contact dermatitis, a painful skin condition marked by redness, blistering and swelling. So how safe is a gel manicure? And what can you do to protect yourself?Just a glance at the social media hashtag #gelallergy will show what an allergic reaction to Hema looks like. “People describe a broad range of symptoms: rashes, pain, blisters, bleeding, itching, changes in sensation in their fingertips,” says Dr Shari Lipner, a dermatologist nail specialist at New York-Presbyterian hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, US. She recentlyanalysed 214 TikTok videosabout gel allergies.The consequences of developing an allergy to these chemicals – known as acrylates – are not necessarily confined to nail products, Lipner says: “Once someone develops an allergy to one acrylate, our immune system often recognises related chemicals, and cross-reactions are common. You could have issues with dental fillings, medical adhesives, joint replacements, insulin pumps or lenses for cataract surgery. You could also react to other cosmetic things. If you want to get false eyelashes or hair extensions, those could also contain acrylates. So it becomes a much bigger problem.”View image in fullscreenNail salon workers are also exposed to the risks of the chemicals used in polishes.Photograph: Posed by models; Oksana Hranovska/Getty ImagesTrimethylbenzoyl diphenylphosphine oxide (TPO) is a different type of chemical used in some gel nail polishes as a “photoinitiator”, triggering the UV curing process. If TPO does pose a risk, it is the nail salon workers, exposed to it and other photoinitiators day in and day out, who are likely to be the most vulnerable. “While photoinitiators are essential in UV-curable products, there is growing evidence of their potential toxicity,” says Prof Runzeng Liu of Shandong University, China.His research in Chinese salons foundphotoinitiator levels in dustwere about 100 times higher than in typical indoor environments, andchemicals on technicians’ handsroughly 200 times higher than in the general population. Liu is also concerned about “cocktail effects” from simultaneous exposure to multiple photoinitiators, which may be riskier than any single chemical alone.Millions of packets are delivered daily to personal addresses. Customs simply cannot control everything that is coming inWhether the TPO ban is strictly necessary remains debated. “The EU’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety reversed its opinion on TPO, not because of direct evidence of harm in humans, as exposure from nail products is minimal, but because animal studies showed reproductive toxicity at high doses,” says Dr Kelly Dobos, a cosmetic chemist at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, US. She notes that toxic effects in animals occurred only at high oral doses, which is not representative of normal use.The TPO ban does not outlaw gel manicures, only polishes containing TPO, and safer alternatives are available. “It doesn’t mean people need to stop enjoying their nail services. Instead, it’s a good reminder to find salons that follow best practices including proper curing, good ventilation and trained professionals,” says Dobos.All the same, there’s the question of enforcement. Scientists at Vito, an independent research organisation in Flanders, Belgium, have developed a test to detect both TPO and Hema, and are increasingly being contacted by companies supplying nail polishes and other products to salons, eager to check whether their imported materials contain TPO. “Especially for raw materials bought outside Europe – which is the majority – the label does not always match the actual contents,” says Jan Jordens, a senior researcher at Vito.View image in fullscreenThe removal of gels can strip away the nails’ keratin layers.Photograph: Kerkez/Getty ImagesIn one case, Jordens’ team found that TPO was deliberately left off the ingredients list when a manufacturer requested a TPO-free material, though testing proved it was still present. In another, a product was labelled as containing TPO, but the supplier insisted it was TPO-free. Testing confirmed the label was wrong.These inconsistencies could make it hard for European manufacturers and distributors to comply with the TPO ban – even though many are making genuine efforts to do so, says Jordens. He suspects the same problem affects DIY gel nail kits sold online. “It is even harder to control this small packet market, because millions of packets are delivered daily to personal addresses, and customs simply cannot control everything that is coming in.”The EU and UK’s ban on the sale of Hema-containing nail products outside professional nail salons in 2021 does not seem to have resulted in a drop in allergic reactions. Arecent auditby the European Environmental Contact Dermatitis Research Group found that, while only 1-2% of the general population has allergic contact dermatitis severe enough to warrant medical attention, Hema now accounts for roughly 2% of these cases – up from 0.9% in 2016.And still, millions of people enjoy regular manicures without incident. For most of them, the main downside of a persistent salon habit is simply weak or damaged natural nails.Removal of gels and acrylics gradually strips away the nails’ keratin layers – protein fibres that give nails their shape and strength and help to protect our fingers from damage and infection. So does filing their surface to help new nails stick.“Over the long term, if you’re taking away that thickness and telling the body they don’t need to be as thick, it’s not going to ramp up protein production and restore the thickness of the nails,” says Adam Taylor, a professor of anatomy at Lancaster University. “You’re going to end up with brittle, unsightly nails that are not what you were going for in the short term.”Leaving false nails – which includes gels – on for too long also risks trapping moisture beneath them, creating a breeding ground for fungus or bacteria, includingPseudomonas aeruginosa– a bacterium that causes green nail syndrome or “greenies”, characterised by unsightly nail discoloration.While nail infections are usually relatively minor, they can develop into something more serious, particularly if your immune system is weakened or if you have other conditions such as diabetes. “Any indication of redness, tenderness, swelling, pain in and around the bottom of the nail is a big red flag to get your artificial nails taken off and consult a doctor,” says Taylor.If you’re telling the body that nails don’t need to be as thick, it’s not going to ramp up protein productionSo what can you do to reduce these risks? Apart from goingau naturel, theAmerican Academy of Dermatology Associationrecommends gels that soak off with acetate rather than hard gels or acrylics that need filing off. They can still leave nails brittle or peeling, but because they flex, your own nails are less likely to crack.It also suggests choosing salons that use LED lamps rather than traditional UV ones – they harden polish faster and give off lower doses of UV radiation, reducing the risk of skin cancer.“If you’re putting your hands under UV light, I’d advocate wearing cotton gloves with the fingertips cut off to protect from UV, or at least wear sunscreen – factor 30 or higher,” says Taylor.Skip cutting your cuticles, which act as a natural barrier against fungi and bacteria. Also consider giving your nails breaks between treatments to allow them to recover.Lipner advises caution rather than complete avoidance, although she does avoid gels and acrylics herself, saying she’s “risk averse”. “I don’t think people need to skip nail polish entirely, but both salon and at-home kits carry some risks, so I advise my patients to consider them with their eyes wide open.”Pick a salon where the technicians are wearing gloves, and you can see their training certificates, Lipner suggests. “You should also be asking some important questions: are your technicians trained in doing gel nails? Are your lamps new? Are they maintained?”At home, follow instructions carefully, avoid skin contact, and watch out for adverse reactions: “If there’s redness, itching or peeling around the nails, that’s a red flag,” says Lipner.As we talk over a video call, I glimpse a flash of red, perfectly shaped nails. She laughs: “It’s just regular nail polish.” But it serves as a quiet reminder: there are safer alternatives.Explore more on these topicsNail varnishBeautySkincarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mindblowing, incredible sex where I discovered that I was into being demeaned and flogged. The depth of trust required made me feel really safe, turned on and even cared for. Things ended with that friend when she moved abroad. I was still grieving the loss when I matched with Viv on Tinder.The sex is gentle and affectionate with her. At the start, I questioned whether that was enough after the intense experience I’d just come out of. After four months, I tried to end things.Two days later, I realised I’d made a mistake. What I have with Viv is like nothing I’d experienced before. I’d been married for 10 years to a woman who gaslit me and controlled me financially. But Viv was kind and generous, and for the first time, that was reciprocal. She also has the softest skin and gorgeous curves. My friend even said to me: “What are you doing? Viv loves you. You’re being really arrogant.”I’m learning that mindblowing sex that goes on all afternoon isn’t the only type. It doesn’t have to be athletic, lustful and kinkyI can fall into the trap of being arrogant – feeling as if I have lots to teach after my last experience, but not much to learn. That arrogance was something I had to check myself on. I’m learning that mindblowing sex that goes on all afternoon isn’t the only type – it doesn’t have to be athletic, lustful and kinky to be wonderful. It can be softer and more loving, and I can also learn from Viv. She’s shown me generosity in bed, which I’ve never had before. On the surface, we’re very different, but underneath, we both want to be loved.We did go to a sex shop and buy a flogger, but Viv feels too shy to use it. I don’t want to push her. I can imagine her going for it in the future – but it won’t be the end of the world if that doesn’t happen. I didn’t even know these things about myself until 18 months ago, so are they my needs or just a bonus? For now, having a loving environment is much more important to me.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

Even the thought of having sex with him gets me arousedMarty is the third person I’ve had sex with. The first was my ex-husband, who I’d been with for 25 years. I was completely uninterested in sex for 15 of those years, and developed vaginismus – sex became too uncomfortable and I would close up. I felt shame around sex, probably because that youthful awkwardness never went away with my husband, but there is none with Marty. Feeling aroused again for the first time after so long was exciting. I felt normal and healthy; life felt instantly better.My initial impression of Marty was that he was someone I would like to be friends with. On the surface, we look like an odd pairing – he’s bohemian, whereas I’m more materialistic. My marriage ending was heartbreaking – I found out my husband had been cheating on me, so part of me wanted to sabotage things with Marty out of fear. But when he ended it, I was devastated.With my husband, it felt like we were doing it wrong. With Marty it’s more about the journey than the destinationThis is how we do it: ‘Over 30 years, our spark has dimmed in difficult times, but we’ve always got it back’Read moreMarty has brought sex back into my life. Even the thought of having sex with him gets me aroused. He’s a lot more experienced, and initially the idea of him with someone else made me feel jealous, but now I find his past fascinating. I worried that Marty’s kinks would mean we aren’t compatible. But I’m learning to relax and be playful with it. When he asks me to spank him and tell him he’s worthless, I giggle. I have a problem with the worthless part, so I tell him he’s naughty instead.With my husband, it felt as if we were doing it wrong, whereas sex with Marty is more about the journey than the destination, and we’re more open about what we want. Marty comes over on weekends and one evening in the week, which I always look forward to. I used to think that for a relationship to be real, you have to live together, but I’m still getting used to being on my own, and learning how to be alone rather than lonely. And this way, we both have our own space, and I get to enjoy the anticipation.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When to upgrade – and when to hold offDon’t splash out just yet! Your existing laptop may have plenty left to giveFrom smash-proof cases to updates: how to make your smartphone last longerDarien Graham-SmithSun 12 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 03.02 EDTShareSo you want a new laptop. Of course you do. Everybody always does, except for perhaps during that short honeymoon period after you’ve just bought one. But the glamour wears off, technology marches on, and before you know it, a newer, younger, more powerful model is wandering into your thoughts.I’m not here to judge, but as a technology specialist I can share a few thoughts that might help you fight the urge to upgrade.Let’s start with the basics: the No 1 reason not to buy a new laptop is that you don’t need one. We’ve grown accustomed to living in an age where technology gets faster every time you turn around, but the jobs we’re actually doing on our laptops are evolving at a much more timid pace. Many of us spend 99% of our computing time using just a handful of apps – a web browser, a conferencing app, a word processor, and possibly a spreadsheet or presentation app.If you’re looking for a new laptop because you’re having to do all of the above on a lousy screen, or with a clunky keyboard, then you might have a point – we’ll come to that later on. But if your head is being turned by faster processors and biggerSSDs, hold fire: do you really think you’ll get your reports written any faster because you’re typing them on a Core Ultra 5 processor rather than an old i3? Worry about your own productivity before scapegoating the poor computer.Outdated connectors aren’t an excuse either. Your laptop may not have the latest USB ports or wifi hardware, but the wonderful thing about modern standards is that they’re stupendously backward- and forward-compatible. You don’t need a new laptop to pair with your sparkly new wifi 7 router – the wifi 5 card in your current one will work just fine (although a Windows update will still take ages). And any USB peripheral can be plugged into any USB port, dating all the way back to 1996 – as long as you have the right cable or adaptor.Save money – and the environmentView image in fullscreenLaptops feature a lot of environmentally costly materials.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesLet’s also acknowledge that not buying a new laptop saves you money. A grand or more for a high-spec model is a lot to spend, but if you tell yourself it’s a long-term investment it somehow feels justifiable. But this doesn’t mean the money can’t be better spent elsewhere.If you’re looking at replacing your laptop because there’s something wrong with it, you might be able to save money by getting it repaired. Sadly it’s not always feasible, largely thanks to the trend towards factory-sealed devices and soldered-in components, but do look into it, as a busted laptop can sometimes be restored to a quasi-pristine state for a third of the price of buying a new one.Another reason you might hesitate to decommission your existing laptop is that it takes a lot of environmentally costly materials to build a new one, and there’s a further ecological cost in safely disposing of your old one.Finally, once you do plonk a shiny new laptop down on your desk, you will probably spend the following days and weeks hunting down all the different bits of software and drivers that you need to reinstall, and working through endless settings and preferences to get the thing working the way you like – which is to say, the way you already had your old one working.How to get the best out of yourexisting laptopView image in fullscreenHardware upgrades can give your laptop a new lease of life.Photograph: baona/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you do decide to give your laptop another chance, there are things you can do to make your working relationship more harmonious. If you’re irritated by endless pop-ups and performance jitters, it’s always a good idea to audit the items that open on startup and turn off any that don’t seem necessary. Windows works perfectly well without any third-party software firing up automatically at startup. All that extra stuff added in there by pushy apps and overzealous laptop manufacturers – that can all go, and your life will be better for it. Even if you’re on a Mac, it never hurts to check your login items and see what you can do without.The same goes for browser extensions, which tend to accrete to the point where every page you open is covered in smart content and analytical toolbars. As well as getting in your way, each one consumes resources and contributes to that sense of general malaise that afflicts laptops of a certain age. Ditch ’em. If you’re using Chrome, enter chrome://extensions into the address bar and smash Remove on anything that isn’t earning its keep; in Microsoft Edge, the address is – guess what? – edge://extensions. On Safari, open the Settings window, and select Extensions to view and manage your plug-ins.And while you’re having a clearout, I recommend spring cleaning your storage too. There are lots of neat free tools that will perform a wholesale audit of your hard disk and show you exactly what’s taking up the space. My personal favourites are WinDirStat on Windows and Disk Inventory X on the Mac; whichever you pick, I’ll bet you’ll be shocked by the amount of space you’re wasting on old downloads and unneeded apps. Purging them probably won’t make your computer run any faster, but if you were thinking of buying a new laptop just because this one was nearly full, that urge may now be quelled.Alternatively, you could give your laptop a new lease of life by treating it to a hardware upgrade or two. As with repairs, this isn’t always possible, but it’s worth exploring whether you can add extra memory, extend the storage or replace the battery. Expanding the RAM, in particular, can make a remarkable difference to the overall feel of a computer. The latest operating systems and applications tend to high-handedly assume that you have at least 8GB of RAM and prefer twice that much; disappoint them and they may embark upon a go-slow in protest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There’s no need to muck about with dozens of floppy disks as in days of yore: you can now download and reinstall the OS files over the internet, on Windows and macOS. This makes it a tantalisingly easy way to restore the spring to a computer’s step, but bear in mind that the process will put your computer back into the same naive, unpersonalised state as a new laptop. And be very certain you’ve backed up all your personal files before you head down this path – the reinstaller may offer to keep your documents and settings, but if anything does get lost, that’s squarely on the head of the genius who decided to reformat their own hard drive.While I’m on this tack, don’t underestimate the power of physical cleaning. Much of the thrill of opening up a brand-new laptop is to do with the perfectly unsmudged screen, and the spotless, grease-free keys that respond precisely to your touch without the slightest hint of biscuit crumb. I recommend you turn off your laptop, grab a non-abrasive cloth (ideally microfibre if you have one) and give it a proper wipe down, inside and out. Then, turn it upside down and attack the keyboard with a handheld vacuum, giving the keys a good scrub with the brush, to dislodge any dust or morsels from around the edges. When you turn the thing the right way up, it’ll be like someone’s handed you a new computer.Maybe you do need a new one after all: signs to upgrade your laptopView image in fullscreenSometimes buying a new laptop is unavoidable.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesAll the above notwithstanding, there are some situations where a new laptop is the right answer. As I’ve intimated, repairs and upgrades aren’t always possible, so if you’ve shattered the screen, the only solution might be to take a trip to the computer shop.A particularly irritating scenario is when the hardware is still working fine, but is too old to support the latest operating system and security patches. This tends to happen to Apple systems after about a decade, and it’s about to hit many millions of PCs on 14 October, whenMicrosoft cuts off support for Windows 10. Computers that meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 can upgrade for free, but the rest will be stuck out in the cold.If your computer is among that unhappy cohort – and for whatever reason you’re not in a position to install a non-Windows OS – then a new laptop is a must. While it’s possible to keep running an unsupported operating system, I can’t in all conscience recommend you do that. Without regular security patches coming down from the mother ship, you’d be a sitting duck for future hacks and ransomware attacks.This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to bin your existing laptop. You can install a free Linux operating system on almost anything, and use that for everyday tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents and spreadsheets in LibreOffice, and even making video calls.Another option is Google’s ChromeOS Flex platform, a free version of the Chromebook operating system that you can install on a wide range of laptops. Whether you use it yourself or pass it off to a friend or family member, you’ll have done your bit to extend the life of that particular device, and to defer the environmental cost of decommissioning it.Finally, let’s not pretend that there isn’t a social aspect to all of this. The whole point of a portable computer is that you can take it out and about with you, where people can see it. Rocking up in your local coffee shop with a David Cameron-era laptop makes a certain statement, and not necessarily a bad one: it shows you’re a loyal, practical sort of person, unswayed by the temptations of consumerism.For more, read the Filter’s guide tohow to make your smartphone last longerDarien Graham-Smith has been a professional IT journalist for more than 20 years, covering brands from Amazon to Zyxel forvarious magazines, newspapers and websites.

But is it just revolting?Grace DentSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 13.40 EDTSharePunk Royale, from Stockholm, has landed in London promising, or rather threatening, that their rowdy, immersive, 20-course fine-dining experience will destroy all puny British perceptions of posh food. It’s a huge claim from these Swedish punks. Indeed, nearly 50 years after the UK invented punk, with theSex Pistols effing and jeffing on live TVand provoking a national meltdown, here we have some folk with mullets and Roxette CDs slopping “bumps” of caviar on to my hand shortly after beckoning me into a shoddily decorated, fusty-smelling dining room in Mayfair. It’s all a bit student house and needs a good visit from Mr Sheen. That bump, one supposes, is a playful twist on taking cocaine at a grotty afterparty. However, none of the jokes at Punk Royale is really playful: rather, they’re mostly big, clumsy sledgehammer thwacks. Such as when, for example, they turn off the lights, serve some substandard remoulade, and instruct you to lick it off the plate, while blastingKhia’s My Neck, My Backagain and again as your soul dies. I’ve heard more whimsical humour at aRoy Chubby Browngig.That caviar bump, by the way, came with a shot of tomato water that complemented it nicely. All the drinks afterwards on the non-alcoholic wine flight, however, were thick, soupy, funky and vegetal.View image in fullscreen‘Largely inedible’: guinea fowl with blackberry swede puree at Punk Royale, London W1.Punk Royale’s aversion to crockery and cutlery is perhaps its most subversive idea. Over 20 breakneck courses, we were served many items on the lids of plastic takeaway boxes (including a cheesy puff with a piped sauce) and in syringes. In one case, we were slung cheap surgical gloves and a tin of something salmony, and told to eat it with our hands. Knives and forks appeared around course 17 to tackle some largely inedible guinea fowl with what Punk Royale called “tasty paste”. I have no idea what was in it.We sat awaiting the actual show: the singing, the dancing, the debauchery; eventually, someone brought a large stainless-steel serving spoon, tapped me on the shoulder and shoved mystery slop into my mouth. It turned out to be lobster, truffle and kohlrabi. There was foie gras on a smiley blini with a syringe of raisin juice, which was basically Shloer. Nothing tasted of much. I was virtually force-fed and it all arrived at speed – every two minutes, another dish was banged down. At the end, they served a cube of what could have beenHartley’s jelly.View image in fullscreen‘Nothing tasted of much’: Punk Royale’s foie gras blini with sweet wine.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianThe coffee semifreddo was my favourite part – a moment of refuge – though maybe I was just in shock and this was the equivalent of some sweet tea. This cooking isn’t delicate, or worth the £500 for two with a non-alcoholic drink pairing. Of course, some might say it’s not about the food, it’s about the vibe. But at £500 it really should be about the food, too, not just painting oysters green and serving unseasoned tofu nuggets with damp breadcrumbs on a box lid and thinking you’re Escoffier in Vivienne Westwood tartan pants.The trendification of UK dining, where diners are bankrupted only to be told that it was never about the cooking, is wearisome. A problem for these punks is that London already has a plethora of immersive dining options; should you wish to eat bad chicken in W1 and be harassed by jobbing actors impersonating Basil Fawlty, Poirot or an Elizabethan wench, we are already well catered to.View image in fullscreen‘Some might say it’s not about the food … though at £500 for two it really should be’: Punk Royale’s oyster in green curry apple granita.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianAs for truly shocking immersive theatre, the likes ofYou Me Bum Bum Train,Punchdrunk,Secret Cinemaand a thousand other arty experiences have set a high, surreal, big-budget bar. Casts of hundreds, hidden rooms, multiple storylines, shock celebrity appearances; rather magically, there’s no limit to the vigour with which these interactive experiences set out truly to jar the audience.Meanwhile, Punk Royale, which I’m guessing is aimed at cash-rich, experience-hungry twentysomethings, really only does one rankling thing, and that’s taking diners’ phones and locking them in a box for safekeeping.

Season to suit your own tastes, and enjoy with a coffee or teaFelicity CloakeSun 12 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareThere are few joys quite like a sticky bun. As soft and sweet as an edible pillow, they’re a lovely thing to sink into with a cup of coffee and, though they look impressive, they’re also unexpectedly easy to make at home. This Scandinavian version is cinnamon flavoured, but feel free to change the seasoning to suit your palate.Prep30 minRest1 hr+Cook25 minMakes71 tsp ground cardamom seeds(from about 25 pods; see step 1)300ml whole milk50g butter, roughly cubed425g plain flour60g caster sugar¼ tsp fine salt7g fast-action/instant yeast1 eggOil, for greasingFor the filling75g butter, softened50g dark brown sugar2 tsp cinnamon½ tsp saltTo finish1 egg, lightly beatenDemerara or granulated sugar1 A note on the cardamomGround cardamom is fairly easy to find these days, but if you don’t mind a bit of fiddly work, you should get a teaspoon or so of powder from the ground seeds of about 25 pods. Alternatively, for a milder flavour, use the seeds whole and strain them out of the milk later.2 Infuse the milkView image in fullscreenPut the milk in a small pan on a medium-low heat, add the cardamom and bring to a gentle simmer, keeping it just below the boil (keep an eye on it, because milk can catch and burn quickly). Take off the hob, stir in the butter, and leave to infuse and cool to blood temperature; if the mixture is too hot, it’ll kill the yeast.3 Make a start on the doughView image in fullscreenMix the flour, caster sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast (if you prefer fresh yeast, you’ll need 21g, or 10g of active dry yeast, both of which will require reactivating before use). It’s always worth checking the best-before date on yeast, because its potency deteriorates with time. Old yeast = greasy cinnamon flatbreads.4 Finish the doughBeat the egg lightly. Once the milk has cooled to warm, make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients, tip in the beaten egg and stir in to combine. Add or strain in the milk, then stir to make a soft dough that comes away easily from the sides of the bowl.5 Knead the doughLightly grease a work surface (this is to avoid adding more flour to the dough) and tip the dough on to it. Knead vigorously for about eight minutes; at first, it will be very soft, but persevere and keep kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic (a dough scraper will be useful here). Alternatively, work it in a food mixer on a medium-low speed for about five minutes.6 Prove the doughView image in fullscreenWipe out the bowl, oil it lightly, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a tea towel or similar, and put somewhere draught-free and not too chilly for about 30 minutes, until well risen. (A cold oven, with a bowl of hot water in the base, is a good option if there’s no obvious draught-free spot in your place.)7 Now for the fillingView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, beat all the filling ingredients until soft and easily spreadable; feel free to replace the cinnamon with another flavouring or spice, such as vanilla seeds, grated citrus zest, cocoa powder, grated nutmeg, etc. Grease a deep, 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin.8 Fill and shape the doughView image in fullscreenRoll out the dough on the same greased surface to a roughly 35cm x 25cm rectangle. Smear the filling all across its surface (your hands are the best tools for this), then, starting from one of the long edges, roll up the dough tightly, like a swiss roll.View image in fullscreenRotate so the seam is at the bottom, then cut into seven equal slices.9 Prove, bake, cool and tuck inArrange the slices in the greased tin, spacing them out evenly, with the smallest in the middle, then cover and leave to prove for about 30 minutes, until the dough springs back when prodded gently.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Paint the buns with the beaten egg, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown.View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsBakingFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodBreakfastScandinavian food and drinkBreadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s one thing to use a witty phrase – another thing entirely to build a whole fake persona …Alexandra JonesSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 15.16 EDTShareStanding outside the pub, 36-year-old business owner Rachel took a final tug on her vape and steeled herself to meet the man she’d spent the last three weeks opening up to. They’d matched on the dating app Hinge and built a rapport that quickly became something deeper. “From the beginning he was asking very open-ended questions, and that felt refreshing,” says Rachel. One early message from her match read: “I’ve been reading a bit about attachment styles lately, it’s helped me to understand myself better – and the type of partner I should be looking for. Have you ever looked at yours? Do you know your attachment style?” “It was like he was genuinely trying to get to know me on a deeper level. The questions felt a lot more thoughtful than the usual, ‘How’s your day going?’” she says.Soon, Rachel and her match were speaking daily, their conversations running the gamut from the ridiculous (favourite memes, ketchup v mayonnaise) to the sublime (expectations in love, childhood traumas). Often they’d have late-night exchanges that left her staring at her phone long after she should have been asleep. “They were like things that you read in self-help books – really personal conversations about who we are and what we want for our lives,” she says.Which is why the man who greeted her inside the pub – polite, pleasant but oddly flat – felt like a stranger. Gone was the quickfire wit and playful rhythm she’d come to expect from their exchanges. Over pints he stumbled through small talk, checked his phone a little too often, and seemed to wilt under the pressure of her questions. “I felt like I was sitting opposite someone I’d never even spoken to,” she says. “I tried to have the same sort of conversation as we’d been having online, but it was like, ‘Knock, knock, is anyone home?’ – like he knew basically nothing about me. That’s when I suspected he’d been using AI.”Rachel gave her date the benefit of the doubt. “I thought maybe he was nervous,” she says. But she’d been “Chatfished” before, so when the gap between his real and digital selves failed to close on their second date, she called it off. “I’d already been ChatGPT-ed into bed at least once. I didn’t want it to happen again.”Where once daters were duped by soft-focus photos and borrowed chat-up lines, now they’re seduced by ChatGPT-polished banter and AI-generated charm.Datingapp fatigue is nothing new; for all its promise of convenience and unlimited choices, the gamified nature of finding love in the app age has, over the years, left many users feeling disposable. And, as AI becomes an ever more present feature of modern life – embedded into everything from healthcare systems to online grocery shopping – it’s adding yet another layer of digital artifice to the search for love.In a landscape where text-based communication plays an outsized role in the search for love, it’s perhaps understandable that some of us reach for AI’s helping hand – not everyone gives good text. Some Chatfishers, though, go to greater extremes, outsourcing entire conversations to ChatGPT, leaving their match in a dystopian hall of mirrors: believing they’re building a genuine connection with another human being when in reality they’re opening up to an algorithm trained to reflect their desires back to them.The majority of Chatfishers say they would never dream of letting AI do all of their talking. Most are like 38-year-old Londoner Nick, who sees it as a tool to help foster stronger connections with app matches. He works in tech and lives with his girlfriend; they’re in an open relationship and both date other people casually. He sometimes uses ChatGPT in his conversations on the dating appsFeeldand Bumble. “If I’m using a dating app,” he says, “I want to start a conversation that feels meaningful from the beginning so I can hook the other person in – but also I don’t want to spend too much time on it. Equally, while I want it to be ‘meaningful’, I don’t necessarily want to get super heavy and emotional straight away – it feels like quite a balancing act.” ChatGPT, he says, helps him tread that fine line: offering enough charm to spark a connection, without the investment of time or emotional labour that might otherwise feel wasted if the match fizzles out after a handful of messages.I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questionsFor Nick, ChatGPT isn’t helpful “if I have a good connection with someone and the conversation is flowing – because what’s the point in using it then?” If, on the other hand, he’s matched with a person “and things are stalling, maybe the conversation has gotten a bit boring but the person is really hot or intriguing, then I might say, ‘Please find a good, engaging, funny answer to this to keep the conversation going.’” He never copies entire answers – “ChatGPT formulates things in a very obvious way,” he says – but he takes inspiration, or uses certain lines and phrases that sound most like him. Still, he admits there’s a subtle slippage when you start filtering yourself through a bot. “It might have generated some things I wouldn’t say or aren’t 100% me, but I went with them anyway. So, in that respect it probably has influenced what someone thinks about me,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s dishonest. I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questions.”For the past three months, 28-year-old social worker Holly from Kent has been navigating a “situationship” with a co-worker. Though they knew each other from the office, they initially started speaking via LinkedIn. Now, they see each other sporadically – “I wouldn’t call them dates,” Holly deadpans – but speak often via WhatsApp. “I mainly use AI because I tend to write really long messages,” she says, “so I’ll put them into ChatGPT and say, ‘Please make this softer and more clear’, or, ‘I need to sound harsher here so he understands I’m upset.’” She doesn’t feel that it’s misleading – “I’m not trying to manipulate anyone,” she says.Her story perhaps speaks to the fact that relationship dynamics have shifted in recent years. According to a2024 YouGov poll, for instance, around half of Americans aged 18-34 reported having been, like Holly, in a situationship (a term it defines as “a romantic connection that exists in a gray area, neither strictly platonic nor officially a committed relationship”). At the same time, few of us have developed the communication skills to navigate the emotional grey areas thrown up by less stable relationship boundaries. For Holly, having her messages reshaped by AI means she can strike the right balance between honesty and tact: “Sometimes it helps me sound kinder when I’m angry.” Still, she says she would never tell her situationship that she uses AI to help her message him – “and I guess maybe he sees me as less reactive and more understanding because of how my messages are.”As 32-year-old Rich points out, though, “it’s not like using ChatGPT guarantees success”. When he met someone in a bar one Friday night and swapped social media handles, he asked AI what his next move should be. ChatGPT discerned that sending an initial message on Monday midmorning would set the right pace. “Then it gave me some options for what the message could be,” says Rich. “Keep it light, warm, and low-stakes so it reads as genuine interest without urgency,” the bot advised. “Something like: Hey Sarah, still laughing about [tiny shared moment/reference if you’ve got one] – good to meet you!” Rich went back and forth with ChatGPT until he felt they’d hit upon exactly the right message (“Hey Sarah, it was lovely to meet you”) but sadly she never replied, he says. “It’s been two weeks now.”When it’s obvious, the polish of ChatGPT can have the opposite effect to the intended. “I lose interest quickly,” says 35-year-old Nina, who works as an editor for a Serbian language website in Manchester. She was recently on the receiving end of an AI-generated opening line: “Your smile is effortlessly captivating”. “No one talks like that,” she says. She didn’t bother replying. She’s been single for three years and uses Hinge and Bumble. She has turned to AI herself to help improve her profiles: “It basically told me to sound more confident and positive,” she says. “I’ve also asked it for help with opening lines, especially when I didn’t know what to say. Once or twice I thought my matches were using it on me, too – their replies felt too polished, like they weren’t really listening. It’s helpful in some ways but it does make me wonder what’s real.”I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum goingJamil, 25, from Leicester, admits he’s a prolific Chatfisher but argues that AI is simply a workaround for what he sees as the coded jargon of modern dating. “Like, what do you mean ‘What’s my attachment style?’” he balks. “Every girl on the apps has this thing about ‘love languages’ – it’s just gibberish, but if you don’t talk about it, people are like, ‘Oh you’re a red flag.’”At first, he turned to ChatGPT in desperation. “It was just a quick thing,” he says. He works on an IT help desk and found himself trying to continue a conversation with a girl he wanted to impress while also swamped with work. “I asked ChatGPT what ‘avoidant style attachment’ meant because a girl was saying she’d been told this was her, and it explained, then added this prompt at the end like, ‘Do you want me to craft a reply?’ So I said yeah. I felt out of my depth and was also just really busy that day. I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum going.” The reply – “I think mine is ‘clingy but with snacks’, so maybe we’ll balance each other out” – proved effective. “She sent a few skull emojis, meaning she was dying laughing. I said I’d have to message her later because of work, and she replied asking if I wanted to meet – so yeah, it was, like, ‘Wow, this works.’”Francesca, 33, owns a digital marketing agency in Cardiff. Like Jamil, she explains that ChatGPT grants her access to a world of inferences and subtext that she’d otherwise find impossible to navigate. “As an autistic woman in an era where the only way to meet anyone is through dating apps, I have struggled immensely. I found understanding tone and ‘the rules’ impossible and so ChatGPT has been really useful,” she says. When she started using it in a dating context it was more as a digital sounding board – an impartial presence that could give her feedback on her profile and offer a debrief after a date.“I pasted all the Hinge prompts [the questions users fill in on their profile] into ChatGPT and said, ‘Knowing what you know of me, choose the best prompts and write a good answer,’” she says. The bot replied: “Based on everything I know about you – creative, self-aware, emotionally intelligent … I’d recommend choosing one of the following Hinge prompts ….”She didn’t copy them exactly, Francesca says, but it gave her a lot of inspiration. Regardless, it still felt like her because the bot was taking what it knew about her from their daily exchanges – “AI is integrated into many parts of my business,” she says – and compressing it into the concise, playful language appropriate for a dating app. “It wasn’t writing me a new personality.”Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me againIt wasn’t until she’d matched with a man whom she found difficult to read that she began to deploy ChatGPT for messaging. “Our messages before we met had been really good [without any help from AI] but in person, he wasn’t very flirty or forward and didn’t try to kiss me at the end of our first date. I thought either he didn’t really fancy me or he was just trying to be respectful,” she says. She took screenshots of their last few exchanges, fed the messages and a short account of the date – a blustery walk around a lake – into ChatGPT, and asked it to read the room for her. The reply, helpfully clinical, suggested he was probably being respectful rather than uninterested, and recommended a light, open-ended follow-up. She sent a version of the suggested message, he replied enthusiastically, and they arranged a second date. “I was like, ‘Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me again.’”After that she found herself checking with the bot between every message, and requesting five variations before choosing the one that sounded most like her. “Over the course of a week, I realised I was relying on it quite a lot,” she says. “And I was like, you know what, that’s fine – why not outsource my love life to ChatGPT?”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.’Photograph: Getty Images/ iStockphotoBy the time they’d been on their third date, though, “I was using ChatGPT for our entire communication,” says Francesca. “I wasn’t even replying any more – he was basically just dating ChatGPT.” In person, their dates still lacked spark. “I was very aware that I’d taken it too far but I felt like I was in too deep by that point. I didn’t know how to get out of it, I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On Discord, a chat platform popular with gamers and tech communities, he came across channels dedicated to AI where other single men were exchanging tips about how to prompt ChatGPT to generate effective dating messages. “So, for instance, someone said that if you start a chat with a girl by asking her a list of questions – favourite film, dream holiday, that kind of thing – then paste her answers into ChatGPT, it would craft replies that would make you sound like her perfect match.” It proved effective. “It got me a lot more dates than I was getting before.”I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonestChat GPT is alarge language model(LMM), and the way LLMs work is by spotting patterns in language – the bot was picking up on keywords and themes in his match’s answers and weaving them into jokes, compliments or echoes of shared interests. Where Jamil might have left an awkward “nice” or “cool”, the bot would spin his match’s love of Bali into a playful, if somewhat unimaginative, line about coconut cocktails. It made him seem, at the very least, attentive. Jamil says he doesn’t feel he tricked anyone, he sees it more as hacking the apps themselves. “Dating apps put everyone at a disadvantage – you’re competing with hundreds of other people for attention, and half the time the chats die after two or three messages. If ChatGPT helps me stand out, why wouldn’t I use it?”Still, there was one date that pricked his conscience. He was doing the usual copy-and-paste, letting ChatGPT do the heavy lifting, “when a girl started talking about how she’d had a bereavement in her family”. ChatGPT navigated her grief with composure, synthesising the kind of sympathy that made Jamil seem like a model of emotional literacy. “It said something like, ‘I’m so sorry you’re going through this, it must be really difficult – thank you for trusting me with it,’” Jamil recalls. When he met the girl in real life, she noted how supportive he’d been in his messages. “I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonest. I didn’t tell her I’d used ChatGPT but I really tried to message her myself after that.”Recently he says he’s been caught out more often. “I’ll get people saying point blank, ‘This sounds bait’, even if I’m not just copy-and-pasting. More people are using AI now so they can spot it. I think the golden age of just letting it do all your messaging has passed.”Francesca had a wake-up call when a simple mistake nearly gave the game away. She pasted a wry message scripted by ChatGPT into her WhatsApp chat with a date, only to realise it ended with the telltale bot prompt: “Do you want me to make this punchier?” It wasn’t until his baffled reply – “What do you mean?” – that she realised her mistake. “I just thought, Oh God, I’ve been caught,” she says. She left his question unanswered for a few hours, until deciding the only option was to style it out by pretending that part was meant for a co-worker.“We went on one more date afterwards but I wasn’t sure if he was interested in me or not, so I just let it go. I thought, ‘I’m not up for having to analyse every interaction to see if he’s into me.’ And anyway, by that point, 90% of the messages he’d had off me had been by ChatGPT so it wasn’t like we’d properly gotten to know each other – he was basically dating the AI.”ForPaul C Brunson, dating guru and one of the experts currently guiding contestants on Married at First Sight UK, there’s a clear line between using AI as a tool and actively lying. “AI is amazing and it has the potential to help a lot of people – of course it depends on the degree to which someone is relying on it and the purpose behind why they’re using it. For many, it’s simply an enhancement that will allow them to connect with others more easily.” For him, the ultimate dating advice will always be to meet your matches as soon as possible. “It’s the best way to determine if you’re a viable match – you get to observe their behaviour and see if they seem trustworthy. You know, were they consistent in their word? Did they show up when they said they would? Did you feel like you were physically attracted to them? How was the communication when you were sitting opposite them? AI doesn’t impact any of that – AI is the tool to help facilitate the meetup.” Equally, though, he says that most of us know that “fully misrepresenting who you are – lying, basically,” has no place in modern dating. “And I think the vast majority of people would know when they’ve crossed that line.”The problem, as Rachel sees it, is that some people will cross that line deliberately. “Before the advent of AI, it was like, OK, maybe you don’t look like your pictures,” she says, “and that’s annoying but you’d quickly be caught out. Now though, people are putting forward entirely new personas.” She describes being on the receiving end of the kinds of techniques that Jamil uses – being drilled with questions, “like you’re answering an HR questionnaire”, then off the back of those answers “having conversations where it feels as if the other person has a tap on my phone because everything they say is so perfectly suited to me”.The worst, she says, was the time she matched with a handsome man. “It’s an awful generalisation – but I thought he would be all looks and no substance,” she admits. It was a pleasant surprise, then, when their digitalconversation flowed easily and she realised they had a lot in common. “I thought I’d found the perfect man. At one point, I talked about how much I loved going on walks and he was like, ‘I know this place with amazing lavender fields, I’m going to take you there.’ I mean, I was used to dating people who didn’t even get me a card on my birthday – and this man was offering to take me to lavender fields? I felt he was really listening to me.”When you’re looking for love and someone says the right things, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’Their date went well, carried on a tide of high spirits from days of intense messaging. “We got pretty intoxicated and did sleep together – I was just swept away by it all,” she says. After that date, though, the messages changed – the flowing sentences filled with questions and quips, the bullet-point lists of books she might like and places they should visit, were replaced by terse one-word replies, sent after long delays. She showed the conversation to a friend, who was the first person to point out that many of his messages bore the hallmarks of having been generated by ChatGPT. She’d never used AI and so wasn’t on the lookout for the distinctive cadences and long dashes. “Maybe I was naive, but when you’re looking for love and someone comes along who says the right things, seems to be on the same page as you, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’, you’re thinking you’ve just stumbled across Prince Charming.”If ghosting was the defining hazard of early app dating, Chatfishing may be its AI-age successor. The rise of ChatGPT in our romantic lives might simply be a symptom of burnout: after years of swiping and stilted exchanges, who wouldn’t be tempted by a digital dating coach, promising wit on tap? Dating apps encourage us to treat romance like a market, full of infinite choice, where we are products to be optimised. AI simply extends that logic – and if the right line, the right cadence, can buy us a little more attention, why wouldn’t we use it?‘People say I come across as incredibly boring!’ How to find love on the dating apps – whatever the obstaclesRead moreBut the secrecy around it is revealing. That so many daters are hiding their reliance on AI suggests that deep down we all know that true intimacy demands vulnerability. Having a chatbot mediate our flirtations – even just in the early stages – risks dimming that intangible spark that only arises in unscripted moments. Worse still, as Rachel’s lavender-field disappointment shows, the drive for more matches, quicker, can leave others feeling used, misled, even doubting what’s real. And dating is perhaps just a test case; as AI seeps further into every corner of our lives, the temptation to neaten the messiness, to smooth the hesitations and flaws that make us human, will surely grow. What happens when no exchange is person-to-person any more? When we’re all talking into echo chambers, hearing our own words reflected back at us?Ultimately, there is no shortcut to connection. “Dating apps are kind of mislabelled,” says Brunson. “They should more appropriately be called ‘introduction apps’, because they’re really only designed to introduce you to potential matches. The rest needs to be done in person – that’s where you find if you have chemistry. And no algorithm can do that part for us.”Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsDatingArtificial intelligence (AI)AppsSexComputingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can I stop?Changing such ingrained habits isn’t easy, but when you’re about to apologise try counting to 10 or substituting a different phraseAnnalisa BarbieriSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 03.29 EDTShareI’m a woman in my late30s who, since childhood, has thought itvital to be politeto those around me,including saying sorry when I feel I’ve done something wrong.While I havea happy and fulfilling life, I’ve always had very low self-confidence. This combination of wanting to acknowledge others appropriately and constantly doubting myself has turned me into a personwho apologises a great deal.Often,it happens so fast I’m not even conscious of it. It is definitely coming from a place of anxiety and has affected my personal and professional life. It drives my loved ones and colleagues mad, and then it drives me mad that they point it out– only making me more anxious about it.It is a particular problem when it comes to public speakingor asking questions in front of others. I try to have everything written downso I stay concise and don’t go off on a nervous tangent, but even that doesn’t work most of the time. I am an early-career academic specialising in politics, so speaking confidently is important. I have been trying to fix this by“exposure therapy”, teaching classes and forcing myself to ask any question I canat public events –despite numerous public“humiliations” by established male academics. I have also tried to consider“pausing” before speaking, so I am more aware of when I’m apologising, but that will only work initially before I fall off the wagon again.I don’t think I’ll ever like myself, and there is nothing I can do about that. I’m at peace with it and still enjoylife. I just want to stop apologising so much. I’ve read that therapy mayhelp, buthow?Apologising is a skill, and a precious one. But it has to be used appropriately (interesting that you yourself used that word). Too little or too much and you’re asking the other person to do a lot of the heavy lifting.I went to UKCP -registered psychotherapist Ali Ross, who wondered where this compulsion came from. “How young were you when this solidified?” he asked. “Was it self-inspired or an inherited principle from someone close to you?” Sometimes, ways of behaving as children which served us well become maladaptive to us in adulthood.Indeed, some of your behaviours now could be seen as self-sabotage (you might find thepodcast I did on this subjecthelpful). You know it drives those around you “mad”, and yet you still do it.Consider how apologising serves you? Normally this is an attempt to avoid shame and exposure. What would it be like not to apologise in those moments?“You ask what therapy could do for you in this,” said Ross. “So much of what you detail is about doing, trying, problem-identifying and solving. Much of good therapy is about ‘being’ not ‘doing’, because in ‘doing’ we often miss ourselves.” In other words, a good therapist will gently challenge you, but won’t try to fix you; they give you a safe place to think about, and ultimately accept, who you are.Ross felt that instead of exposure therapy, you might want “a relational approach, maybe with a ‘humanist’ therapist. This will help bring you back to yourself and look at how you treat, judge, dismiss and invalidate yourself. This can help you catch self-criticism, interrupt it and find more self-compassionate ways to view it. Your confidence can grow from there.”This will take time, but you’ve taken an important first step by acknowledging there is an issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What would it be like not to apologise in those moments? Normally this is an attempt to avoid shame and exposure: ‘If I acknowledge what I suspect you’re about to notice about me, at least I show that I recognise my shortcomings.’ You seem to be trying to take control over something that is beyond your control, which is how people perceive you. Ironically, by trying to control this they will likely feel frustrated. You then feel out of control … ” And a vicious circle ensues.Even thinking things through after the event can be helpful. Could you count in your head to 10 before answering, or have a stock phrase to say instead of “I’m sorry”? It could be something like “I see”, if appropriate – a great phrase which makes people feel heard, but doesn’t hold you accountable.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Accepting puts you at risk of identity theft and even prisonShane HickeySun 12 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareCriminals are cashing in on would-be drivers’ frustration over test delays by claiming they can help them skip queues and obtain licences without the need to do exams.Fraudsters are asking for hundreds of pounds for what they say are legitimate licences, claiming they have staff inside the government testing and licensing bodies working for them.In one scam seen by the Guardian, the fraudster asked for £850 for a driving licence, payable in instalments, claiming that a “team of DVSA-certified instructors” would process the buyer’s details.They claim the driver is enrolled in a test centre but will not have to sit the theory or practical test. Instead, they claim their staff submit test results through the system, which leads to the licence being issued.However, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which issues licences, and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which carries out tests, have warned that the promised shortcuts are scams designed to gather victims’ money and personal details.They have also warned that any documents that do arrive are counterfeit.Anyone found in possession of a fake driving licence could face up to 10 years’ imprisonment.Waiting times for tests haveaveraged about 22 weeksacross Great Britain this year, with London drivershaving to wait 24 weeksin many cases.Thelatest DVLA figuresshow 668,128 people had a practical driving test booked in Britain at the end of September, up from 579,138 a year earlier.Recent figures from the bank TSB showed that among its customers total losses linked to driving lesson and test fraud had doubled in a year, and victims had lost an average of £244 each.It found almost every recorded scam was carried out via a social media platform.The number of drivers who have fallen victim to scams around learning to drive is on the increase,according to TSB, which said recently that some of its customers had also been duped into buying fake driving lesson offers.What the scam looks likeThe fraudsters behind social media accounts seen by the Guardian encouraged prospective buyers to get in touch with them by WhatsApp.When contacted, one said that they had an “agent working on the DVLA system” who could obtain a full driving licence and passing certificates for the theory and practical tests. They said the cost would be £500, with £200 paid upfront and another £300 due once the licence arrived, which they said would be within four days.Another claimed to be a technician working on the DVLA database. They asked for £740 for an automatic licence and £850 for a manual one.One of the fraudsters asked how good the potential buyer’s driving skills were and whether they had any medical issues and points on their licence, which the fraudsters said was necessary to process their application. One asked for the screenshot of a provisional licence for the application.The accounts contacted by the Guardian requested payment via bank transfer.What to doThe DVLA said it had found no evidence that any staff had been involved in such scams.“These accounts are not connected to DVLA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information,” a spokesperson said. “Anyone concerned they may have been a victim of a scam should contact the police through Action Fraud straight away.”The DVSA said it had received a large number of reports about the scams, and promised documents usually failed to arrive.A spokesperson said: “These accounts are not connected to DVSA and are recognised scams that attempt to obtain payment or personal information.“We take all allegations about test standards and fraud extremely seriously. We fully investigate reports of any individuals who attempt to circumvent the testing process and have a robust process in place to ensure driving tests conducted by our examiners meet the required standard of assessment.”TikTok banned three accounts highlighted by the Guardian. “Our community guidelines are clear that we do not allow the trade or marketing of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, nor do we allow attempts to defraud or scam members of our community,” a statement from the social media company said.Meta, which owns Instagram, removed two accounts using similar tactics that were pointed out by the Guardian. The platform said it bans content that dealt in the trade of forged documents.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchMotoringConsumer affairsDVLAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eilean Sionnach is an islet off Skye that is accessible by boat or on foot at low tide. Like the lighthouse, the cottage was built in 1857 and has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a kitchen and a lounge with a wood burner, and incredible sea views.As well as a patio and garden, which has a fire circle, the cottage has its own private beach. It is possible to time a lunchtime walk to the nearest pubs and restaurants over on Skye.

They can be rented separately or together: the cottage sleeps four in two bedrooms; the house sleeps six in two bedrooms and a snug with a double sofa bed. Both have kitchens with range ovens, lounges with lots of books and games, and outdoor fire bowls.Outside, there’s adventure to be had in the woods, walks to waterfalls and natural plunge pools, and berries and mushrooms to forage. Hardy guests can snorkel and free dive for scallops on nearby Loch Sunart, or hire kayaks and boats. The nearest shop is a 15-minute drive away, but there is a whisky distillery just over a mile down the road.Cottage from£171 anight, house from £214, both together (sleeps 10) from £357, four-night minimum,kiphideaways.comThe Blue Hemmel, NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenGuests have to cross two fords to reach this contemporary barn conversion, which is a mile from the nearest neighbour (the owner). Set in moorland on the edge of Kielder Forest, close to Hadrian’s Wall, the barn is spacious yet cosy, and the open-plan living area has original beams, a vaulted ceiling, underfloor heating and windows overlooking the garden and forest.There’s a wood burner to keep you warm in winter, a curved sofa, armchairs and a games table, and the three bedrooms have doors on to the patio. The barn is in Northumberland’s International Dark Sky Park and there’s a stargazing platform with a telescope in the garden; keen astronomers can also visit the Battlesteads Dark Sky Observatory in Wark, the nearest village.From£907 for a week,sleeps six,classic.co.ukBull Hollow Cottage, ShropshireView image in fullscreenThis charming cottage for two, set in a clearing in four hectares of private woodland, looks like it’s straight out of a fairytale. The ground-floor lounge has a wood burner and a bay window seat for wildlife watching, while up the steep, narrow stairs is the bedroom, bathroom and snug-cum-study.The large garden has a stream running through it, with a little stone bridge leading to woodland walks and Acton Burnell Castle beyond.

The compact cabin has a futon sofa bed, a fold-down table and a wood burner. There is plenty of space outside, including a covered outdoor kitchen, an outdoor shower and a composting toilet. Best of all is the wood-fired hot tub, on a platform perched on a boulder and with views across the valley.There’s no danger of being overlooked while bathing – the cabin is set in six hectares of private land. Still, it is only a 10-minute walk to the Druid Inn or the Red Lion in the ancient village of Birchover.

It was once a cow barn, and is still very simple: there is a sitting room with a wood burner, a small kitchen, a twin bedroom and a room with a bunkbed. Unusually, there is no bathroom – guests wash at the kitchen sink and use a caravan-style toilet under the cottage, in the old shippon (cattle shed).It’s not for everyone, but it’s perfect for serious hikers who want to explore a lesser-known part of the Lake District. Hardknott Pass, among the steepest roads in England, is on the doorstep, and walkers can also take a quieter route up Scafell Pike.From £449a week or £292 for three nights, sleepsfour,nationaltrust.org.ukThe Boat House Cabin, CornwallView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Canopy And StarsFollow a gravel path, over a small bridge, through lush gardens to a lake, where the Boat House Cabin sits on the shore.

Inside it’s a tasteful wood and white-walled haven, with a stylish bedroom and French doors opening onto a balcony.Take a rowing boat out on the lake (or swim) and warm up in front of the wood-burner in the living room, watching a film on the pull-down screen. Spa treatments and yoga sessions can be arranged, and there’s lots to explore locally – the fishing village of Porthleven and coastal walks are a short drive away.From£124a night (two-night minimum), sleeps two,canopyandstars.co.ukGarth Gell Farmhouse, SnowdoniaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rhiannon BattenGuests have to drive up a steep track to reach this beautiful old stone farmhouse in Snowdonia, which is in 10 hectares of land. The four-bedroom property has been carefully restored by conservation architects, keeping the original flagged floors, beams and other period features, and it is still off-grid. Solar panels provide electricity for a few lamps and a small fridge-freezer; there is limited hot water from the oil-fired Aga for the main bathroom.Forget watching TV or scrolling – this is a place to read, relax, play games and go for walks. Guests can cycle to the nearest pub, the George III in Penmaenpool, and along the Mawddach estuary. It is 15 minutes to the seaside town of Barmouth.From £240a night (four-night minimum), sleepssix,garthgellfarmhouse.co.ukTincture, PowysView image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Curran / Unique HomestaysUnless you have a 4x4, it is a steep 15-minute walk up to this thoughtfully renovated 17th-century farmhouse – a wheelbarrow is provided for luggage. The house runs off-grid via a solid-fuel Rayburn, solar panels and spring water. Surrounded by untouched National Trust land in the Cambrian mountains, there’s not a neighbour in sight. There are two bedrooms, one en suite, and a family bathroom upstairs and a kitchen, sitting room and dining room downstairs.Furniture is repurposed from farming days: the dining table was recovered from the stable and a cabinet was made from part of the pigsty. A wood burner in the sitting room adds to the cosy vibe, and there’s a brook and natural plunge pool in the garden for cold-water dippers. It is seven miles to the spa town of Llanwrtyd Wells and about two hours’ drive to Cardiff.From £1,995 a week, short breaks £1,495, sleeps four,uniquehomestays.comDrumskinny Farm, County FermanaghView image in fullscreenThis simple Grade II-listed farmhouse is at the end of a private lane in rolling hills on the Fermanagh/Donegal border. Whitewashed and with a wildflower meadow on the roof of the original cattle sheds, it’s as pretty outside as it is cosy in. Most of the rooms are on the ground floor, with traditional flagstone floors, a living room with a wood burner, kitchen and master bedroom, plus there’s a twin bedroom and toilet upstairs.Outside are big front and back gardens (two dogs welcome), and unspoilt countryside to explore. It’s a 40-minute walk to the Drumskinny stone circle and a 15-minute drive to Lower Lough Erne. The towns of Enniskillen, Omagh and Donegal are almost equidistant – but are a good 20 miles away.From£250for two nights, sleeps four,underthethatch.co.ukAccommodation prices correct at time of going to press.

Is it nature or nurture?Jane Shaw, FranceSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyBecome leftwing? I was born that way!oldyfoldyFor me, it was seeing that what was offered (by rightwing parties) was not relevant to where I was at the time as a student. I had no money, no job, no connections and no clue about where I wanted to go with my life. But I did know I didn’t want to work in London, wearing formal office attire and being a slave to the nine-to-five grind for the rest of my days. The leftwing parties seemed to offer more inclusion and be more welcoming to ordinary folk like me. So that’s where I looked for my political home.WordChazerI think it has more to do with the economy. People are having a hard time finding decent jobs, wages are going down, housing prices are at an all-time high and the right are not going to tax any billionaires because you can always divert attention elsewhere.BacksideflipMy parents were small-c conservatives and religious; I’m leftwing and atheist. I think a lot of people end up in one camp or another out of antagonism to their upbringing.DonAlfonsoHeliotropeOn the other hand, once they are grown up, a lot of people end up with pretty much their parents’ values.ockham2Persuasive evidencegathered over the past few decadesindicates that neurological differences affect political engagement and persuasion, if we take a typical left/right or liberal/conservative approach to political viewpoints. The primary result seems to be that holding “rightwing” views is associated with strong disgust responses in individuals. What I think is interesting is that, when you compare policies, you tend to find that left and right can have near-identical policy prescriptions. That may be why “populist” politicians can see short-term success (as they say the things that trigger emotional responses in the audience), and may also be a really good reason for insisting that developing the ability for rational thought is a fundamental outcome of formal education. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that populists try to gain power through “othering”, and when they do gain power their first attack involves a pivot toward teachers and education.DorkaliciousI think it’s the wrong question. Let’s focus on the person, not the politics.eamonmccFor a leftwing/centrist person of my generation (gen X), I think it’s often a very strong, adverse reaction to our nurture. We had parents of the “silent generation”, some of whose cultural norms included casual racism, homophobia and sexism, but we became teenagers and young adults in the late 70s-90s when those attitudes were recognised to be wrong – and desperately uncool. I was in the maybe unusual position of having a father who was an active member of the Conservative party, and a mother (a school nurse at a school for children with disabilities, mostly from very poor families) who always voted Liberal. She tolerated my dad’s Tory party membership as it got him out of the house and out of her hair!WifeofbathPolitical identity is not a fixed trait, it is a living story. It is shaped by temperament, upbringing, by society, and by our emotional experiences.Psychologytells us that both nature and nurture are important, but the real insight is how they interact together. Empathy can shift political identity. Nature may shape our sensitivities, but nurture writes our script. Sometimes, the most powerful political transformation begins not with argument, but with belonging. When belonging is denied, and fear is amplified, political identity can harden into extremism. In the UK and beyond, we are witnessing how unchecked polarisation and algorithmic distortion can radicalise individuals into ideologies that thrive on division. The antidote is not silence, but reflection, and the courage to meet with compassion.Sarah Marsh, chair of the political psychology section at the British Psychological SocietyThis does puzzle me! I’m the sole lefty in my immediate family (apart from my mother, who I think was a closet sympathiser, but was of the generation and upbringing where you didn’t openly disagree with your husband – or, in fact, talk about politics at all). My father would have described himself as conservative; volunteered for the army in 1939, was a great royalist, and admired Margaret Thatcher, although he was deeply cynical about most politicians.My question is: is it really about politics at all? What shapes our sense of what we can or can’t accept? I look at the spectrum of politicians we have at present and am repelled by the hypocrisy and ineptitude, sloppy thinking, childish squabbling and name-calling, as well as the vanity, prejudice and lack of moral courage – all things that would have appalled my parents as well. How do we learn to see clearly, think critically, and speak honestly (and respectfully)? And what do we do with that experience as we grow up?Woodlander1917I would have thought nurture was the main factor, but [Australian political scientist] Karen Stenner makes a really interesting case that there is also an underlying personality element – what she calls an authoritarian predisposition. If you look at the“big five” personality traits, openness seems to play a part, too: people who score higher on openness usually lean more liberal or left, while people lower on it often lean more conservative or right, with less comfort around diversity. On the nurture side, I think how we perceive our identities as shaped by our families, friends and neighbourhoods is a major factor. Emotion often leads reason.Jean-Pierre, via emailI was brought up in a leftwing family (more Methodism than Marx, however). I have instinctively always inclined leftwards, but occasionally if a right-ish thought comes to mind, I’m pulled back by reminding myself: “What would my grandmother think?”DocLobster1960This is an interesting question. I don’t think it’s genetic, as I don’t see why it would be. I think it is much more about social tribes and how much you identity with your parents’ tribe, and how exposed you are to other ideas and other tribes. As young people, a great many influences weigh on us. Friends, family, media, teaching, what we read and learn. I suppose that somehow political leanings come out of that soup of influences, mixed with a healthy dash of a private inner sense of what is right and wrong.MiffledKittyFamilies have a tendency to share similar opinions and values. It is to the parents’ credit if their children grow up both left- and rightwing – it means they were encouraged to think independently and arrive at their own views.DamsonjamThe answer to most questions like this, especially in politics, is likely to be “a bit of both’! Of course, that isn’t what everyone wants to hear, but as humans we should be getting used to the idea that we are relatively complex animals and generally successful, too. As a species, we have so far survived and thrived by adapting to our environments, mixing the stable with the spontaneous. Of course, evolution tells us things can change …Dr Ashley Weinberg, senior lecturer in psychology, University of SalfordExplore more on these topicsLife and styleNotes and queriesPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My view is that the system doesn’t work for anybody. It’s in the school’s interests for the kids to do well, and they’ll push you all the time. It’s taken the fun out of school. Patrick was a bit shocked to hear what I was telling him – that it’s weaponised anxiety, the teachers use kids’ anxieties to drive them forward, but they’re really using it against them. Both of my kids had school anxiety, which caused them to be out of formal education for a while, and I think that was created by the school not solved by it.PatrickMolly sees the pressure coming from teachers and schools, whereas I was trying to contextualise that. I agree that yes, it’s pressurised, but that pressure comes from above us. Everybody’s got a thumb on them and we’re all just trying to get through, and unfortunately, that doesn’t always have the most holistic impact on the most important people, which are the kids.MollyI thought kids in a PRU had all been expelled, but it’s for any kids who can’t cope in mainstream education. It was quite eye-opening for me, to meet someone who was that emotionally involved with the kids.PatrickThe second you raise your voice at a student, you’ve lost. There is no raising your voices in my school. We empower kids to articulate what they’re feeling, and we work with them to meet those challenges. It’s beautiful. I’ve never been in a school that talks the talk and walks the walk like this. My wife is a teacher in a private school, and they operate the same way.

Rather than working on mark schemes, focus on the one thing AI can’t do, which is humanity and art.

I held it up to the sky and the light shone through it. Lovely.”The flake was probably the byproduct of a Neolithic person fashioning some sort of tool. “As I work here now, I think about the people who were here before us,” said Stevens. “Why did they build this? What drew them here?“I wonder how they must have felt building it. They were proud building it and I’m proud looking at the holes we’ve built trying to find out why.”Experts and almost 100 volunteers have been on the site near Bodmin over the last month to attempt to work out if Castilly Henge is Cornwall’s lost great stone circle.The siteis an oval earthworkwith an external bank and an internal ditch, thought to have been the venue for gatherings and rituals in about 2,500BC – the same sort of time that Stonehenge was built 150 miles away in Wiltshire.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Castilly Henge.Photograph: Courtesy of Historic EnglandOlaf Bayer, a senior archaeological investigator forHistoric Englandand the project manager, explained how he had asked for a geophysical survey to be undertaken of the site on a hunch.The surveyors found what he cautiously terms “a series of anomalies” in the ground. “They are six or seven entities that are different to the normal, different to the background,” he said. One theory is that they are pits that once held stones forming a circle.There are other stone circles in Cornwall but only one other with a henge –Stripple Stones on Bodmin Moor.“It would be wonderful if it turned out to be a stone circle,” Bayer said.The Castilly Henge site feels significant. It is perched on a watershed and has views across to the summit of Brown Willy, the highest spot in Cornwall.View image in fullscreenOlaf Bayer.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianBayer said the site may have been one of the few fixed points for the Neolithic farming communities dotted around this part of what is now south-westEngland.“It may have been a place where people came together for important events, a piece of land snipped out of the surrounding world. I think of it as a focus for ceremony, for ritual, for activities that we don’t quite understand.”An intriguing detail is that the flint fragments found at Castilly are not local but were brought from the Blackdown Hills on the Somerset-Devon border. “People have moved raw material from there,” said Stevens.As well as the flints, the dig has uncovered medieval pottery and 20th-century coins, presumably dropped by archeologists who worked on the site in the 1960s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of schoolchildren have visited and volunteers have included people prescribed a spell at the site by medics.Map of the areaAnn Preston-Jones of theCornwall Archaeological Society,one of the project partners, said it had been “buzzy”. She said some of the areas close to the site were very deprived. “This is about placemaking, about giving people pride, ownership and belonging,” she said.Another of the partners,Cornwall Heritage Trust, israising money to buy the site. It’s engagement manager, Sophie Meyer-Bourne, said children had loved visiting. “They wouldn’t normally have this opportunity. They learn about history but to actually come out on to a site and relate to it in the way that they have is brilliant.”Nev Meek, 64, president ofKernow Goth, the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies,was also on the dig.“This site is immensely important for Cornwall,” he said. “It is clear that the people who created this invested a tremendous amount of effort.”And he said taking part was hugely rewarding. “These sort of volunteer efforts attract a nice group of people, having fun, having a laugh and hopefully finding amazing things too.”Explore more on these topicsCornwallArchaeologyHeritageEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The newly appointed prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, had said on state television on Saturday night that the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”.Rajoelina said: “The presidency of the republic wishes to inform the nation and the international community that an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, contrary to the constitution and to democratic principles, is currently under way.”Soldiers from Capsat , which brought Rajoelina to power in acoup in 2009, said on Sunday morning that they were taking command of the military, according to avideoed statementshared by local news organisations.Later on Sunday, General Demosthene Pikulas, the head of Capsat, was installed as chief of the army staff during a ceremony at the army headquarters attended by armed forces minister Manantsoa Deramasinjaka Rakotoarivelo.“I give him my blessing,” the minister said of Pikulas.Pikulas admitted to journalists after the ceremony that events inMadagascarover the past few days had been “unpredictable”.“So the army has a responsibility to restore calm and peace throughout Madagascar,” he said.When asked if he called for Rajoelina to resign, he refused to “discuss politics within a military facility”.On Saturday, Capsat said it would not fire on protesters and called on the rest of the military to “join forces” in refusing. Late in the afternoon, members of the unit left their base in Soanierana district, in the south of the capital, Antananarivo, driving in armoured vehicles to the symbolic May 13 Square, about 3 miles to the north, accompanied by thousands of cheering protesters.A Capsat general said on Saturday that one of their soldiers had been killed by the gendarmerie, police under the command of the defence ministry, and a journalist had been shot in the buttocks. The UN said at least 22 people were killed at the start of the protests in September, but Rajoelina disputed this last week, saying 12 “looters and vandals” had died.The protests on the Indian Ocean island of around 32 million people were initiallycoordinated by Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people who had been inspired by similar “gen Z” protests inIndonesia and Nepal, where the government was overthrown.Rajoelinafired his governmenton 29 September in response to the initial demonstrations. However, Gen Z Madagascar rejected this as insufficient, calling for the resignation of the president, as well as the leader of parliament and constitutional court judges, while protesters on the streets continued to shout, “Miala Rajoelina!” (Leave Rajoelina!).Some young activists expressed concern on Saturday about Capsat’s intervention, with one calling the soldiers, and opposition politicians who joined them in May 13 Square, “dangerous”.Madagascar is one of the world’s poorest countries, with aGDP per capita of just $545 last year, according to the World Bank. The precious gem- and vanilla-rich nation was ranked140 out of 180countries in Transparency International’s 2024 corruption perceptions index.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMadagascarProtestAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

What went wrong?Philip Oltermannin Berlin andEromo Egbejulein AbidjanSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn a corner of the new Museum of West African Art, visitors can marvel at a sample display of the cultural treasures that adorned the royal palace that once stood in its place: a proud cockerel, a plaque with three mighty warriors, a bust of a king with a glorious beaded collar.The artefacts, collectively known as theBeninbronzes, were looted by British colonial forces who went on to burn down the palace in a punitive expedition in 1897. In the decades that followed they were scattered across collections in Europe and America.View image in fullscreenNeil Curtis, head of collections at the University of Aberdeen, with a bronze sculpture depicting an oba (king) of Benin in 2021.Photograph: Courtesy of University of AberdeenTheir return and public display inside the $25m (£19m) state-of-the-art museum in the city of Benin in Nigeria’s Edo state, co-funded by European governments and western enterprises, was to be the crowning moment of an almost century-long effort to reclaim Africa’s stolen art.Yet when MOWAA opens its doors on 11 November, the only Benin bronzes on display will be clay replicas – a far cry from the “most comprehensive display [of Benin bronzes] in the world” touted by authorities when plans for the museum to become their home were announced in 2020.About 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years, some on the initiative of private collections and some as acts of state byGermanyand the Netherlands. For now, none are on public display.If the looting of the original bronzes took place in the context of what has been called the “scramble for Africa”, as European nations raced to claim overseas territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, restitution has in part resembled a scramble in reverse. Western actors tried to outbid each other to atone for their past, before authorities in Nigeria had settled old rivalries about what restitution precisely entailed.View image in fullscreenBenin Bronzes on display at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin in May.Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/Alamy“In the west, there was a race about who was going to be the first institution to restitute,” said MOWAA’s director and chair Phillip Ihenacho, without naming individual museums or governments. “And there was not enough of a focus on to whom they would be restituted to.“I think that there was a well-intentioned effort that was focused very much around being seen to be a pioneer in this area. But a lot of people in the west failed to understand the complexities within those countries.”Nigerian demands for the Benin bronzes’ return, first voiced in the 1930s, were widely shunned by western governments and institutions until 2007, when a consortium of European museums and Nigerian officials formed the Benin Dialogue group.On the Nigerian side, the group included not just representatives of the federal Nigerian government, but also of Edo state, where the kingdom of Benin was once located, and of Ewuare II, the descendant of the royal family that once owned the bronzes, known as the Oba of Benin.Which of these three parties were entitled to the bronzes upon their return has historically been a bone of contention. The Oba has argued that since they were looted from the palace, they should be returned to the descendants and not to Edo state.European participants in the discussions were of the impression that the conflict on the Nigerian side had been settled.Race to returnIn November 2019, the groupinvited Ghanaian-British architect David Adjayeto come up with plans for a new museum where the returned treasures could be stored and put on public display. Still, to the frustration of officials in Nigeria and activists in Europe, there were no concrete announcements on physical returns.The spring of 2021 was to provide a sudden step-change. In a March interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the director of Berlin’s newly opened Humboldt Forum let slip that the museum was considering leaving symbolic empty spaces where it had intended to display Benin bronzes from its collection, with the originals returning to Nigeria.The comment surprised German government officials, who were in west Africa to discuss repatriations with their Nigerian counterparts, and set high expectations among the public and other organisations.A flurry of activity followed: days later, Aberdeen University in Scotlandannouncedit would also return a pillaged bronze. Then similar declarations were made by the Horniman museum in London, Cambridge University, New York’s Met and the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum.Museum officials suggest the pace of these developments was also fanned by the Nigerian cultural heritage agency, whose representatives were jetting around the world to strike return deals.In December 2022, a German state delegation travelled to Nigeria with 21 bronzes packaged in crates in the belly of the government plane, an initiative pushed for by the then foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, of the German Green party, who was eager to make her mark a year into office. “It could and should have been a lot less hectic,” said one official directly involved in preparing the trip.View image in fullscreenNigerian culture minister, Layiwola ‘Lai’ Mohammed (R), and German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, signing an agreement of intent to return the Benin bronzes to Nigeria in Berlin in the summer of 2022.Photograph: Adam Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesAt a handover ceremony in Abuja, Baerbock said Germany was proud to co-finance MOWAA to the tune of €6.8m (£6m), and “invited” her counterpart to exhibit the bronzes there. It was a grand, pathos-filled moment but underneath the surface, tensions that the Europeans believed had been laid to rest were bubbling up again. Present at the ceremony were ministers of the federal Nigerian government and representatives of Edo state, but not the Oba.View image in fullscreenPeople photographing the returned artefacts at the Nigerian foreign ministry during the handover ceremony in December 2022.Photograph: Kola Sulaimon/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was a personal flavour to the animosity: Godwin Obaseki, the then governor of Edo state, is a direct descendant of aformer palace official who had been named Benin prime ministerby the British after the punitive expedition and is still seen in some circles as a betrayer of the kingdom. Media outlets loyal to the palace accused Obaseki of having set up MOWAA in order to hijack the restitution process, calling for its occupancy licenceto be revoked.View image in fullscreenGodwin Obaseki.Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/AlamyThe tussle over the bronzes was ended in an abrupt fashion on 23 March 2023, when Nigeria’s federal government announced in an officialgazettethat the Oba of Benin was the stolen treasures’ rightful owner and custodian, and that they must be stored within his residence in Benin City unless the royal family decided otherwise.The move caused howls of outrage among those in Europe who had been sceptical of the restitution in the first place. Centre-right German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it “a fiasco”, suggesting that the bronzes would be locked away in the Oba’s private residence with no access for the public.This is unlikely to be the case: a former cultural centre adjacent to the Oba’s residence is rumoured to be earmarked as a designated future museum. “The new name will be Benin Royal museum and this is where they plan to store the bronzes,” said Benin-born Mercy Imiegha, director of Lagos-based Nomadic Art Gallery.At any rate, inter-Nigerian disputes should not deflect from the urgent need for the bronzes’ return, say restitution advocates. “The Benin bronzes in German museums would never have found their way to Europe if British forces hadn’t invaded the Benin Kingdom and sacked the royal palace,” said Barbara Plankensteiner, director of Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum and co-spokesperson of the Benin Dialogue group. “We are looking at the largest theft of a royal treasure in history. There was a moral imperative for them to be returned to Africa with no strings attached.”View image in fullscreenBenin bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Photograph: Art2010/AlamyAndreas Goergen, a former secretary general of the German Federal Ministry for Culture and the Media, said: “Dealing with the art objects of traditional rulers is difficult for any republic. Germany took 100 years to reach an agreement with the Hohenzollerns [the German imperial dynasty that was overthrown at the end of the first world war]. Nigeria took four to reach an agreement with the Oba of Benin. So, no reason to be snooty.”“The Europeans can’t tell us what we should or shouldn’t do with the objects of our heritage,” said Toyin Akinosho, co-founder of the nonprofit Committee for Relevant Art, which organises the Lagos Book and Arts festival. “Can’t we hold conversations here too about programming of new culture spaces?”MOWAA, meanwhile, has had to readjust. Originally supposed to be called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it decided to remove the name of the state to emphasise its impartiality.View image in fullscreenThe Museum of West African Art.Photograph: Museum of West African Art (MOWAA)“We had hoped that we would be able to provide support to the restitution effort by demonstrating that we have institutions in West Africa that have what the west would regard as world-class display and storage facilities,” said Ihenacho. “But we never were set up to be the exclusive Benin bronzes museum.”One space will host an exhibition about the archaeological dig carried out on the MOWAA site with £3m in support from London’s British Museum, which still holds the largest single collection of looted Benin bronzes in the world.A selection of about 100 artefacts will hint at the story of the kingdom of Benin and its dissolution. “Some of them may well be made of bronze,” said Ihenacho. “But there will be nothing that was involved in the restitution process.”"

Opposition parties have accused the electoral commission, Elections Cameroon, of being subservient to the ruling party, and the most credible opposition candidate, Maurice Kamto, has had his candidacy barred by the courts.Other candidates include former ministers Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who recently defected from the presidential camp and has gathered several thousand people at meetings around the country, and Bello Bouba Maigari, who was Biya’s first prime minister in 1982. Observers say their individual campaigns lacked the cohesion necessary to mount a significant challenge to Biya’s long-standing rule.Cameroon faces significant socioeconomic challenges; a third of the population lives on less than $2 (£1.50) a day, youth unemployment is rampant, and many young people have expressed disillusionment with the electoral process, citing a lack of economic opportunities and political representation.View image in fullscreenSupporter of opposition politician Issa Tchiroma Bakary, one of the candidates contesting Sunday’s poll.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersVoter turnout has declined dramatically over the years, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts with jihadists in the Far North region andanglophone separatistsin the west.The world’s oldest president is running again: can anyone stop him from winning?Read moreThe latter crisis, which began in 2017, has led to thousands of deaths in the country’s two English-speaking regions and forcibly displaced over 700,000 people.Kah Wallah, the leader of the Cameroon People’s party and founder of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, said the anglophone crisis is one of the reasons why the movement has not supported elections since 2018. “We still believe it is unconscionable for the Biya regime to go to elections without ensuring the security of citizens in #NOSO,” she said, referring to a common abbreviation for Cameroon’s anglophone North-West and South-West regions.The government has been criticised for its heavy handed response, which has left many in the anglophone regions feeling marginalised and open to boycotting the vote.Biya, who is rarely seen in public, held his first and only campaign rally on Tuesday. Addressing a crowd of supporters at a stadium in the Far North town of Maroua, he promised to step up security in the region, curb youth unemployment, and improve road infrastructure and social amenities if reelected.“I am well aware of the problems that concern you, I know the unfulfilled expectations that make you doubt the future,” Biya said in his speech. “Based on my own experience, I can assure you that these problems are not insurmountable.”This year’s election cycle has featured striking appeals for him to step aside. First came the Catholic archbishop Samuel Kleda, who went on French radio last Christmas to say it was “not realistic” for Biya to keep doing the job. Then came the defections of Tchiroma and Maigari, both of whom openly challenged Biya’s fitness to lead.Finally, the president’s daughter Brenda Biya, 27, said on TikTok last month that her father “has made too many people suffer” and urged Cameroonians not to vote for him. She later recanted, but the post continues to circulate widely among Biya’s detractors.Theophile, an artist in the economic capital, Douala, called the vote a “scam”. The 24-year-old had hoped to vote for Kamto, who came second to Biya in the 2018 election. “As long as the system remains in place, there is nothing that can be done. There has to be a change,” he said.Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCameroonAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But these are also the brightest of times,”María Corina Machadotold supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night.Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebratewinning the Nobel peace prizefor her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela’s “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro.“We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,”Machado declaredafter hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.”For all Machado’s relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday’s surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado’s tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat’s feared security forces?International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.Carlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela’s collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community…asthe one credible opposition leader” in the South American country.“A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year’s rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck.Others are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it.“But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict.Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded.Krebs citedLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese poet and activist whoreceived the prizein 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an“anti-China farce”. Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping.In 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for herstruggle for democracy and human rights. Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said.Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”Allies hope Machado’s prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change.Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro’s mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela’s authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign.Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year’s election from Machado’s ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change.Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There’s never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said.But the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump’s pressure campaign would “break” Maduro’s regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it’s a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials.“This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don’t want forever wars. They don’t want Vietnam. They don’t want Iraq,” Izarra said.Perhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubbornMargaret Thatcher-admiring conservativeknown as Venezuela’s “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn.“She’s a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaMaría Corina MachadoNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “Obviously, the Crown Prosecution Service are best placed to explain why they were not able to bring forward a prosecution, but what I can be absolutely clear about is that ministers and others, including the national security adviser, had no role to play in either the substance of the case or the evidence in question.”Speaking earlier on Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips, the education secretary was asked for assurances that Powell took no part in the decision. “Yes, I can give that assurance,” Phillipson replied. “We’re very disappointed that the CPS were not able to take forward the prosecution.”Asked if the prime minister still had full confidence in Powell, she said he did.The centrality of government decision-making emerged last week when Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions,wrote tothe chairs of two parliamentary select committees to say that the case was dropped after ministers and officials declined to set out that Beijing represented a “threat to the national security of the UK”, despite what he called “many months” of efforts.This is key because of case law relating to the Official Secrets Act, which emerged after Cash and Berry were charged. This, connected to the separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, clarified that under the act, a country must be a threat to the UK’s national security at the time of the offence, prompting the need for clarification from the government.Phillipson told the BBC that because some of the legal changes dated back to 2023, it was a matter for the previous Conservative government. “I’m not making a partisan point when I say this, but there was a different government in office then,” she said.In a letter to the prime minister on Sunday evening, Kemi Badenoch urged Starmer to address “key questions which remain unanswered” about the case, claiming the government’s “account of what has happened has changed repeatedly”.She added: “This is a matter of the utmost importance, involving alleged spying on members of parliament. It seems that you and your ministers have been too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.Trump threatens 100% China tariffs as Beijing restricts rare-earth exportsRead more“If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.”Trump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday as market futures showed another US stock market drop.“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Trumpwroteon Truth Social.The message came afterJD Vancecalled on Beijing to “choose the path of reason” in the latest spiralling trade fight between the world’s two leading economies that has shaken stock markets.Dow futures showed a drop of 887 points ahead of the stock markets’ open on Monday. The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%.“It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too.The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry.It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks.China insisted on Sunday thatits latest export controls on rare earthssuch as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate.“China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Global heating is now at about 1.4C.Without rapid and unlikely cuts to greenhouse gases, the upper threshold of 1.5C would be hit in the next 10 years, the report says.“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute. “The first tipping of widespread dieback of warm water coral reefs is already under way.”He said this was already impacting hundreds of millions of people who depend on reefs. The report points to reefs in the Caribbean, where marine heatwaves, low diversity and disease outbreaks have pushed reefs “towards collapse”.View image in fullscreenExperts agree that coral reefs need ‘aggressive’ action on climate change and improved local management.Photograph: Glenn Nicholls/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, Prof Peter Mumby, a leading coral reef scientist at the University of Queensland in Australia, said he accepted reefs were in decline but there was emerging evidence corals could adapt with some reefs remaining viable even at 2C of global heating.He said coral reefs needed “aggressive” action on climate change and improved local management, but he was concerned some would interpret the report as saying coral reef habitats were heading for collapse, which was a position he did not support.He said he was worried society would “give up on coral reefs” if people think they can no longer be saved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game has changed and the response has to be really urgent.”He said there were some coral reefs that were known as refugia – places where climate impacts were not as pronounced – and protecting these places was paramount.“We have to make sure we have the seeds of recovery for a future world where we have managed to stabilise the climate,” he said.Dr Tracy Ainsworth, the vice-president of the InternationalCoralReef Society, said in many places reef ecosystems were changing and were either no longer dominated by corals, or were losing diversity.“The future of coral reefs is one of transformation, ecosystem restructure and new challenges,” she said. “Our challenge now is to understand how all of these different ecosystems are reorganising and how we can ensure they continue to support diverse marine life and communities.”In a statement, the Australian Institute of Marine Science said interpretation of global figures “should be taken with care” for two reasons – they masked significant regional variability and global temperatures had not stabilised “indicating there remains a narrow window of opportunity to act”.Earth entering a ‘danger zone’Lenton said parts of the west Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet were “looking perilously close” to their tipping point, as they were losing ice at an accelerating rate. Loss of ice that is still attached to the land causes sea levels to rise.“We are going to overshoot 1.5C of global warming probably around 2030 on current projections,” Lenton said.“This puts the world in a greater danger zone of escalating risk of further damaging tipping points.”The Amazon – under pressure from the climate crisis and deforestation – was closer than previously thought to reaching a tipping point, he said.The report does offer some hope, saying there are likely “positive tipping points” in society – such as with electric vehicle adoption – that could also have runaway effects to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“The race is on to bring forward these positive tipping points to avoid what we are now sure will be the unmanageable consequences of further tipping points in the Earth system,” Lenton said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCoralGlaciersAmazon rainforestnewsShareReuse this content"

After a Truth Social post last month, when Trump announced the US would designateantifa, the decentralised anti-fascist movement,“a major terrorist organisation”, his international allies swung into action.That same day, the Dutch parliament, where the largest party is Geert Wilders’ far-right PVV, passed a resolution, noting the US decision and calling on the government to declare antifa a terrorist organisation in theNetherlands.Then the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán – more usuallya source of inspiration for Trump– said his country would follow suit. Next, in the European parliament, a far-right MEP from the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang party drafted a resolution with the same request. Tom Vandendriessche announced last week that 79 MEPs from 20 countries supported his proposed text. In a video posted on X with ominous music playing, he described antifa as “an international network that is supported, financed and protected by the system to fight the nationalist opposition with violence”.Trump signs order designating antifa as a ‘domestic terrorist organization’Read moreExperts characterise antifa rather differently, instead describing it as a loose identity movement with neither leaders nor membership structure. While it hasorigins in Europe, it gained attention in the US after Trump’s election in 2016.“Antifa is not what I would call an identifiable group or organisation [but] a movement, perhaps,” Jessica White, acting director of terrorism and conflict studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told the Guardian.“On the basis of that lack of clear definition, I think it’s very challenging, if not counterproductive, to try and designate it,” she added. The security services, she said, would see “the least amount of value” in such a designation, as “usually what I’ve seen is that it is much easier to reach a verdict and a prosecution based upon focusing on the actual acts of violence.”She added: “I think there’s probably a very justified sense of fear around how it could be used in a politically motivated way to target people that are seen as opponents to a more rightwing political government.”The Hungarian government has claimed that antifa, which it calls a “a leftwing terrorist organisation”, is a menace to its citizens. The EU’s law enforcement agency Europol does not use the term “antifa” in its recentTerrorism Situation and Trend report– a document cited in the far-right European parliament resolution. Europol reports 21 attacks attributed to leftwing or anarchist violent extremism in 2024, based on data from 14 countries, excluding Hungary. Nearly all the attacks, which took place in Italy and Greece, targeted property.Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács has said antifa members have “brutally beaten people” in the street, and while some were brought before the courts, “those who did not flee justice for the European parliament have received their due.”This is a reference to Ilaria Salis, an Italian activist who became an MEP in 2024, an election that brought an end tonearly 16 months of detention in Hungary, where she was accused of assaulting people suspected of far-right sympathies. Orbán’s political director, Balázs Orbán (no relation), has described Salis as a “far-left antifa activist”.This week, Salis narrowly survived an attempt by the Hungarian government to remove her immunity, afterMEPs voted by a majority of onenot to grant Budapest’s request. Salis says she is innocent and will not get a fair trial in Hungary, where legal experts have long concluded thatthe rule of law is compromised.She told the Guardian that Hungary’s use of the term “antifa” was a way of “stigmatising whoever dissents, whoever doesn’t agree with the regime”. She added: “If being anti-fascist means dissenting with his regime, of course I am an anti-fascist.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pawel Zerka, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump served as an important inspiration for the new right in Europe, who were willing to emulate his culture war in their own countries.In a recent report, Zerka argued that Trump and the US Maga movement arewaging a culture war on Europeby aggressively promoting ideological allies on the continent and seeking to humiliate European leaders on the world stage.Trump,the reportargues, provides credibility, framing and coherence to Europe’s new right, from Orbán in Hungary to National Rally leader Marine Le Pen in France, as well as critical infrastructure – conferences, media, funders and thinktanks – that “supports the formation of a Maga internationale”.The notion of antifa, “a copy-paste from the American political debate”, was another way of polarising European societies, Zerka said. “The mere fact that you can claim there is a dangerous political adversary … gives you a powerful engine to also mobilise your base and seek a certain cohesion among domestic forces.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightEuropeEuropean UnionDonald TrumpNetherlandsViktor OrbánHungarynewsShareReuse this content"

The remains of deceased hostages are expected to be sent to the national Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification.An unnamed Hamas official told Al Jazeera that living hostages had been gathered inGazaand the militant group would meet the Red Cross on Sunday night to agree the logistics of their release.There are 48 hostages still in Gaza,20 of whom are believed to be alive.An international taskforce will work on finding the remains of hostages not released on Monday, with many believed to be buried under the rubble somewhere in the devastated Gaza Strip.Israel will also release nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees, the vast majority of whom will be sent to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, once Israeli hostages are back on Israeli soil.Several Hamas commanders, prominent Palestinian political figures and detained doctors whose releases were requested by Hamas were not on the list of Palestinians to be freed. The doctors Hussam Abu Safiya and Marwan al-Hams, who were detained in Gaza during the war, as well as the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, were not on the list.Hamas said it was still in talks with Israeli negotiators to secure their release.View image in fullscreenMunicipal workers hang a sign near the airport in Sharm el-Sheikh, as the Egyptian Red Sea resort prepares to host a US-brokered international Gaza peace summit.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty ImagesThe hostage-detainee swap is the first step in Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire has been in place since Friday afternoon, but most of the details of the US president’s proposals need to be negotiatedbefore a lasting end to the war is established.The US president will visit Jerusalem on Monday to speak at the Knesset, as well as meeting families of the hostages.Trump will then fly to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt where he will co-chair a “peace summit” attended by the leaders of more than 20 countries aimed at finalising a permanent truce in Gaza.Donald Trump and Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to chair Gaza peace summit on MondayRead moreAs he boarded Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump said that the “war is over” and “everybody’s cheering”.“There are 500,000 people yesterday and today in Israel and also the Muslim and Arab countries all cheering … That’s never happened before,” he said.Palestinians are desperate to see the ceasefire extend into a permanent end to the war, after two years of an Israeli campaign that destroyed most of the strip, killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000. Israel stands accused of conducting genocide in Gaza by a UN commission of inquiry and several human rights bodies.View image in fullscreenPalestinian flags flutter on top of rubble in Gaza City.Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael denies the claim of genocide and says its conduct in the war, launched in retaliation for an attack by Hamas-led militants that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, constitutes self-defence.In Israel, preparations were under way to receive the hostages, who will be taken to a military base to undergo an examination before being taken to hospitals, which have run drills to prepare for the releases, using actors in place of hostages to practise.“We are very excited, waiting for our son and for all the 48 hostages,” Hagai Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages still held in Gaza, told Reuters.On Sunday night, tens of thousands of people cheered in “Hostages Square” in Tel Aviv as the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, spoke alongside Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.“I dreamed of this night. It’s been a long journey,” Witkoff said. The crowd yelled praise for Trump, but booed when Witkoff mentioned the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.Families in the occupied West Bank also prepared to receive loved ones who were being let out of Israeli jails. Israeli authorities instructed families not to be vocal in their celebrations and warned them to limit their interaction with the media.Roughly 2,000 Palestinian detainees are due to be let out around the same time as the hostages are released. About 1,700 were detainees from Gaza, while 250 were longtime prisoners of Israel, among them Palestinian leaders. About half of the 250 are to be released to Gaza or exiled to neighbouring countries, while the other half will be released to the West Bank or East Jerusalem.As preparations continued for the hostage swap, humanitarian groups geared up to send aid into Gaza.View image in fullscreenHumanitarian aid trucks enter the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.Photograph: Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty ImagesCogat, the Israeli military agency that oversees humanitarian aid in Gaza, said it expected about 600 trucks to enter the strip each day, starting on Sunday. This would restore aid to about prewar levels, after months of severely restricted aid into the strip.The UN said about 170,000 metric tonnes of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid was ready to enter Gaza once Israel permits its entry. Tents, high-energy food for malnourished children and menstrual hygiene supplies were among the prioritised aid items.A spokesperson for the World Food Programme, Abeer Etefa, said that roads were being cleared and repaired on Sunday to help facilitate future aid deliveries.The restoration of aid follows months of Israeli siege on Gaza, which resulted in famine in parts of the territory, according to the world’s leading authority on food crises. At least 459 people have died of hunger over the past two years and starvation has spread through the territory since May.The restoration of regular aid is mandated by the Trump plan. The UN will once again coordinate supplies into Gaza after months of being barred by Israel from doing so.1:20Drone footage shows destruction as Gazans reflect on returning back home – videoThe role of the private Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which was meant to replace the UN in aid distribution in Gaza, remained unclear. The foundation’s logistics sites in Gaza had stopped operating after the ceasefire deal started.The GHF was widely seen as a failure, with its model of distribution marked by overcrowding and death. More than 1,000 people were shot to death by Israeli soldiers during the daily scramble to access food at the GHF sites, chaos that aid groups said was brought on the foundation’s militarised model of provision. The GHF consistently denied any wrongdoing.A spokesperson for GHF told Reuters there was a temporary closure of aid sites during the hostage transfers, but that there was “no change to our long-term plan”.The US will deploy up to 200 troops in Israel to help establish a taskforce to assist with stabilisation efforts in Gaza. No US troops will be deployed within Gaza, but will advise the taskforce, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), from within Israel.The head of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper, met the Israeli military chief, Eyal Zamir, while travelling to Gaza alongside Witkoff and Kushner. Cooper said his visit was in service of the establishment of the CMCC.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His father, known for being stubborn, refused. Their argument was never finished – an Israeli airstrike hit his father’s home, burying his parents beneath the rubble.On Sunday, two days after the ceasefire was announced, Khadr returned to search through the ruins of his parents’ home. He spent the day sifting through shattered concrete and twisted metal for any sign of them. All he managed to find were some shards of their skulls and parts of their hands.View image in fullscreenGhali Khadr.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The Guardian“My father, a retired ambulance driver, was known for his strong will and patience. He did not know fear and was always optimistic,” said Khadr, 40, of Jabaliya in northernGaza.Khadr took the remains of his parents to the graveyard, but found that it too had been destroyed. He decided to bury them next to the few graves that were still intact.View image in fullscreenThe destruction left by Israel’s offensive on Gaza City.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianLike Khadr, thousands of Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza since Friday’s ceasefire with a grim task ahead of them: searching for loved ones killed weeks or months earlier in Israeli airstrikes and whose bodies are buried under the rubble.Gaza’s civil defence agency estimates that the bodies of about 10,000 people are trapped under the debris and collapsed buildings. The halt in the fighting has given the ambulance service the chance to finally start the search for the dead and give their families a chance at closure.The task ahead of the rescuers is immense given an estimated 60m tonnes of rubble across the territory.View image in fullscreenBodies unearthed by Israeli bulldozers in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianMost roads have been destroyed or blocked by debris. Civil defence workers are short of heavy equipment and have to use pickaxes and sledgehammers to break through collapsed buildings. Rescue crews have to move slowly. The debris is also full of unexploded bombs and ordnance.“At first, we are focusing on collecting the corpses lying in the streets to preserve what remains of them, especially with the presence of stray dogs that have been attacking bodies,” said Khaled al-Ayoubi, 64, the civil defence chief for northern Gaza.Other rescuers are forced to dig through rubble with their bare hands. So far, they have only recovered a fraction of the 10,000 missing people and have yet to begin searching through the ruins of multistorey buildings.View image in fullscreenPeople searching for the remains of their loved ones in the northern Gaza neighbourhood of Sheikh Radwan.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianIf Israel permits the entry of heavy equipment in the coming days, all the bodies should be recovered within six months to a year, said Dr Mohammed al-Mugheer, 38, the director of humanitarian support and international cooperation at the Gaza civil defence agency.Many residents of northern Gaza cannot bear to wait that long. They have begun to return to their ruined homes to search for their loved ones on their own.Yahya al-Muqra, 32, from Jabaliya, believes his brother, Sharif, is dead. He lost contact with him after an Israeli airstrike on their home on 25 July. He managed to visit the razed buildingbut found no sign of Sharif’s body.“We went to check the area, but found no trace of him, as if he had vanished, the house and everything around it had turned to rubble,” Muqra said. “Witnesses said they last saw him near the house.” His brother suffered from epilepsy, and he worries that even if the airstrike did not kill him, he would have died without his medication.On Sunday, Muqra finally had the time to search for his brother, but working by himself he could find no sign of him.View image in fullscreenPalestinians search the rubble in Khan Younis.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty Images“I was hoping to find something that proves Sharif was there, a piece of clothing, any trace. We really need heavy machinery to search under the rubble, but these machines are unavailable,” he said.For many families, the pain of not knowing where, when or how their loved ones died is immense. They have spent months in exile from their homes, waiting in limbo for the chance to find even a fragment of those they lost, something to say goodbye to.Providing families with that chance is what drives Gaza’s rescue workers, who labour painstakingly under the intense sun while anxious families wait by their side.“Families feel that recovering the bodies of their martyrs is a way to honour them and preserve their souls, and it reassures them that their loved ones truly became martyrs and are no longer alive,” said Fadi al-Salibi, 35, a civil defence employee.Muqra hopes that the coming days will reveal something about his brother’s fate. With the cemeteries in his neighbourhood destroyed, he plans to bury Sharif in the garden of his home.“My heart is broken because my brother has not been buried yet. Even a single bone would allow us to lay him to rest and feel some relief,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

The attacks came after the Taliban regime in Afghanistan accused Pakistan of carrying out airstrikes on Afghan territory, including in the capital, Kabul, earlier this week.On Sunday, Pakistan responded with retaliatory strikes, gunfire and ground raids on AfghanTalibanposts along the border.In a statement, the media wing of the Pakistan military said 23 soldiers had been killed and another 29 wounded in the attacks. They claimed that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” from the Afghan side were killed in their retaliatory strikes and that terrorist training camps had been dismantled.The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid had earlier claimed that Taliban forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in the attacks, while just nine from the Taliban side were killed.View image in fullscreenTaliban security personnel patrol in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, Afghanistan.Photograph: Qudratullah Razwan/EPAThe clashes signal a new low in Afghan-Pakistan relations, which have become increasingly hostile amid claims that Afghanistan is giving a safe haven to Islamist militants carrying out an escalating number of deadly attacks on Pakistani soil.Early on Sunday morning, the Taliban government’s defence ministry said its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border. “If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation’s borders and will deliver a strong response,” said the ministry.Pakistan’s media wing accused the Afghan Taliban of launching attacks to “facilitate terrorism”.“Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces,” said the statement.“We will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan … the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.”The cross-border strikes came after two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in south-eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks. Pakistan has neither denied nor confirmed carrying out the Kabul strike, only stating that it had carried out “a series of retribution operations”.Analysts said recent days showed just how volatile the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border had become. The two countries share a nearly 1,600-mile (2,600km) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line, which is contested by Afghanistan.Since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Pakistan government has accused them of giving shelter to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamist militant group who are behind a deadly rise in insurgent attacks in Pakistan’s border region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.MapThousands of TTP militant attacks – mostly targeting Pakistani police, paramilitary and army – have been carried out over the past four years, leaving more than 2,500 dead. Islamabad has grown increasingly impatient with Kabul, publicly calling on the Afghan Taliban to stop harbouring TTP militants, accusing them of turning a blind eye to training camps and giving funding and arms to TTP fighters who carry out attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations backed by UN findings.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said “Pakistan’s patience with Kabul had been wearing thin” as TTP attacks continued to escalate. Just earlier this week, at least three senior army officers, including 20 soldiers, were killed in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. According to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, there have been more than 600 attacks by TTP so far this year, the most in a decade.Gul described the clashes as a “logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”Speaking at a press conference in Delhi, where he was on an official visit to India this week, the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, denied that Afghanistan was giving shelter to TTP fighters. “There is no safe haven for TTP in Afghanistan,” he said.Muttaqi said the situation along the Afghan-Pakistan border was now “under control” and that allies Qatar and Saudi Arabia had reached out to “express that the war should stop”.“Afghanistan has the right to keep its territory and its borders safe and so it has retaliated to the violation,” he said. “We achieved the objective of our retaliatory mission … so from our end, we have stopped.”Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, described the border situation as “precarious”. He emphasised that while the cash-strapped Taliban in Afghanistan “lacks the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on”, he cautioned that the strikes could further fuel the cross-border militant insurgency in Pakistan.“The risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan,” said Kugelman. “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanPakistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

Even so, some have clearly fared better, and millennials are leading the charge in buy-to-let investment, according to analysis of Companies House data by the estate agent Hamptons.Buy-to-let firms become biggest single type of business in UK, data showsRead moreFor the first time, millennials made up 50% of all new shareholders in buy-to-let companies set up so far this year. Five years ago, they made up 40% of buy-to-let shareholders.So far this year, three-quarters of shareholders in new companies were under 50 – up from 68% a decade ago. While tax rises and tighter regulations have prompted some landlords to sell up, the influx of younger investors has helped sustain landlord purchases.The share of homes bought by a landlord acrossEnglandand Wales remained unchanged from the same time last year, despite an increase in the second home stamp duty surcharge. Landlords now pay a 5% surcharge as of April, up from 3% previously.Across the country, landlords accounted for 11.3% of property purchases in the third quarter, a small uptick from 11.2% a year earlier.Hamptons estimates that millennial landlords will create 33,395 new buy-to-let companies this year – more than twice the number incorporated in 2020.These purchases are increasingly concentrated outside the south of England, previously a property hotspot. Together, London, the south-east, south-west and east of England accounted for 34% of investor purchases across EnglandWalesin the July-to-September quarter. In 2016, these regions accounted for 50% of purchases.Investors are increasingly trying to buy in the north of England, where yields are higher and cheaper properties mean stamp duty costs are lower. More than a quarter (28.4%) of homes sold in the north-east were bought by a landlord, compared with 8% in London.The average rent for a newly let home in Britain fell by 0.3% in the year to September – down £4 a month from £1,402 to £1,398, Hamptons said. This marks a notable shift from the 4.2% annual growth recorded a year earlier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For cabinet ministers this equates to just under £17,000.Under the new system, those who serve for fewer than six months will be expected to not take the payment, while those who get a new ministerial job within three months will be asked to not take a salary until the end of that three-month period.With Acoba abolished, Sir Laurie Magnus, Starmer’s independent adviser on ministerial standards, will adjudicate on job appointment rules for ex-ministers. The Civil Service Commission, which regulates recruitment into the civil service, will do this for former civil servants and government special advisers.TheEthicsand Integrity Commission is, however, not an entirely new organisation, but takes on the work of the existing Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), which was tasked with giving the prime minister advice on broader ethical standards.The commission will be headed by the CSPL’s existing chair, Doug Chalmers, a former soldier who ended his military career as deputy chief of defence staff.In a letter to Chalmers marking the new commission, Starmer said one of the organisation’s tasks should be to make sure ministers and civil servants help other public servants meet their responsibilities under the still-to-be-passedHillsborough law, which obliges them to act with honesty and candour and avoid cover-ups.The announcement said: “The prime minister has made clear public service is a privilege and is committed to showing how politics can be a force for good. The government’s manifesto pledge to set the highest standards in public life to restore trust between the public and politics.”Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister of state for the Cabinet Office, said the Ethics and Integrity Commission “will play a central role” in ensuring the government delivers its pre-election promise to uphold the highest standards in public office.It remains to be seen how big an impact will come from a minor reorganisation of the framework for monitoring ethical standards, and the creation of a new, top-level watchdog, the job of which is not to enforce rules but to help make sure others to do so.As well as Magnus’s office and the Civil Service Commission, other ethics-related bodies for public life include the parliamentary standard commissioner, parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Service, the House of Lords Appointments Commission, the Electoral Commission, the UK Parliamentary Standards Authority and the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRegulatorsCivil serviceEthicsKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

It is seen as key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries – although there isfierce debateover its use, with claims that heat pumps powered by electricity are much more efficient.Gary Smith, the general secretary of theGMB union, said: “The success of this trial is a significant moment for our country’s energy future. It highlights the vital role that innovation across our industrial heartlands can play in creating highly skilled unionised jobs in working-class communities, an essential part of any credible plan to meet our net zero obligations.”Centrica and National Gas are urging the government to back the use of hydrogen blends of up to 5% in the UK’s gas system.Jon Butterworth, the chief executive of NationalGas, said: “It’s another crucial milestone on Britain’s hydrogen journey, showing how blending can fuel our power stations and unlock new investment opportunities for producers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had high blood pressure in her pulmonary arteries which caused an increased resistance to blood flow through the lungs, which led to irreversible lung damage and heart failure.Mitchell had her combined transplant at Royal Papworth hospital in September 1987, a procedure so rare that only about five are carried out in the UK each year.“Thanks to organ donation, I was given the gift of a normal life,” she said.“I think about my donor a lot, especially on the anniversary of the transplant. I think about their family and what their family must have felt at the time.“I just know my donor was a young female. Her family made that decision at a terrible time in their lives. I am so grateful.“It’s quite difficult to put into words how it feels to know I am now the longest-lived heart-lung recipient in the UK. It’s mixed feelings.View image in fullscreenKatie Mitchell on a treadmill during her recovery after her transplantPhotograph: NHSBT/PA“People I know who had the same transplant have passed away in front of me, but it’s a blessing and amazing to feel I’ve had all this extra time.“I don’t really know why it has worked so well. Perhaps the immunosuppressants suit me well. Everybody has so many different reactions to the medications, and everyone has their own regimen.”There are currently 8,124 people on the UK transplant waiting list, including 12 waiting for a heart and lung transplant.Mitchell’s transplant is functioning well. She also had two kidney transplants from deceased donors in 1994 and 2015.Mitchell, from Sidcup in south-east London, said: “I went to an event at Papworth and there were a couple of young women who had their heart-lung transplants recently.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tory party membership figures are not made public, but recent reports say the total is slightly above 120,000.Such numbers do not necessarily translate into electoral success, with Labour having had a peak of more than 500,000 members under Jeremy Corbyn, who lost two general elections. And while one recent poll put the Greens at 15%, most such surveys have put the party nearer to 11% or 12%, not much changed since Polanski took charge.But the influx of members does point to Polanski’s apparent ability to galvanise attention and enthusiasm for a party that has often struggled to get its message across, with a mass of interviews, social media videos and TV appearances.The Greens’ surge has caused worries among some senior Labour figures, who believe it could take votes and seats from the party in next May’s local elections in England, particularly in some London boroughs.Polanski has repeatedly set out what he sees as the Greens’ ambition to supplant Labour. Ina speech this monthto the party’s annual conference, he said that without action Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Reform UK.Responding to the new membership figure, Polanski said: “More than 100,000 people have now joined the Green movement. That’s 100,000 people who believe politics can be honest, fair and hopeful again.“When I was elected leader last month, I said that we’re not here to be disappointed with Labour but that we’re here to replace them. I was serious. Because while Labour talks about change, people can see in their weekly shop, their utility bills and crumbling services, Labour are offering more of the same.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A path of building, a path of healing, and I hope - a path of uniting hearts,” Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahusaid in a televised statement.Such optimism was shared broadly.“There is a lot of joy among the people,” said Abdou Abu Seada, a resident of Gaza who added that the joy was tempered by exhaustion after two years of war that has destroyed much of Gaza.Government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said Israel expected hostages to start being released early on Monday morning with the 20 living hostages to be released together.In the event that hostages were released earlier, Israel was ready to receive them, she said. Their release is to be followed later by the handover of bodies of the remaining 28 deceased hostages.Under the ceasefire agreement,Hamasis due by noon on Monday to release the remaining hostages. They were taken captive on 7 October 2023 when the group’s militants launched the surprise attack on Israel that ignited the war.Israel is also to release 1,700 Palestinians who have been detained in Gaza since 7 October 2023, and 22 Palestinian minors, along with the bodies of 360 militants. Bedrosian said the prisoners would be released once the living hostages reach Israeli territory.Israel’s hostages coordinator, Gal Hirsch, said on Thursday a taskforce would be formed to help find the remains of any dead hostages that Hamas could not locate.Trump is due to arrive in Israel on Monday to address the Knesset, the parliament, before travelling to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt for aworld leaders’ summiton ending the Gaza war.Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, will also attend the summit, an Axios reporter said on Sunday, citing a senior Palestinian official.Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner addressed a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday, which many Israelis hoped would be the final one urging the release of hostages and an end to the war. The US, along with Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, mediated what has been described as a first phase agreement between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and the release of hostages by Hamas and prisoners and detainees by Israel.‘Trump is like a juggernaut’: how the Gaza ceasefire deal was doneRead more“For two years we [have been] waiting for this day for this moment ... All of us feel happy for the family, for the hostages, that finally ... we will see them,” said demonstrator Dalia Yosef, thanking Trump.Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said that once the hostages were returned, the military would destroy underground tunnels in Gaza built by Hamas. Palestinians returning to northern Gaza have described widespread devastation. Rescue workers warned there could be unexploded ordnance and bombs in the area.Amjad al-Shawa, who heads a Palestinian organisation coordinating with aid groups, estimated 300,000 tents were needed to temporarily house 1.5 million displaced Gazans.“We couldn’t believe the destruction we have seen,” Rami Mohammad-Ali, 37, said by phone after walking 15km (9.5 miles) with his son from Deir al-Balah to Gaza City.“We are joyful to return to Gaza [City] but at the same time we have bitter feelings about the destruction,” he said, describing seeing human remains scattered along roads.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warUS foreign policyIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

The last time a president called on it was in 1992 when the governor of California requested military aid from George HW Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles.In Sunday’s Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn’t felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities.Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday afederal judge prohibitedthe deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”.National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by theTrump administrationfrom both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets.Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places inChicagowhere people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”.In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”.In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America’s biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with thehighest murder rates– all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans.As Vance did the rounds of Sunday’s political talkshows, tension between the Trump administration and the Democratic states it is targeting exploded across TV screens. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump’s “political enemies”.Vance skirted the question until he was pressed into saying: “He should suffer consequences. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.”Pritzker responded to the veiled threat by accusing Vance of coming out with a “tidal wave of lies”. The governor told This Week that he was not intimidated by the prospect of prosecution as has befallen the former FBI directorJames Comeyand the New York attorney generalLetitia James, who have both been indicted in recent days.US immigration enforcement using military hardware and tactics on civiliansRead morePritzker said: “I am not afraid. Do I think he could do it? He might. But as I have said before, come and get me. I mean, you’re dead wrong, Mr President and Mr Vice-President, and I will stand up for the law and the constitution.”Raw emotions were widely on display across the TV studios as thefederal government shutdownentered day 12. The Republican House speaker,Mike Johnson, told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”.He said that after eight attempts to reopen the government had all failed in votes in the Senate, the shutdown was causing “real pain for real people – and the Democrats don’t seem to care”.On the same program, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, denied that the Democratic stance was partisan. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said.The Democrats’ aim, Jeffries added, was to “improve the quality of life of the American people and address the healthcare crisis that threatens tens of millions of people across the country”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryDonald TrumpJD VanceUS politicsChicagonewsShareReuse this content"

Asked about the injuries to his torso that he suffered during the incident, the former New York Jets quarterback said: “I’m recovering slowly, it’s a long process”.Sanchezfaces a felony battery chargeover the incident last weekend. Sanchez, who was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts game with the Raiders for Fox Sports, was involved in a confrontation with a 69-year-old truck driver, Perry Tole, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Tole, who was left with a deep laceration to his face, said he feared for his life during the incident and pepper sprayed and stabbed Sanchez. Police say the incident happened after a dispute over a parking space.Sanchez could face up to six years in jail if he is found guilty of the battery charge. He is due to attend a court hearing on 5 November.Tole has also filed a lawsuitagainst Sanchez, with his lawyers saying their client suffered “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress.Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which also include battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle.Fox Sports has yet to address Sanchez’s long-term future with the broadcaster. The Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009NFLdraft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsIndianapolisFoxUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The office urged travelers to be cautious and put property owners on alert as high tide approached.All ofNew Jerseyhas been under a state of emergency since Saturday night. It is expected to last into Monday, authorizing the state’s emergency services personnel to be activated as necessary.Parts of the state are forecast to experience moderate to major coastal flooding, inland flash flooding, winds up to 60mph (97kph), up to 5in (about 13cm) of rain and high surf, potentially causing beach erosion. Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches.The National Weather Service placedNew YorkCity, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3in of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.Wind gusts of more than 30mph (48km/h) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning.Utilities in the area have added more than 1,600 workers to respond to the storm.“With high wind warnings and flood risks, staying alert, vigilant and taking steps to prepare is crucial for everyone’s safety,” the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said in a statement.Some flight delays and cancellations were announced in airports from Washington DC to Boston.The storm was expected to move out by Monday night.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherNew JerseyNew YorkNorth CarolinaSouth CarolinanewsShareReuse this content"

We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.Trump threatens 100% China tariffs as Beijing restricts rare-earth exportsRead more“If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.”Trump and senior US administration officials opened a door to a China trade deal on Sunday as market futures showed another US stock market drop.“Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!” Trumpwroteon Truth Social.The message came afterJD Vancecalled on Beijing to “choose the path of reason” in the latest spiralling trade fight between the world’s two leading economies that has shaken stock markets.Dow futures showed a drop of 887 points ahead of the stock markets’ open on Monday. The index dropped sharply lower on Friday after reignited fears of a trade war with China when threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports after China said it would restrict rare earth exports. The Dow fell 879 points, or 1.9%.“It’s going to be a delicate dance, and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond,” Vance said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures. “If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you, the president of the United States has far more cards than the People’s Republic of China. If, however, they’re willing to be reasonable,” he said, then the US would, too.The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry.It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks.China insisted on Sunday thatits latest export controls on rare earthssuch as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate.“China’s export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of thousands more are working without pay. They are being “held hostage by a political dispute”, according to union leaders, asRepublicansand Democrats remain deadlocked.In the Oval Office on Tuesday,Donald Trumpsuggested that furloughed employees would not necessarily receive back pay – despite a legal guarantee – prompting further unease throughout the federal workforce. “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way,” the US president said.The administration, meanwhile, continues to threaten mass firings ifDemocratsstand by their demands. “If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial,” Trump told reporters. “And a lot of those jobs will never come back.”Democrats introduce bill to help federal workers cover childcare costs during shutdownRead moreOn Friday, Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget (OMB) director, announced on social media that layoffs had begun. Several federal agenciesstarted announcing layoffs, but details remained scant on how many workers would be impacted.After abrutal year for the federal workforce, employees who spoke to the Guardian expressed growing anxiety over their pay – and the future of their jobs.“This is the third time I’ve been furloughed in my federal career,” said Priscilla Novak, a furloughed federal employee researcher. “But this is the first time there were threats of having people be fired en masse. I’ve been checking my email every day to see if I’m fired yet.”“Even before the shutdown, it’s just kind of been one thing after another for us,” said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “I think a lot of us are expecting the worst, hoping for the best.”“Not knowing when my next paycheck is going to get here is definitely very daunting,” Farruggia, also executive committee chair of AFGE Local 2883, which represents CDC workers, added. “But at least I paid rent this month, so that was probably the most important thing. If some of my other bills go by the wayside, then it is what it is, and I don’t really have any other options to seek out.”“What I’m hearing is a lot of anxiety, confusion, and chaos,” said Brent Barron, a US Department of Labor employee who serves as president of the National Council of Field Labor Locals, which represents workers at the department outside Washington DC. Some staffers don’t even know whether they’re furloughed or not, he claimed, let alone “whether or not they’re going to continue to have a job” for much longer.“There are a lot of employees out there that can’t even miss one check, let alone have this thing drag on for weeks and weeks and weeks,” said Barron. About three-quarters of the labor department has been furloughed. “All we want to do is do our jobs.”A law signed by Trump during his first term, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, guarantees all federal workers receive retroactive back pay once a government shutdown is over.“It really baffles me that this administration can just flaunt whatever law and say they don’t have to follow it,” said Barron. “This is a law that was passed in 2019 by Congress and signed by the president. And we all know who was president in 2019.”Trump officials are now facing calls to clarify that the federal government will follow the law, and ensure that every furloughed employee receives back pay.“Given the clarity of the law, there is no place for the Administration to backpedal on its obligation to pay furloughed workers,” labor unions and Democracy Defenders Fund, a watchdog group, wrote to the OMB on Wednesday. “The Administration’s statements appear to be a naked attempt at inflicting pain on innocent parties to gain advantage in the shutdown.”OMB is led by Vought, an architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint. In aprivate speech in 2023, Vought spoke of wanting to put officials “through trauma” to reduce the capacity of the federal government. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work.”As the administration continues to threaten mass layoffs, raising the prospect of further cuts beyond the300,000 federal employeesset to be removed from the government by the end of this year through firings andattrition programs, officials have also beenorderedby a federal judge to provide specifics on the status of any layoff plans, the agencies affected, and whether any federal employees have been recalled to work to carry out reductions in force.“The American people and the workers who keep this country running are being held hostage by a political dispute, by a petty political dispute that they have nothing to do with,” Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO’s transportation trades department, said during a press conference this week. “This is entirely vindictive and the only victims are going to be this country.“We’ve all seen the reports every single time we go through this stupid process of a shutdown, how much the American taxpayers lost. It’s a drain on our economy. It’s a drain on our safety. It’s a drain on the people that live here. So we need to put this to an end.”‘People cannot focus on their jobs’Almost all Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are required to work without pay during shutdowns, in a bid to minimize the threat of disruptions at key travel hubs like airports.The uncertainty has been particularly unnerving for newer, lower-paid employees, according to Cameron Cochems, a lead TSA officer and vice-president for AFGE Local 1127, which represents the administration’s employees in Idaho.Workers are worried about when they start missing paychecks, he said, adding that several have asked where to get low interest loans to float them through missed paychecks.“It feels kind of like there’s just a train coming and you can hear the whistle blowing, but every day it gets a little closer and closer to us,” Cochems told the Guardian. “And right now we can barely hear the whistle because we’re still focused on our jobs, we’re still focused on the mission, which is protect the nation’s transportation system to ensure freedom of movement for people in commerce.“But once that paycheck doesn’t come, I think that that train whistle is going to get louder in everyone’s heads, and it could get so loud that people cannot focus on their job because they’re focusing on things like ‘The bank is calling me for the fifth time today’, or ‘I don’t know how to pay for my daycare,’ things like that.”Empty tollbooths, ‘devastated’ visitors: shutdown throws US national parks into limboRead moreThreats made about federal workers not being entitled to back pay by Trump and his top officials have heightened anxieties and fears and “thrown a lot more people for a loop, especially the people that are disadvantaged, single parents or living paycheck to paycheck”, added Cochems.“It just feels like they’re intentionally using us as political pawns, and they intentionally want to make our jobs and lives unstable,” he said.“Even worse than morale is the future implication for how our government runs,” added Novak. “I think having a strong civil service that is not politically motivated is the most effective to render modern services for our citizens. Furloughed workers want to go back to work. We need Congress to pass a budget.”The White House and office of management and budget did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsUS politicsDonald TrumpEconomicsTrump administrationUS CongressfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and fingerprints scanned before they are allowed into Europe’s Schengen area. The system will eventually replace passports being stamped by border officials.What is EES?It is not a replacement for passport control. Travellers will still have to go through checks with border officials at ports. But eventually they will not have their passport stamped – instead, countries in the Schengen area will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates.The system is being introduced to make border crossing faster and more efficient, while also tracking who is coming in and out. The EU says it will also give it information that will be used for security purposes.This is the start of a phased introduction of the system. It is scheduled to be fully in place by 10 April 2026.Where does it apply and to whom?The EES applies to the Schengen area, which comprises 25 of the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.It includes countries where British people travel to frequently for holidays such as Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Italy.The Republic of Ireland and Cyprus are not part of the Schengen area and so will continue to process passports as before.The EES applies to people who are not from an EU country or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – although there are some exceptions such as people who have long-stay visas, among others.How does it work?When someone arrives at the border for the first time after the EES is in place, they will use a self-service screen to register their name, passport details, fingerprints, and the date and place of entry and exit. The machine will photograph their face. Children under 12 will not have their fingerprints scanned.When people first come into contact with the EES depends on where they are travelling to and when.Coach and foot passengers going through theport of Doverwill go through a new facility for EES processing from Sunday. From November, this will apply to all traffic. Coach passengers goingthrough the Eurotunnelwill also go through the checks from Sunday.The process will be rolled out gradually over the coming months on Eurostar, which has installed registration terminals at its departure areas at St Pancras International in London.For other trips the process will happen when travellers get to the destination country.Airports are implementing the changes at different times. For example, Germany will phase in the service starting with a small airport in Stuttgart and then build up to operations in Frankfurt, one of the busiest aviation hubs in Europe.Will I have to get to Dover earlier?There have been concernsthat the extra time it takes to process the EES data will lead to delays. However, the port of Dover has asked coach drivers not to arrive at the port any more than two hours before travel.Eurostar has said that the time it will take for the process can be squeezed into the current 75-minute window passengers are asked to spend at the station before departure.And the chief executive of Eurotunnel, Yann Leriche, has said the company is fully prepared and does not expect lengthy queues.Border officials have been told they have discretion to suspend EES if queues are building.What will happen to the data that is collected?The data provided digitally through the EES will kept for three years, with some exceptions, after which it is erased.It can be used by border, visa and immigration authorities in the countries using the system as well as local police and Europol, the EU agency for law enforcement.The EU says that the information may be transferred to another country, outside Schengen, or an international organisation, such as a UN body, under “strict conditions”.If travellers cross the border again, within the three-year period, the process should be quicker as the face picture and fingerprints will already be on file.If a person refuses to provide a picture or have their fingerprints takenthen they will be refused entry, the EU says.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeTravel & leisureBrexitexplainersShareReuse this content"

But Fields was sacked by Jonathon Cooper and Justin Strnad on fourth-and-eight from the Denver 44 after Aaron Glenn opted to go for it rather than send out Nick Folk for a long field-goal attempt. Folk had successfully converted all three of his field goals.Fields struggled all game, completing nine of 17 passes for just 45 yards. The Jets finished with minus-10 net yards passing, the fewest in any game since the Chargers had minus-19 against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1998.“Our passing game was non-existent,” Glenn said after the game.Dallas Cowboys 27–30 Carolina PanthersRico Dowdle went over 200 yards from scrimmage for the second straight week – this time against his former team – and rookie Ryan Fitzgerald kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired as the Carolina Panthers (3-3) defeated the Dallas Cowboys (2-3-1) in a wild back-and-forth. Bryce Young completed 17 of 25 passes for 199 yards and threw two of his three touchdown passes to rookie Tetairoa McMillan. The Panthers improved to 3-0 at home. Dowdle ran for 183 yards on 30 carries and caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown for the Panthers.San Francisco 49ers 19–30 Tampa Bay BuccaneersBaker Mayfield’s heroics came early in the fourth quarter instead of the final minutes. Mayfield threw two touchdown passes and had a spectacular scramble to help the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-1) beat the San Francisco 49ers (4-2). After winning four games with scores in the last minute, the Buccaneers didn’t have to come back late to secure this victory. The injury-riddled 49ers lost four-time All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner to a serious right ankle injury in the first quarter. Mayfield made a critical play when he scrambled for a first down on third-and-14.Los Angeles Rams 17–3 Baltimore RavensThe Los Angeles Rams (4-2) finished the first half with a goalline stand and then Matthew Stafford guided them to a pair of touchdowns to begin the third quarter in their victory over the Baltimore Ravens (1-5). The Rams weren’t at their best, but they didn’t have to be against a spiraling Baltimore team who were without injured quarterback Lamar Jackson for a second straight weekend. The Ravens managed a field goal on their first drive and nothing more. It was tied at 3-3 late in the first half when the Ravens had first-and-goal from the four-yard line. The Rams stopped four straight runs.Arizona Cardinals 27–31 Indianapolis ColtsDaniel Jones threw two touchdown passes and Jonathan Taylor ran for the go-ahead score with 4:32 left, giving the Indianapolis Colts (5-1) victory over the Arizona Cardinals (2-4). Jones finished 22 of 30 for 212 yards with one interception. He also ran for a score. Taylor had 21 carries for 123 yards, and rookie tight end Tyler Warren caught six passes for 63 yards and a touchdown. Indy remained perfect at home by winning their sixth straight at Lucas Oil Stadium. Arizona lost their fourth straight, blowing a fourth-quarter lead for the second consecutive week.Seattle Seahawks 20–12 Jacksonville JaguarsSam Darnold threw touchdown passes to Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp, and Seattle dominated both lines of scrimmage on their way to victory. Smith-Njigba finished with eight receptions for 162 yards as the Seahawks (4-2) rebounded from a last-second loss to Tampa Bay at home. They had few issues traveling cross-country for an early start, controlled most of the way and improved to 22-6 over the last decade in 1pm kickoffs on the East Coast. The Jaguars (4-2), meanwhile, looked every bit like a team that spent the week reveling in a Monday night victory against Kansas City.Cleveland Browns 9–23 Pittsburgh SteelersAaron Rodgers passed for 235 yards and two touchdowns, and the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-1) had little trouble with the Cleveland Browns (1-5). The Steelers strengthened their early grip on the AFC North by continuing their home mastery of the Browns. Cleveland’s regular-season losing streak at Acrisure Stadium hit 22 games after another lifeless performance by its offense. Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel passed for 221 yards but couldn’t lead the league’s second-lowest scoring offense to the end zone as Cleveland failed to crack the 17-point barrier for the 11th consecutive game. Rodgers threw TD passes to Connor Heyward and DK Metcalf.Los Angeles Chargers 29–27 Miami DolphinsJustin Herbert escaped the Dolphins’ pass rush and connected with Ladd McConkey for a 42-yard catch-and-run in the final minute. That set up Cameron Dicker’s fifth field goal of the game, and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-2) rallied to beat Miami. The Dolphins overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter and took the lead when Tua Tagovailoa threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining. Nyheim Hines set the Chargers up at Miami’s 35 with a 40-yard return of the ensuing kickoff. Then Herbert found McConkey and Dicker’s 33-yard kick won it for Los Angeles, who snapped a two-game skid. The Dolphins (1-5) were booed off the field at Hard Rock Stadium.Cincinnati Bengals 18–27 Green Bay PackersJosh Jacobs rushed for two touchdowns and the Green Bay Packers (3-1-1) held off Cincinnati (2-4) for a victory in Joe Flacco’s Bengals debut. Jacobs had a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and opened the fourth by scoring on a 14-yard burst up the middle. Jordan Love went 19 of 26 for 259 yards with an interception and a 19-yard touchdown pass to Tucker Kraft. Lucas Havrisik sealed the win by making the second of his two field goals, a 39-yarder with 1:52 remaining. Flacco went 29 of 45 for 219 yards with two second-half touchdown passes five days after the Bengals acquired him from Cleveland.New England Patriots 25-19 New Orleans SaintsDrake Maye passed for 261 yards and three touchdowns and the visiting New England Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints. Maye completed 18 of 26 passes as the Patriots (4-2) matched their win total from last season while improving to 3-0 on the road. Spencer Rattler completed 20 of 26 for 227 yards but no touchdowns and Blake Grupe kicked four field goals for the Saints (1-5).Tennessee Titans 10-20 Las Vegas RaidersGeno Smith passed for 174 yards and a touchdown, and Devin White led a suffocating Raiders defense as Las Vegas defeated the Tennessee Titans. The Raiders (2-4) ended a four-game skid, and the Titans (1-5) missed an opportunity to win consecutive games for the first time since November 2022. Neither of the struggling teams did much on offense. They combined for 451 yards. Las Vegas won fairly easily despite pedestrian numbers from Smith and Ashton Jeanty, who rushed for 75 yards and a touchdown on a 3.3-per-play average. The Raiders set the tone in the first half, when they shut out the Titans.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The school fired their longtime head coach on Sunday, less than 24 hours after a 22-21 home loss to Northwestern all but ended whatever remote chance the preseason No 2 team had of reaching the College Football Playoff.Terry Smith will serve as the interim head coach for the rest of the season for the Nittany Lions (3-3, 0-3 Big Ten), who began the year with hopes of winning the national title only to have those hopes evaporate by early October amid a string of losses, each one more stinging than the last.Penn State, who reached the CFP semifinals 10 months ago, fell at home to Oregon in overtime in late September. A road loss at previously winless UCLA followed. The final straw came on Saturday at Beaver Stadium, where the Nittany Lions let Northwestern escape with a victory and lost quarterback Drew Allar to injury for the rest of the season.Franklin went 104-45 during his 11-plus seasons at Penn State. Yet the Nittany Lions often stumbled against top-tier opponents, going 4-21 against teams ranked in the top 10 during his tenure.There was hope this fall might be the one when Penn State would finally break through. Yet after three easy wins during a light non-conference schedule, the Nittany Lions crumbled.Athletic director Pat Kraft said the school owes Franklin –who is due nearly $50m in a buyoutof his contract, which went through to 2031 – an “enormous amount of gratitude” for leading the Nittany Lions back to relevance but felt it was time to make a change.“We hold our athletics programs to the highest of standards, and we believe this is the right moment for new leadership at the helm of our football program to advance us toward Big Ten and national championships,” Kraft said.The move will cost Penn State at a time the athletic department has committed to a $700m renovation to Beaver Stadium. The project is expected to be completed by 2027.Former athletic director Sandy Barbour signed Franklin to a 10-year contract extension worth up to $85m in 2021. According to terms of the deal, Penn State will have to pay Franklin’s base salary of $500,000, supplemental pay of $6.5m and insurance loan of $1m until 2031.It’s a steep price, but one the university appears willing to pay to find a coach who can complete the climb to a national title.“We have the best college football fans in America, a rich tradition of excellence, significant investments in our program, compete in the best conference in college sports and have a state-of-the-art renovated stadium on the horizon,” Kraft said. “I am confident in our future and in our ability to attract elite candidates to lead our program.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A judge ruled Sanchez had to undergo the processing before he is allowed to leave Indiana.Former NFL star Mark Sanchez replaced in Fox booth for Sunday’s game after stabbing incidentRead more“I am just focused on my recovery and I want to thank the first responders,” Sancheztold CBS/Fox Indianapolis journalist Max Lewisoutside Marion County Jail. The 38-year-old then appeared to grow emotional as he thanked the surgeon who operated on him “she saved my life … I’m grateful for that”. Asked about the injuries to his torso that he suffered during the incident, the former New York Jets quarterback said: “I’m recovering slowly, it’s a long process”.Sanchezfaces a felony battery chargeover the incident last weekend. Sanchez, who was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts game with the Raiders for Fox Sports, was involved in a confrontation with a 69-year-old truck driver, Perry Tole, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Tole, who was left with a deep laceration to his face, said he feared for his life during the incident and pepper sprayed and stabbed Sanchez. Police say the incident happened after a dispute over a parking space.Sanchez could face up to six years in jail if he is found guilty of the battery charge. He is due to attend a court hearing on 5 November.Tole has also filed a lawsuitagainst Sanchez, with his lawyers saying their client suffered “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress.Sanchez has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, which also include battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle.Fox Sports has yet to address Sanchez’s long-term future with the broadcaster. The Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009NFLdraft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsIndianapolisFoxUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Having star turns such as Havertz, Madueke and now Ødegaard succumb to long-term injury is a reminder of the risk of being derailed, but it does feel like we’ve never been better equipped to cope with the slings and arrows. Arteta is still unwrapping his new toys and figuring out the best way to use them – can’t wait to see how the chemistry develops.Best 90 minsNewcastle away.Worst 90 minsThese were far from our worst all-round displays, but the source of most frustration so far was the timid approach taken against both Liverpool andManchester Citywhen our two biggest competitors were there for the taking.Best goalThe93rd-minute equaliser by Martinelliagainst City. Eze’s assist and Martinelli’s finish were exquisite and a much-needed confidence boost for both players. It blew the stadium roof off, too.Best opponentLove him or hate him, Haaland is an unstoppable beast.

The window was a disappointing one, and the new blood has yet to fire. Elliott is probably good but looks like he’s running through treacle and Guessand splits opinion, though I think he’ll be OK. Thankfully, more recently, with McGinn scoring freely and the back four miserly again (hard to believe Konsa could get any better but he has) there have been clear signs our evolving style will reap rewards. And, excitingly, we’ve started very brightly in Europe. If we can get Watkins and Rogers back on the same wavelength we can challenge the protected elite.Best 90 mins2-1 at home to Burnleydoesn’t scream emphatic, but their keeper was inspired and several of our key players looked on the verge of fully recapturing their best form. This too was a day when Bogarde showed he’s ready for serious top-flight work.Worst 90 minsSunday at 7pm at home to bogey teamCrystal Palacehad “end to long home unbeaten record” written all over it. And so it proved, spinelessly so, a clear nadir since Emery took over.Best goalMalen’s second against Burnleywas textbook half-opening to net ripple.Best opponentThe boy Josh King atFulham.

Written off by many so-called media experts (again), we’re outperforming expectations (again). It’s only seven games played, but to be unbeaten in six of those since the narrow defeat at Anfield on the opening day is remarkable. The recruitment team deserve great credit in the replacements they’ve brought in, replacing Kepa, Zabarnyi, Huijsen and Kerkez with Petrovic, Diakité, Milosavljevic and Truffert. The coaching team led by Andoni Iraola have done an outstanding job in getting them performing so seamlessly. What’s been equally impressive is the way existing squad members have really stepped up their games, led by David Brooks. Alex Scott, Tyler Adams, Evanilson, Marcos Senesi and, of course, the world-class talent that is Antoine Semenyo are all performing brilliantly. Right now, the Cherries are flying and we’re loving it.Best 90 minsSpurs away. Off the back of beating Man City the week before, Spurs were humbled at home. We nullified their attack, dominated the game and overwhelmed them with our fluent attacking play. One of the most comprehensive 1-0 wins you’ll ever see.Worst 90 minsWe lacked our usual intensity away at Leeds but still came back to grab a 2-2 draw. Our first ever point at Elland Road.Best goalCan I have two, please?Semenyo and Kluivertat home to Fulham. Both worldies for different reasons.Best opponentSean Longstaff, Leeds.Worst VAR momentIt’s hard to beat that wrongly disallowed Fulham goal from Josh King at Chelsea.

Backroom staff follow. Top scorer Bryan Mbeumo departs. Second top scorer Yoanne Wissa goes on strike. Captain Christian Nørgaard leaves. We promote set-piece coach Keith Andrews to head coach. We bring Ouattara in fromBournemouthfor a record fee to replace Mbeumo which has opposition fans sniggering, but can’t replace Wissa because he leaves on deadline day. Everyone piles in on Brentford predicting relegation. We then lose to Forest in the opening match. The pile-on continues. We then go and beat Aston Villa and Man United and draw with Chelsea – putting us on exactly the same points tally as the same stage last season under Thomas Frank. The pile-on dies down. We knew it would be a rollercoaster of a season. So far, it hasn’t disappointed.Best 90 minsWe were excellent against Chelsea, butthe United gamewas on another level in terms of excitement. We went two up and were cruising, gifted them a goal, conceded a penalty (which they missed), then smashed in an absolute screamer in stoppage time to seal it. Perfect.Worst 90 minsThe 3-1 defeat at Fulham. Incredibly poor all over the park.Best goalThiago’s finish against United was incredible, butJensen’s strike in the same gameedges it: a slick nine-pass move from back to front finished with an absolute rocket.Best opponentElliot Anderson stood out against us on the opening day for Forest although to be fair, anyone could’ve bossed our midfield that afternoon.Worst VAR momentUnited’s penalty against ustook about three years to sort. VAR checked the foul, then spent even longer deciding if Collins should be sent off. Add subs and other delays, and by the time it was finally taken Bruno Fernandes had lost the will to live and Kelleher saved it.Next manager sackedI tipped Nuno in my pre-season predictions, so I’ll try to keep the streak going.

Fabian Hürzeler has come under fire from some fans but we need to manage our expectations. We’ve sold our best players for huge sums in recent seasons and our top scorer went this summer. We’re in good financial shape and have to stay patient as we continue to build. There will be many moments of joy this season. Probably the only surprise is that Carlos Baleba has looked so lost sinceManchester Unitedand all their cash came knocking, but he’s bound to find his feet again.Best 90 minsIt’s always a great feelingto beat Chelsea & Hove Albion, especially away, and after João Pedro’s claim that he was the main man at Brighton. And Hürzeler’s quadruple substitution that resulted in thecomeback win over Man Citywas the single best moment so far.Worst 90 minsThe horribly disappointing 1-1 draw at Wolves, yawn.Best goalBrajan Gruda’s 89th-minute winneragainst City, with a big shoutout to Diego Gómez who scored four – including one 30-yard half-volley – in the Carabao Cup at Barnsley.Best opponentJack Grealish was annoyingly good and got both assists in Everton’s 2-0 win over us at Hill Dickinson Stadium.Worst VAR momentIt feels as if there’s been an argument raging over VAR every weekend for ages now, it’s so boring. Apart from when Palace are on the wrong end of it, of course.

We’ve been competitive in a lot of them but also been the architects of our own misfortune in a couple. Points-wise, we’re probably about par – but the next run of fixtures is going to be crucial.Best 90 minsProbablySunderland at home. It’s our only win but it came on the back of them winning their opening game and us getting beaten in ours. I think they thought they’d turn up at the Turf and roll us over, but they didn’t.Worst 90 minsVilla away in the last game. We weren’t terrible like we were so many times under Vincent Kompany in thePremier League, but we were still well off it.Best goalWe’ve scored a couple of nice ones but I’d probably go forLyle Foster at United. It was a lovely, well-worked goal and a superb strike from Lyle. We need a bit more of that from him.Best opponentI don’t think there’s been that many standout individual performances against us so far. I’d probably go with Villa’s Donyell Malen, who took both his goals so well. He’s everything we probably miss in terms of ability to finish, so that’s why he probably stands out so much for me.Worst VAR momentLyle Foster having his goal chalked off at Manchester United. I’ve still not seen an image which convinces me he was offside. If we’re still going to rule out goals for tiny amounts of shirt sleeves being in an offside position it’s time to pack up and go home.Next manager sackedBig Ange. Not sure why he was in such a hurry to take that job.By Christmas we will beWe’ll still be in the relegation mixer but probably just above the line – 17th.Andrew GreavesFrom the Bee Hole Endpodcast,@beeholepodcast,@andrewgreaves84View image in fullscreenLyle Foster scores Burnley’s first against Manchester United at Old Trafford in August.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAChelseaStory so farAn indifferent start. We do show signs of great potential and play some lovely football at times but all too quickly revert to the dull passing game where we always seem to be looking backwards. Stupid errors aren’t helping, either – and we’ve been very unlucky with injuries. But if we can build on theLiverpoolwin and the excitement that generated on and off the pitch then things will quickly get better.Best 90 minsThat victory over Liverpoolhad everything – end-to-end football with us on the front foot, and a last‑minute winner. Even after conceding and the two defensive injuries, the team continued to fight. Hats off to Maresca for how he managed the situation; the subs made a difference. Wild scenes at the final whistle.Worst 90 minsThe loss at Manchester United. The early red card didn’t help but Maresca panicking and making some bizarre changes set the tone against the worst United team we’ve faced for years. He has since admitted he mishandled it. Let’s hope he’s learned from it, and from the Brighton home defeat.Best goalCaicedo’s screamer against Liverpool: an absolute rocket.Best opponentI hate to praise an ex-Spurs player but it was Harry Kane in our Champions league game. He’s on fire this season and is the type of centre-forward I’d love to see at the Bridge.Worst VAR momentDisallowing Josh King’s goal against us. Hard not to enjoy all the squealing from our neighbours down the Fulham Road, though.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will beComfortably fourth, if we avoid the red cards.Paul Bakerin memory of Trizia FiorellinoView image in fullscreenMoisés Caicedo scores Chelsea’s opener against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.Photograph: Ian Walton/APCrystal PalaceStory so farWe’re all living the dream right now. Ignoring last week’s defeat at Everton (we should have won easily), to go 19 games undefeated, picking up the Community Shield on the way, qualifying for the Conference League, winning our first game in Europe and be fighting for the top places in the Premier League is an unbelievable achievement. We can’t wait to see how this season will unfold.Best 90 minsLiverpool at homewithout a doubt; the first half should have seen us four or five up, and to grab the win we fully deserved with the last kick of the game was a brilliant moment on the pitch and in the stands. Villa away was also a masterclass, and the sheer ease with which we beat Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League shows just how far we have come.Worst 90 minsSlightly bending the rules here given it was Europe, but our 0-0 snorefest in Fredrikstad when we struggled against the low block and an artificial pitch: one of the worst games I have ever seen, and made worse by the huge cost in going to see it!Best goalMarc Guéhi’s top-corner curleragainst Villa.

Poor first halves have been our downfall versus Leeds and Liverpool and scoring remains a problem too, with neither Barry nor Beto demanding ownership of the fabled No 9 shirt.Best 90 minsPerforming for the full 90 minutes has been the problem, with slow starts the predominant feature. But theopening home game against Brightonwas probably the most complete.Worst 90 minsEasily, by some margin, the Carabao Cup game at Wolves. Having previously emphasised the importance of winning a trophy we made wholesale changes and went out with a whimper. A shocking display in front of a capacity away support as always.Best goalGiven it was our first last-minute goal at Hill Dickinson, given it ended Palace’s fabulous unbeaten run, given the circumstances, the scorer and how it was scored, ithas to be Jack Grealish’s strike. It wouldn’t make any other team’s list of best goals but in this context it was magic.Best opponentCrysencio Summerville was exceptional for West Ham, but probably Adam Wharton shades it. Before they tired, Palace really looked an excellent team, extremely well coached by Oliver Glasner.Worst VAR momentThepenalty given against James Tarkowskiversus Leeds.

Instead of heading into the break in a lofty slot brimming with confidence, we’re aiming to regroup. Injuries haven’t helped, but then neither has some untypical sloppiness and lack of focus. Very unprofessional. As has been the undue influence of Mr Webb and his underlings.David Squires on … after review, this week’s cartoon is a VAR specialRead moreBest 90 minsCame at the Bridge, only for the video-powers-that-be to intervene, finding a way to rule out Josh King’s goal. Still, they apologised, so that’s all right. Move on; nothing to see here. The Brentford game was also a good display: after presenting them with the opener we ran out deserved 3-1 winners.Worst 90 minsIt was vice versa at Villa Park. An early lead against nervy hosts only to crumble once they snatched a route-one leveller before the break. Further key decisions went against us in the first half, but that’s no excuse for the collapse and 3-1 loss.Best goalJosh King at Chelsea to propel us to a famous victory. But no.Spuriously chalked offbecause the Stockley Park mob said so: a clear and obvious cock-up. That leaves Harry Wilson’s clever finish from Alex Iwobi’s brilliant pass against the Bees in top spot.Best opponentAntoine Semenyo or Matheus Cunha. Or Howard Webb.Worst VAR momentI’ve covered the specifics, so here’s the general. VAR is fine in principle but its implementation remains an utter farce. And the game is far, far worse as a result. Delays, disappointment and obfuscation. It was introduced to mop up “clear and obvious errors” with a “high bar for interventions”. Like hell. That clanger at Chelsea was the most publicised but others, particularly against Man United and Villa, not only highlighted the flaws and made a solid case for favouritism (yikes!) but probably cost us points.

So far this doesn’t look like a team destined to go straight back down, which is better than most promoted sides expect. But throwing away late points against Fulham and Bournemouth and not getting anything from a good performance against Spurs has created tantalising hope. Hold on to those points and Leeds could be flying in sixth. We’ve hardly seen new goalie Lucas Perri or new centre-back Jaka Bijol, while injuries to Dan James and Wilf Gnonto have me feeling there’s more to come from this team. If “more” includes Dominic Calvert-Lewin finishing half his chances, well, then I will be in danger of getting giddy. Harsher reality is coming, though: Man City, Chelsea then Liverpool in one week. But before that are five games from which Leeds can pick up points, and need to, to keep this working smoothly.Best 90 minsMost have been good. I’ve enjoyed competitive games after two years playing attack against defence in the Championship. Wolves was best becausewe scored goals and won.Worst 90 minsArsenal away. But we’ve all moved on.

That ended our unbeaten run and started a new run of consecutive defeats. Now three of them. The first time in Arne Slot’s career and so the first time for us for some time. It’s not so great not being on an unbeaten high, but the season is barely two months old and certainly no time for kneejerk panic. Yes, we need to find our best lineup, yes, the new players need to integrate and yes, players need to find form. But as Virgil said, we’ll stick together and go again. And we will.Best 90 minsThe first at home to Bournemouth. From 2-0 to 2-2 we then scored two, on 88 and 94, to take the win and set a precedent for the weeks to come. Goals for Ekitiké, Gakpo, Chiesa and Salah made for a business-as-usual start to the season on a less-than-usual Friday night.Worst 90 minsCame at Palace. We were not good and they knew how to play us. We nearly got out of jail again with a last-minute equaliser, but then came Nketiah with his version of our late routine.Best goalFor sheer thrills,the winner at Newcastle from Rio Ngumoha, then just 16. Brilliant buildup starting with Chiesa to Salah, a pass fizzed across the box, ace dummy from Szoboszlai and the final shot blasted into the top corner.Best opponentBournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo scored his side’s two goals, one of them running from his own half, evading our defence, before shooting on the edge of the area past Alisson.Worst VAR momentThe penalty given against us away to Galatasaray is one of the worst decisions we’ve had. A shocker.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will beTop again.Steph JonesView image in fullscreenLiverpool teenager Rio Ngumoha celebrates his dramatic winner at Newcastle.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty ImagesManchester CityStory so farI’m pretty satisfied. The early consecutive losses to Spurs and Brighton were obviously disappointing, but I think the signs since have been encouraging. Defensively we’ve been a lot better since Gvardiol’s return and the progress of O’Reilly and Khusanov. Four out of six points in the Champions League is a decent start. Foden is “back”, and Haaland has started outrageously well.Best 90 minsI don’t think there’s been a clear ‘best performance’ yet in the league, though we weredominant in the 5-1 win over Burnley. But beating United comfortably at the Etihad was most satisfying, obviously (and needed at the time after two consecutive losses).Worst 90 minsThe 2-0 loss to Spurs. Tottenham plus Thomas Frank really is our kryptonite. Defensively we were really poor and our pressing was a mess too. Spurs deservedly punished us.Best goalHaaland’s versus Arsenal. It was a brilliant counterattack. Erling’s movement and physicality to get into space was amazing. Reijnders’ pass. And of course,the big man’s slotted finish.Best opponentNo player has shone against us yet but Djed Spence was very solid against Bobb and Cherki.Worst VAR momentFor us, without doubt the penalty given against Nico González at Monaco. Never a penalty, even by Champions League refereeing standards. Elsewhere, the decision not to award Josh King’s goal against Chelsea was a bad one too.Next manager sackedIt’s going to be Ruben Amorim, isn’t it?By Christmas we will beSecond. I think we’re trending well and are going under the radar, which I’m loving. This is a completely new City team this season.

As it is, so far what we’ve got is one-game cycles where we win one and lose one. You can see by the players’ body language that they aren’t happy with Amorim’s system: they’re routinely outplayed and outworked. We have beaten three teams at home – two promoted clubs and a team playing with 10 men for most of the game. We haven’t won an away game since Leicester in March. Teams can suss us out too easily: even Grimsby knew what to do. Opponents seem to relish telling the press after games how easy it is to play against us as they know how we set up, and Amorim won’t do anything about it, setting the team up the same, week after week.Best 90 minsThe Arsenal gamewhere we made a hatful of chances. Despite the defeat I left the ground feeling we just might be heading in the right direction. Didn’t last.Worst 90 minsGrimsby was excruciating. Amorim not watching the penalties was gobsmacking; as Napoleon said: “If you build an army of 100 lions and their leader is a dog, in any fight, the lions will die like a dog. But if you build an army of 100 dogs and their leader is a lion, all dogs will fight as a lion.”Best goalMount’s goal against Sunderlandshowed real class.Best opponentHaaland by a street. To think Ole offered him to us for £4m when he managed him at Molde.Worst VAR momentWhen Saliba went through Cunha in the season opener. He took his left leg; VAR shrugged it off.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will be10th.Shaun O’DonnellView image in fullscreenRuben Amorim sits in the dugout during United’s shootout defeat against Grimsby.Photograph: Sky SportsNewcastleStory so farIt’s been disappointing, but what could we expect? A disrupted pre-season and injuries to new recruits Yoane Wissa and Jacob Ramsey have undoubtedly stymied our campaign. Yet there are encouraging signs. In Nick Woltemade we have a new cult hero and a striker loving life at St James’ – so it’s bye-bye, AI, you’ll soon be forgotten. And the imperious Malick Thiaw, who has contributed to a string of clean sheets, is a joy to watch. With Dan Burn, Fabian Schär, Sven Botman and now Thiaw to call on, plus two sensational full-backs, our defence is the best it’s been in decades.Ross Wilson ends Newcastle sporting director saga in switch from ForestRead moreBest 90 minsSurprisingly,the home loss against LiVARpool. We went full throttle from the off and a ferocious atmosphere inspired a stirring fightback while we were down to 10 men. Of course we lost it in Slot time to a 16-year-old debutant, but St James’ was a cauldron that night.Worst 90 minsArsenal at home. We lacked possession and failed to protect a (somewhat fortuitous) lead. Two late sucker-punch goals – both from corners – were agonising.Best goalBruno Guimarães’ stunner against Forest. A moment of class in a frustrating contest.Best opponentBarcelona’s Pedri. One of the world’s finest technical midfielders: elegant, intelligent, incisive, he ran the show.Worst VAR momentWe thought VAR was there to intervene in violent incidents. Apparently we were wrong. Gabriel got away with striking Woltemade in the face during our home loss, then went on to score the winner.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.

The change of head coach might well have derailed the Premier League, Europa League and Carabao Cup campaigns. It all feels so avoidable.Best 90 minsIn the league it was our only win,the opening day against Brentford; Nuno’s Reds showed they didn’t just play a low-mid block and could stroke it around, with three goals in the bag. Overall, the best performance was the first half against Real Betis.David Squires on … Nottingham Forest’s clash of the titansRead moreWorst 90 minsCynics will say all of them under Ange, but actually, the home defeat against West Ham still felt worse. It was a performance that precipitated Nuno’s departure and in which the players were clearly feeling the weight of the situation at the club.Best goalChris Wood against Brentford: a sublime first-time pass by Elliot Anderson and a well-timed run by the veteran striker, before he rounded the keeper and tapped home. Definitely one for the football nostalgists. Also, Igor Jesus’s first against Betis; brilliant team play and a great cross by Morgan Gibbs-White into the corridor of uncertainty, before the Brazilian struck. Forest are back, baby (at least for a few minutes).Best opponentGranit Xhaka for Sunderland; he was utterly in control of everything that was happening.Worst VAR momentWe’ve had a few dodgy ref calls, as often happens when things aren’t going your way; I would have liked VAR to look at Nico Domínguez’s yellow card against Sunderland for simulation after getting caught by a high boot – I bet you won’t see that given again this season.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will be16th, but doing better than right now.Rich Ferraro1865: The Nottingham Forest Podcast:eighteensixtyfive.footballView image in fullscreenChris Wood delivered against Brentford on the opening day.Photograph: Ritchie Sumpter/Nottingham Forest FC/Getty ImagesSunderlandStory so farIt’s started better than anyone could have imagined. Every match has been a joy to watch and after so many frustrating years it finally feels like fans are getting the reward we deserve. Régis Le Bris has brought belief, purpose and an identity that feels special. His football is brave, intelligent and exciting, and every week it feels like something is building.Best 90 minsThe opening-day win against West Hamwas everything we had dreamed of. Confident, ruthless and full of energy, it was the perfect return to Premier League football. The atmosphere that day was incredible, it felt like we were back.Worst 90 minsThe defeat byBurnleywas tough to take. It came so early in the season, just after the joy of that opening win, when positivity was sky high. It brought us back down to earth a little, reminding us that this league is relentless. It was sobering.Best goalIsidor’s against Brentford was a thing of beauty. From Xhaka’s perfect delivery to the instinctive finish, it summed up everything this team is about. Coming from behind and showing that same “till the end” spirit that got us promoted, it felt like a moment that was truly Sunderland.Best opponentAmad, without question. Seeing him again, this time for United, was bittersweet. His talent is effortless and even though his brilliance came at our expense, it was impossible not to stop and admire him.Worst VAR momentIt has mostly been kind since our return, but the overturned penalty against United was frustrating. Still, after it saved us in the playoff final, I will take the rough with the smooth.Next manager sackedAmorim feels like the obvious shout. United cannot drift like this for ever.

New players, rejuvenated stars … we just need to marinate before the flavours sizzle.David Squires on … Daniel Levy’s greatest hits at Tottenham HotspurRead moreBest 90 minsLeeds away. Not pretty – we dug deep, played our football, produced moments of quality, and proved we’re a team, one that has some bite, spirit. We pressed extremely well and fired in plenty of crosses that a finished-article forward would have relished. Work in progress. Play Xavi at 10. Be patient.Worst 90 minsBodø/Glimt in the Champions League. Artificial turf, rotation; a messy away day. But even the worst this season has involved fighting spirit in the form of a comeback. Spurs do “bad” good.Best goalRichy’s against Burnley: the most dazzling “oh my days” moment. It had me spiraling towards a supernova.Best opponentAntoine Semenyo. Baller. I want the new THFC board to action their battle cry: we need ruthless balance, Kudus on one side, Semenyo on the other, Xavi through the middle. Make this fan-fiction a reality.Worst VAR momentMy brain shuts down in the time it takes for them to decide if my “limbs” lost in celebration will count for nothing. I do enjoy that rarity when a ref runs off to the screen to review and sticks with his original decision, though. Drama.Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will beTop five, just to generate hype and push us back into a self-fulfilling prophecy where we expect too much, too soon – even though the reality is we finished 17th last season and lost 22 games. I’m going with third. Don’t judge me. Football is more fun like this.SpookyOriginalThe Fighting CockpodcasterView image in fullscreenRicharlison watches his acrobatic effort fly into Burnley’s net.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersWest HamStory so farSacking Potter after six games tells its own story, though the real problem is the lack of strategy from the owners. Potter was a decent man but his side’s slow buildup and leaky back line were less than magic. We should be mid-table with this squad but the defence stopped being able to deal with corners and new keeper Hermansen appeared to be suffering from PTSD. Midfield signings Fernandes and Magassa arrived too late and the home losses to Chelsea and Spurs were embarrassing. At least Nuno might help lift the mood of apathy; he already appears more inspirational than Potter and his counterattacking style better suited. We’re in a relegation scrap, but Nuno has tightened up the defence and given youth a chance.Best 90 minsThe 3-0 win at Forest, admittedly aided by the imminent sacking of Nuno, then the home manager. Three goals in the final six minutes was decidedly enjoyable. Potter’s only highlight.Worst 90 minsSpurs was bad, but the 5-1 home defeat against Chelsea was abject defending, conceding three goals from corners and failing to hold an early lead. Our defence looked dodgier than a Nigel Farage pledge.Best goalPaquetá’s long-range effortagainst Chelsea stands out, though Bowen’s goals at Forest and Everton were fine strikes too. Thank goodness both the Dyers are keeping Jarrod loyal to WHU.Best opponentChelsea’s Estêvão is only 18 but terrorised us, treating Tomas Soucek like a training cone. And that Declan Rice at Arsenal looked quite good.Worst VAR momentNiclas Füllkrug had an equaliser against Chelsea disallowed for a toe offside. That goal might have got his season going; so far he’s struggled.Next manager sackedPostecoglou at Forest doesn’t seem to be going down too well, mate.By Christmas we will be17th.Pete MayAuthor,Massive: The Miracle of Prague;hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.ukView image in fullscreenWest Ham’s Lucas Paqueta scores from distance against Chelsea.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersWolvesStory so farRock bottom and no wins from the first seven – not great. The struggle was expected, so I’m not entirely surprised. We’ve taken the lead in the last three matches and only two late equalisers have denied us that much-needed first victory. We’re starting to look more competitive, and the progress in the League Cup has been a pleasant distraction. There’s still hope.Best 90 minsWe came agonisingly close to a deserved win over Spurs. After we were taken apart by Leeds the previous weekend, Vítor Pereira made wholesale changes and we looked more resilient.Worst 90 minsIt would have to be that Leeds game. We went ahead with a brilliantly worked goal, but instead of growing in confidence we wilted. Leeds were comfortably the better side, albeit handed the win with atrocious defending for at least two of their three goals.Best goalLadislav Krejci looks a great signing. He started in midfield against Leeds and timed a run perfectly toget on the end of an inch-perfect Fer López pass. A classy team goal in another otherwise honking team performance.Best opponentJack Grealish got a couple of assists for Everton, but it was more the controlled manner in which he went about his business. It just oozed class and experience.Worst VAR momentNothing too horrendous for us so far – thankfully. One minor gripe I will share is that I’m fairly certain (having been sat right behind it) the ball was moving when Brighton took a short corner for their late equaliser. In the age of hyper-correctness, should that have been spotted?Next manager sackedPostecoglou.By Christmas we will be19th.

The 28-year-old Philadelphian nicknamed Boots flattened Uisma Lima on Saturday night at the Xfinity Mobile Arena, marking an explosive debut at 154lb and setting the stage for the far bigger challenges that await him next year.Ennis dropped the sturdy but unheralded Lima three times in 118 seconds, igniting the rollicking hometown crowd squarely in his corner. A concussive right uppercut started the unraveling, followed by two blistering flurries that left his Portugal-based Angolan opponent unable to continue. Referee Shawn Clark waved it off at 1:58 of the opening round, giving the unbeaten Ennis his 35th professional win, his 31st inside the distance, and the kind of statement that reverberates through the sport even in a mismatch. “The more I move up, the stronger I get,” Ennis said afterward. “This is my division now. I sent a big message tonight.”That message was aimed squarely at Vergil Ortiz Jr. The undefeated Texan, who holds the WBC’s interim junior middleweight title, is expected to meet Ennis in early 2026 in what promoter Eddie Hearn called “one of the best fights to be made in American boxing”. The MatchroomBoxingsupremo confirmed that an agreement with Golden Boy Promotions is already in place, pending Ortiz’s November title defense against Erickson Lubin.Saturday’s quick destruction doubled as vindication for Ennis, theformer unified welterweight championwho’d spent years draining himself to make 147lb. His father and trainer, Derek “Bozy” Ennis, had long said the welterweight cut cost him strength and sharpness. “He was killing himself to make 147,” Hearn said. “Now we’re seeing the real Boots: closer to 100%. He’s massive, powerful and finally free.”View image in fullscreenJaron Ennis, right, looks to land a punch on Uisma Lima during their fight on Saturday night.Photograph: Emma Brawley/Emma Brawley Matchroom BoxingLima, a fringe contender and distant 10-1 underdog, barely had time to test him. After probing with a few jabs, Ennis switched to a southpaw stance and sneaked in a right uppercut that lifted Lima’s head like a hinge before landing three more hooks that dropped him flat on his back.After beating the count, Lima’s balance was gone and his eyes told the story. Ennis moved in coldly, swarming him with another hail of punches that dumped him to the canvas a second time. When Lima rose again, he staggered backward into a neutral corner, where Ennis closed the distance and let his hands go. The fusillade of punches left the referee with no choice but to intervene as the towel came flying from Lima’s corner. When it was over, Ennis looked almost sheepish at the ease of it. “I was trying to test him out,” he said. “But my pop told me, ‘Don’t play with him.’ So I just went in there and went for the kill.”Afterward, Hearn was effusive. “I’ve worked with some incredible fighters over the years,” he said, “and I think this guy is the best I’ve ever worked with. Some fighters can punch, some are defensive geniuses, some have great footwork. Boots has absolutely everything.”There is no shortage of opportunities for Ennis in a deep 154lb division, including newly minted beltholdersXander Zayasand Abass Baraou or the popular Sebastian Fundora, whose hand injury last week postponed his title defense against Keith Thurman.But none would move the needle quite like Ortiz. The two have circled each other for years, twin comets on parallel trajectories, their eventual collision long predicted and eagerly awaited. “It’s going to happen next,” Ennis said. “He’s got his fight coming up. If he don’t win, I’ll fight the winner of that. I want Vergil Ortiz next.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsPhiladelphiaShareReuse this content"

She held and then broke the Pegula to love for 5-5. Pegula’s forehand volley at the net landed wide to give Gauff a first match point and, with Pegula on second serve, she clinched the contest with a forehand winner following a brief rally.Pegula had staged a comeback of her own to beat world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals. But this time she lost momentum and missed out on a 10th career title as Gauff became the second American to claim the Wuhan title, after Venus Williams in 2015.It was their seventh career meeting and first in a final. Pegula leads 4-3 overall against Gauff, with whom she has won several doubles titles. Gauff complimented her opponent after the match.“When I came on tour, you were one of the first people to be nice to me and welcome me with open arms. And that really goes a long way and still goes a long way,” Gauff said during the trophy presentation. “So I appreciate you. And it’s great to finally play in a final against you.”Pegula’s last eight matches have all gone the distance, and she has won seven of them.“You’ve been playing a lot of three-setters – you’re a three-set queen,” Gauff said. “I’d like to congratulate you on an incredible tournament. I was determined not to let you get there today because I felt the odds would be in your favour in a third set.”Gauff improved to 11-3 in finals; Pegula dropped to 9-11. The win adds to Gauff’s WTA 1000 triumphs in Cincinnati (2023) and Beijing (2024) and marks her third final at this level in 2025 after runner-up finishes in Madrid and Rome.Explore more on these topicsCoco GauffTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A song reserved normally for euphoric moments only just drowned out the jeers which met aScotlandvictory. People just want more and more? Too right they do.With this win, Steve Clarke and his players edged closer to theWorld Cupfinals tournament. It was just that a return to that scene for the first time since 1998 felt a million miles away as the Scots limped and laboured past Belarus. “We know we have got to be better, man,” Scott McTominay said. The Napoli midfielder was even more profound as he scored Scotland’s second; second word “me” and the first a rhyme with “duck”. McTominay’s lack of celebrations depicted perfectly Scotland’s messy night.Scotland 2-1 Belarus: World Cup 2026 qualifying – liveRead moreClarke is fiercely protective of his squad as standard. To the Scotland manager’s credit, he refused to sugarcoat what played out here. A clearly furious Clarke was withering in his criticism. “I am really, really disappointed,” he said. “As disappointed as I have been during 72 games in charge. We just didn’t turn up. The performance was way below par. It is head-scratching.” Perhaps, yet it must be remembered Scotland were outplayed even in defeating Greece on Thursday.There is a caveat, and an important one. Scotland’s overall qualifying position is strong. They have taken 10 points from a possible 12 to date. “The players know what my feelings are but I have great faith in them, I trust them completely,” Clarke said.“I am very confident they will be in a much better place next month. They have never let me down before and I am confident they will not next month.”Amid the bad vibes, Denmark’s win against Greece in Copenhagen meant Scotland have secured at worst a World Cup playoff berth.Yet questions, and so many of them, were raised by this Scottish showing. They were unconvincing in defence, lacking authority in midfield and woefully ponderous in attack. A capacity crowd, who arrived for a box-ticking exercise, grew increasingly edgy. Should Scotland progress to the World Cup and produce anything remotely approaching this, they will be also-rans.Belarus, the 100th-ranked team in the world and a side knocked for six at home by Denmark only days earlier, were the more fluent for concerted spells. The visitors managed 22 shots on goal, were denied a second‑half equaliser by a debatable VAR intervention, and had the Scots clinging on for dear life by the end.View image in fullscreenChé Adams fires in Scotland’s first goal in their 2-1 win at Hampden Park.Photograph: Colin Poultney/ProSports/Shutterstock“In my opinion we deserved to at least draw this game,” the Belarus coach, Carlos Alós, said. Not even those with tartan lenses on their specs could argue.There had been warning signs for Scotland in the opening exchanges. It was just that nobody bothered to heed them. Scott McKenna had to scramble away a teasing German Barkovskiy cross, Kenny McLean had to block Evgeni Yablonski’s shot and Pavel Zabelin sent a free header over the Scotland bar – all within 11 minutes.Ché Adams slamming home with his left foot after collecting a Jack Hendry pass for the opener – although it was originally ruled out for offside and needed a VAR review to stand – should have settled nerves, but Clarke cut an agitated figure for the remainder of the first half. Ben Gannon-Doak, Scotland’s bright young forward hope, was guilty of poor decision-making time and again.Scotland believed they had won a penalty for a handball by Yegor Parkhomenko, only for Adams to be penalised for the same offence in the lead-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yevgeny Malashevich spun off Andy Robertson, met Barkovski’s cross and flicked beyond Angus Gunn. The Romanian referee Marian Barbu decreed upon second glance that McTominay was fouled on the halfway line as Belarus snatched possession. It was a borderline call and an embarrassing scenario for the Scots to be in. “If that stands, I am not sure we would have got ourselves back in front,” Clarke said later. Alos refused to make an issue of the decision.Quick GuideWorld Cup qualifying roundupShowTheFaroeIslandsproduced a stunning victory against theCzech Republicto boost their hopes of qualifying for the World Cup finals tournament. The European minnows made it four wins from their past five qualifiers, following their remarkable 4-0 victory against Montenegro last week by defeating the Czechs 2-1.All the goals came in the final quarter of the match, with Adam Karabec cancelling out Hanus Sorensen's opener only for Martin Agnarsson to score an 81st-minute winner. The Faroe Islands are now only one point behind second-placed Czech Republic in Group L. Croatia top the pool and sit three points ahead of the Czechs with a game in hand thanks to a 3-0 victory against Gibraltar.TheNetherlandsare in full control of Group G after hammeringFinland4-0.There was a distinct Liverpool look to the scoresheet, with Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo both finding the net along with Aston Villa's Donyell Malen and Memphis Depay.Polandsit three points behind after beatingLithuania2-0 with goals from Sebastian Szymanski and Robert Lewandowski.Denmarkand Scotland are guaranteed top-two finishes in Group C after the Danes defeatedGreece3-1. The game was all but over by half-time, with Denmark going three up through Rasmus Hojlund, Joachim Andersen and Mikkel Damsgaard. Christos Tzolis pulled one back for Greece in the 63rd minute, but that was as close as they came.Virgil Ghita's stoppage-time winner keptRomania's hopes of qualifying alive as they secured a 1-0 victory against the Group H leadersAustria, whileCyprusdefeatedSan Marino4-0.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.McTominay has been well short of his best throughout this Scottish campaign. He did, however, allow his country breathing space after Aleksandr Martynovich failed to clear Robertson’s cross from the Scotland left. Anybody who anticipated Clarke’s men easing over the line from there was to be swiftly dissuaded from that notion.The final act of the night, quite rightly, belonged to Belarus. Robertson was left for dust by Hleb Kuchko in the sixth added minute of eight. He finished smartly underneath the advancing Gunn.Clarke dismissed the sense that nerves played a part in the Scottish approach. In fact, he swatted aside any potential excuse floated towards him. “Maybe I’ll go back to the hotel and have a quiet beer,” he said.It was a night for more than one. Scotland must hope this is a game of which they never need speak ever again.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersScotlandBelarusWorld Cupmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Wales’s fate is in their hands after Belgium were held against Group J leaders North Macedonia and victory in Cardiff would keep alive the hosts’ hopes of qualifying automatically.Wales are seeking to bounce back from a3-0 friendly defeatagainst England at Wembley, which the captain, Ben Davies, who is poised to win his 100th cap against Belgium, said provided a “wakeup call” and prompted a “quiet journey back to Cardiff” on Friday, hours before the squad were boosted by watching their next opponents draw in Ghent.World Cup qualifying roundup: Neves stuns Republic of Ireland with late goalRead moreBellamy discussed the importance of heading into Monday’s game in a positive mindset. “I always believe there is a special moment coming, I can’t and won’t allow myself to feel the other way,” the Wales manager said. “Positivity is something I have to have around me, from my coaches, players; body language, I’m very big on that, how you present yourself, it’s so important. I only ever see good. Trust me, there was a period where I only ever saw the other side. I know which side I want to see. Being positive is everything.”Bellamy said Wales can use their previous experience of big nights in the capital to their advantage. “Players have been in this situation so many times over the last 10 years, especially Cardiff nights. The crowd are used to these moments.“When we’ve managed to qualify it’s been here. I didn’t get to experience that [as a player] – usually at this stage I was out of the group – so it’s nice to be able to get to three games left and a huge game on Monday that if we win, it’s a nice start to the remaining games.”Bellamy added thatdefeat against Thomas Tuchel’s Englandonly fuelled his determination to improve Wales. “How can I close that gap? How can I get to where he is? And if I get there: how can I overtake him?” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool have a game in hand on the teams around them but sit joint-bottom of the table.Arsenal get back on track in WSL after Olislagers’ own goal scuppers BrightonRead more“I’m disappointed for the group because they worked tremendously hard today and deserved more,” said Taylor, who was appointed in August.“At this moment we’re not getting what we deserve, and it’s tough but it’s fine; I think it’s close to working, it’s close to coming. It takes time. There has been a lot of change but we [will] keep working in the same way.“The results are tough at the moment because we’ve probably felt a little bit hard done by in a couple of games especially. But no one has consistently opened us up.“We have changed a lot of things. We have been asked to come in and play a new way. Sometimes it takes time, and certainly with how late we came into the door [late in pre‑season], it’s been really tough. More time with the girls would be what every head coach wants, more time to implement your way and your style.”City created all of the first-half opportunities but were fairly wasteful in the final third. Kerstin Casparij did hit the target when the ball rolled to her after Khadija Shaw was tackled in the box, but her left-footed shot went straight at Rafaela Borggräfe – who produced a one-handed save to keep out an Aoba Fujino strike, after the winger had raced on to Vivianne Miedema’s slick pass into the penalty area.In contrast to their lack of adventure into the City area during almost the entire first half, Liverpool were more attack-minded at the start of the second and they went in front with an excellent team goal as Ceri Holland’s right-wing cross found the back-post run of Cornelia Kapocs, who headed home in front of the Kop. Kapocs has scored both of Liverpool’s league goals this season.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Cornelia Kapocs (centre) celebrates scoring against Manchester City.Photograph: George Wood/Getty ImagesThe hosts gifted the equaliser in unnecessary fashion through a mistake from Borggräfe; Shaw’s header was bouncing comfortably wide of goal but the keeper still tried to save it, only diverting the ball into the path of Iman Beney, who gratefully tucked in the leveller.Shaw did have a 79th-minute effort well saved, after shooting powerfully from the edge of the penalty area, as the City pressure began to intensify. It felt as though the winning goal was coming for the visitors, though, and it eventually did through Fujino. She was fed into space in the box and lashed in a clinical, low finish that had too much pace for Borggräfe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not until Liverpool scored. It was almost as if then we woke up and thought we need a little bit more, and that’s why we turned the game around.”There was a worry for Liverpool earlier in the game, when Marie Höbinger limped off with an injury. The midfielder appeared to be in tears of pain as she was substituted after treatment on the pitch.Jeglertz said: “Liverpool showed they are better than the position they have. They will definitely cause problems for other teams. They have good players and I think they showed in this game that they are very structured, organised and can make it difficult for us, so I am 100% sure they will soon climb the table.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueLiverpool FC WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The update is that she is up and about, which is great to hear. Fingers crossed she’s OK and I’m sure the medical staff will take great care of her.”The show went on, and Arsenal’s win alleviates some growing pressure on Slegers. It has seemed a little cruel to suggest the heat has been turned up a little on the manager who deliveredArsenal’s second European titlein her first season in charge having had her temporary role made permanent only in January.

That may feel like an exaggeration, given the Champions League final was a major hurdle, as were many games in the run-up to that night in Lisbon, but expectations were low then, every win was a thrilling step on a journey no one was expecting.Quick GuideChelsea see off Spurs to stay topShowChelseabattled pastTottenhamto consolidate top spot in the Women's Super League after Keira Walsh's second-half strike secured a 1-0 win at Kingsmeadow.

Carla Camacho put the ball wide, Kiko Seike tested Daphne van Domselaar at the near post and Fran Kirby’s looped chip was cleared before it reached the line.The concerning 10-minute pause in play came in the 63rd minute, with Mpomé carried off on a stretcher in a neck brace and on oxygen.The game was, understandably, a little flatter after Mpomé’s injury, but Stina Blackstenius’s header grazed the top of the crossbar to inject some fresh energy for the subdued crowd as Arsenal’s bench looked to force another goal and make the lead a little more comfortable. It didn’t come, and they held on, but there is still work to do.“What we did really well last season was to capitalise in the times in the game where we had momentum and accept and suffer in the moments when we don’t have momentum, and we always found a way back,” Slegers said. “That’s been a strength of the team and that’s not gone.“Sometimes just things click and sometimes they don’t click. It’s the same when the ball goes on the inside or the outside of the post. It’s within our control.

Before kick-off similar sentiments had been expressed around the concourse as 18,154 gathered for Everton women’s first game beside the docks.Walking around the plaza outside the East Stand, it was clear that, for many of those in attendance, as well as being able to watch this WSL game, they were here because this was their first chance to see this tadium; there are understood to be more than 25,000 people on the waiting list for a men’s season ticket at this ground and many of them were therefore making their debut.WSL: Chelsea 1-0 Tottenham, Everton 1-4 Manchester United and more – matchday liveRead moreMany families were searching for their loved ones’ names on the personalised bricks along Everton Way, some clutching printed-out maps as they tried to locate them, others visibly emotional as they posed for photographs by a relative’s brick. Some were simply admiring the architecture, such as Eloise from Merseyside, who has watched women’s games at the comparatively primitive Walton Hall Park. “It’s breathtaking, isn’t it?” she said.Unfortunately for Everton, the football that came closest to being described in the same way was being played by the opposing team. United could have been 3-0 up inside eight minutes and eventually came from a goal down to win 4-1 and preserve their unbeaten start to the league season.Skinner said his side have become so accustomed to big arenas that they simply took the occasion in their stride: “They are big-time players now, they play like it’s just another pitch in another surrounding. We probably actually had a little bit more of an advantage because Everton don’t usually play here, whereas for us it’s another stadium for us to visit and try and win. It’s a really, really lovely stadium.”View image in fullscreenMany Everton fans were enjoying their first visit to Hill Dickinson Stadium.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersNot all attendees were first-timers. Daryl, from Kirkby, a men’s team season-ticket holder, said: “I wasn’t expecting Everton women to win, but it was a good game and a good attendance. It’s always a good atmosphere at a women’s game because it’s like a family atmosphere, it’s mostly people bringing their kids for the first time and their grandparents for the first time. I love it [the view] because when you’re in the upper tier, it looks far away but you’re actually close to the action.”The best of that action came from a former Everton player, as Jess Park thrived after coming on as a second-half substitute. Without the winger, the visitors created a flurry of early chances as firstly Lisa Naalsund clipped an effort over the crossbar, before her Norwegian compatriot Elisabeth Terland surprisingly headed wide from around two yards out when a goal had looked certain. Fridolina Rolfö also fired into the side-netting in that early spell of United pressure, before Melvine Malard’s overhead flick was saved by Emily Ramsey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after Park arrived in the second half United levelled when Malard raced on to Hinata Miyazawa’s through ball and scored on the rebound after Ramsey had saved her initial shot. Malard was then involved again when it became 2-1, putting pressure on Hikaru Kitagawa in the box as the defender inadvertently scuffed her attempted clearance into her own net.Late on, Park was enjoying running at the Everton backline and scored with a low, deflected shot that sent Ramsey in the wrong direction, but there was nothing fortunate about Park’s second and United’s fourth, as she classily found the bottom corner from outside the box. Despite the scoreline, Brian Sørensen, Everton’s manager, said: “It was a great experience and these are the opportunities the new ownership are giving us and we’re really grateful for it. Of course we’re gutted that we couldn’t keep the performance [going] over the 90 minutes but that’s where we are at, at the minute, against a top side like United.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueEverton WomenManchester United WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A failure to flag any issues by March would still be deemed a breach of the rules.The standard mechanism for avoiding an MCO breach is to set up a blind trust to manage one club, as Manchester City and Manchester United have done in the past with Girona and Nice, but Palace and Lyon failed to make such provisions last season.Uefa’s initiative is a response to a tumultuous summer dominated by MCO disputes particularly the Palace saga, during which Forest gave evidenceagainst their Premier League rivalsat the disciplinary hearing and in their subsequent appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne. Elsewhere, the League of Ireland side Drogheda and Dunajska Streda, from Slovakia, were expelled from European competition altogether after qualifying for the Conference League, alongside clubs from the same ownership group.Palace were demoted to the Conference League after Uefa’s club financial control body ruled that they had failed to meet the March deadline for putting the club in a blind trust, which was deemed necessary as the then-shareholder John Textor’s French club Lyon also qualified for the Europa League.In a decision upheld subsequently by Cas, the CFCB ruled Textor’s joint shareholding at Palace and Lyon at the time of the deadline gave him a decisive influence at both clubs, despite the fact that he subsequently sold his 44.9% stake at Selhurst Park to Woody Johnson before this season’s competition started. Lyon were awarded the Europa League place, as Uefa’s qualifying criteria state that league position trumps a domestic cup win, a decision that could end up costing Palace more than £20m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in an interview with TalkSport on Sunday, Parish said he had held “some early conversations” with the 51-year-old.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think for Oliver it’s about the conditions being right,” said Parish. “It’s about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve. Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that. That’s what he’s in football for. So if we can align those interests then hopefully we can make something happen.” Parish also admitted that Adam Wharton – the England midfielder who has been linked with a move to United this weekend but is also believed to be on the wishlists of several other major clubs, including Real Madrid – has ambitions to play at the highest level.“I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,” he said. “He’s an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can’t speak for Adam, he’s focused on his time at Crystal Palace.”Meanwhile, work on redeveloping Palace’s main stand – estimated to cost up to £250m and due to have started in the summer – is now expected to begin in January.“It’s an absolute must and everybody now on the shareholder group is committed to doing it so hopefully in January there’s lots of things going on,” said Parish. “Things are being moved, power stations, dressing rooms being built. There’s a lot of things that maybe the fans can’t see so it has been going forwards but the real physical things, things being demolished etc, will start in January.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

This week has been so tough, but now I’ve picked the trophy up it’s one I can tick off and there’s not many left.”The match was closer than the scoreline suggested but Littler was flawless in deciding legs, winning each of the first four sets from 2-2.In the first leg of the third set, he came agonisingly close to a rare nine-dart finish in the format but missed his final dart at bullseye.In the fourth set, Humphries roused himself from 2-0 down with two big checkouts only for Littler to come up trumps again in the decider, leaving the world No 1 able only to smile and shake his head.A 154 checkout from Humphries gave him the fifth set and hopes of at least making it competitive, but Littler responded superbly and dominated the final two sets.On his precision when it counted, the teenager said: “That’s what I’ve learned from the past in the matchplay. I’ve got to perform the big out shots, the big scores when Luke does put me under pressure.“I think I played very well tonight. Luke was always behind me, I couldn’t step off the gas. I’m very happy to win.”Humphries was disappointed by his own display, saying: “He’s so clinical and the first four sets I missed darts to get in. Double 16 was my friend for the last three years and tonight it wasn’t.“When I was 4-0 down, I just wanted to give the crowd something. It’s hard to take, it’s disappointing because I felt like I was going to give him a lot better game than I did.

The victory, their third in four matches, lifted Australia to the top of the standings while the hosts, India, are third after a second straight defeat, having lost to South Africa earlier in the tournament. The top four teams qualify for the semi-finals .Australia chase down record score to beat India in Women’s Cricket World Cup – as it happenedRead moreHealy set the tone for the chase, sharing a brisk opening stand with Phoebe Litchfield and later a crucial partnership with Ashleigh Gardner (45), before falling, with Australia still needing 66 from 68 balls. Perry, who had earlier retired hurt with cramps, returned late in the innings to guide Australia over the line.“Really proud of the group,” said Healy. “A little bit tight at the back end. We have been preaching about the depth in our lineup, the fact that we could chase 330 [proved it].“Full credit to our bowlers for pulling it back; we could have been chasing 360-plus. I was trying to lock in for a big day. To contribute heavily was great, I would have liked to stay a bit longer but the girls got the job done.”The chase eclipsed the 302 made by Sri Lanka to beat South Africa at Potchefstroom in April 2024. Earlier, Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal shared a 155-run opening stand to put India on course for a huge total before a collapse in which they lost nine wickets for 138 to finish on 330.

And while the England star dazzled in patches with ball in hand, it was his composed kicking that was the difference asHarlequinsbeat Saracens 20-14 in a scrappy but enjoyable London derby.Smith launched raking kicks into space. He hoisted contestable spirals into pale blue skies. He dinked over the top of rushing defenders. His first‑half try came off a hoof into Saracens’ red zone, one that caused chaos in the backfield. Chandler Cunningham-South gathered the loose ball and bulldozed over the gain line. Shortly after, Smith, on the front foot, wriggled past a tackler to score from five metres out.Anthony Belleau turns the screw as Northampton see off rivals LeicesterRead more“He’s a British & Irish Lion,” Smith’s coach, Jason Gilmore, pointed out. “He gives us that game management. It’s something we’ve struggled with in the past two weeks.”Saracens were pinned in their own patch and struggled to get out. The mood of the match was summed up when another Smith bomb was shelled by Owen Farrell on the Saracens 22. Though the home side could not convert from the scrum, they maintained their territorial hold over their guests.Despite their dominance, Harlequins were not stretching their lead and it was wiped out when Saracens scored a screamer from their own half. At first receiver off the back of a scrum, Farrell pirouetted and delivered a gorgeous offload for Lucio Cinti who galloped up field. The Argentinian jinked left then right before stitching an offload of his own for the supporting Fergus Burke.Smith thought he had a second try after selling a dummy pass and bursting through a gap close to the Saracens line. Quins had nicked the ball off a defensive scrum but the ball had squirted out the side rather than through the No 8’s feet. Fin Baxter won a penalty off the very next scrum and Smith nudged over the penalty to take a 10-7 lead.Neither side managed to find much fluency in attack. At the 30-minute mark a packed Stoop witnessed 30 kicks from hand. Scrums needed restarting. Lineouts misfired. A brief exchange of shoves between Cunningham-South and Farrell brought one of the loudest cheers of the first half.View image in fullscreenTyrone Green shows his delight after scoring Harlequins’ second try.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PASmith belted a high kick with his first touch after the break. Tyrone Green chased after it and put enough pressure on Burke for the ball bobble away. Green was first to react, hacking ahead and winning the race to the line. Smith’s extras opened up a 17-7 lead.“We got what we deserved but maybe we were lucky to get what we got,” said the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, who gave his supporters some joy when he confirmed the return of Maro Itoje for next week. “Marcus kicked beautifully and put us under a lot of pressure. We probably didn’t prepare the team in the way we should have for what came today and that’s the coach’s fault. But we expect the playing group to react to that better than we did. We lost intent in all of the important things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the forwards hammering away in the left corner, Harlequins defenders were sucked into the morass. Ben Earl was the one heavy who kept his distance, prowling the right wing. The cross‑field kick from Farrell could not have been better placed and in a flash the gap was reduced to three after a tough conversion from the tram.Harlequins had the game won when the debutant Boris Wenger burrowed over from close range following a lineout five metres out. But, for the second time in the game, the home crowd booed a chalked‑off try as replays showed the replacement prop had committed a double movement.More kicking took the game’s total tally beyond 50 with seven minutes remaining. Crucially it was Smith dictating the tempo in the closing stages. Men in white were kicking in desperation. Smith had it on a string, ensuring the clock ticked down with all the action taking place in Saracens’ third. A penalty for Smith on the final hooter was a fitting end.“It was a different way to win a game,” said Gilmore, who deserves credit for moving away from the club’s ingrained desire to play free‑flowing rugby. It might not have been a vintage show from the league’s entertainers, but it got the job done against their bitter city rivals.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyHarlequinsSaracensRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Brewers were on the verge of their second World Series appearance in franchise history that year before losing Game 7 of the National League Championship Series at home to the Los Angeles Dodgers.Now they get another NLCS matchup with the Dodgers, who beat the Philadelphia Phillies in four games in the other NL Division Series. Game 1 is Monday at Milwaukee.Milwaukee won with an all-hands-on-deck pitching approach in the final game against Chicago. Trevor Megill, Jacob Misiorowski, Aaron Ashby, Chad Patrick and Abner Uribe combined on a four-hitter.That the Brewers ended their recent history of postseason frustration in this series was particularly sweet for Milwaukee fans because it came against their biggest rival and knocked Cubs manager Craig Counsell out of the postseason.Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area, played for the Brewers and became the winningest manager in team history until he left for Chicago.In the two seasons since Counsell’s departure, Brewers fans have booed every mention of his name whenever the Cubs have visited American Family Field. They did it again Saturday, though the sellout crowd appeared to include more Cubs backers than in Milwaukee’s Game 1 and Game 2 home victories.The Cubs had forced a Game 5 by winning two straight at Wrigley Field. They were attempting to become the 11th team to erase a 2-0 deficit and win a best-of-five playoff series, something last accomplished by the New York Yankees against Cleveland in their 2017 ALDS.Homers produced all the runs in this winner-take-all game, and each of Milwaukee’s came with two outs.Contreras hit a 389-foot shot to left-center off Drew Pomeranz in the first inning. Vaughn sent a 3-2 pitch from Colin Rea over the left-field wall to break a 1-all tie, and Turang provided some insurance with a 416-foot blast to center off Andrew Kittredge in the seventh.Chicago’s Seiya Suzuki greeted Misiorowski by sending a 101.4-mph fastball into the Cubs bullpen to lead off the second inning, but that’s the only run the rookie right-hander allowed in four innings. Misiorowski struck out three while giving up three hits and walking none to earn his second win of the series.The young right-hander pitched three innings of shutout relief in Milwaukee’s 7-3 Game 2 triumph.The Brewers had Misiorowski enter the game in the second inning after Megill worked as the opener and retired the side in order in the first. The Cubs had totaled 11 first-inning runs in the first four games of this series without ever going scoreless in the opening frame.After Suzuki’s homer, the Cubs didn’t score again.Chicago’s best threat came when it put two on with nobody out in the sixth against Ashby, who had thrown 32 pitches two nights earlier in Milwaukee’s 6-0 Game 4 loss. Michael Busch hit a leadoff single before Ashby hit Nico Hoerner with a pitch.Ashby got Kyle Tucker to strike out swinging at a 3-2 pitch for the first out. Patrick then came out of the bullpen and retired Suzuki on a fly to left before Ian Happ struck out looking.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsChicago CubsShareReuse this content"

In part, he responded: “It seems your piece is an attempted hit job meant to punish Meta for working with me on AI fairness. Nothing I’ve said has been on behalf of Meta – they work with people from every political background.”He added: “My role is simple: work to make AI fair for everyone, regardless of their views. That’s a goal anyone who believes in fairness should support. What you’re really trying here looks like cancel culture and activism dressed up as journalism, and I won’t cower for holding the same views as the political party that won the popular vote less than a year ago in America.”Heidi Beirich, the co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said: “It is appalling that Robby Starbuck was given a hand in Meta operations in any capacity. He peddles lies and pushes extremism, and it is hard to believe any of this will help make their platforms safer or better.Eric Bloem, vice-president of corporate citizenship at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said: “People should be able to find safe, welcoming communities online. Robby Starbuck pushes a dangerous anti-LGBTQ agenda, spreading disinformation and denying the very existence of transgender people.”Starbuck’s appointment to Meta via lawsuitStarbuck, formerly a music video director, has gained attention as an opponent of corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. His pressure campaigns have frequently been directed at companieswho are perceived as having conservative customer bases, and have induced major American firms to abandon internal DEI measures, or to end their relationships with pro-LGBTQ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign.Starbuck won his role in the aftermath of one such campaign.In the midst of a summer 2024 campaign aimed at motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, Starbuck threatened Meta with a lawsuit over claims its Meta AI chatbot apparently made about him. In August 2024, Starbuck posted a screenshot purporting to show Meta AI’s summary of a Facebook thread of Harley riders angry that the “company chose to go woke “.A screenshot in reply from a Harley-Davidson dealer appeared to show Meta AI asserting that Starbuck was, among other things, an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and had participated in the January 6 attack at the Capitol.Starbuckresponded: “Wow thanks for sending, Meta will hear from my lawyers since I was never at J6 and have been a longtime critic of QAnon.”That lawsuit was filed last April. Starbuck’s appointment to work with Meta waspart of the settlement. Other details of the settlement – including whether or not Starbuck was paid or is receiving ongoing compensation for the role – were not made public.On 8 August, Meta’s chief of global affairs Joel Kaplanposted on Xa joint statement with Starbuck.In part, the statement read: “Since engaging on these important issues with Robby, Meta has made tremendous strides to improve the accuracy of Meta AI and mitigate ideological and political bias.”The statement continued: “Building on that work, Meta and Robby Starbuck will work collaboratively in the coming months to continue to find ways to address issues of ideological and political bias and minimize the risk that the model returns hallucinations in response to user queries.”Bloem said: “There’s nothing unbiased about [Starbuck’s appointment].” He added: “Coupled with its January rollback of protections against hate speech across its platforms, this decision calls into question Meta’s commitment to keeping LGBTQ+ people and others safe online.”‘Portland is working with the terrorists’Starbuckhaslongpushed vaccinedisinformation, and he has amplified false claims made by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.In July, he boosted adebunkedclaim made by Kennedy in an interview with Tucker Carlson, in which he claimed that hepatitis B vaccinations led to a 1,135% increase in autism risk, adding: “This is absolutely criminal. The people behind this belong in jail and the hep B shot should be pulled immediately from the childhood vaccine schedule.”As part of his anti-DEI push, Starbuck has also spreadoverheated claimsandfalsehoodsabout transgender and LGBTQ people.He has also boosted such claims made by members of the Trump administration.In March, boosting a claimDonald Trump made in an address to Congressthat the government had spent “$8m for making mice transgender”, Starbuck wrote: “Democrats are trying to pretend that Trump was wrong about the government funding a study to turn mice transgender. He was NOT wrong. This is the study and it’s vile. Eighty female mice were ‘sacrificed’ after their last injection. Democrats funded this.”In fact, the mice studies sought to gauge the effect of hormone therapy on maladies such as wound-healing, HIV, and infertility.Starbuck’s online demeanor has continued largely unchanged since he was appointed, with him backing far-right figures in America and around the world and posting dubious pro-Trump narratives.Starbuck recently expressed support for authoritarians and he posted a video of Stephen Miller’s speech on theMemphis Safe Task Force, which has seen federal officers and national guard troops making arrests in there.Starbuck added the caption: “I’ve been advocating for us to make Memphis safe again for YEARS now by carrying out similar initiatives @nayibbukele executed successfully in El Salvador and finally… It’s happening.”El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, self-styled as the “world’s coolest dictator”, is celebrated by the far right in the US for his unconstitutional crackdown, which has seen up to more than 1.5% of the country’s population imprisoned, almost a quarter of those without trial,according to World Prison Brief.Starbuck also baselessly asserted that city officials in Portland were working with anti-fascists, and appeared to urge a violent response. Starbuckclaimedthat injuries to rightwing online personality Katie Daviscourt indicated that “the leftist government in Portland is working with the terrorists”, adding: “It’s time to treat Antifa cells like we would treat Isis cells.”In a comment on this allegation, Starbuck wrote: “The record is not in dispute. Portland councillors Angelita Morillo and Candace Avalos both publicly defended an antifa activist charged with assaulting a federal officer. Morillo has even posted tips to help antifa evade law enforcement. “He added: “When elected officials openly side with violent extremists, they are enabling them.”Morillo told the Guardian: “When influencers like Robby refer to ‘terrorists’, I’m not sure who they’re talking about – the guy in the frog suit? The people doing the Cha-Cha Slide outside the Ice facility in Portland? I can’t take anyone seriously who relies on sensationalized clips, AI content and outright lies to inform their thinking.”Avalos said: “People are free to say what they like on social media. That doesn’t make their statements true, and it doesn’t mean we have to take them at face value.“As a federal judge found in her recent ruling against the administration, the idea that there are coordinated attacks from ‘antifa, and other domestic terrorists’, as Trump alleged on Truth Social, is simply ‘untethered to the facts’. Who should we listen to: a sitting federal judge or someone with a Twitter account?”She added: “When I advise my constituents on how to protect themselves from federal agents acting unlawfully, I am speaking to the vast majority of Portlanders, who rightfully oppose fascism and are certainly not terrorists.”Starbuck also claimed that a high profile Trump detainee who was once incarcerated in Bukele’s brutal Cecot prison that “Kilmar Abrego Garcia [is] almost certainly an MS-13 member”.Twofederal judges this yearrejectedthe administration’s claims that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS13, and the government was ordered to facilitate his return from El Salvador.Commenting on his allegation, Starbuck wrote: “This is simple: an immigration court, DHS, and the president of the United States all identified Garcia as an MS-13 member. Denying it is no longer reporting – it’s spin in the pursuit of your own make-believe narrative. So once again, my language was perfectly appropriate.”‘This is domestic terrorism’In recent weeks, Starbuck has energetically attempted to connect the alleged perpetrators of high-profile shootings to the Democratic party.These claims culminated in avideoposted to X in which he claimed that “in less than 2 weeks there have been 5 domestic terrorism attacks by leftists”, citing the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the armed attack on an ABC affiliate in Sacramento, California; the attack on a wedding reception in Nashua, New Hampshire; and the attack on an Ice facility in Dallas. Another example he offered were purported chants of “Fuck Charlie Kirk!” by leftists in New York in the wake of Kirk’s death.In anearlier post, he cited the same events and claimed: “This is domestic terrorism”.The manaccused of the Sacramento ABC attackdoes have a long history of posting anti-Trump messages on social media, according to prosecutors, and spent two decades as “a lobbyist for healthcare, tribal and labor interests”, according to the New York Times.Evidence for connections between the other perpetrators and the Democratic party, or even the broader left, is either tenuous or non-existent.The claim about chanting demonstrators appears to arise frommid-September videos of counterprotesterswho, according to videos taken by independent journalists, disrupted a memorial vigil for Charlie Kirk in New York’s Washington Square. The identities, allegiances, and organizational affiliations of the counterprotesters are unspecified, and few media outlets reported on the story exceptRussian outletPravda.However, Joshua Jahn, who turned his gun on himself after the Dallas Ice attack, wasreportedly registeredas an independent in Oklahoma, and was described by friends as someone with “a vaguely libertarian bent who despised both major parties and politicians generally, including Trump, but who didn’t engage with politics beyond that”,according to reportingby journalist Ken Klippenstein.Hunter Nadeau, accused of killing one and wounding two others in an attack on a country club in Nashua, New Hampshire, reportedly yelled “Free Palestine” during the attack. But state attorney general John Formella said Nadeau “made a number of statements during the shooting and appeared to be attempting to cause chaos in the moment as opposed to showing a hate-based motivation”,according to NPR.Formella added: “We don’t have any evidence to indicate that this was a hate-based act.”Tyler Robinson, the man accused of Charlie Kirk’s murder, was reportedlyregistered as a non-partisan voter in Utah, although family members indicated he had moved politically to the left, according to prosecutors.Nevertheless, investigatorsreportedly told NBC Newsthat “thus far, there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any leftwing groups”.All of the reporting clouding the political allegiances of the shooters was on the public record on 25 September, when Starbuckrepliedto an X user who challenged him that “every single one of the cases I just pointed out are leftists”, blaming “left wing leaders … and their crazy followers”.Starbuck reiterated his claims about each shooter to the Guardian and linked to four sources he claimed supported him, including aDaily Mail storyabout Facebook posts by Joshua Jahn’s mother, and aprotest footage videopublished to YouTube by one of the previously cited independent videographers.He further responded with accusations about the Guardian, writing: “Why is the Guardian fixated on trying to downplay leftwing violence instead of investigating the clear surge of it?”He added: “I don’t have the luxury of ignoring this reality – my security team and the FBI are actively handling ongoing death threats against me. The dismissiveness from outlets like yours makes you complicit in emboldening this violence.”Meta adviserThe lawsuit that took Starbuck to Meta was carried out by a firm with Trump administration connections.Dhillon Law Group (DLG) filed suit in Delaware on behalf of Starbuck. In apress release, the firm said Meta’s chatbot had made “provably false and defamatory statements” about Starbuck.Between the original posts and the lawsuit, DLG founder Harmeet Dhillon was nominated and confirmed as Donald Trump’s assistant attorney general for civil rights. Trump named her as his pick in December and she was confirmed in April, weeks before Starbuck’s settlement.According to Office of Government Ethics filings, Dhillon divested her ownership in Dhillon Law Group in the firm in favor of her brother, a non-equity partner in the firm.In her 27 February ethics agreement, however, Dhillon wrote that she would “retain an interest in a portion of future recovery in 21 contingency fee cases based upon a fixed percentage of compensation”.The Guardian contacted the justice department to ask whether Starbuck’s case was one of the 21 that Dhillon retained an interest in. Initially, an automated response warned that “during the current lapse in appropriations, this inbox will not be monitored on a regular basis”.A spokesperson subsequently responded in an email, writing: “AAG Dhillon does not currently have any role in cases involving Mr Starbuck and their relationship is one of friendship and former client.”The Guardian then asked whether or not she had a role in his case at the time it was settled in April.The spokesperson said no.The Guardianpreviously reportedthat Dhillon earned a six-figure salary as CEO of a nonprofit, the Center for American Liberty (CAL), according to filings from 2021, 2022 and 2023. During that period, Dhillon Law Group received more than $1.3m as a contractor to the organization over two years. Dhillon, several CAL clients and Dhillon Law attorneysalso shared the servicesof the same Republican-aligned PR operative.During Dhillon’s leadership, the CAL pursued a myriad of culture-war lawsuits on behalf of rightwing influencers, “de-transitioners” and parents of transgender children, and churches that had been subject to California’s pandemic restrictions.Beirich, the extremism expert, said: “This is just another example of Meta caving to Trump and his allies, and bogus charges of political bias, and makes a mockery of fair content moderation on Meta’s various platforms.”Elsewhere in his comments to the Guardian, Starbuck wrote: “You should be honest with Guardian readers about the fact that you’ve been accused of extremely close ties with antifa.”Explore more on these topicsMetanewsShareReuse this content"

What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events.View image in fullscreenA Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in Oakland, California, on 23 September.Photograph: Denise HerediaThe talks come as the global movement againstSpotifyedges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background.Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNTpulledtheir music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.)View image in fullscreenMood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly.Photograph: HodderIn Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired.Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift,boycottedthe service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playingWill Anderson of Hotline TNTNeil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.View image in fullscreenManasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.Photograph: Eva TuffOthers such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too. Her album Year of the Slug came out only on vinyl and Bandcamp, inspired by Cindy Lee’s Diamond Jubilee, which was initially available only on YouTube and the filesharing site Mega. “I find it pretty lame that we put our heart and soul into something and then just put it online for free,” Rose says.Khruangbin, again? I quit Spotify for a month to escape samey algorithms – this is what I learnedRead moreRose is a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), an advocacy group formed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect music workers. Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”.“What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashida Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists.The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”This article was amended on 12 October 2025.

But should a little-known Post Office engineer named Tommy Flowers be seen as the real father of computing?Andrew SmithSun 12 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareThis is a story you know, right? It’s early in the war and western Europe has fallen. Only the Channel stands between Britain and the fascist yoke; only Atlantic shipping lanes offer hope of the population continuing to be fed, clothed and armed. But hunting “wolf packs” of Nazi U-boats pick off merchant shipping at will, coordinated by radio instructions the Brits can intercept but can’t read, thanks to the fiendish Enigma encryption machine. Unless something is done – and fast – Hitler’s plan to first bomb, then starve the country will succeed. Enter the geniusAlan Turing, working as a codebreaker at the top secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, who, in a generational act of intellectual virtuosity, designs and builds the world’s first computer to crack Enigma, allowing the U-boats to be neutralised and the war ultimately to be won. This is why Turing is known as the father of computing.It’s a great story. But, like a lot of great stories, it couldn’t be more wrong. The world’s first digital electronic computer, forerunner of the ones reshaping our world today,wasbuilt in Britain to revolutionise codebreaking during the second world war – a mind-boggling feat of creative innovation – but Turing wasn’t in the country at the time. Neither was it conceived by the mostly private school and Oxbridge-educated boffins at Bletchley Park. Rather, the machine Park staff called Colossus was the brainchild of a degreeless Post Office engineer named Tommy Flowers, a cockney bricklayer’s son who for decades was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from acknowledging his achievement. Now, with his 120th birthday approaching and a Tommy Flowers Foundation established to right this historical wrong, he is finally getting some of his due, starting with a mural by the artist Jimmy C (best known for the David Bowie mural in Brixton, south London) at the National Museum of Computing.Here’s the story youdidn’tsee in the movies.On a sun-drenched weekday in August, Bletchley Park is the soul of pleasantness: a stately home flanking a lake codebreakers skated on in winter between battling a constantly evolving phalanx of electromechanical encryption machines used to scramble messages between leaders of the Third Reich. On the right as you face the house is a Lego brick complex of concrete huts – grim-looking, as one female codebreaker noted on arrival, but with an aura you fancy you can still feel. I’ve noticed that visitors tend to speak in hushed tones here, as though wary of distracting the brilliant minds still haunting the place. Stephen Fry once declared, “Just saying the name Bletchley Park gives me goosebumps.” Clearly he is not alone.In the visitors’ centre cafe, one of the Park’s two in-house historians, David Kenyon, explains why the bucolic scene modern visitors encounter needs contextualising. The popular imagining of Bletchley Park (BP) as a determinedly unmilitary scratchpad for eccentric geniuses may have been true in the beginning, he says. But by the end of 1943, when many of the cryptographic breakthroughs had been made, BP was on its way to becoming a codebreaking and intelligence factory underpinning the entire Allied effort. The huts Turing and the cryptographers originally toiled in were now used for minor admin work, while a growing inventory of futuristic codebreaking machines whirred and hummed in a complex of huge lettered blocks built around a communication centre on the far side of the mansion, connected by mechanical conveyors and vacuum tube delivery systems. At peak more than 10,000 people worked here round the clock, in three eight-hour shifts and improbable secrecy. Three-quarters were women, their mean age between 20 and 22.View image in fullscreenCodebreakers at Bletchley Park in 1943.Photograph: Science Museum Photo Studio/Bletchley Park Trust/Science Museum Group“Substitution cyphers” such as those the Nazis favoured have existed for at least two millennia. The first known use is recorded by Julius Caesar in his book Gallic Wars, where he describes encrypting a message to his besieged general Cicero by substituting Greek letters for Roman ones. One of the most famous cyphers would subsequently be named for him and involve replacing the original letters of a message (the plaintext) with those a certain number of places along in the alphabet.Substitution cyphers present obvious points of attack to an enemy. Being able to guess any of the words, for instance “Heil Hitler” at the end of a message, will offer a way in. Letters that appear often, or rarely, or mostly together in the encrypted cyphertext, reflecting patterns in the original message, can offer a toehold. For two millennia cryptography has been a battle of wits between code makers and breakers.By the time we reached the typewriter-sized Enigma machine, three rotor wheels, like the barrels of a combination lock, were being used to addle plaintext messages. But where the barrels of a combination lock have 10 possible starting positions (0 to 9), these had 26, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. And then came the fiendish bit: each letter activated a different substitution alphabet – in one position b might become f, in another q. What’s more, with every plaintext letter typed into the machine, at least one wheel rotates, so changing the substitution alphabet and muddying the patterns on which codebreakers rely.He should be up there with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, all the great figures of computing. He should have made as much money as they didThe British had known about Enigma since 1921, when its manufacturer tried to sell them on it. Dillwyn “Dilly” Knox, a brilliant codebreaker who was said to have been a lover of John Maynard Keynes at Eton and would work closely with Turing at BP, brought one back from Vienna for testing in 1926, when it was found to have small but significant vulnerabilities and rejected. By 1939 and the outbreak of war, a gifted Polish mathematician named Marian Rejewski had broken it “by hand”, with paper and pencil, and with colleagues designed a machine they called Bomba to speed the process. One of Turing’s several acts of genius was to break the more complex naval Enigma machine, before which U-boat wolf packs ran riot in the North Atlantic. Another was designing his own machine, called the Bombe in tribute to his Polish predecessors but vastly more sophisticated than theirs. There’s no way to exaggerate the importance of these contributions. And yet greater challenges lay in wait, leading to a crisis with an outcome no one could have predicted. Enter Tommy Flowers.By June 1941 most of the work on Enigma was done. That month, however, “Y Service” eavesdroppers at Knockholt in Kent intercepted a Nazi message encrypted in a way they hadn’t seen before. Instead of being transmitted in morse code, like Enigma, this one arrived in teleprinter code, in which each letter was allocated a five-bit binary number. G, for instance, was 01011, equivalent to the decimal number 11. The binary number for each character was then transmitted via rapid pulses and silences – not dissimilar to a 1990s modem.A teleprinter machine took ordinary typewriter-type keyboard input, converted it to a stream of these five-bit binary numbers and transmitted it. An identical machine at the other end printed the message on tickertape, punching a hole to represent a one and leaving a space to represent zero. Each horizontal line on a teletype tape thus represented a specific character. In the middle of the tape was a smaller sprocket hole used to drive it through the machine.The mysterious device was active for 16 months of testing, until October 1942, then vanished. British codebreakers dared hope it had been abandoned. Yet almost immediately it reappeared on a line between Berlin and Salonika in occupied Greece – this time to stay. Soon this ghost machine, which the British would never see during wartime, was scrambling traffic on multiple lines, protecting communications between Hitler, his high command and commanders in the field: material of the highest possible order. In keeping with the British characterisation of intercepted messages as fish, the new machine was nicknamed Tunny, for tuna.View image in fullscreenColossus, Flowers’ groundbreaking computer, at Bletchley Park in the 1940s.Photograph: Science History Images/AlamyKnown to German high command as the Lorenz SZ40, Tunny was the size of a laser printer and far more sophisticated than Enigma. It attached directly to a teleprinter and made use of not three or four but12wheels, each with a different number of positions, ranging from 23 to 61 (all prime numbers). As per Enigma, the operator of the receiving Tunny machine needed to know the starting positions of each wheel: Bletchley codebreakers called these the wheelsettings. But the internal configurations of each wheel could also be changed with the use of small pins, effectively rewiring the machine: BP called these the wheelpatterns.For a year the Research Section at Bletchley strained against Tunny. At first their only hope of a window into the machine rested with enemy carelessness. When, on 30 August 1941, an operator ignored protocol and sent the same message twice without changing the wheel settings, small errors in the second version allowed a veteran cryptanalyst named John Tiltman to deduce 4,000 characters of decrypted text, then infer the wheel patterns (changed monthly at this time). Yet from this high, codebreakers watched in agony as, months later, Nazi high command tightened security, locking them out all over again.Which is how it stayed for another year, until 25-­year-old postgraduate chemist turned mathematician Bill Tutte, in one of the most remarkable intellectual feats of the war, extended an insight of Turing’s that had allowed wheel patterns to be broken and conceived a formula for uncovering the all-important wheel settings. Enough information for any message to be decrypted. But there was a problem. Applying Tutte’s formula to a Tunny cyphertext by hand would take a century or more per message. Still locked out of Tunny traffic except in increasingly rare instances of operator error, the codebreakers’ agony only increased.The first intake of codebreakers had been light on mathematicians, who were thought too abstracted and weird to trust. Turing’s breakthroughs helped change this, along with a popularity resting on what colleague Peter Hilton called “his original approach to problems of any kind and his quirky and infectious sense of humour”. One beneficiary of the change was a Cambridge don named Max Newman, who found painstaking pencil-and-paper work dull and was on the brink of returning to university when Tunny drew him back.If you asked Central Casting for a photo of a cerebral academic and they sent you one of Newman, you’d send it back demanding more imagination. There are the round milk bottle glasses; hair battling for headspace with giant brain. In a lecture series in the 1930s, Newman had wondered if intractable maths problems could one day be automated away. He didn’t specify how this would be done, but one of his students – Turing – did, in what is now one of the most famous academic papers ever written, On Computable Numbers. This is the actual reason Turing is “the father of computing”.View image in fullscreenAlan Turing, who was so impressed with Flowers that he called on him to help codebreak at Bletchley Park.Photograph: Pictures from History/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe machine Newman now designed to execute Tutte’s formula for attacking Tunny wheel settings was by no stretch a computer in the modern sense, but had the benefit of being relatively quick to build. BP staff named it Heath Robinson for its thrown-together look. And it worked, if with substantial problems, not least being its use of two teleprinter tape loops, one containing the binary cyphertext to be attacked and the other Tunny’s already decrypted wheel patterns, which had to be kept perfectly in sync but tended to stretch, wear and snap. It was also slow and not perfectly reliable. When the team building it ran into difficulties, Turing suggested they consult an engineer he’d worked with and been impressed by. That engineer’s name was Tommy Flowers.Flowers was born in 1905 in Poplar, east London, the son of a master bricklayer. At 12 he won a scholarship to the local technical college and went from there to an apprenticeship at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, then renowned for precision mechanical engineering. Over four years he learned a range of design and manufacturing skills, yet by the end knew mechanical engineering wasn’t for him. What excited Flowers waselectricity.One of the few organisations hiring in the postwar slump of the 20s was the Post Office, then responsible for mail and telecoms and engaged in an ambitious plan to replace their manual phone exchanges with automatic ones. Flowers joined in 1926 and soon built a reputation as an innovative thinker. By the time Turing came calling, he was head of switching research at the Post Office’s Dollis Hill Research Station in north London.There’s less publicly available information on Flowers than almost anyone else in this tale. But over the line from Washington DC, his niece, Bridget Young, now 82, fills in some of the blanks about his life prior to Bletchley Park. Young went to live with her uncle aged 15, after her father and disabled mother – Flowers’ sister, who he was very close to – died in a car crash. This wasn’t the first familial trauma he’d endured: he was only 25 when his father died suddenly of a stroke, leaving him to assume responsibility for his two sisters and mother, there being no pensions or social safety net in those days. Then one night in October 1940, while he was involved in war work at Dollis Hill, he received news that a bomb had fallen on the family home, killing his mother and youngest sister. He had to go and identify their bodies, as he later would Bridget Young’s parents. For him, the fight against Tunny was personal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

She reads me a monograph he wrote in which he laments the inequality of opportunity for working-class children. Going to university never occurred to him. “I had to get a university standard of education by study in my own time without the benefit of actually attending,” he writes.According to Young, Flowers’ sense of his East End roots never left him. In retirement, when he was stuck on a waiting list for a hip replacement, she offered to pay for it to be done privately – not because he couldn’t afford it but because it might spur him to action – and recalls him telling her, “No, ducks, if my number hasn’t come up, it must be because there are people who need it more than me.” It turned out – in the kind of irony a novelist wouldn’t dare try to fly – the health authority computer had randomly dropped him from the list.When I told him there was going to be a book, telling the whole story, he looked interested, but he said, ‘It’s too late’Working in his lab at Dollis Hill, visiting Bletchley as needed, Flowers improved Newman’s design for Heath Robinson and oversaw its manufacture, but still considered it a poor machine. In response, in February 1943, he stunned the boffins with a plan for a fully electronic digital machine that would use thermionic valves as switches to generate and process the zeroes and ones used for binary calculation. Valves – mostly found in guitar amplifiers and high-end hi-fi systems now – look like small, tubular lightbulbs. In the 1940s most people knew them from radio sets, and they had a reputation for constantly failing. Yet, having pioneered their use in automatic telephone exchanges, Flowers knew that if left switched on they were highly reliable.The idea of using valves as switches in a digital system was so new and radical that Flowers may have been the only person in Britain capable of seeing it – and of knowing they would be millions of times faster than the traditional electromechanical switches Newman used: he had already used them to build a prototype digital memory unit for the Post Office, a truly astonishing first. Nonetheless, Flowers later characterised the response he got at BP as “incredulity”. Nothing like the machine he proposed, using 1,600 valves to perform digital calculations, had ever been contemplated (“What, are you going tothrowthem at the Germans?” a procurement officer scoffed). Just as mathematicians had been sidelined in favour of genteel denizens of the humanities at first, so building actual things implied “trade”, which tended to be looked down upon. Newman wished him well but pressed on with the utilitarian Heath Robinson.Turing was different, being someone who loved both making and thinking. He was supportive of Flowers and offered advice on the machine’s logic, but couldn’t be around to provide more than this, because he would be in the US, helping to establish a cluster of US-built Bombes to be run as a BP outpost in Washington DC.View image in fullscreenFlowers at 90, with his rebuilt Colossus.Photograph: Peter Trievnor/Times Newspapers LtdFlowers went away feeling the Bletchley people hadn’t understood him. Luckily his boss at Dollis Hill did and put the Research Station resources at his disposal. Recruitment of able telephone engineers and “wiremen” from around the country yielded a close-knit team of 50 or so, most in their early 20s. Few could be told the purpose of what they were working on, but the intensity of six-to-seven-day work weeks made clear it was important. At one point a resident barber was hired to minimise the need to leave the building.After 10 months working round the clock, it was done. Colossus weighed a ton and occupied a whole room. Where Heath Robinson used two tapes, Flowers’ machine allowed the Tunny wheel patterns to beprogrammedinto it using plugboards and switches. His original plan was to digitise the Tunny cyphertext being attacked, too, but this was deemed problematic for long messages, so it remained on tape, as rows of holes and spaces representing five-bit binary numbers. The teleprinter tape sprocket holes, conventionally used to drive the tape forward, served to synchronise the whole machine, functioning like the “clock” in a modern computer. Which is what Flowers and his team of young Post Office engineers had built: the world’s first special purpose electronic digital computer.Delivered in a Post Office truck to BP on 18 January, the prototype was assembled by Flowers’ people and worked almost immediately. Its first job, for a cyphertext whose decrypt was known, took 10 minutes. Flowers later marvelled that “when the first machine was constructed and running, they couldn’t believe it”. More were ordered, to be produced in a commandeered Birmingham Post Office factory at a rate of one a month, with the enhanced Colossus II involved in a race to be ready for D-day in June 1944 (though whether it had a specific role in D-day is unclear). Subsequent models included many new features and innovations, with a later example including what one of the Colossus team proudly describes as “a relatively large semi-permanent memory”, equivalent to Ram. By VE Day 10 machines were working round the clock in two giant steel-framed buildings: a codebreaking factory.After the war, Churchill ordered most of the Colossi to be destroyed, with all information about them classified. Two went to GCHQ, where they remained in use until the 1960s. One, or possibly two, were disassembled and, with parts scrubbed of clues to their previous use, went with Newman to Manchester University, to help build the world’s first general purpose computer, soon taken to market as the Ferranti Mark I. Turing went to the National Physical Laboratory in London, where he built the most sophisticated computer of the immediate postwar years, the ACE.Meet the female codebreakers of Bletchley ParkRead moreBoth Newman and Turing have long (and rightly) been considered seminal figures in the annals of computing. No one seems to have guessed they were shown the way by a working-class Post Office engineer. Meanwhile, two years after Flowers delivered Colossus, he was forced to watch the Americans John Mauchly and J Presper Eckert being feted as visionary builders of the first computer, the ENIAC, and enriched accordingly; to see their claim repeated in history books for the next 50 years, unable to say anything in reply. Worse, when he tried to persuade the Post Office to modernise with the technology he pioneered, managers didn’t believe he could make it work and thought him pretentious for suggesting he could.Full details would take another five decades to be declassified. By then, a computer scientist named Tony Sale, fresh from campaigning to save BP from property developers, had begun a rebuild of a Colossus, which now lives at the Bletchley-based National Museum of Computing. After speaking with the historian David Kenyon, I amble round the corner for a treat: not just to see Colossus, but to see it running. In operation it’s majestic, all crisply spooling tape and flashing lights, and surprisingly smooth-running; the kind of conceptual leap the world doesn’t see often. I’ve been lucky to meet a lot of charismatic machines, but few have the kind of presence this one does.Jack Copeland is professor of philosophy at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, and director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing. Any article or discussion of Turing or Colossus owes a huge debt to his work and this one is no exception. If anyone is well placed to provide perspective on Flowers’ life and achievements, he is.“Of course, Tommy couldn’t have patented anything he’d done,” he tells me over Zoom. “He should be up there with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and all the rest of them, one of the great figures of the history of computing. He should have made as much money as they did, certainly as much as Eckert and Mauchly did.”Copeland met and interviewed Flowers before he died in 1998, just as a new tranche of material relating to Tunny and Colossus was being released. How was the engineer feeling about his deferred recognition?“You know, I think he was over it by then. I remember one day bouncing in, full of the joys of spring, saying, ‘Hey, there’s going to be a book’” – the monumentalColossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park’s Codebreaking Computers, which Copeland edited – “‘and it’s going to tell the whole story.’ He just sort of … looked interested, but he said, ‘It’s too late. It’s much too late.’”Bridget Young is pleased her beloved uncle got to see his achievements acknowledged finally, even if most people still think Turing built Colossus. But she recalls someone who was mostly happy; who in retirement was still acquiring ambitions and enthusiasms, from painting to playing bassoon in an orchestra.“You know, I have three kids and my older son was always fascinated by Uncle. He used to get a magazine called Cricket and somebody wrote an article about the first computer, the ENIAC computer. So Daniel, who must have been about seven, wrote them a letter saying, ‘No, they weren’t the first, my uncle was!’ And Cricket printed the letter, so I sent a copy to Uncle, saying, ‘Look, you’ve got somebody standing up for you.’ And Uncle wrote Daniel this wonderful letter, in which he thanked him for defending him, then said, ‘You know, when a new discovery is about to be made, it’s usually happening in several places at the same time, because different developments, in different disciplines, are all making different moves forward, until enough is known that a new step is needed. It’s never just one person in one place.’ I think for him the reward was what he and the others all did together.”This and other stories appear in Andrew Smith’s bookDevil in the Stack: A Coding Odyssey(Grove Press UK).Explore more on these topicsSecond world warAlan TuringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s one thing to use a witty phrase – another thing entirely to build a whole fake persona …Alexandra JonesSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 15.16 EDTShareStanding outside the pub, 36-year-old business owner Rachel took a final tug on her vape and steeled herself to meet the man she’d spent the last three weeks opening up to. They’d matched on the dating app Hinge and built a rapport that quickly became something deeper. “From the beginning he was asking very open-ended questions, and that felt refreshing,” says Rachel. One early message from her match read: “I’ve been reading a bit about attachment styles lately, it’s helped me to understand myself better – and the type of partner I should be looking for. Have you ever looked at yours? Do you know your attachment style?” “It was like he was genuinely trying to get to know me on a deeper level. The questions felt a lot more thoughtful than the usual, ‘How’s your day going?’” she says.Soon, Rachel and her match were speaking daily, their conversations running the gamut from the ridiculous (favourite memes, ketchup v mayonnaise) to the sublime (expectations in love, childhood traumas). Often they’d have late-night exchanges that left her staring at her phone long after she should have been asleep. “They were like things that you read in self-help books – really personal conversations about who we are and what we want for our lives,” she says.Which is why the man who greeted her inside the pub – polite, pleasant but oddly flat – felt like a stranger. Gone was the quickfire wit and playful rhythm she’d come to expect from their exchanges. Over pints he stumbled through small talk, checked his phone a little too often, and seemed to wilt under the pressure of her questions. “I felt like I was sitting opposite someone I’d never even spoken to,” she says. “I tried to have the same sort of conversation as we’d been having online, but it was like, ‘Knock, knock, is anyone home?’ – like he knew basically nothing about me. That’s when I suspected he’d been using AI.”Rachel gave her date the benefit of the doubt. “I thought maybe he was nervous,” she says. But she’d been “Chatfished” before, so when the gap between his real and digital selves failed to close on their second date, she called it off. “I’d already been ChatGPT-ed into bed at least once. I didn’t want it to happen again.”Where once daters were duped by soft-focus photos and borrowed chat-up lines, now they’re seduced by ChatGPT-polished banter and AI-generated charm.Datingapp fatigue is nothing new; for all its promise of convenience and unlimited choices, the gamified nature of finding love in the app age has, over the years, left many users feeling disposable. And, as AI becomes an ever more present feature of modern life – embedded into everything from healthcare systems to online grocery shopping – it’s adding yet another layer of digital artifice to the search for love.In a landscape where text-based communication plays an outsized role in the search for love, it’s perhaps understandable that some of us reach for AI’s helping hand – not everyone gives good text. Some Chatfishers, though, go to greater extremes, outsourcing entire conversations to ChatGPT, leaving their match in a dystopian hall of mirrors: believing they’re building a genuine connection with another human being when in reality they’re opening up to an algorithm trained to reflect their desires back to them.The majority of Chatfishers say they would never dream of letting AI do all of their talking. Most are like 38-year-old Londoner Nick, who sees it as a tool to help foster stronger connections with app matches. He works in tech and lives with his girlfriend; they’re in an open relationship and both date other people casually. He sometimes uses ChatGPT in his conversations on the dating appsFeeldand Bumble. “If I’m using a dating app,” he says, “I want to start a conversation that feels meaningful from the beginning so I can hook the other person in – but also I don’t want to spend too much time on it. Equally, while I want it to be ‘meaningful’, I don’t necessarily want to get super heavy and emotional straight away – it feels like quite a balancing act.” ChatGPT, he says, helps him tread that fine line: offering enough charm to spark a connection, without the investment of time or emotional labour that might otherwise feel wasted if the match fizzles out after a handful of messages.I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questionsFor Nick, ChatGPT isn’t helpful “if I have a good connection with someone and the conversation is flowing – because what’s the point in using it then?” If, on the other hand, he’s matched with a person “and things are stalling, maybe the conversation has gotten a bit boring but the person is really hot or intriguing, then I might say, ‘Please find a good, engaging, funny answer to this to keep the conversation going.’” He never copies entire answers – “ChatGPT formulates things in a very obvious way,” he says – but he takes inspiration, or uses certain lines and phrases that sound most like him. Still, he admits there’s a subtle slippage when you start filtering yourself through a bot. “It might have generated some things I wouldn’t say or aren’t 100% me, but I went with them anyway. So, in that respect it probably has influenced what someone thinks about me,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s dishonest. I’m mostly me on the dating app – just maybe asking better questions.”For the past three months, 28-year-old social worker Holly from Kent has been navigating a “situationship” with a co-worker. Though they knew each other from the office, they initially started speaking via LinkedIn. Now, they see each other sporadically – “I wouldn’t call them dates,” Holly deadpans – but speak often via WhatsApp. “I mainly use AI because I tend to write really long messages,” she says, “so I’ll put them into ChatGPT and say, ‘Please make this softer and more clear’, or, ‘I need to sound harsher here so he understands I’m upset.’” She doesn’t feel that it’s misleading – “I’m not trying to manipulate anyone,” she says.Her story perhaps speaks to the fact that relationship dynamics have shifted in recent years. According to a2024 YouGov poll, for instance, around half of Americans aged 18-34 reported having been, like Holly, in a situationship (a term it defines as “a romantic connection that exists in a gray area, neither strictly platonic nor officially a committed relationship”). At the same time, few of us have developed the communication skills to navigate the emotional grey areas thrown up by less stable relationship boundaries. For Holly, having her messages reshaped by AI means she can strike the right balance between honesty and tact: “Sometimes it helps me sound kinder when I’m angry.” Still, she says she would never tell her situationship that she uses AI to help her message him – “and I guess maybe he sees me as less reactive and more understanding because of how my messages are.”As 32-year-old Rich points out, though, “it’s not like using ChatGPT guarantees success”. When he met someone in a bar one Friday night and swapped social media handles, he asked AI what his next move should be. ChatGPT discerned that sending an initial message on Monday midmorning would set the right pace. “Then it gave me some options for what the message could be,” says Rich. “Keep it light, warm, and low-stakes so it reads as genuine interest without urgency,” the bot advised. “Something like: Hey Sarah, still laughing about [tiny shared moment/reference if you’ve got one] – good to meet you!” Rich went back and forth with ChatGPT until he felt they’d hit upon exactly the right message (“Hey Sarah, it was lovely to meet you”) but sadly she never replied, he says. “It’s been two weeks now.”When it’s obvious, the polish of ChatGPT can have the opposite effect to the intended. “I lose interest quickly,” says 35-year-old Nina, who works as an editor for a Serbian language website in Manchester. She was recently on the receiving end of an AI-generated opening line: “Your smile is effortlessly captivating”. “No one talks like that,” she says. She didn’t bother replying. She’s been single for three years and uses Hinge and Bumble. She has turned to AI herself to help improve her profiles: “It basically told me to sound more confident and positive,” she says. “I’ve also asked it for help with opening lines, especially when I didn’t know what to say. Once or twice I thought my matches were using it on me, too – their replies felt too polished, like they weren’t really listening. It’s helpful in some ways but it does make me wonder what’s real.”I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum goingJamil, 25, from Leicester, admits he’s a prolific Chatfisher but argues that AI is simply a workaround for what he sees as the coded jargon of modern dating. “Like, what do you mean ‘What’s my attachment style?’” he balks. “Every girl on the apps has this thing about ‘love languages’ – it’s just gibberish, but if you don’t talk about it, people are like, ‘Oh you’re a red flag.’”At first, he turned to ChatGPT in desperation. “It was just a quick thing,” he says. He works on an IT help desk and found himself trying to continue a conversation with a girl he wanted to impress while also swamped with work. “I asked ChatGPT what ‘avoidant style attachment’ meant because a girl was saying she’d been told this was her, and it explained, then added this prompt at the end like, ‘Do you want me to craft a reply?’ So I said yeah. I felt out of my depth and was also just really busy that day. I thought she was fit so I wanted to keep the momentum going.” The reply – “I think mine is ‘clingy but with snacks’, so maybe we’ll balance each other out” – proved effective. “She sent a few skull emojis, meaning she was dying laughing. I said I’d have to message her later because of work, and she replied asking if I wanted to meet – so yeah, it was, like, ‘Wow, this works.’”Francesca, 33, owns a digital marketing agency in Cardiff. Like Jamil, she explains that ChatGPT grants her access to a world of inferences and subtext that she’d otherwise find impossible to navigate. “As an autistic woman in an era where the only way to meet anyone is through dating apps, I have struggled immensely. I found understanding tone and ‘the rules’ impossible and so ChatGPT has been really useful,” she says. When she started using it in a dating context it was more as a digital sounding board – an impartial presence that could give her feedback on her profile and offer a debrief after a date.“I pasted all the Hinge prompts [the questions users fill in on their profile] into ChatGPT and said, ‘Knowing what you know of me, choose the best prompts and write a good answer,’” she says. The bot replied: “Based on everything I know about you – creative, self-aware, emotionally intelligent … I’d recommend choosing one of the following Hinge prompts ….”She didn’t copy them exactly, Francesca says, but it gave her a lot of inspiration. Regardless, it still felt like her because the bot was taking what it knew about her from their daily exchanges – “AI is integrated into many parts of my business,” she says – and compressing it into the concise, playful language appropriate for a dating app. “It wasn’t writing me a new personality.”Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me againIt wasn’t until she’d matched with a man whom she found difficult to read that she began to deploy ChatGPT for messaging. “Our messages before we met had been really good [without any help from AI] but in person, he wasn’t very flirty or forward and didn’t try to kiss me at the end of our first date. I thought either he didn’t really fancy me or he was just trying to be respectful,” she says. She took screenshots of their last few exchanges, fed the messages and a short account of the date – a blustery walk around a lake – into ChatGPT, and asked it to read the room for her. The reply, helpfully clinical, suggested he was probably being respectful rather than uninterested, and recommended a light, open-ended follow-up. She sent a version of the suggested message, he replied enthusiastically, and they arranged a second date. “I was like, ‘Oh ChatGPT was right, he did want to see me again.’”After that she found herself checking with the bot between every message, and requesting five variations before choosing the one that sounded most like her. “Over the course of a week, I realised I was relying on it quite a lot,” she says. “And I was like, you know what, that’s fine – why not outsource my love life to ChatGPT?”View image in fullscreen‘I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.’Photograph: Getty Images/ iStockphotoBy the time they’d been on their third date, though, “I was using ChatGPT for our entire communication,” says Francesca. “I wasn’t even replying any more – he was basically just dating ChatGPT.” In person, their dates still lacked spark. “I was very aware that I’d taken it too far but I felt like I was in too deep by that point. I didn’t know how to get out of it, I didn’t know how to talk to this person as myself any more.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On Discord, a chat platform popular with gamers and tech communities, he came across channels dedicated to AI where other single men were exchanging tips about how to prompt ChatGPT to generate effective dating messages. “So, for instance, someone said that if you start a chat with a girl by asking her a list of questions – favourite film, dream holiday, that kind of thing – then paste her answers into ChatGPT, it would craft replies that would make you sound like her perfect match.” It proved effective. “It got me a lot more dates than I was getting before.”I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonestChat GPT is alarge language model(LMM), and the way LLMs work is by spotting patterns in language – the bot was picking up on keywords and themes in his match’s answers and weaving them into jokes, compliments or echoes of shared interests. Where Jamil might have left an awkward “nice” or “cool”, the bot would spin his match’s love of Bali into a playful, if somewhat unimaginative, line about coconut cocktails. It made him seem, at the very least, attentive. Jamil says he doesn’t feel he tricked anyone, he sees it more as hacking the apps themselves. “Dating apps put everyone at a disadvantage – you’re competing with hundreds of other people for attention, and half the time the chats die after two or three messages. If ChatGPT helps me stand out, why wouldn’t I use it?”Still, there was one date that pricked his conscience. He was doing the usual copy-and-paste, letting ChatGPT do the heavy lifting, “when a girl started talking about how she’d had a bereavement in her family”. ChatGPT navigated her grief with composure, synthesising the kind of sympathy that made Jamil seem like a model of emotional literacy. “It said something like, ‘I’m so sorry you’re going through this, it must be really difficult – thank you for trusting me with it,’” Jamil recalls. When he met the girl in real life, she noted how supportive he’d been in his messages. “I felt bad – I think that was the only time I thought it was kind of dishonest. I didn’t tell her I’d used ChatGPT but I really tried to message her myself after that.”Recently he says he’s been caught out more often. “I’ll get people saying point blank, ‘This sounds bait’, even if I’m not just copy-and-pasting. More people are using AI now so they can spot it. I think the golden age of just letting it do all your messaging has passed.”Francesca had a wake-up call when a simple mistake nearly gave the game away. She pasted a wry message scripted by ChatGPT into her WhatsApp chat with a date, only to realise it ended with the telltale bot prompt: “Do you want me to make this punchier?” It wasn’t until his baffled reply – “What do you mean?” – that she realised her mistake. “I just thought, Oh God, I’ve been caught,” she says. She left his question unanswered for a few hours, until deciding the only option was to style it out by pretending that part was meant for a co-worker.“We went on one more date afterwards but I wasn’t sure if he was interested in me or not, so I just let it go. I thought, ‘I’m not up for having to analyse every interaction to see if he’s into me.’ And anyway, by that point, 90% of the messages he’d had off me had been by ChatGPT so it wasn’t like we’d properly gotten to know each other – he was basically dating the AI.”ForPaul C Brunson, dating guru and one of the experts currently guiding contestants on Married at First Sight UK, there’s a clear line between using AI as a tool and actively lying. “AI is amazing and it has the potential to help a lot of people – of course it depends on the degree to which someone is relying on it and the purpose behind why they’re using it. For many, it’s simply an enhancement that will allow them to connect with others more easily.” For him, the ultimate dating advice will always be to meet your matches as soon as possible. “It’s the best way to determine if you’re a viable match – you get to observe their behaviour and see if they seem trustworthy. You know, were they consistent in their word? Did they show up when they said they would? Did you feel like you were physically attracted to them? How was the communication when you were sitting opposite them? AI doesn’t impact any of that – AI is the tool to help facilitate the meetup.” Equally, though, he says that most of us know that “fully misrepresenting who you are – lying, basically,” has no place in modern dating. “And I think the vast majority of people would know when they’ve crossed that line.”The problem, as Rachel sees it, is that some people will cross that line deliberately. “Before the advent of AI, it was like, OK, maybe you don’t look like your pictures,” she says, “and that’s annoying but you’d quickly be caught out. Now though, people are putting forward entirely new personas.” She describes being on the receiving end of the kinds of techniques that Jamil uses – being drilled with questions, “like you’re answering an HR questionnaire”, then off the back of those answers “having conversations where it feels as if the other person has a tap on my phone because everything they say is so perfectly suited to me”.The worst, she says, was the time she matched with a handsome man. “It’s an awful generalisation – but I thought he would be all looks and no substance,” she admits. It was a pleasant surprise, then, when their digitalconversation flowed easily and she realised they had a lot in common. “I thought I’d found the perfect man. At one point, I talked about how much I loved going on walks and he was like, ‘I know this place with amazing lavender fields, I’m going to take you there.’ I mean, I was used to dating people who didn’t even get me a card on my birthday – and this man was offering to take me to lavender fields? I felt he was really listening to me.”When you’re looking for love and someone says the right things, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’Their date went well, carried on a tide of high spirits from days of intense messaging. “We got pretty intoxicated and did sleep together – I was just swept away by it all,” she says. After that date, though, the messages changed – the flowing sentences filled with questions and quips, the bullet-point lists of books she might like and places they should visit, were replaced by terse one-word replies, sent after long delays. She showed the conversation to a friend, who was the first person to point out that many of his messages bore the hallmarks of having been generated by ChatGPT. She’d never used AI and so wasn’t on the lookout for the distinctive cadences and long dashes. “Maybe I was naive, but when you’re looking for love and someone comes along who says the right things, seems to be on the same page as you, you aren’t thinking, ‘He must be a bot’, you’re thinking you’ve just stumbled across Prince Charming.”If ghosting was the defining hazard of early app dating, Chatfishing may be its AI-age successor. The rise of ChatGPT in our romantic lives might simply be a symptom of burnout: after years of swiping and stilted exchanges, who wouldn’t be tempted by a digital dating coach, promising wit on tap? Dating apps encourage us to treat romance like a market, full of infinite choice, where we are products to be optimised. AI simply extends that logic – and if the right line, the right cadence, can buy us a little more attention, why wouldn’t we use it?‘People say I come across as incredibly boring!’ How to find love on the dating apps – whatever the obstaclesRead moreBut the secrecy around it is revealing. That so many daters are hiding their reliance on AI suggests that deep down we all know that true intimacy demands vulnerability. Having a chatbot mediate our flirtations – even just in the early stages – risks dimming that intangible spark that only arises in unscripted moments. Worse still, as Rachel’s lavender-field disappointment shows, the drive for more matches, quicker, can leave others feeling used, misled, even doubting what’s real. And dating is perhaps just a test case; as AI seeps further into every corner of our lives, the temptation to neaten the messiness, to smooth the hesitations and flaws that make us human, will surely grow. What happens when no exchange is person-to-person any more? When we’re all talking into echo chambers, hearing our own words reflected back at us?Ultimately, there is no shortcut to connection. “Dating apps are kind of mislabelled,” says Brunson. “They should more appropriately be called ‘introduction apps’, because they’re really only designed to introduce you to potential matches. The rest needs to be done in person – that’s where you find if you have chemistry. And no algorithm can do that part for us.”Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsDatingArtificial intelligence (AI)AppsSexComputingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When to upgrade – and when to hold offDon’t splash out just yet! Your existing laptop may have plenty left to giveFrom smash-proof cases to updates: how to make your smartphone last longerDarien Graham-SmithSun 12 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 03.02 EDTShareSo you want a new laptop. Of course you do. Everybody always does, except for perhaps during that short honeymoon period after you’ve just bought one. But the glamour wears off, technology marches on, and before you know it, a newer, younger, more powerful model is wandering into your thoughts.I’m not here to judge, but as a technology specialist I can share a few thoughts that might help you fight the urge to upgrade.Let’s start with the basics: the No 1 reason not to buy a new laptop is that you don’t need one. We’ve grown accustomed to living in an age where technology gets faster every time you turn around, but the jobs we’re actually doing on our laptops are evolving at a much more timid pace. Many of us spend 99% of our computing time using just a handful of apps – a web browser, a conferencing app, a word processor, and possibly a spreadsheet or presentation app.If you’re looking for a new laptop because you’re having to do all of the above on a lousy screen, or with a clunky keyboard, then you might have a point – we’ll come to that later on. But if your head is being turned by faster processors and biggerSSDs, hold fire: do you really think you’ll get your reports written any faster because you’re typing them on a Core Ultra 5 processor rather than an old i3? Worry about your own productivity before scapegoating the poor computer.Outdated connectors aren’t an excuse either. Your laptop may not have the latest USB ports or wifi hardware, but the wonderful thing about modern standards is that they’re stupendously backward- and forward-compatible. You don’t need a new laptop to pair with your sparkly new wifi 7 router – the wifi 5 card in your current one will work just fine (although a Windows update will still take ages). And any USB peripheral can be plugged into any USB port, dating all the way back to 1996 – as long as you have the right cable or adaptor.Save money – and the environmentView image in fullscreenLaptops feature a lot of environmentally costly materials.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesLet’s also acknowledge that not buying a new laptop saves you money. A grand or more for a high-spec model is a lot to spend, but if you tell yourself it’s a long-term investment it somehow feels justifiable. But this doesn’t mean the money can’t be better spent elsewhere.If you’re looking at replacing your laptop because there’s something wrong with it, you might be able to save money by getting it repaired. Sadly it’s not always feasible, largely thanks to the trend towards factory-sealed devices and soldered-in components, but do look into it, as a busted laptop can sometimes be restored to a quasi-pristine state for a third of the price of buying a new one.Another reason you might hesitate to decommission your existing laptop is that it takes a lot of environmentally costly materials to build a new one, and there’s a further ecological cost in safely disposing of your old one.Finally, once you do plonk a shiny new laptop down on your desk, you will probably spend the following days and weeks hunting down all the different bits of software and drivers that you need to reinstall, and working through endless settings and preferences to get the thing working the way you like – which is to say, the way you already had your old one working.How to get the best out of yourexisting laptopView image in fullscreenHardware upgrades can give your laptop a new lease of life.Photograph: baona/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you do decide to give your laptop another chance, there are things you can do to make your working relationship more harmonious. If you’re irritated by endless pop-ups and performance jitters, it’s always a good idea to audit the items that open on startup and turn off any that don’t seem necessary. Windows works perfectly well without any third-party software firing up automatically at startup. All that extra stuff added in there by pushy apps and overzealous laptop manufacturers – that can all go, and your life will be better for it. Even if you’re on a Mac, it never hurts to check your login items and see what you can do without.The same goes for browser extensions, which tend to accrete to the point where every page you open is covered in smart content and analytical toolbars. As well as getting in your way, each one consumes resources and contributes to that sense of general malaise that afflicts laptops of a certain age. Ditch ’em. If you’re using Chrome, enter chrome://extensions into the address bar and smash Remove on anything that isn’t earning its keep; in Microsoft Edge, the address is – guess what? – edge://extensions. On Safari, open the Settings window, and select Extensions to view and manage your plug-ins.And while you’re having a clearout, I recommend spring cleaning your storage too. There are lots of neat free tools that will perform a wholesale audit of your hard disk and show you exactly what’s taking up the space. My personal favourites are WinDirStat on Windows and Disk Inventory X on the Mac; whichever you pick, I’ll bet you’ll be shocked by the amount of space you’re wasting on old downloads and unneeded apps. Purging them probably won’t make your computer run any faster, but if you were thinking of buying a new laptop just because this one was nearly full, that urge may now be quelled.Alternatively, you could give your laptop a new lease of life by treating it to a hardware upgrade or two. As with repairs, this isn’t always possible, but it’s worth exploring whether you can add extra memory, extend the storage or replace the battery. Expanding the RAM, in particular, can make a remarkable difference to the overall feel of a computer. The latest operating systems and applications tend to high-handedly assume that you have at least 8GB of RAM and prefer twice that much; disappoint them and they may embark upon a go-slow in protest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There’s no need to muck about with dozens of floppy disks as in days of yore: you can now download and reinstall the OS files over the internet, on Windows and macOS. This makes it a tantalisingly easy way to restore the spring to a computer’s step, but bear in mind that the process will put your computer back into the same naive, unpersonalised state as a new laptop. And be very certain you’ve backed up all your personal files before you head down this path – the reinstaller may offer to keep your documents and settings, but if anything does get lost, that’s squarely on the head of the genius who decided to reformat their own hard drive.While I’m on this tack, don’t underestimate the power of physical cleaning. Much of the thrill of opening up a brand-new laptop is to do with the perfectly unsmudged screen, and the spotless, grease-free keys that respond precisely to your touch without the slightest hint of biscuit crumb. I recommend you turn off your laptop, grab a non-abrasive cloth (ideally microfibre if you have one) and give it a proper wipe down, inside and out. Then, turn it upside down and attack the keyboard with a handheld vacuum, giving the keys a good scrub with the brush, to dislodge any dust or morsels from around the edges. When you turn the thing the right way up, it’ll be like someone’s handed you a new computer.Maybe you do need a new one after all: signs to upgrade your laptopView image in fullscreenSometimes buying a new laptop is unavoidable.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesAll the above notwithstanding, there are some situations where a new laptop is the right answer. As I’ve intimated, repairs and upgrades aren’t always possible, so if you’ve shattered the screen, the only solution might be to take a trip to the computer shop.A particularly irritating scenario is when the hardware is still working fine, but is too old to support the latest operating system and security patches. This tends to happen to Apple systems after about a decade, and it’s about to hit many millions of PCs on 14 October, whenMicrosoft cuts off support for Windows 10. Computers that meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11 can upgrade for free, but the rest will be stuck out in the cold.If your computer is among that unhappy cohort – and for whatever reason you’re not in a position to install a non-Windows OS – then a new laptop is a must. While it’s possible to keep running an unsupported operating system, I can’t in all conscience recommend you do that. Without regular security patches coming down from the mother ship, you’d be a sitting duck for future hacks and ransomware attacks.This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to bin your existing laptop. You can install a free Linux operating system on almost anything, and use that for everyday tasks such as surfing the web, editing documents and spreadsheets in LibreOffice, and even making video calls.Another option is Google’s ChromeOS Flex platform, a free version of the Chromebook operating system that you can install on a wide range of laptops. Whether you use it yourself or pass it off to a friend or family member, you’ll have done your bit to extend the life of that particular device, and to defer the environmental cost of decommissioning it.Finally, let’s not pretend that there isn’t a social aspect to all of this. The whole point of a portable computer is that you can take it out and about with you, where people can see it. Rocking up in your local coffee shop with a David Cameron-era laptop makes a certain statement, and not necessarily a bad one: it shows you’re a loyal, practical sort of person, unswayed by the temptations of consumerism.For more, read the Filter’s guide tohow to make your smartphone last longerDarien Graham-Smith has been a professional IT journalist for more than 20 years, covering brands from Amazon to Zyxel forvarious magazines, newspapers and websites.

Sketched out in never-before-reported documents,this plot aimed to destroy accountability journalism and make news outlets into champions rather than adversaries of power.If that seems like exaggeration, consider that almost exactly 50 years before Weiss’s appointment, CBS’s own president was boasting of his support for a conservative, antidemocratic political project and bragging about his efforts to shift his news division’s media coverage away from scrutinizing corporate power.It was a harbinger of what was to come.‘The national television networks should be monitored’This untold story of American media began in the news business’s Watergate-era transition. In the first half of the 20th century, journalism had swung between the triumphs of investigative reporting and the excesses of Citizen Kane-like oligarchs wielding their media properties as political weapons. But by the early 1970s, the pendulum was swinging back toward the muckrakers – journalism had once again become a problem for the ruling class, exposingnational securityandcorporate scandals– and giving aplatformto advocates like Ralph Nader who were holding power accountable.Irate about Nader and other troublemakers, a prominent tobacco industry attorney named Lewis Powell penned a1971 call to armsfor the nation’s largest lobbying group, the Chamber of Commerce, and its corporate members.Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News | Margaret SullivanRead moreHe noted that “most of the media, including the national TV systems, are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations which depend upon profits, and the enterprise system to survive” – and that therefore they should start deliberately amplifying defenders of the status quo, and stop providing platforms to critics of big business.“Much of the media – for varying motives and in varying degrees – either voluntarily accords unique publicity to these ‘attackers’, or at least allows them to exploit the media for their purposes,” Powell wrote. “The national television networks should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance. This applies not merely to so-called educational programs, but to the daily news analysis, which so often includes the most insidious type of criticism of the enterprise system. Whether this criticism results from hostility or economic ignorance, the result is the gradual erosion of confidence in business and free enterprise.”In this now-infamousPowell memo, he implored corporations to bring their grievances to the Federal Communications Commission, which could threaten to take action against media outlets refusing to toe the corporate line (soundfamiliar?). And he decried what he depicted as corporate critics’ dangerous infiltration of media conglomerates.“As these bright young men from campuses across the country seek opportunities to change a system which they have been taught to distrust – if not, indeed ‘despise’ – they seek employment in the centers of the real power and influence in our country, namely: with the news media, especially television,” he wrote.Just a few months after Powell penned his memo, then president Richard Nixon nominated him to the US supreme court, where he wouldengineerrulings equating money to constitutionally protected speech,extendthose constitutional protections to corporations aiming to buy elections, anddefang antitrust law.As the conservative movement built political power, Ronald Reagan soon killed the fairness doctrine – a move that birthed the rightwing talk radio monopolyAfter Powell was first confirmed by the Senate, CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite emceed his sendoff party. As Philip Morris executives gave Powell judicial robes emblazoned with tobacco logos, Cronkite narrated a faux radio drama valorizing Powell’s life – all of which was recorded on a vinyl record that we discovered.The event signaled how closely involved the media establishment would soon become in Powell’s conservative political project.‘Correct the situation at CBS News’Powell’s memo prompted the Chamber of Commerce to create a taskforce to implement its directives for corporations to begin spending heavily on politics, advertising and thinktanks, building what we now know as the modern conservative movement. Rather than deploying journalists to expose that new master plan, some of the nation’s largest media outlets and their sponsors joined it.According to adocumentobtained by the Lever, members of this taskforce included CBS vice-president Richard Jencks, ABC executive James Hagerty, newspaper magnate Edward Scripps II, Metromedia executive Mark Evans, Ad Council chair Barton Cummings and Hill & Knowlton president James Cassidy.In correspondence with a local media president enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo, CBS’s then president, Arthur Taylor,wrotethat he was actively pressuring CBS News journalists to make their coverage more pro-business.“[The memo] makes good reading, and it is in accord with my own thinking that our free enterprise system is indeed in danger, not only due to the misunderstanding in academic circles, but I might also add the misunderstanding in media circles,” Taylor wrote of the Powell memo. “I’ve been attempting as persuasively as possible for the last year to correct the situation at CBS News with some results, but I’m afraid it’s going to take a long time.”Taylor then added: “I hope we can have an opportunity to discuss methods by which we might accelerate what is obviously a very important movement.”Forwarding Taylor’s letter to a conservative activist, the local media executive wrote that “Taylor has achieved some results and, hopefully, we can help him and others in his position, accomplish more”.Around this time, in 1973, the future Fox News impresario Roger Ailes delivered a presentation to a meeting of business leaders enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo. Acollege presidentin attendance wrote that “Ailes outlined the power which advertisers would be able to exert upon TV programming if they were moved to do so” in support of their political goals – and he said that members of the Chamber of Commerce should hire Ailes and focus on “where and how they can apply leverage and be given the tools to exert the leverage”.The following year, Ailes landed a job running TVN, a Fox News forerunner controlled by Joseph Coors, the conservative beer magnate who said he had been “stirred” into political philanthropy by the Powell memo. Like Weisstoday, Ailes had no experience running a television newsroom – which apparently made him an attractive candidate to lead a political project masquerading as journalism.“The Coors people trust Ailes because of his affiliation with Republicans – and because he’s not a newsman,” one TVN staffersaidat the time. “They don’t trust newsmen.”‘Media monopoly and autocracy do go hand in hand’In 1974, the Chamber of Commerce convened a secret meeting to review all the ways the Powell memo acolytes were leveraging media to build the conservative movement. According to themeeting minutesobtained by the Lever, the chamber’s members were:Creating a “new motion picture [that] is being seen by tens of thousands” – which led to a filmstarringJimmy Stewart promoting free-market capitalism;Producing “a series of television shows to present business views on vital issues” that would be “for use on the Public Broadcasting network and elsewhere”;Publishing “a FAIR media handbook – particularly to help those in business communicate with press, radio, and television. It describes how business can generate fair, accurate, and informed reporting”;Promoting “a weekly column – discussing timely topics [that] goes to more than 500 press and 300 radio and television outlets”;Writing “monthly editorials – for print and electronic media – used by 70 television, 225 radio stations, plus 300 newspapers”;Distributing “radio voice actualities and television news clips – for major networks and news services”.Meanwhile, the Powell memo taskforce member Barton Cummings used his Ad Council position to launch anationwidegovernment-sponsoredadvertisingcampaigninpartnershipwiththen president Gerald Ford’s administrationand major corporations to defend free-market capitalism against its critics.All of these efforts were the seeds of what was to come. As the conservative movement built its political power, its champion, Ronald Reagan, soon killed the fairness doctrine that had required time for contrasting political content – a move thatbirthedthe rightwing talk radio monopoly.When the Democrats regained power, Bill Clinton joined in by signinglegislationderegulating the media industry so that a handful of megacorporations (and now tech companies) could buy up and control most of what we read, see and hear from news media.George W Bush’s administration then furtherloosenedlocal media ownership rules, allowing for even more consolidation.Critics were once ridiculed for suggesting that billionaire owners politically influence their media properties – but today that influence is on display for all to seeAt key moments along the way, media conglomeratesbacked downamid corporate pressure,avoided storiesthat Wall Street wanted hidden andparrotedgovernment lies. And with media industry consolidation and mass layoffs of local journalists, oligarchs and government leaders could more easily narrow the political discourse, knowing that dissenting viewpoints would be shadowbanned or simplyshut out– and have nowhere to make inconvenient reporting heard.Of course, every now and then, the sound of protest managed to slip through the matrix. For example, just after Clinton signed the bill accelerating media mergers, Saturday Night Live writers managed to slip this Schoolhouse Rockspoofabout media consolidation on to the national television airwaves. It was promptly erased from all future reruns.In the Trump era, there is no longer any attempt to obscure what’s really going on. Nine years ago, as Trump was starting his authoritarian ascent andbashingjournalists, CBS’s CEO didn’t sound an alarm – he instead seemed thrilled, declaring that the circus-like environment “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS”. Critics such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were oncemercilesslyridiculedfor suggesting that billionaire owners politically influence their media properties – but today that influence is on display for all to see. Few even bother to pretend that all the media industry mergers,defunding,purgesand surrenders have nothing to do with oligarchs’ self-serving ideological project.Quite the opposite – if you read between the lines, it’s almost as if they are bragging about their role in the movement Powell ignited. Indeed, Weiss’s own Substack – which was reportedlysold to CBS’s parent companyfor $150m – just published anessayfrom a formerNews Corporation executiveande-cigarette company executiveeffusively valorizing Powell. In thatFree Press hagiography, Powell is presented not as a zealot who published an ideological manifesto and sculptedradical precedentslegalizing corruption. Instead, he is depicted as “thoughtful, measured, and willing to listen to others” as well as “less partisan and more cautious” than other jurists.That kind of historical revision may land Powell his own bust in Trump’sproposedNational Garden of American Heroes – but it will not succeed in obscuring what Powell actually helped create. Everyone can see the transformation of media that he envisioned. It’s right there in our faces – which means we can start calling all of this what it has always been: not merely a crass short-term business play, but a decades-long effort to destroy whatever’s left of the fourth estate that is supposed to deter authoritarianism.“If we don’t break up the anti-free speech media monopolies, we will lose our democracy,” Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticutwroterecently. “I wish the billionaires that own these companies cared about democracy more than getting rich. But they don’t. They are willing to help destroy free speech so they can buy a bigger private jet. Media monopoly and autocracy do go hand in hand. And so we need a remedy.”The Lever’s David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher are the authors of the new bookMaster Plan: The Hidden Plot to Legalize Corruption in AmericaExplore more on these topicsUS television industryOpinionUS press and publishingUS televisionThe super-richNewspapersTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s endangering democracyRyan W PowersThe establishment left’s attachment to rigid rules leaves the party out of touch and failing to meet the momentSun 12 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn early August, dozens of Democratic lawmakersfledTexas for Illinois, denying Republicans the quorum needed to pass new congressional maps projected to give the party as many as five additional seats. Their absence paralyzed the state legislature, turning a walkout into political resistance anddrawing national attention.As the standoff dragged on, Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, offered an unorthodox countermove:a proposalto suspend his state’s independent redistricting commission and draw maps designed to hand Democrats a comparable advantage. He unveiled the plan with spectacle, mimicking Donald Trump’s signature style throughall-caps declarations, amocking nicknamefor White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt (“KaroLYIN”) andAI-generated celebrity endorsements.While Texas Democratsultimately returnedand the Republican redistricting planhas advanced, Newsom has been cast as theemerging leader of Democratic oppositionto Trump. Why did it take the party nine months to find one?It wasn’t for lack of need. Just last summer, Trumpoustedindependent agency heads who contradicted his narrative,deployedthe national guard to Washington DC against the mayor’s wishes andgrantedthe attorney general license to enlist the justice department in partisan battles. Each step pushed democratic norms closer to the breaking point.The real answer is that the most powerful liberal institutions – the Democratic establishment, major donors and the professional class around them –are captive tooutdated etiquette. They prize agreeability as an end in itself: disruptionis discouraged, compromiseexalted, restraint worn as abadge of honor. And because these institutionsshape liberal culturefrom the top down, their attachment to niceties dulls urgency and narrows the space for bold, breakout leadership.What makes Newsom unique is his willingness to defy convention when circumstances demand it. The lesson is not in his theatrics, but in the reminder that strategically breaking norms can sometimes accomplish more than following them.California’s independent redistricting commission is written into the state constitution, which means Newsom’s proposalcannot advancewithout voter approval in November. Even if successful, redistricting alone is only a stopgap. The deeper fight is cultural: whether the Democratic establishment can break its attachment to rigid politeness before democracy withers.The stakes are not theoretical. The Trump administration hasunderminedjudicial independence,hollowed outfederal agencies andrun straight throughone of elite liberalism’s most entrenched institutions: big law.For decades, elite law firms have been essential to Democrats, supplying both thefundingandtalentthat sustains the party’s infrastructure. Yet when faced withpunitive executive orders, some of these very institutions –once defendersof liberal democracy – folded,signing settlement dealsthat critics have labeledunconstitutional and undemocratic.Until recently, I was an associate at a big law firm. After publishingan op-edabout the constitutional dangers of a Trump-Palantir partnership - implicating my firm’s client Trump Media, and a former client, Palantir – I was warned that continuing to speak out could cost me my job. What came next was more interesting: a test of how far one act of dissent could ripple through a system built to contain it.Instead of leaving quietly, I challenged big law publicly. I announced my firingon Instagramwith a caption that began“Candidly, I’m disgusted”and concluded with a stern rebuke of big law’s surrender to Trump “in shadowy back rooms, on billion-dollar yachts”. The post was raw, even theatrical, but its real purpose was to spotlight a more substantiveop-edI had written on the corporate legal sector’s complicity in democratic backsliding.Within hours, the post went viral. Political commentators with a combined audience of more than 10 million amplified it on social media, andleadinglegalpublicationspicked up the story. The op-ed drew more than 50,000 readers, including Fortune 500 CEOs, non-profit leaders and the dean of Harvard Law School. Even the prominent legal scholar Laurence Tribeshared the piece.Trump’s return to the White House made clear that authoritarianism does not yield to decorumWhat began as a messy act of dissent had become legitimized critique. Some elites may have clutched their pearls at the breach of decorum, but the spectacle renewed debate over big law’s role in creeping authoritarianism.In elite liberal spaces, the expectation isalways the same: stay quiet, exit gracefully, never make a scene. Yet nonviolent unruliness has power precisely because it breaks the code of composure. Psychologists call this the “expectancy violations theory”: when behavior defies what’s anticipated, it commands outsized attention and carries significant weight.That impact is magnifiedwhen it comes from insiders with status or access.This dynamic suggests that liberalism’s best strategy is to subvert its own norms. Critics may argue that spectacle undermines substance, or that breaking etiquette diminishes the credentials that lend Democrats authority. But intoday’s attention economy, spectacle is oftenhow substance gets noticed. Breaking strict decorum is not the enemy of liberalism; it may be the very tool that keeps it alive.Elections bear this out. In Wisconsin’s supreme court race this year, the candidate Susan Crawford broke from traditional judicial etiquette. She waged a decisively bold campaign,labellingher opponent Brad Schimel “a rightwing extremist” andmocking himas “Elon Schimel” in light ofhis endorsementby the controversial tech billionaire. Behavior that might once have seemed undignified insteadhelped driverecord turnout and carried her to adecisive victory.By contrast, in Ohio’s 2022 Senate race, the US representative Tim Ryanbuilt a campaignon moderation and convention, presenting himself as asteady unifier. That strategyfailed to resonatewith the electorate, overshadowed by thedeliberately unorthodox and provocativecampaign of his opponent, JD Vance, now the vice-president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Their resistance, defined by hollow gestures likewaving“No King!” and “Save Medicaid” signs on the House floor, only underscores how mismatched the party is to the moment. The reason is clear: politics has evolved, but the Democratic establishmentstill clingsto the Obama-era script of unwavering politeness and reserve that now defines a bygone age.That era ended with the mainstream embrace of rightwing populism. In the late 2000s, the Tea Party clawed its way into the national spotlight byangrily hecklingDemocratic lawmakers,paradingAR-15s outside political events andstagingunruly rallies on the National Mall. The movement dominated headlines,heavily influencingthe Republican party’s agenda and showing that unruliness itself could confer political legitimacy. By the 2010 midterms, Republicans had turned that ethos into an electoral strategy andmanaged to flip63 House seats, the party’s largest gain since 1948.If the Tea Party proved that disrupting norms could win elections, Trump showed that it could seize an entire party. Once afamiliar faceon red carpets and network television, he built a political base by rejecting etiquette: apparentlymockinga reporter’s disability live on stage,attackinga federal judge’s ethnic background andurgingsupporters to use physical force against protesters at his rallies. Acts that might once have disqualified a candidate instead became evidence that longstanding norms were now optional.Even so, Democrats should not use rightwing populism as a blueprint. That approach is rooted in demolition: attacking institutionsindiscriminately, sometimes throughbrute force. What’s needed instead is an approach rooted in defense: reinforcing institutions carefully and rejecting violence wholesale. When Nicole Collier, a Texas state representative,camped outin the House chamber, she was not attempting to upend the legislature. She was pushing back against aRepublican power playthat threatened its integrity.Skeptics may argue that this style of politics risks alienating moderates or deepening division. But unruliness is not an end in itself: it is a temporary shock meant to restore democratic vitality. Here, abandoning etiquette is less about breaking order than resetting it. As the economist Karl Polanyiobserved, such interruptions act like an immune response, jolting institutions back to health so decorum can return.Of course, bold disruption carries risk. Breaking composure can cost reputations, careers, even relationships. From Harry Belafonte, ostracized by Hollywood and mainstream media fordefiantcivil rights activism, to Larry Kramer, rejected by his peers foruncompromisingAids advocacy, history shows that those who put action above etiquette often paid dearly. But sacrifice itself – the willingness to acceptance consequences – is what transforms dissent into political pressure.The task now is to channel deliberate, nonviolent unruliness into strategy. Trump’s return to the White House made clear that authoritarianism does not yield to decorum. Voters recognize this: a recent survey found thatnearly three-quartersof Democrats believe their leaders aren’t fighting hard enough. Newsom has now stepped forward, with Kathy Hochul, the New York governor, and Obama himself – the onetime apostle of gentility –lending their support. Breaking ranks will not always succeed, but caution all but ensures defeat. The choice is plain: abandon outdated norms, or watch democracy slip away.What’s giving me hope nowWhat gives me hope are the people living out Jane Goodall’s final lesson: that hope is a discipline we practice together, not a feeling we hold alone. The ones who show up at town halls, register young people to vote and lean into the small, human bonds that keep hope alive.

And there are worrying signs the test may come.”As the new row withChinashows, Trump is continuing to wield tariffs as a weapon, creating fresh shocks in financial markets. The impact has been especially tough in developing countries, some of which, as Unctad pointed out, have faced some of the highest tariffs.Away from trade policy, the White House continues to pursue unfunded tax cuts and trash the economic institutions usually considered the cornerstones of credibility – including the Federal Reserve.Over time, that must surely undermine market confidence, including in US Treasuries (government bonds) – an important benchmark against which assets in global markets are valued. There is little sign of that yet; but once lost, economic credibility is hard to rebuild.Part of the reason markets have not responded more skittishly to this and other concerns is that the economic picture is being flattered by another extraordinary and unpredictable phenomenon: the AI boom.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A wall of funding continues to pour into the tech industry as investors bet on the future of generative AIand battle to build the massive datacentres required to train and run the models.Data from the World Trade Organization last week showed that a full 20% of the growth in global goods trade in the first half of the year was accounted for by “AI-related goods – including semiconductors, servers, and telecommunications equipment”, much of it flowing from Asia to the US.As Ben May of Oxford Economics said recently: “The surge in US capital spending to develop AI capability has been masking weakness in other parts of the domestic economy.”However, a growing number of observers have begun to fret that generative AI may not deliver the extraordinary gains that would justify Wall Street valuations of the tech companies.Andthe increasingly complex web of cross-shareholdings between some of the key firms involved has raised eyebrows.The Bank of England last week became the latest body towarn about the risk of a “sudden correction”in global markets if the AI boom goes into reverse.“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on artificial intelligence. This … leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,” it said.Georgieva echoed that caution, comparing the AI boom to the dotcom bubble around the turn of the millennium. “Today’s valuations are heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago,” she warned, raising the spectre of a “sharp correction”.The dollar and dollar-denominated assets remain the lifeblood of much of global finance, despite efforts since the financial crisis to build up the importance of other currencies – so an AI crash would reverberate worldwide.Perhaps it is fitting that Trump has unleashed a new round of destabilising threats just as policymakers fly into town to take the temperature of the world economy.

She wasn’t expecting a call, but we both knew who she was referring to: her father.Growing up, Bianca could never predict what mood he’d be in. Jovial one day, explosive the next. “Sometimes I’d just hear the tone of his voice and my body would start buzzing,” she told me. “Like something bad was about to happen.” Even now, as a 35-year-old woman with a successful career and close friendships, a slew of missed calls from him could unravel her for hours, as his mood escalated.I see this dynamic often; adults wrestling with anxiety, perfectionism, chronic guilt or emotional suppression, shaped by the unpredictable storms of emotionally immature parents. Bianca, like many adults I see in therapy, had spent most of her life trying to decode and contain the emotional chaos of a parent who could barely manage his own inner world. Her father was unpredictable and reactive. Then he would suddenly demand closeness, support or attention. The whiplash was constant.Racist voices are becoming louder and moving into the mainstream. How can I help my client feel safe? | Ahona GuhaRead morePsychologically, emotional maturity refers to the ability to regulate and express your feelings in a way that matches the moment. Emotionally mature adults can apologise, reflect and hold space for others. They don’t make everything about them. Emotional immaturity, by contrast, is a persistent pattern of self-absorption, emotional reactivity and lack of insight. In a parent, this can lead to emotional neglect, boundary violations and unpredictable reactions.Growing up with emotionally immature parents is disorienting. You learn early to read the room before you read yourself. The nervous system becomes fine-tuned to danger. It waits for the next outburst, the next icy silence, the next unexpected storm. It can make you question your reality. Your needs may have been minimised, mocked or outright ignored. You may have learned to repress emotions, to anticipate another’s mood before checking in with your own or to twist yourself into shapes that felt safer, but never truly authentic.For Bianca, that danger most often came in the form of her father’s volatility. “If I didn’t pick up the phone when he called,” she told me, “he’d leave these horrible voicemails; screaming, swearing, accusing me of abandoning him. It didn’t matter if I was working, sleeping or just … not up for a conversation.” This wasn’t a rare occurrence. In fact, she admitted she had started leaving her phone on silent more often and blocked his number intermittently when she felt overwhelmed with his reactivity.She had explained this to him calmly, more times than she could count. They had also had arguments about this topic over the years where she would try to explain to him the impact this had on her. But nothing ever changed.Emotional immaturity, particularly when shaped by trauma, neglect or generational dysfunction, is complexThis pattern wasn’t just hard on Bianca as a child. It followed her into friendships, romantic relationships and how she felt about herself.In clinical terms, emotional immaturity is a persistent pattern of lacking awareness and insight about one’s emotions and how they impact others. Emotionally immature parents may be highly reactive, defensive, self-absorbed or emotionally unavailable. In practice, this can look like unpredictable outbursts over small issues; punishing a child for showing emotions; expecting children to provide emotional support; dismissive or aloof reactions to their child’s distress and a fundamental inability to empathise.Bianca’s father was a textbook case. His high emotional reactivity meant small incidents like missing a call could spiral into days of stonewalling or angry rants. She recounted times he would angrily demand she make time for him and then cancel on the day they were to see one another. Her life and schedule were treated like inconveniences, minor unimportant details. When she dared express frustration, she would be met with accusations and rage.One of the cruellest legacies of emotional immaturity in a parent is the way it echoes into adulthood, leaving children with warped templates for relationships. Many become people-pleasers, overly attuned to others but disconnected from themselves. Others swing the opposite way by becoming closed off, wary, suspicious of connection.Breaking free from resentment: the hidden cost of revenge and the healing power of forgiveness | Gill Straker and Jacqui WinshipRead moreIn Bianca’s case, the chaos with her father left her hypervigilant. In her romantic relationships, she struggled to trust. In therapy, we began with acknowledging this was not her fault, and that there were deficits in her father’s emotional capacity, deficits she didn’t cause and could never fix. Emotional immaturity, particularly when shaped by trauma, neglect or generational dysfunction, is complex.From there, we worked to rebuild Bianca’s sense of agency. Key strategies included learning that it’s not her job to manage her father’s feelings or rescue him from discomfort, recognising that walking away from an unhealthy interaction is protection, and calmly and consistently expressing her boundaries.These were not easy shifts. They required courage, patience and feeling grief when accepting that a parent may never become who you needed them to be.Healing from emotionally immature parenting doesn’t always involve reconciliation, and all too often estranging oneself from a family member may appear to be reactionary. For many people, it is necessary.Bianca no longer flinches when her phone notifies her of voicemails. She is still working on her aversion to phone calls.*name and some other features have been changed to protect client privacy and identityCarly Dober is a psychologist living and working in Naarm/MelbourneExplore more on these topicsMental healthThe modern mindFamilyParents and parentingHealth & wellbeingPsychologycommentShareReuse this content"

What’s most revealing is that few seem to careJohn HarrisThese vital spaces have been the first targets of cuts in a nation that favours age over youth – despite being the remedy for blights such as social division, polarisation and lonelinessSun 12 Oct 2025 09.12 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareAconsensus seems to have recently settled in UK politics: that young British lives are not as they should be, and something must be done. Our teens and twentysomethings, we are told, arelonely, phone-addicted, “overdiagnosed”, and too oftenjobless, which entails a great blizzard of proposals – from welfare reform to thescaling-back of universityeducation – that seem to have more to do with older voters’ prejudices than the real-life problems of other generations. At the next election, the extension of the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds may do something to correct that, but I wouldn’t count on it. There is, after all, something deep within the British psyche that favours age over youth, and consequently misrepresents and ignores the latter in a way that sometimes looks almost pathological.If you want a vivid example, consider a drastic loss from millions of young lives that is still bafflingly overlooked. During the first 10 years of the spending cuts that began in 2010, councils’ funding for youth services in England and Wales suffered areal-terms cutof 70%. By 2023, about 1,200 publicly run youth centres hadclosed, and more than 4,500 youth workers hadlost their jobs. Villages, towns and cities still bear the scars: empty buildings that look just as forlorn as any shuttered library or Sure Start centre. But while other aspects of the austerity disaster have at least been acknowledged, this one still seems to be a strange kind of guilty secret, with seemingly no chance of all that lost provision ever being restored.For anyone who wants to understand how tragic that is, there is now aset text: a recently published book titled Up the Youth Club, by the journalist and writer Emma Warren, is both a superb work of social history, and a passionate call for a newly energised, modern version of everything she writes about. Her story goes back 150 years, and is split between the state and voluntary sectors. What ties everything together is the provision of what she describes as “warm and welcoming” spaces, where “those who are in their second decade of life can gather regularly … to do things they like doing … where restorative ‘hanging out’ is welcome”. There is fascinating material about trailblazing meeting places for LGBTQ+ people, the centrality of youth clubs to the music scenes of cities such as Bristol and Coventry, and their role as connection points in postwar new towns. And one theme recurs time and again: the plain fact that youth services ought to be thought of as one of the public realm’s most basic elements.As 21st-century Conservatives renew their faith in blindly shrinking the state, the book also contains a timely example of why they ought instead to reflect on how their party came to loseany semblance of a social conscience. In 1958, the Tory government led by Harold Macmillan commissioned a watershedreport about youth services, put together by an aristocratic social reformer called Lady Diana Albemarle. From the vantage point of 2025, much of what it portrayed is grimly familiar: she found youth services “in a state of acute depression”, with the people who provided them “neglected and held in small regard, both in educational circles and by public opinion generally”. Youth provision, it said, was “dying on its feet”. But as Warren describes, Conservative politicians then made huge changes: 3,000 new buildings, 160 new sports projects, and newly expanded and professionalised youth services.Years later, many of us enjoyed the remaining legacy of all that: dependable places, open most nights of the week, where we could find out who we were. We learned how to relate to adults who were not our parents and teachers and therefore tended to treat us as their equals, and let us organise our own time. For me and my friends, that meant precious rehearsal time for us and our fellow teenage musicians, and the chance to play in front of our peers. But for others, youth clubs represented something much more important: what we now call safe spaces, where they could be gently pointed towards the kind of help that was often urgently needed.Though the decline of youth clubs began in the Thatcher years, this is what austerity so cruelly snatched away, and we are now living with the consequences. Back in 2014, Ireported oncrushing local austerity in Newcastle, and drastic cuts to its youth centres. One youth worker based in the middle of the city told me about what that meant for drug and alcohol advice and programmes focused on teenage pregnancy. He also mentioned Alexis Jay’sreport on child sexualexploitation in Rotherham, and one of its most pointed sentences: “We met several experienced and skilled youth workers who voiced serious concerns about the severity of the cutbacks in the youth services and specifically how it was impacting on their work with vulnerable young people.”There is, moreover, striking evidence that cuts to youth clubslead toincreased teenage crime and measurably poorer educational outcomes. But spending cuts have one particularly pernicious effect: the way that they sooner or later start to twist many people’s thinking, so that yesterday’s crucial service is suddenly reframed as today’s faded throwback. In that sense, it may be easy to think of youth clubs as old-fashioned spaces, synonymous with trite jokes about table tennis and flat Coke. But that, once again, is an old person’s perspective, and they actually remain vital places, as no end of research proves.In 2009, just before austerity began to blitz London’s youth services, the Greater London authority’s Young Londoners’ Survey found that 41% of respondents aged between 11 and 16 attended youth clubs at least once a week. Last year, anotherpiece of research– commissioned by the London-based organisation Legacy Youth Zone – focused on what it called “isolation through screens”, and a corresponding “need for connection”. More than half of the young people involved said they would like to reduce screen time, but 46% felt “unable” to. And then came the kicker: “93% of young people who have attended a youth centre say it has made a positive difference to their lives.”Even if some of our politicians grasp this point, they have yet to convincingly respond to it. Labour has made a fewannouncements about boosted spending, but the funds are unlikely to stretch as far as youth services. And thesums involvedremain comparatively small. Austerityhacked almost£1bn a year from youth services, and deep problems will remain, even though they answer so many 21st-century questions – about social division, polarised attitudes, and much more besides.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But sharing their tantrums and pain on social media is not a ‘teachable moment’. It’s cruelSun 12 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThere’s a song that’s been in my head all week, and no, it’s not from Taylor Swift’s new album. It’s by a far more sophisticated songwriter than Swift:Ms Rachel. The song is called Big Feelings and it goes: “Big feelings are OK / I’m here to stay with your big feelings.”Thanks to the trend for gentle parenting, the concept of “big feelings” has become big money online, and for the most part I welcome that (Big Feelings isn’t the only song that reflects this cultural shift; the animation Small Potatoes on CBeebies has a song that goes “Feelings / I’ve got so many feelings”, which my husband likes to sing to me when I’m premenstrual). As a parent, strong emotions are hard to escape: you’re feeling them, the small child in your home is feeling them and, in one of the biggest departures for us as a species, so are myriad other children on your social media feed.Indeed, footage of babies and children crying is so commonplace on some platforms that many parents don’t even question it. I don’t have TikTok and my Instagram algorithm is mostly fixated on soup and witchcraft, but when a colleague told me that she found the trend disturbing, not to mention morally dubious, I watched some of the videos myself.What I found was video after video of children at their most vulnerable. Crying, shouting, screaming, and sometimes lashing out physically. I have of course been witness to these moments in my own house, but seeing someone else’s child going through it feels excruciatingly uncomfortable, especially when that child is not being comforted by their own parent. Least forgivable is a genre of video in which mothers subject their children to sinus clearing while their baby or toddler cries and screams directly to camera. It should be said that most of the videos are not like that, and yet there is still something horrible about them all.Of course, “big feelings” aren’t always wholly traumatic. When your child is lying on the pavement distraught at the realisation that cake isn’t infinite it can be hard to keep a straight face. Many of us have been regaled with tales of particularly iconic tantrums of our own. Mine involved screaming “GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY!” in the lobby of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in central London. Playfully teasing your child about a time they had a meltdown, or laughing about it with your partner once they have gone to bed, is one thing. Filming a child in a moment of vulnerability and uploading it to the internet for all to see without their consent is a different matter altogether.Then you have the trends that are simply unpleasant, such as one that involved shocking babies out of crying bythrowing a slice of cheeseat their foreheads, orcracking an eggon them. Such content seems geared towards humiliating children. In a piece for the New York Times,Amanda Hess wrote: “The eeriest part of these videos [is that] the parents are barely interacting with their kids. Instead they are relating to a mirror image of their children that they are spreading online. And they are revelling in their power over that image.”There are video creators who would abhor this sort of content. They claim that they are filming their children at their most vulnerable not to mock them, but because they are trying to create teachable moments – “just look at how calmly and wonderfully I was able to defuse this child’s outburst using these techniques”. Some even try to stave off inevitable criticism. “This video is shared to educate and raise awareness – not for approval or opinions”, one video,posted by @babybearhealth(run by a paediatrician, apparently) reads. The message that follows is some of the most self-congratulatory horseshit I have read on the internet. “If you don’t live the life, don’t judge the moment.”How about you don’t post the moment? I find myself thinking. Because I do judge these people. What I see, when I watch a video of a small child in distress, whether their parent is performing comfort or not, is a dereliction of duty – the duty to be present for your child. And I wonder what message it sends, if when your child starts expressing a “big feeling”, you get your phone out. What does that say to your baby about their wholly natural emotions? “Sharing real moments is part of the learning”, apparently.As my husband and I begin touring schools for our son, it’s difficult not to reflect on how approaches to child development have changed since we were small. There is an increased understanding of the fact that “big feelings” are par for the course for small children. These days many adults try to validate those emotions and offer children a safe space in which to express themselves. Yet despite what the gentle parenting influencers claim, I don’t believe you can truly provide a safe space for your child if you are filming their moments of vulnerability and invading their privacy and dignity in the process. If I’m honest, I don’t think these people have much to teach any of us about parenting.There are some who will find that extreme, who would balk at the fact that in some ways I’d rather put a cheese slice on my boy’s forehead for a laugh than exploit his distress as a teachable moment for clicks. But to them I would say this: if, as the parental truism goes, “all behaviour is communication”, what, exactly, are these adults trying to say?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Usually if they want to win an Oscar, however, they have to reach for more serious roles. The late Diane Keaton, whodied unexpectedly this week, followed a reverse trajectory and made it look disarmingly natural. Her first major film role was in The Godfather, about as serious an American masterpiece as has ever been made. But that same year, she reprised the part of Linda, the object of a nerdy hero’s affection, in a film adaptation of Broadway’s Play It Again, Sam. (Keaton originated the role opposite playwright Woody Allen on the stage.) She continued to alternate serious dramas with romantic comedies throughout the ’70s, and it was the latter that won her an Oscar for best actress, changing the genre permanently.Diane Keaton, Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and The Godfather, dies aged 79Read moreThat Oscar was for Annie Hall, co-written and directed by Allen, with Keaton as the title character, one half of the movie’s fractured love story. Allen and Keaton had been in a romantic relationship before making the film, and remained close friends for the rest of her life; in interviews, Keaton had characterized Annie as an idealized version of herself, through Allen’s eyes. It would be easy, then, to assume Keaton’s performance involves doing what came naturally to her. But there’s too much range in Keaton’s work, both between her Godfather performance and her Allen comedies and within Annie Hall itself, to dismiss her facility with romantic comedy as simply turning on the charm – though she was, of course, tremendously charming.Annie Hall famously served as Allen’s transition between more gag-based broad comedies and a more naturalistic style. As such, it has plenty of gags, fantasy sequences, and a freewheeling patchwork of a relationship memoir in between some stinging insights into a doomed romantic relationship. (The script even included a murder mystery, presumably repurposed to some degree in Allen and Keaton’s 1993 reunion, Manhattan Murder Mystery.) Keaton, similarly, presides over a transition in American rom-coms, playing neither the screwball-era speed-talker or the bombshell ditz popularized in the 1950s. Instead, she mixes and matches aspects of both to create something entirely new that still reads as oddly contemporary today, interrupting her own boldness with her own false-start hesitations.View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton in Annie Hall.Photograph: United Artists/AllstarWatch, for example, the scene where Annie and Alvy Singer (Allen) first connect after a tennis game, fumbling over ping-ponging invitations for a ride (despite the fact that only one of them has a car). The banter is fast, but zig-zags around unpredictably, with Keaton soloing around her own discomfort before winding up in a cul-de-sac of “la di da”, a phrase that encapsulates her nervous whimsy. The movie physicalizes that sensibility in the next scene, as she makes blasé small talk while driving recklessly through Manhattan streets. Later, she centers herself singing It Had to Be You in a nightclub.These aren’t examples of Annie acting erratic. Throughout the movie, there’s a dimensionality to her light zaniness – her hippie-hangover willingness to try drugs, her panic over lobsters and spiders, her refusal to be manipulated by Alvy’s attempts to shape her into someone more superficially serious (which for him means death-obsessed). At first, Annie might seem like an odd character to win an Oscar; she’s the romantic lead in a movie seen from a man’s point of view, and the central couple’s arc doesn’t bend toward either changing enough accommodate the other. Yet Annie does change, in ways both observable and unknowable. She just doesn’t become a more suitable partner for Alvy. Plenty of later rom-coms stole the superficial stuff – neurotic hang-ups, quirky fashions – without quite emulating Annie’s ultimate independence.Diane Keaton: a life in picturesRead moreMaybe Keaton was wary of that tendency. After her working relationship with Allen ended, she took a break from rom-coms; Baby Boom is really her only one from the entirety of the 1980s. But during her absence, Annie Hall, the character perhaps moreso than the loosely structured movie, became a model for the genre. Meg Ryan, for example, owes most of her rom-com career to Keaton’s ability to play smart and flibbertigibbet simultaneously. This made Keaton seem like a permanent rom-com queen even as she was actually playing more wives (whether happily, as in Father of the Bride, or less so, as in The First Wives Club) and/or moms (see The Family Stone or Because I Said So) than single gals falling in love. Even in her reunion with Allen, they’re a long-married couple brought closer together by comic amateur sleuthing – and she slips into that role easily, beautifully.View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton and Jack Nicholson in Something’s Gotta Give.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarBut Keaton did have another major rom-com hit in 2003 with Something’s Gotta Give, as a playwright in love with a younger-dating cad (Jack Nicholson, naturally). The result? Her final Oscar nomination, and a whole subgenre of romances where older women (usually played by movie stars, but still!) reassert their romantic and/or social agency. Part of the reason her death seems like such a shock is that Keaton was still making those movies as recently as last year, a constant multiplex presence. Now audiences will be pivoting from taking that presence for granted to realizing what an enormous influence she was on the romantic comedy as we know it. If it’s harder to think of present-day versions of Meg Ryan or Goldie Hawn who similarly follow in Keaton’s footsteps, that’s probably because it’s rare for a performer of Keaton’s skill to dedicate herself to a genre that’s mostly been streaming fodder for a while now.Consider: there are 10 living female actors who received at least four best actress nominations, including Nicole Kidman, Jane Fonda and Ellen Burstyn. It’s rare for one of those roles to originate in a romantic comedy, let alone half of them, as was the case for Keaton. Because her persona became so familiar, it may have been easy to overlook just how much nuance and care Keaton brought to a genre better known for its star turns. She had the requisite star quality too, and depended on it plenty in movies like the Book Club series (where she lives the obvious dream of the Adam Sandler crew and literally plays a character called Diane). But she also played characters like Annie Hall, Erica in Something’s Gotta Give, and the more aloof Mary in Manhattan with a passion, at once comic and touching, missing from more plastic imitations of Annie or Nancy (Meyers, who only directed Keaton once, but through her writing became as associated with her later period as Allen was with her earlier stuff). Maybe she was able to carry that disappointment and disillusionment from the Godfather movies with her, subtly grounding her later roles. Or maybe comedy really is more complicated to play than drama. Regardless, it’s no wonder she was so associated with romance, despite a greater range. Keaton’s characters may have been deceptively difficult to pin down, but like her, they were easy to love.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonRomance filmsComedy filmsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s rich, plot-packed, and perfectly seasoned with humourLucy ManganSun 12 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareSally Wainwright should be prescribed on the NHS as a form of HRT. Alongside oestrogen and progesterone tablets, patches, gels and sprays to counter the myriad ills female flesh is heir to, doctors could prescribe a weekly dose ofScott & Baileyfor those who are just beginning to feel that Summat’s Up, moving on toLast Tango in Halifaxfor the lightly but definitely perimenopausal, followed by a daily hour ofGentleman Jackto alleviate more intense symptoms and culminating in a nightly binge ofHappy Valleyonce you’re fully entangled in menopause’s proliferating tentacles and need to bring out the big guns before they drag you under for good.Now we have an addition to the arsenal: her new drama Riot Women, about a quintet of menopausees facing the question of when all this shite is going to stop and how they are going to manage until it does.First, we meet Beth (Joanna Scanlan), who has decided that the only answer to this question is to take her own life. A note is written to her beloved but thoughtless son, Tom (Jonny Green), and propped on the piano and she is getting prepared – when the phone rings. It’s her brother, Martin, selfish to the point of viciousness, calling to berate her for putting their mother in a home that will eat up the inheritance he was looking forward to instead of continuing to care for her by herself. Beth roars back at him, but not cathartically enough to turn her from her chosen path. She only stops trying to see her plan through when her friend Jess (Lorraine Ashbourne) rings. “D’you want to be in a rock band?”And we’re off. The call has gone out to their friend Holly (Tamsin Greig) too. She has just ended 30 years in the police force by arresting a drunk and disorderly woman – further disoriented by a hot flush – in a supermarket and giving her a bed for the night as she has no home to go to. The next morning, Holly recognises the magnificently obstreperous felon as Kitty (Rosalie Craig), daughter of local gangster Keith. She will be even less delighted in episode two when Beth discovers Kitty doing karaoke in a bar and brings her along to the first band rehearsal as their new and soon indispensable singer. Though Holly has also invited her joyless sister, Yvonne (Amelia Bullmore), to play guitar so they are roughly equal on the potentially bad decision-makinge.Add in a thick sprinkling of unrewarding children, parents at various stages of dementia, weak men, bad men, bosses who cannot or will not address the suffering of employees whose problems run deeper than hurt feelings, mounting physical problems in the face of medical indifference, a baby given up for adoption in the 90s and now looking for his birth mother and you have a rich and moreish stew that is offered up in generous portions. And it is, of course, in Wainwright’s customary manner, perfectly seasoned with humour, from the lightest (“Rocco was a tree in assembly. Before and after an explosion. It was heartbreaking”) to the darkest. Kitty was expelled from the posh school she was sent away to at 13 after her mother died and her father couldn’t stand the sight of her. “It was an education in all sorts of way. Apart from … education.”Like all Wainwright’s best work (and work by the likes ofDebbie HorsfieldandKay Mellorbefore her), Riot Women covers a lot of ground without getting bogged down or leaving the viewer feeling shortchanged. As the band fights to get into a fit state to play at the local fundraiser in six weeks’ time, Beth learns to stand her ground and fight against the invisibility that did so much to make her miserable. She bonds with Kitty partly through admiration of her talent and their shared interest in writing original material for the Riot Women (“Old Bags’ Department” was considered as a band name but ultimately vetoed) but also because she needs to mother, and Kitty, whatever she thinks, needs mothering.It is a drama that, like Happy Valley, looks at the multitudinous roles women manage, the caring responsibilities that accumulate and how they evolve over a lifetime. Children leave home but never stop taking. Mothers become children and take some more. What do you do if you are caught between the two, alone, and no one is around to give you anything? You turn to your equally depleted friends, dig deeper and give what you can to each other. You become a self-supporting circle, which itself becomes a link in the chain that can keep an entire society going. There will be merry hell to pay when that breaks, of course, but TV with this sort of pedigree and cast will buy us a little more time.Riot Women aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSally WainwrightTamsin GreigreviewsShareReuse this content"

What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest. People as far away as Barcelona and Bengaluru emailed the organizers asking how to host similar events.View image in fullscreenA Death to Spotify event at Bathers library in Oakland, California, on 23 September.Photograph: Denise HerediaThe talks come as the global movement againstSpotifyedges into the mainstream. In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”. Spotify’s model, she writes, depends on paying artists a pittance – less still if they agree to be “playlisted” on its Discovery mode, which rewards the kind of bland, coffee-shop muzak that fades neatly into the background.Artists have long complained about paltry payouts, but this summer the criticism became personal, targeting Spotify’s billionaire co-founder Daniel Ek for his investment in Helsing, a German firm developing AI for military tech. Groups including Massive Attack, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof and Hotline TNTpulledtheir music from the service in protest. (Spotify has stressed that “Spotify and Helsing are two separate companies”.)View image in fullscreenMood Machine: the Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist by Liz Pelly.Photograph: HodderIn Oakland, California, Stephanie Dukich read Mood Machine, heard about the boycotts, and was inspired.Dukich, who investigates complaints against the city’s police, was part of a reading group about digital media at Bathers library. Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift,boycottedthe service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playingWill Anderson of Hotline TNTNeil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.View image in fullscreenManasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.Photograph: Eva TuffOthers such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too. Her album Year of the Slug came out only on vinyl and Bandcamp, inspired by Cindy Lee’s Diamond Jubilee, which was initially available only on YouTube and the filesharing site Mega. “I find it pretty lame that we put our heart and soul into something and then just put it online for free,” Rose says.Khruangbin, again? I quit Spotify for a month to escape samey algorithms – this is what I learnedRead moreRose is a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW), an advocacy group formed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to protect music workers. Joey DeFrancesco, a member of the punk rock band Downtown Boys and co-founder of UMAW, says the group “unequivocally supports artists taking agency, holding corporations accountable, and making splashes [such as taking music off Spotify] to push back at the company”. At the same time, DeFrancesco says, that kind of individualized boycotting has its “limits”.“What we try to do in the labor movement and at UMAW is to act collectively,” he adds. Examples include UMAW’s successful campaign (alongside the Austin for Palestine Coalition) to pressure the music festival South by Southwest to drop the US army and weapons manufacturers as sponsors for the 2025 event, and the Living Wages for Musicians Act, sponsored by representative Rashida Tlaib, a bill that would regulate Spotify payouts to artists.The Death to Spotify organizers say their goal is not necessarily to shut the app down. “We just want everyone to think a little bit harder about the ways they listen to music,” Karthikeyan says. “It just flattens culture at its core if we only stick to this algorithmically built comfort zone.”This article was amended on 12 October 2025.

They usually follow certain rules – either an attempt at a toughened-up R&B sound, replete with at least one single featuring a guest appearance by an American rapper, or a lunge towards “grownup” Radio 2-friendly smooth pop-rock territory – and they usually amount to a dimly remembered placeholder, the sight and sound of someone gamely killing time in the years before the inevitable reunion tour.It’s a state of affairs that makes the idiosyncratic path thus far followed by Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall oddly invigorating. She’s certainly not above doing the kind of things that former talent show band members are wont to do, among them loudly underlining that she’s no longer subject to the media-trained constraints of the manufactured pop industry – judging by tonight’s crowd, the most popular item on the merchandise stall is a fan emblazoned with the legend “TINA SAYS YOU’RE A CUNT”, a lyric from Gossip, her collaboration with dance duo Confidence Man – but nevertheless, the music she’s opted to make is pop of a noticeably more intriguing stripe than usual.

Headache melds an Abba-esque chorus with verses that are offer a borderline atonal brand of funk or are enfolded by cavernous echo. She dedicates Unconditional to her mum: it has a fabulous melody, early 80s syndrums, and crashing rock guitar allied to clanging industrial drums. IT Girl unexpectedly reanimates the sound of early 00s electroclash, or rather the thrilling strain of early 00s pop that was heavily influenced by electroclash, while Natural at Disaster starts out like a piano ballad before unexpectedly swerving into a malevolent electronic grind. The woman at its centre is a hugely appealing, cheerily unvarnished presence: she is, she announces at one point, “shaking like a shitting dog”; shouting out her LGBTQ+ fanbase, who are here in force, she suggests thanking them by adding a branded jockstrap to the merch stand.It may well end the way these kind of solo careers end – the enmity towards former bandmate Jesy Nelson expressed in Natural at Disaster patched up, a press conference to announce that Little Mix are back – but the fact the entire audience seem to be word-perfect as they sing along to an album that only came out a month ago makes you wonder. And even if it does, the closing Angel Of My Dreams underlines that Thirlwall’s solo career is unlikely to recede into the realms of the dimly remembered placeholder.Jade plays the O2 Victoria Warehouse in Manchester tonight and istouring the UKuntil 23 October.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockLittle MixreviewsShareReuse this content"

I remember where I was when this feeling, so heretical to me, arrived: it was early morning in London, and having come down Fleet Street on my way to work, I was standing at the till of a newsagents to pay for a Diet Coke, a flapjack and a pack of Silk Cut. There were no children there and no pregnant women; nothing had been said or done to change my mind. It had simply landed on me, and more or less immediately – because I’ve never known how to control an impulse, and because I was 30, which seemed to me then a great age – my husband, Robert, and I set about trying to have a child.When for some months nothing happened, I turned to the websites where women who’ve never met scrutinise their bodies for signs of pregnancy or fertility or miscarriage, and my vocabulary changed. I became able to communicate in acronyms impenetrable to anyone who hadn’t held a dozen ovulation sticks in a dozen urine streams, and it is all so long ago now that I only remember one: 2WW. At first I took this to be some dry reference to the second world war, since they did seem to be always in battle, these women, or in flight – but in fact it refers to the “two-week wait”, the fearful, hopeful days between sex and ovulation, and the first signs the uterus had succeeded or failed (that these signs can be identical sometimes invokes a kind of madness, to which I also briefly succumbed).During this time, I began to picture myself raising a boy as sweet and funny as my husband, and became prone to sentimental visions; one morning I imagined a row of small socks drying on a radiator and burst into tears. My desire to conceive became equal to my prior horror of conception, and when I failed to become pregnant I was indignant, as if for the first time in my life I’d flunked an exam. When eventually I did conceive, it was soon after my mother-in-law, Jenny, had died quite suddenly, and it seemed a recompense for our grief – both my husband’s and mine, and that of his father, David, who’d been not only Jenny’s husband but her carer during a life made difficult by rheumatoid arthritis. That pregnancy was only brief, and I’ve few memories of that time – though I do recall once lying in Victoria Park, east London, and lifting my shirt to allow the sun to reach my belly, saying “there we are – there we are!”, patting the skin over my womb and basking with my child in the late-afternoon light. I quickly miscarried, and for some days sat on the upper deck of London buses weeping steadily, to the visible sympathy of fellow passengers.A room with sunlight illuminating ranks of books was as desirable to me as a nursery might be to another womanSubsequent investigations diagnosed unexplained infertility, and IVF was indicated as our likeliest route to parenthood. But already the surge of maternal longing was fading, replaced by sober consideration of what fertility treatment entailed. I was by then pursuing a full-time PhD during full-time employment, while writing my first book: there seemed insufficient hours in the day for hospital appointments, and injections, and whatever undignified tinkering about with my fallopian tubes they’d deem necessary. With horror I understood that I wanted to publish novels more than I wanted to raise a child – or at any rate that I wanted to write more than I wanted to endure years of interventions that might not produce a baby, but would almost certainly diminish my capacity for study. I pictured those small white socks drying on the radiator, and that was a lovely image – but I also pictured, down the other path, a room with sunlight illuminating ranks of books and a glass of wine and possibly a telescope, and it was as desirable to me as a nursery might be to another woman. One afternoon, over gin and tonic, I announced to a friend (herself happily a mother) that we’d decided not to pursue fertility treatment, and she grasped my hand: “Congratulations!” she said, “I’m just as pleased as if you told me you were pregnant!” – a piece of understanding for which she’ll be forever loved.What that friend knew – and what she’d always let me say – was that until that startling moment on Fleet Street, I’d always regarded the wanting of children, and the having of them, to be absolutely insane. Possibly you’d imagine this makes me a cold sort of person, who flinches from children on public transport and dines on the olives in her martini. In fact, I resemble an illustration of, say, a motherly badger in a children’s book: I’m sturdy and broad-hipped, flour frequently dusting the hem of my pinafore; I make patchwork quilts, windfall jam and my own pastry. I never met a baby I didn’t love, and though I’m not good with children (I’m incapable of silliness and don’t know how to play), I like them no more and no less than any other living soul, that is: according to their merits. Nor do I dislike mothers. Some of my best friends are mothers, and their children are my friends, too (for this reason I call myself childless, which represents mathematical fact, rather than child-free, which casts children of whom I’m very fond as burdens).I feared not that I would be forced to abandon my fierce literary ambitions in service of my child, but – far, far worse – that I would actually want to.The trouble is this: I began to observe motherhood when very young and with the fascination of an anthropologist. As family members began producing their babies, I was aghast: never could I imagine actually choosing such a state. Familiar girls became haggard women who wept as their children screamed upstairs (these were the days when it was fashionable to abandon babies to their sorrow); familiar homes became tautly silent in case the mercifully sleeping infant was woken by a footstep; marriages were strained to snapping by insomnia, and by a deadening of spirits I later recognised as postnatal depression, or the effects of a hopeless co-parent. In time I watched with equal confusion as women willingly gave up their pursuits and careers and – at their own estimation, not mine – their identities, consumed by atavistic emotions that caused them to abandon their most basic needs. One friend became painfully thin, having failed to eat enough to compensate for the demands of breastfeeding; another went about with her blouse transparent with leaking milk, and told me her nipple had a wound that could accommodate a two-pence piece, “just like a slot-machine!”Then there was the contradictory mental state that seemed to me to entail the loss of reason: mothers declared they’d never felt so wretched but also never so fulfilled; none ever suffered like them, but equally (and at precisely the same time!) none ever knew such happiness. Motherhood was a maligned and undervalued condition, but also it was an exalted state that almost every woman I knew either anticipated as inevitable, or sought with a desperation that left their sanity and bank accounts depleted. My attachment to logic and reason – better suited to a mathematician than a novelist – caused me to view all this with a sort of bewilderment, as if I were a student who couldn’t solve an equation.It occurs to me now that I underwent a kind of neurological version of the social media algorithms that turn an idle interest into an obsession: I’d clicked on unhappy mothers early on, and for decades could see little else. Perhaps because I had no dog in the race, new mothers confided in me, and I found that common to them all was guilt: endless, particular, and to my mind nonsensical. Guilt if the baby was not breastfed, but then again guilt if it was breastfed only for three months, or six months, or 12; guilt if the birth was caesarean, or assisted by any of the interventions for which millennia of women would have given their right arm; guilt if the child would not eat peas, or would eat only peas, or was left unattended and put a pea up their nose. “What I would like,” I often said, “is to be a father”, noting how often men (their bodies and careers intact) would regard their partners with simpering gratitude and say that, really, it was all down toher,concealing within the compliment a refusal of such indignities as, for example, the daily preparation of a packed lunch.Above all (it is this that causes me to feel most shamefully unnatural), I feared not that I would be forced to abandon my fierce literary ambitions in service of my child, but – far, far worse – that I would actuallywantto.Soon I will be 46. I never did conceive again: I never will. I have the study of which I dreamed – I have a piano, a telescope, a microscope and a little printing press; my many thousand books flank an open fire, and my time is largely my own. I never grieve my lack of children, but now and then I wonder how things might have been, had I, as that watchful and too-rational child, seen not motherhood’s troubles, but its joys. Once, overlooking the river that divides Namibia from Angola, I ate lunch with a clever and vital woman whose merry nature seemed not contrary to her motherhood, but part of it – she loved her children and she loved her work: it was as simple as that. To the mortification of us both, I burst into tears: “If I’d known you when I was young,” I said, “I might be a mother now – but you see: I had no idea I could have been happy!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’m fortunate to have godchildren, and innumerable nieces and nephews; one of these – though considerably smarter than me and gainfully employed at the British Museum – still calls me “Auntie Sarah”, and I’ve never asked her to drop the honorific, since the tie of blood is precious. Some years ago, a tall, coltish girl from the American south arrived at the house to look after our sensitive rescue hound, and never quite left. Her cleverness showed itself in a thousand surprising and sometimes ludicrous ways; she bred fancy mice that resembled animated pearls, occasionally modelled, and painted beautiful representations of fish guts. Immediately I liked all these things about her, and felt I would have liked them very much in any daughter of mine; these days I suspect my house is as familiar to her as her own, and if you asked me to explain why I love her, I could say only that I like having her about the place. When recently she said, more or less in passing, that since she disliked the idea of speaking at my funeral when the time inevitably came, there was nothing for it but to train as a stonemason, in order to carve my tombstone, I only said “very sensible”, and concealed tears as best I could.And then, in the autumn of 2023, I experienced a curious echo of that time when I’d briefly tried to have a child, as I encountered the NHS policy of leaving patients with suspected cancer for no longer than two weeks before seeing a specialist: another “two-week wait”, if sometimes at the other end of life. David, my father-in-law, having previously seemed in good health, was found to have a suspicious growth in his oesophagus: cancer was suspected, and would be confirmed within 14 days. So his two-week wait ticked away in the bungalow where he lived, as he put the kettle on and made himself porridge he could never quite eat, and set about phoning friends and family members to give them news that was not quite news, because it would be two weeks before the possible became certain. Then the possible did become certain: cancer was confirmed, and he lived for just less than nine days. Those days consumed my husband and me, as we nursed David to his death in his own sitting room, stunned by the speed and rapacity of the disease. There were no hours then but those hours, no world but the bungalow, no object but a dying man’s comfort – and often it occurred to me that we performed our acts of care with something like the instinctual, loving competence of a new mother.Now, those two times of waiting have got muddled up for me – 14 days until signs of life, or the possibility of life; 14 days until signs of death, or the possibility of death. And in the many fortnights since then, I’ve often thought that in fact those days were really no different from any other days – that David and Robert and I had always lived with the possibility and even the proximity of death, as well as life, and that what had changed wasn’t the land, but the view.Death of an Ordinary Man by Sarah Perry is published by Jonathan Cape.

In the decades that followed they were scattered across collections in Europe and America.View image in fullscreenNeil Curtis, head of collections at the University of Aberdeen, with a bronze sculpture depicting an oba (king) of Benin in 2021.Photograph: Courtesy of University of AberdeenTheir return and public display inside the $25m (£19m) state-of-the-art museum in the city of Benin in Nigeria’s Edo state, co-funded by European governments and western enterprises, was to be the crowning moment of an almost century-long effort to reclaim Africa’s stolen art.Yet when MOWAA opens its doors on 11 November, the only Benin bronzes on display will be clay replicas – a far cry from the “most comprehensive display [of Benin bronzes] in the world” touted by authorities when plans for the museum to become their home were announced in 2020.About 150 original bronzes have been returned to Nigeria over the last five years, some on the initiative of private collections and some as acts of state byGermanyand the Netherlands. For now, none are on public display.If the looting of the original bronzes took place in the context of what has been called the “scramble for Africa”, as European nations raced to claim overseas territories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, restitution has in part resembled a scramble in reverse. Western actors tried to outbid each other to atone for their past, before authorities in Nigeria had settled old rivalries about what restitution precisely entailed.View image in fullscreenBenin Bronzes on display at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin in May.Photograph: NurPhoto SRL/Alamy“In the west, there was a race about who was going to be the first institution to restitute,” said MOWAA’s director and chair Phillip Ihenacho, without naming individual museums or governments. “And there was not enough of a focus on to whom they would be restituted to.“I think that there was a well-intentioned effort that was focused very much around being seen to be a pioneer in this area. But a lot of people in the west failed to understand the complexities within those countries.”Nigerian demands for the Benin bronzes’ return, first voiced in the 1930s, were widely shunned by western governments and institutions until 2007, when a consortium of European museums and Nigerian officials formed the Benin Dialogue group.On the Nigerian side, the group included not just representatives of the federal Nigerian government, but also of Edo state, where the kingdom of Benin was once located, and of Ewuare II, the descendant of the royal family that once owned the bronzes, known as the Oba of Benin.Which of these three parties were entitled to the bronzes upon their return has historically been a bone of contention. The Oba has argued that since they were looted from the palace, they should be returned to the descendants and not to Edo state.European participants in the discussions were of the impression that the conflict on the Nigerian side had been settled.Race to returnIn November 2019, the groupinvited Ghanaian-British architect David Adjayeto come up with plans for a new museum where the returned treasures could be stored and put on public display. Still, to the frustration of officials in Nigeria and activists in Europe, there were no concrete announcements on physical returns.The spring of 2021 was to provide a sudden step-change. In a March interview with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the director of Berlin’s newly opened Humboldt Forum let slip that the museum was considering leaving symbolic empty spaces where it had intended to display Benin bronzes from its collection, with the originals returning to Nigeria.The comment surprised German government officials, who were in west Africa to discuss repatriations with their Nigerian counterparts, and set high expectations among the public and other organisations.A flurry of activity followed: days later, Aberdeen University in Scotlandannouncedit would also return a pillaged bronze. Then similar declarations were made by the Horniman museum in London, Cambridge University, New York’s Met and the Rhode Island School of Design’s art museum.Museum officials suggest the pace of these developments was also fanned by the Nigerian cultural heritage agency, whose representatives were jetting around the world to strike return deals.In December 2022, a German state delegation travelled to Nigeria with 21 bronzes packaged in crates in the belly of the government plane, an initiative pushed for by the then foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, of the German Green party, who was eager to make her mark a year into office. “It could and should have been a lot less hectic,” said one official directly involved in preparing the trip.View image in fullscreenNigerian culture minister, Layiwola ‘Lai’ Mohammed (R), and German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, signing an agreement of intent to return the Benin bronzes to Nigeria in Berlin in the summer of 2022.Photograph: Adam Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesAt a handover ceremony in Abuja, Baerbock said Germany was proud to co-finance MOWAA to the tune of €6.8m (£6m), and “invited” her counterpart to exhibit the bronzes there. It was a grand, pathos-filled moment but underneath the surface, tensions that the Europeans believed had been laid to rest were bubbling up again. Present at the ceremony were ministers of the federal Nigerian government and representatives of Edo state, but not the Oba.View image in fullscreenPeople photographing the returned artefacts at the Nigerian foreign ministry during the handover ceremony in December 2022.Photograph: Kola Sulaimon/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was a personal flavour to the animosity: Godwin Obaseki, the then governor of Edo state, is a direct descendant of aformer palace official who had been named Benin prime ministerby the British after the punitive expedition and is still seen in some circles as a betrayer of the kingdom. Media outlets loyal to the palace accused Obaseki of having set up MOWAA in order to hijack the restitution process, calling for its occupancy licenceto be revoked.View image in fullscreenGodwin Obaseki.Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/AlamyThe tussle over the bronzes was ended in an abrupt fashion on 23 March 2023, when Nigeria’s federal government announced in an officialgazettethat the Oba of Benin was the stolen treasures’ rightful owner and custodian, and that they must be stored within his residence in Benin City unless the royal family decided otherwise.The move caused howls of outrage among those in Europe who had been sceptical of the restitution in the first place. Centre-right German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it “a fiasco”, suggesting that the bronzes would be locked away in the Oba’s private residence with no access for the public.This is unlikely to be the case: a former cultural centre adjacent to the Oba’s residence is rumoured to be earmarked as a designated future museum. “The new name will be Benin Royal museum and this is where they plan to store the bronzes,” said Benin-born Mercy Imiegha, director of Lagos-based Nomadic Art Gallery.At any rate, inter-Nigerian disputes should not deflect from the urgent need for the bronzes’ return, say restitution advocates. “The Benin bronzes in German museums would never have found their way to Europe if British forces hadn’t invaded the Benin Kingdom and sacked the royal palace,” said Barbara Plankensteiner, director of Hamburg’s Museum am Rothenbaum and co-spokesperson of the Benin Dialogue group. “We are looking at the largest theft of a royal treasure in history. There was a moral imperative for them to be returned to Africa with no strings attached.”View image in fullscreenBenin bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Photograph: Art2010/AlamyAndreas Goergen, a former secretary general of the German Federal Ministry for Culture and the Media, said: “Dealing with the art objects of traditional rulers is difficult for any republic. Germany took 100 years to reach an agreement with the Hohenzollerns [the German imperial dynasty that was overthrown at the end of the first world war]. Nigeria took four to reach an agreement with the Oba of Benin. So, no reason to be snooty.”“The Europeans can’t tell us what we should or shouldn’t do with the objects of our heritage,” said Toyin Akinosho, co-founder of the nonprofit Committee for Relevant Art, which organises the Lagos Book and Arts festival. “Can’t we hold conversations here too about programming of new culture spaces?”MOWAA, meanwhile, has had to readjust. Originally supposed to be called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it decided to remove the name of the state to emphasise its impartiality.View image in fullscreenThe Museum of West African Art.Photograph: Museum of West African Art (MOWAA)“We had hoped that we would be able to provide support to the restitution effort by demonstrating that we have institutions in West Africa that have what the west would regard as world-class display and storage facilities,” said Ihenacho. “But we never were set up to be the exclusive Benin bronzes museum.”One space will host an exhibition about the archaeological dig carried out on the MOWAA site with £3m in support from London’s British Museum, which still holds the largest single collection of looted Benin bronzes in the world.A selection of about 100 artefacts will hint at the story of the kingdom of Benin and its dissolution. “Some of them may well be made of bronze,” said Ihenacho. “But there will be nothing that was involved in the restitution process.”"

As his fans will know, they are part of tradecraft practised by the spies he wrote about so evocatively. Now, almost five years after his death, an exhibition, with the title Tradecraft, reveals the techniques and motivations of the characters’ real creator, David Cornwell.As you enter the exhibition inOxfordUniversity’s Bodleian library you are greeted with a large portrait of Cornwell, wearing a black bucket cap, looking straight ahead with piercing eyes, his chin resting on his gently clasped hands. Accompanying the photo are two of his quotes. “I am not a spy who writes novels, I am a writer who briefly worked in the secret world,” one says. The second, after questioning whom, if anyone, we can trust, continues: “What is loyalty – to ourselves, to whom, to what? Whom, if anyone, can we love? And what is the caring individual’s relationship to the institutions he services?”They are questions that had confronted him since childhood, with a mother who abandoned and lied to him and a father, Ronnie, a conman and fantasist who spent time in prison. Among the books that feature in the exhibition is A Perfect Spy, which he called the most autobiographical of his novels, whose central character, Magnus Pym, is obsessed with his father, Rick, a seductive fraudster.View image in fullscreenDraft manuscript page of The Constant Gardener, including stapled sheet labelled with arrows and signs to indicate to Cornwell’s wife, Jane, where her typing was to include his inserted amendments.Photograph: Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesBetrayal and spying are, of course, the dominant themes of his cold war novels featuring his hero George Smiley – themes which Cornwell experienced first in fact, then in fiction. After spending national service in the army’s intelligence corps, he was offered a place at Lincoln College, Oxford. The exhibition includes caricatures he sketched for the college publication, the Lincoln Imp. There are articles written for the journal Oxford Left. His fellow contributors were among those on whom Cornwell passed information to MI5, one of his first tasks for the agency, one he said later he regretted.A handwritten note shows how uncomfortable he was amid early speculation about his own spying. “Why do people want me to have views about spying? If I wrote about love, or cowboys, even sex, people would take it that this was my interest and therefore I made up stories about it,” he wrote.His college fellow and rector was Vivian Green with whom Cornwell developed a close relationship (he sketched Green for the Imp). Green had been Cornwell’s tutor at Sherborne school and presided over Cornwell’s marriage to his first wife, Ann Sharp. A reference from Green reveals that he described his former pupil as “congenial, pleasant and loyal”. A Lincoln tutor later recorded: “Mr Cornwell has done his medieval texts very intelligently,” adding: “He must make more of his facts.” It was advice Cornwell, unknowingly at the time, was to seize with astonishing results.View image in fullscreenJane Cornwell, David Cornwell’s second wife, typing a le Carré manuscript. She typed everything that he handwrote – through a series of cut, stapled, sellotaped and annotated drafts.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesAlthough Smiley, portrayed by Alec Guinness in the BBC television series Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley’s People, was a composite character, correspondence between the actor and the novelist featured in the exhibition shows how much Cornwell was inspired by Green. Cornwell, as le Carré, oncewrote: “George Smiley must have all the qualities I lacked: Vivian’s patience, his sagacity, his discretion, his memory. And that peculiar loneliness that comes from knowing and seeing a lot that you can’t do much about.”Fact and fiction seemed to merge when a younger Smiley is described at Oxford as “donnish” but “much slimmer”. In a letter to Cornwell, Guinness questioned whether he was suitable for the role of Smiley. “Although thick-set I am not really rotund or double-chinned,” he wrote.The exhibition includes what he called an “observation”. “From the very first book,” Cornwell wrote, “my central characters have been forced to ask themselves what they owe to Caesar, and what they owe to their consciences.” After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the cold war Cornwell turned his attention to contemporary issues that struck his conscience.View image in fullscreenPen and ink sketches, titled Oxford Gesichte (Oxford Faces). Circa 1953.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesThe exhibition shows the extent to which Cornwell, much like a journalist, relied on sources – they included his former colleagues in MI6 – and how he travelled extensively to research his plots. He consulted widely on the arms trade for The Night Manager, and the pharmaceutical industry for The Constant Gardener. He accused the industry – the subject of much controversy now – of “obsessive secrecy at all levels”. He noted: “Pharma Speak … Be grateful for our brilliant successes and pay whatever we tell you and shut up.”View image in fullscreenThis hand-painted ‘to fix’ pebble sat atop piles of le Carré’s writing to indicate further work needed.Photograph: Estate of John le Carré/Courtesy of the Bodleian LibrariesDrafting The Mission Song, about a western coup plot in eastern Congo, Cornwell described “corporate responsibility” as “the other Heart of Darkness”. The main character of A Most Wanted Man was based on the real story of Murat Kurnaz, a Turk brought up in Germany and rendered to Guantánamo Bay. Cornwell checked with the manager of the Hotel Bellevue Palace in Berne, Switzerland, to ask whether he could name the establishment in the money-laundering and mafia plot Our Kind of Traitor. He met the former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat while writing The Little Drummer Girl, in a plot with striking contemporary resonances.Some former ministers and spy chiefs have expressed regret, and some concern, about what they criticised as a cynical tone and negative message in Cornwell’s novels. Others have welcomed the debates he has provoked. Cornwell mentioned some years ago how he had been invited by MI5 to give a talk to their officers. He was welcomed but told them he was unlikely to be accepted if he applied to join the agency again.Tradecraft at the Weston library, the Bodleian, Oxford, runs until 6 April.Explore more on these topicsJohn le CarréUniversity of OxfordOxfordEspionageExhibitionsThrillersFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

The band sold 70m albums globally and collected 18 platinum and gold discs.They had already enjoyed chart success in the UK and US with a cover of the songGo Now!by the time Lodge joined in 1966. Their original vocalist,Denny Laine, and bass player,Clint Warwick, both left the band following the release of a debut album, The Magnificent Moodies, and Lodge was recruited as a replacement along with guitarist and singerJustin Hayward. Lodge’s falsetto harmonies provided a compelling foil for Hayward’s baritone voice.View image in fullscreenJohn Lodge (left) in 1968 with fellow Moody Blues members (left to right), Mike Pinder, Ray Thomas, Graham Edge and Justin Hayward.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyThe first album recorded by the new lineup, Days of Future Passed (1967) is now regarded as a groundbreaking contribution to the psychedelic rock genre. The involvement of the London Festival Orchestra was evidence of the band’s flirtation with prog rock, although they never shed their pop sensibilities, crafting strong melodies and eschewing the lengthy solos of their prog contemporaries. The standout track on the album wasNights in White Satin, written by Hayward.Many years later Lodge said: “Before we made Days of Future Passed we were singing songs that originated in America and, having never been there, it seemed like a really strange thing to do – singing about a country or an environment I had no first-hand knowledge of. That’s why we said, ‘OK, let’s write about English blues. Let’s write about us. Blues is about people and whatever goes on in their lives.’ That’s what Days of Future Passed is.”High sales and critical approbation followed, with a succession of albums including In Search of the Lost Chord (1968), On the Threshold of a Dream (1969, a UK No 1) and To Our Children’s Children (1969). In the new decade, when the critical tide turned against progressive rock bands in favour of the emerging glam acts, fans stayed with the “Moodies”, propelling A Question of Balance (1970) and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971) to No 1 spots in the UK. Seventh Sojourn (1972) featured two top 40 hits written by Lodge –Isn’t Life Strangeand I’m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band).The Moody Blues performing I’m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)Following a lengthy world tour in 1974 the band decided they all needed a break from each other. Lodge and Hayward continued to work together, however, releasing a collaborative album, Blue Jays (1975), which peaked at No 4 in the UK and No 16 in the US. A solo album from Lodge, Natural Avenue (1977), reached No 38 in the UK.Born in Birmingham, John was the son of Olive (nee Crane) and Charles Lodge. He grew up in the suburb of Birches Green, attended the city’s Central grammar school and then studied engineering at the local technical college (now part of Birmingham City University). Along with classmate and future Moody Blues flute playerRay Thomas, he formed a band called El Riot and the Rebels, which played gigs around the area.Mike Pinder, keyboards and Mellotron player with the Moody Blues, was also a member of that band.Thomas and Pinder eventually moved to London, where, with Laine, Warwick, andGraeme Edge, they formed the fledgling Moody Blues lineup. Lodge remained in Birmingham to complete his engineering studies, joining the band in the mid-60s shake up.After their four-year pause in the late 70s, the classic Moodies line up got back together to record Octave (1976) and then Long Distance Voyager (1981), which went to No 1 in the US and reached No 7 in the UK. The lead single, the Lodge-pennedGemini Dream, peaked at No 12 in the US but did not chart in the UK. In 2015 Lodge released his second solo album, 10,000 Light Years Ago, which featured Pinder and Thomas.Lodge was a supporter ofBirminghamCity football club, a wine enthusiast who launched his own label, Krisemma, and a keen golfer who collaborated on an audio cassette that aimed to help others improve their game.He credited his religious convictions, which he had gained from an early age, with keeping him on an even keel across his career. “I grew up through an evangelical church, and the more I talked to people the more I realised all the things I’d learned at church were relevant – and what everyone was looking for,” he said. “The 60s was a crazy time in rock’n’roll, and you could have really gone to extremes in everything. But I found I had this inner strength that seemed to see me through a lot of things.”He married Kirsten Wright in 1968. She survives him, along with their children, Emily and Kristian, and grandson John-Henry.John Charles Lodge, musician, born 20 July 1943; died 10 October 2025Explore more on these topicsPop and rockBirminghamobituariesShareReuse this content"

Twenty two years since its debut, withrevivalsnow in double figures,David McVicar’s production of The Magic Flute is back, overseen by revival directorRuth Knight.The lighting is as beautiful as ever: there’s no mistaking the Enlightenment’s visual metaphors here. Notwithstanding a technical hitch that delayed the start of act two on opening night, the opera’s sequence of mysterious non-places glides along, dreamlike and atmospheric. The opera has long outlived itsgenre of Singspiel– a kind of 18th-century musical – and its edutainment moralising unavoidably harks back to another age. Whether you agree with the programme that an opera insisting that women always need male guidance is “very suitable for children” will depend on your parenting style. But it’s hard to imagine the plot making more sense in the 21st century than it does in McVicar’s hands.This revival is also a lot of fun, weaving a vital thread of panto-ready physical comedy through the earnest lessons of Sarastro and his pseudo-masonic initiates. The German dialogue is so fluently delivered you’ll overlook the absurdity of a London audience listening to a non-German cast chattering auf Deutsch. The opera’s “noble” couple of Tamino and Pamina can be a bore – all head prefect goody-goody – butAmitai PatiandLucy Crowewere far too vivacious for that. Crowe sparkled from the get-go, her tone warm, her phrasing exquisitely controlled. Pati (the brother of acclaimedSamoan-born tenor Pene) gleamed heroically up top yet blended sensitively in the various ensembles: an extremely fine Royal Opera debut.View image in fullscreenSteely soprano … Kathryn Lewek as the Queen Of The Night.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHuw Montague Rendallis a born Papageno, sympathetic as he struts and strops, his singing easy, his comic timing acute.Gerhard Siegel’s Monostatos (the character stripped of its most explicit racism) was a thoroughly kitsch baddie, whileKathryn Lewekwas a relatively un-histrionic Queen of the Night, her soprano steely and laser-accurate, the leaps of her most famous aria ringing out, bell-like. As Sarastro,Soloman Howardhad easy authority, his high register sumptuous, his lowest notes dense velvet. The three boys boasted exceptional intonation and angelic tone; the three ladies agile, luminous ensemble singing.Holding it all together with an utterly musical, utterly assured sense of pace, was young French conductorMarie Jacquot. She drew ultra-stylish playing from the orchestra: tutti heft remained translucent, chorale passages were sublimely well-tuned, solos artfully sculpted. At one point her hand shot up, releasing the end of a phrase as if she’d been grasping it in her fist, such was her intimate involvement with the music. Remember Jacquot’s name: this Royal Opera debut suggests we’ll be needing it.At theRoyal Opera House, London, until 3 November.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Seamlessly revived by Rachael Hewer, it not only looks good, it does full justice to Puccini’s classic weepy while finding novel ways to raise the odd goosebump.Dieuweke van Reij’s set – a metaphorical highway to heaven – serves for all four acts with more than a nod to Brassaï’s noirishphotos of 1930s Paris. Bare walls and glistening cobblestones are breathtakingly lit by Alex Brok, while Jon Morrell’s monochrome costumes ooze couture. Visser’s bohemians inhabit a kind of twilight zone, a world of fogs, gendarmes and prostitutes, where the spectre of Death stalks the streets with the consumptive Mimì firmly in his sights.Whenever Aida Pascu’s spook-haunted seamstress appears, he’s there, a pallid man in black, sitting and staring. Rodolfo senses him, perhaps, but Mimì increasingly sees and fears him. It’s a chillingly effective conceit, played with consummate stillness by Christopher Lemmings. He pops up again as the toy-maker Parpignol, this time grasping an ominous bunch of blood-red balloons. When the lovers declare they will not part until the flowers return in springtime, he draws back a tarpaulin to reveal them already in bloom. Mimì’s final, agonsed cry of “Come here, my love” is delivered not to Rodolfo but to Death himself.Visser paints precise and visually alluring stage pictures. His endearing students engage in spirited horseplay that for once is tightly crafted and easy to follow. The street scene crackles with energy; Café Momus does a fine line in comedy waiters; crooked policemen turn more than a blind eye to the activities of the local sex workers.View image in fullscreenCrackling with energy … La Bohème.Photograph: Marc Brenner/Glyndebourne Productions LtdIn the pit, musical standards are high. Adam Hickox, son of the late Richard Hickox, has clearly inherited the conducting gene, delivering an incisive account of Puccini’s score that’s crisply alert. A palpable, well-judged elasticity heightens the emotional stakes without ever becoming syrupy. The Glyndebourne Sinfonia responds enthusiastically, as do the lively Glyndebourne Chorus and the fresh voices of Glyndebourne YouthOpera.Pascu’s abject Mimì is a tender creation, pale, agitated and desperately fragile. Her soprano has just the right degree of mid-register creaminess, although top notes could use a little more body. Andrés Agudelo’s Rodolfo doesn’t always spark. His voice blossoms and fades, sometimes within the same phrase, and he’s inclined to resort to stock operatic gestures.Aksel Daveyan’s vocal swagger brightens his otherwise taciturn Marcello, making him an excellent foil for Camilla Harris’s assured, feisty and ever-so chic Musetta. Markus Suihkonen shines as Colline, his performance culminating in a moving Coat Aria, with Darwin Prakash a firm-toned, puckish Schaunard and Darren Jeffery turning in delicious cameos as Benoît and Alcindoro.At Glyndebourne, Sussex,until 2 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicGlyndebourneOperareviewsShareReuse this content"

It is seven miles to the spa town of Llanwrtyd Wells and about two hours’ drive to Cardiff.From £1,995 a week, short breaks £1,495, sleeps four,uniquehomestays.comDrumskinny Farm, County FermanaghView image in fullscreenThis simple Grade II-listed farmhouse is at the end of a private lane in rolling hills on the Fermanagh/Donegal border.

But is it just revolting?Grace DentSun 12 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 12 Oct 2025 13.40 EDTSharePunk Royale, from Stockholm, has landed in London promising, or rather threatening, that their rowdy, immersive, 20-course fine-dining experience will destroy all puny British perceptions of posh food. It’s a huge claim from these Swedish punks. Indeed, nearly 50 years after the UK invented punk, with theSex Pistols effing and jeffing on live TVand provoking a national meltdown, here we have some folk with mullets and Roxette CDs slopping “bumps” of caviar on to my hand shortly after beckoning me into a shoddily decorated, fusty-smelling dining room in Mayfair. It’s all a bit student house and needs a good visit from Mr Sheen. That bump, one supposes, is a playful twist on taking cocaine at a grotty afterparty. However, none of the jokes at Punk Royale is really playful: rather, they’re mostly big, clumsy sledgehammer thwacks. Such as when, for example, they turn off the lights, serve some substandard remoulade, and instruct you to lick it off the plate, while blastingKhia’s My Neck, My Backagain and again as your soul dies. I’ve heard more whimsical humour at aRoy Chubby Browngig.That caviar bump, by the way, came with a shot of tomato water that complemented it nicely. All the drinks afterwards on the non-alcoholic wine flight, however, were thick, soupy, funky and vegetal.View image in fullscreen‘Largely inedible’: guinea fowl with blackberry swede puree at Punk Royale, London W1.Punk Royale’s aversion to crockery and cutlery is perhaps its most subversive idea. Over 20 breakneck courses, we were served many items on the lids of plastic takeaway boxes (including a cheesy puff with a piped sauce) and in syringes. In one case, we were slung cheap surgical gloves and a tin of something salmony, and told to eat it with our hands. Knives and forks appeared around course 17 to tackle some largely inedible guinea fowl with what Punk Royale called “tasty paste”. I have no idea what was in it.We sat awaiting the actual show: the singing, the dancing, the debauchery; eventually, someone brought a large stainless-steel serving spoon, tapped me on the shoulder and shoved mystery slop into my mouth. It turned out to be lobster, truffle and kohlrabi. There was foie gras on a smiley blini with a syringe of raisin juice, which was basically Shloer. Nothing tasted of much. I was virtually force-fed and it all arrived at speed – every two minutes, another dish was banged down. At the end, they served a cube of what could have beenHartley’s jelly.View image in fullscreen‘Nothing tasted of much’: Punk Royale’s foie gras blini with sweet wine.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianThe coffee semifreddo was my favourite part – a moment of refuge – though maybe I was just in shock and this was the equivalent of some sweet tea. This cooking isn’t delicate, or worth the £500 for two with a non-alcoholic drink pairing. Of course, some might say it’s not about the food, it’s about the vibe. But at £500 it really should be about the food, too, not just painting oysters green and serving unseasoned tofu nuggets with damp breadcrumbs on a box lid and thinking you’re Escoffier in Vivienne Westwood tartan pants.The trendification of UK dining, where diners are bankrupted only to be told that it was never about the cooking, is wearisome. A problem for these punks is that London already has a plethora of immersive dining options; should you wish to eat bad chicken in W1 and be harassed by jobbing actors impersonating Basil Fawlty, Poirot or an Elizabethan wench, we are already well catered to.View image in fullscreen‘Some might say it’s not about the food … though at £500 for two it really should be’: Punk Royale’s oyster in green curry apple granita.Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianAs for truly shocking immersive theatre, the likes ofYou Me Bum Bum Train,Punchdrunk,Secret Cinemaand a thousand other arty experiences have set a high, surreal, big-budget bar. Casts of hundreds, hidden rooms, multiple storylines, shock celebrity appearances; rather magically, there’s no limit to the vigour with which these interactive experiences set out truly to jar the audience.Meanwhile, Punk Royale, which I’m guessing is aimed at cash-rich, experience-hungry twentysomethings, really only does one rankling thing, and that’s taking diners’ phones and locking them in a box for safekeeping. Clearly this is to preserve the magic of the journey, although a cynic might say that there’s so little substance to the staging of dinner here that Instagram scrutiny would kill it stone dead in two weeks. We fled into Saturday night Soho, where true debauchery has thrived non-stop since at least 1500.It’s only rock’n’roll, and I don’t like it.Punk Royale 6 Sackville Street, London W1S, 07375 136388. Open dinner Tues-Sat; seating times Tues 7pm; Weds-Sat 5.45-6pm and 8.45-9pm. £220 per head, including drinks, plus service.The next episode of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is out on Tuesday 14 October – listen to ithere.Explore more on these topicsFoodGrace Dent on restaurantsRestaurantsScandinavian food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Season to suit your own tastes, and enjoy with a coffee or teaFelicity CloakeSun 12 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareThere are few joys quite like a sticky bun. As soft and sweet as an edible pillow, they’re a lovely thing to sink into with a cup of coffee and, though they look impressive, they’re also unexpectedly easy to make at home. This Scandinavian version is cinnamon flavoured, but feel free to change the seasoning to suit your palate.Prep30 minRest1 hr+Cook25 minMakes71 tsp ground cardamom seeds(from about 25 pods; see step 1)300ml whole milk50g butter, roughly cubed425g plain flour60g caster sugar¼ tsp fine salt7g fast-action/instant yeast1 eggOil, for greasingFor the filling75g butter, softened50g dark brown sugar2 tsp cinnamon½ tsp saltTo finish1 egg, lightly beatenDemerara or granulated sugar1 A note on the cardamomGround cardamom is fairly easy to find these days, but if you don’t mind a bit of fiddly work, you should get a teaspoon or so of powder from the ground seeds of about 25 pods. Alternatively, for a milder flavour, use the seeds whole and strain them out of the milk later.2 Infuse the milkView image in fullscreenPut the milk in a small pan on a medium-low heat, add the cardamom and bring to a gentle simmer, keeping it just below the boil (keep an eye on it, because milk can catch and burn quickly). Take off the hob, stir in the butter, and leave to infuse and cool to blood temperature; if the mixture is too hot, it’ll kill the yeast.3 Make a start on the doughView image in fullscreenMix the flour, caster sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add the yeast (if you prefer fresh yeast, you’ll need 21g, or 10g of active dry yeast, both of which will require reactivating before use). It’s always worth checking the best-before date on yeast, because its potency deteriorates with time. Old yeast = greasy cinnamon flatbreads.4 Finish the doughBeat the egg lightly. Once the milk has cooled to warm, make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients, tip in the beaten egg and stir in to combine. Add or strain in the milk, then stir to make a soft dough that comes away easily from the sides of the bowl.5 Knead the doughLightly grease a work surface (this is to avoid adding more flour to the dough) and tip the dough on to it. Knead vigorously for about eight minutes; at first, it will be very soft, but persevere and keep kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic (a dough scraper will be useful here). Alternatively, work it in a food mixer on a medium-low speed for about five minutes.6 Prove the doughView image in fullscreenWipe out the bowl, oil it lightly, then return the dough to the bowl. Cover with a tea towel or similar, and put somewhere draught-free and not too chilly for about 30 minutes, until well risen. (A cold oven, with a bowl of hot water in the base, is a good option if there’s no obvious draught-free spot in your place.)7 Now for the fillingView image in fullscreenMeanwhile, beat all the filling ingredients until soft and easily spreadable; feel free to replace the cinnamon with another flavouring or spice, such as vanilla seeds, grated citrus zest, cocoa powder, grated nutmeg, etc. Grease a deep, 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin.8 Fill and shape the doughView image in fullscreenRoll out the dough on the same greased surface to a roughly 35cm x 25cm rectangle. Smear the filling all across its surface (your hands are the best tools for this), then, starting from one of the long edges, roll up the dough tightly, like a swiss roll.View image in fullscreenRotate so the seam is at the bottom, then cut into seven equal slices.9 Prove, bake, cool and tuck inArrange the slices in the greased tin, spacing them out evenly, with the smallest in the middle, then cover and leave to prove for about 30 minutes, until the dough springs back when prodded gently.View image in fullscreenMeanwhile, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Paint the buns with the beaten egg, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown.View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsBakingFelicity Cloake's masterclassFoodBreakfastScandinavian food and drinkBreadfeaturesShareReuse this content"
