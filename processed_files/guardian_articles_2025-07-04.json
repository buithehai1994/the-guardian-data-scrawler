You might have expected a loud response. This is, after all, a crowd so partisan that, in between the support acts, they cheer the promotional videos – the tour’s accompanying brand deals seem to involve not just the obviously Oasis-adjacent sportswear brand Adidas, but the more imponderable Land Rover Defender.Even so, the noise the fans make as the reconstituted Oasis launch into Hello takes you aback slightly, and not just because Hello is a fairly bold choice of opener: this is, after all, a song that borrows heavily from Hello, Hello, I’m Back Again by Gary Glitter. But no one in Cardiff’s Principality Stadium seems to care about the song’s genesis: the noise is such that you struggle to think of another artist that’s received such a vociferous reception.So, the success of the show seems more or less like a foregone conclusion. Anyone who saw them in the 00s will tell you that the old Oasis were a hugely variable proposition live: you never knew what moodLiam Gallagherwould show up in, or how the current state of familial relations might affect their performance. But evidently as little as possible has been left to chance at these reunion gigs. No one – including, to their immense credit, Liam and Noel Gallagher – seems interested in pretending this tour is anything other than a hugely lucrative cash-grab, and clearly, you only grab the maximum possible cash if the tour doesn’t descend into the kind of bedlam to which Oasis tours were once prone.Liam is on his best behaviour – “thanks for putting up with us,” he offers at one juncture, “I know we’re hard work”, a noticeable shift from the days when he was wont to rain abuse on the audience – and Liam and Noel have rhythm guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs stood squarely between them on stage, creating distance. You could say that removes combustibility, the hint of potential chaos that was at least part of Oasis’s appeal, but you might as well save your breath: no one would be able to hear you over the sound of people singing along en masse to a set that plays to the strengths of Oasis’s back catalogue.View image in fullscreenAbundant songwriting talent … Noel Gallagher at the Principality Stadium.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersFew bands’ reputations have been better served by the rise of streaming, both in its favouring of curated playlists over albums – all the highlights and none of the rubbish, of which there was a great deal in Oasis’s later years – and in the way it decontextualises music, denuding it of its accompanying story or contemporary critical responses. The much-vaunted Oasis fans too young to remember the band first-hand definitely exist – you can see them in the audience – but you do wonder how many of them believe Oasis split up in 1998, rather than grimly trudging on for another decade, to declining artistic returns.The show seeks to maintain this myth. It’s very much playlist Oasis, big on the first two albums and B-sides from the years when Noel Gallagher’s songwriting talent seemed so abundant he could afford to blithely confine stuff as good as Acquiesce or The Masterplan to an extra track on a CD single, and low on anything at all from their later years. Only the presence of 2002’s Little By Little indicates that Oasis existed into the 21st century.You can still sense inspiration declining – 1997’s D’You Know What I Mean? sounds like a trudge regardless of how many people are singing along – but far more often, the show serves as a reminder of how fantastic purple patch Oasis were. Against a ferocious wall of distorted guitars, there’s a weird disconnect between the tone of Noel’s songs – wistful, noticeably melancholy – and the way Liam sings them like a man seething with frustration, on the verge of offering someone a fight. Even discounting half their career, they have classics in abundance: Cigarettes & Alcohol, Slide Away, Rock ’n’ Roll Star, Morning Glory. Enough, in fact, that a section where Liam cedes the stage and Noel takes over vocals doesn’t occasion a dip in the audience’s enthusiasm: during Half the World Away, the audience’s vocals threaten to drown the song’s author out entirely.It ends with precisely the encore you might have expected – Don’t Look Back in Anger, Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova – which understandably occasions precisely the response you might have expected. A very perfunctory clap on the back – the only time the Gallaghers interact beyond playing the same songs – and Liam vanishes: a car is waiting by the side of the stage to whisk him away before the final notes die away, a triumph in the bag.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockNoel GallagherLiam GallagherreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are lots of cases waiting to be unlocked.”View image in fullscreenA screen grab from Avon and Somerset police of Ryland Headley being interviewed after his arrest for the murder of Louisa DunnePhotograph: Avon and Somerset Police/PADays before the Headley trial began, a commission on forensic science chaired by Gallopconcludedthat the sector in England and Wales was in a “graveyard spiral” leading to an increase in unsolved crimes.The commission said the two countries had lost their national forensic science service and the commercial market that followed had “collapsed”.Police forces were taking more testing in-house or moving away from “traditional” forensic science, because they perceived commercial provision to be too slow and too expensive, the commission concluded.Gallop said: “At the moment, forensic science isn’t working for anyone. There aren’t the scientists to help the police – a lot of them have been deskilled or become disenchanted because it’s all about quick cheap tests, not scientific investigation.“There aren’t enough of us with the right experience. We’re in a sorry state.”View image in fullscreenAngela Gallop, photographed for the Guardian in 2022.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianCarole McCartney, professor of law and criminal justice at the University of Leicester, said cold case investigations could be “haphazard”. She said: “There are 43 police forces [in England and Wales], 43 different ways of doing things and they’re all on a budget.”A big concern is that the forces do not have the budget or expertise to run complex storage facilities. McCartney said: “I’ve spoken to forensic scientists who say they won’t touch a case if the evidence has come out of a police store because they can’t attest to its integrity.”She said, ironically, it may be easier to solve very old crimes than new ones because some evidence from historical cases is still stored centrally.Avon and Somerset policehas been fetedfor the cold case inquiry, codename Operation Beatle,that led to Headley being jailed for life, but some of the serious challenges faced by the police emerged, not least the small size of the cold case team that caught Headley.View image in fullscreenExhibit boxes from Avon and Somerset police’s investigation of Louisa Dunne’s murder.Photograph: Avon and Somerset Police/PAThere were only six part-timers – two officers and four retired detectives now working as civilian investigators. They have about 30 unsolved murders on their books, and also look at rapes, missing people and unidentified bodies.McCartney said when she visited a different force she was told they had an “amazing” system. “It turned out to be four retired cops in a bunker sifting through boxes and Googling the cases.”Glyn Maddocks KC, a solicitor based in south Wales, said: “Forces [in England and Wales] store material differently: they’re all deciding slightly differently what to test and what not to test, what to take swabs off and what not to. It’s quite chaotic.”Maddocks said forces carrying out their own scientific investigations could lead to miscarriages of justice. “People have this idea that forensic science is independent.”View image in fullscreenThe BBC cold case detective series Steeltown Murders.Photograph: Tom Jackson/BBCThe Headley casehas made headlines around the world,a reminder of the fascination cold cases hold. Ed Talfan, the creative director of the Welsh production companySevern Screen, which has made two celebrated cold case shows based on real-life crime,Steeltown MurdersandThe Pembrokeshire Murders, said such investigations made powerful drama.Talfan said: “Cold cases hold a particular power, because victims’ families not only have to endure the pain and shock that comes with losing a loved one, but then navigate the terrible limbo that follows.“When a breakthrough does finally come, sometimes after decades, I think audiences respond to the families’ feeling of release – not from the pain of losing their loved one, but from the pain of not knowing. I don’t think families ever get closure. But knowing the facts, knowing who was responsible, gives them something that matters deeply.”View image in fullscreenEmilia Fox and Prof David Wilson in Channel 4’s cold case series In the Footseps of Killers.Photograph: Alaska TVProf David Wilson, emeritus professor of criminology and presenter of the Channel 4 cold case seriesIn the Footsteps of Killers, said: “We really like an ending. We’ve always been attracted to solving the mystery.”But he said there were no happy endings. “We might get a denouement in terms of what happened, but that doesn’t necessarily bring family and friends any form of closure. The ripples continue.”Women’s campaign groups are keen that Dunne, who was killed aged 75, is not forgotten and have called for the investigations into Headley to continue. The campaign groupWomen Against Rapesaid: “We’re glad the appalling crimes against Louisa Dunne are finally recognised.“But how many other women has this man raped and murdered? Solving cold cases doesn’t atone for continuing refusal by the authorities to treat violence against women and girls as a serious crime.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeTV crime dramaTelevisionRape and sexual assaultfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you don’t count the walls falling downMarina HydeNothing says you’ve lifted the mood of the nation like having to haul your chancellor to a photocall at a ‘wellbeing centre’Fri 4 Jul 2025 08.58 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 13.20 EDTShareWell, British politics has served up another week of compellingly packaged action. Like Drive to Survive, but for clown cars. Leave it to “no-drama Starmer” to come up with the only thing weirder and more awful than watching the chancellor of the exchequersob on the frontbench– wheeling her out a mere 22-and-a-half hours later for an unscheduled appearance at a wellbeing centre(!), where Rachel Reeves had to get her happy face on and pose for selfies.The whole thing gave Keir Starmer the feel of one of those remorseless boyband managers who reacts to one of their young charges having a breakdown by getting them a special injection and shoving them straight back out on stage the next night. I think you can probably do it with a member of Take That or 5ive or whoever, and only run the risk of them turning on you in adocumentary decades later. But is it a vibe you want at the heart of the team in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy?Yes, imply some allies of Reeves, who are now suggesting that because the (debunked) possibility that the chancellor was crying about losing her job clearly spooked bond traders, she has actually emerged in a stronger position from the whole business. Again: really? Having to physically hug your boss to calm the markets doesn’t feel like a textbook power move – but look, like people kept saying last July: the grownups are back in charge.Anyway, never mind last July. Watching the turbo-fiasco of this week unfold, I kept thinking instead of a speech Starmer made in the Downing Street garden near the end of last August. I want to say it was the first reset of his government … ? But who’s counting. This government’s had more reboots than Batman. And, like that particular character’s screen incarnations, it all just seems to keep getting darker and grittier every time.That August speech featured an extremely extended analogy between the country and a house that had some kind of rot, but could be fixed by being completely made over, if you really had a go at overhauling the foundations.Rereading itin the wake of Labour’s full-spectrum Commons chaos over the universal credit and personal independence payment bill reminded me of one of those movie scenes where an idealistic young newcomer is telling a guy in the town about the house they’ve just bought. It’s a real fixer-upper, they’re going to do it all themselves, it was quite the bargain, but it could be beautiful – and the guy just cuts them off as it dawns on him. “Ohright,” he says. “The murder house.”No one is saying the House of Commons wasbuilt on an Indian burial ground… but this week’s deranged farce certainly seemed to release the spirits of the Brexit years back into its cursed chamber. Much as Theresa May’s 437 Brexit votes never actually achieved a Brexit, the universal credit and personal independence payment bill now has nothing about personal independence payments in it. If that doesn’t take you back down memory lane, meanwhile, other throwbacks are available. Shortly after 9pm last night, the Coventry South MP, Zarah Sultana, announced she wasgoing to “co-lead the founding”(what?) of a new party with Jeremy Corbyn. And shortly after that, sources close to Corbyn let it be known he was furious and bewildered this plan had been launched without consultation. According to what one allytold the FT, “Zarah has really overplayed her hand”, which is believed to include the three of clubs, Mr Bun the Baker, and an expired student railcard. Out loud, Corbyn said things like “Zarah will help us” and “discussions are ongoing”. Let’s pray for peace – if not in the wider world, then certainly in this new and fractured party.Then again, which part of our politics isn’t fracturing before our very eyes? It is quite possible none of us will be able to escape the murder house’s past. In some ways, the most bizarre thing about the welfare bill fallout was the cabinet ministers attempting to clean it up with the same strange, dead language that a growing number of people feel characterises most contemporary politicians bar Nigel Farage. No sooner had the horror show unfolded than cabinet office minister Pat McFadden was explaining that though there would be a cost,Labourwould still stick to its manifesto promises on tax. Is this the gibberish about not raising taxes on “working people”? It would seem so.Yet even back at manifesto stage, this already felt like a deliberately obscure way of talking that just comes across as lying. Newsflash, Pat: you already have raised taxes on working people.People who run small businesses are working people. And the reason they haven’t employed more working people, and in some cases have let go the working people they used to employ, is because you raised taxes on them. By chance I heard McFadden’s interview right after one of my children told me they’d seen Reeves crying on loads of YouTube videos. He’s 12, so I think that’s what they call cut-through – and underscores the feeling that you just can’t control politics in the knackered old ways any more.As for what we’re feeling – all those wonderful working people out there in the dark – the answer is surely: like we’ve been here before, and that the dysfunction is more wearying for its familiarity. Starmer came to power promising his government would fix broken Britain. One year on, it would be a start if he could even fix his broken government.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsStarmer: one year onLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

The heady memories of England’s victory over Germany at Wembley in July 2022, which won them a first European Championship, will never disappear but retaining their title would surpass that achievement. Sarina Wiegman’s players arrived in Zurich on Monday to complete their preparations for Euro 2025 and must hit the ground running after being dealt a fiendishly difficult route to glory.They will begin against France on Saturday at Stadion Letzigrund, hoping victory against a notoriously difficult foe will banish the doubts that have clouded their buildup. England have been dealt a “group of death” that also includes a strong Netherlands side and the debutants Wales. Only two can make it to the quarter-finals, so one of Europe’s leading lights has to miss out. An early victory would send the message that England are here until the conclusion on 27 July.Sarina Wiegman takes relaxed approach with Lionesses ready to launch Euro defenceRead moreTheir supporters certainly hope to be. Among record sales of more than 600,000 tickets for a tournament whose popularity is burgeoning, 41,000 have been bought by fans from England. The Football Association comfortably sold its allocation of 2,000 for each of England’s Group D games but many more are expected to find their way into the stands.Switzerland has not been spared the heatwave that has seared an entire continent, although a heavy overnight thunderstorm in the Zurich area ensured preparations could be undertaken more comfortably on Friday. Supporters have enjoyed watching the tournament’s early fixtures on giant screens in a dedicated fan zone; an atmosphere that has otherwise resembled business as usual will ramp up as the nation’s biggest city prepares to stage its first game.England fans have been trickling into different parts of Switzerland all week. Among the replica shirts seen in Basel, which held the hosts’opening-night match against Norwayon Wednesday, was one bearing the name of Aggie Beever-Jones. The Chelsea striker, who will turn 22 on the day of the final, is one of the bright new hopes in a squad that has seen significant upheaval since sweeping all before them.Wiegman was forced to reject suggestions of a crisis upon naming her squad last month after the senior players Mary Earps and Fran Kirby retired from international football. A third, Millie Bright, declared herself unavailable for selection in Switzerland. All three played in the Euro 2022 final; Bright had captained England at the 2023 World Cup, whose final they narrowly lost against Spain.View image in fullscreenAggie Beever-Jones is one of the new crop of England players who were not part of the Euro 2022 triumph.Photograph: Nigel French/Getty Images/AllstarKirby had learned she would not make the cut this summer and the goalkeeper Earps had been gradually phased out of a starting position. Nonetheless they have been integral to England’s rise and there are fears that the class of 2025 will lack the nous needed for a draining month of tournament football.A7-0 friendly victory over Jamaicaon Sunday provided the kind of send-off that can clear heads. Ella Toone, one of the goalscoring heroes on that special Wembley afternoon, was on target twice to boost the feelgood factor. England can also point out thatthey beat Spain, the overwhelming favourites, in February.England and Wales can look forward to a historic meeting in St Gallen on 13 July. Wales’ progress has been a beacon for smaller nations and they may yet have a say in their bitter rivals’ fate. A positive result for Rhian Wilkinson’s side against the Netherlands on Saturday could leave the group wide open. England’s clash with France, though, will be the first true heavyweight tussle of a tournament whose polished start bodes well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps the only disappointment was that thehost nation were beaten 2-1despite being the better side. Local hopes have not been particularly high in the buildup, an inexperienced Switzerland team having struggled this year, but a similar level of performance in their second two group games could be enough for progress to the quarter-finals.That would maintain the positive feeling in a country whose enthusiasm for football tends to bubble around the surface. Some senior figures inside Uefa have privately expressed concerns that their affordable ticketing policy could backfire: given Switzerland’s affluence, a 25 franc (£23) outlay might easily be written off if something more interesting comes up. But there was plenty to allay those fears when 29,520 filled Stadion Wankdorf in Berne to watch Spain make anearly statement in overpowering Portugalon Thursday. It was the largest crowd for a European Championship group stage game not featuring the home country and may have set a tone for the next three weeks.The shocking deaths of Diogo Jota, the Liverpool and Portugal forward, and his brother André Silva left a cloud over that game and have devastated an entire sport. If nothing else, perhaps Euro 2025 can help return the tiniest crack of light. England hope this is another moment to shine.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballEngland women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My daughter told me I would love it and I ignored her for too long. I’ve tackled Elden Ring, but much prefer the often gentler combat of Enshrouded. It sometimes makes me feel like an elite fighter, then other times kicks my arse in precisely the right measures.Its real joy is the flexibility to spend your time doing whatever tickles your fancy. I’ll spend a few hours growing crops to make a cake or smelting metals for better armour, then knock off a few quests to unlock new materials and weapons. But mainly my goal is to complete the ludicrously large plans I have for a castle or village perched on top of a mountain. Most of all, though, the visuals are glorious. From the deep forests, to the deserts to snow-capped mountains, just a feast for the eyes. When the sun sets and the light hits the shroud just right it’s one of the most stunning things I’ve seen in gaming.Paul, SouthendStalker 2There are no other games like the Stalker series. Stalker 2 is utterly immersive, a survival epic with a riveting backdrop loosely based on the Stalker film (another riveting experience) and the Chornobyl incident. This is a complete rebuild in a modern game engine of the first Stalker game, with updated graphics and interactivity, but the same familiar places. There’s a new story too. Not only does it have the same feel as the original Stalker, it also has many familiar bugs. I’ve been playing computer games since Labyrinth in 1978 and Stalker is the most charismatic of them all. Purchasing it also gives a small boost to the Ukrainian game studio.James, SpainView image in fullscreenUtterly immersive … Stalker 2.Photograph: GSC Game WorldStories from Sol: The Gun DogThis is my highlight from 2025 so far. I love the art style and music. But it is the three-dimensional characters who make it my favourite. They pull you into the story; I really felt an emotional connection to them, although you get to spend more time with some than others. They left me wanting to know more. I can’t wait to see what Space Colony Studios does next.Miranda, CardiffView image in fullscreenEmotional connection … Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog.Photograph: Space Colony StudiosIndiana Jones and the Great CircleStray comes a close second, and Atomfall was a lot of fun, but Indiana Jones was about as close to perfect as I could ask for. Not too long – with two kids and a busy job, I don’t have time for sprawling open-world RPGs any more, but there was enough of an open-world flavour to keep me satisfied. The missions were fun, and very Indiana Jones in terms of style and problem solving. Having the boulder scene from Raiders as the prologue was a touch of genius. And let’s be honest, with the excellent sound effects, you could never tire of punching Nazis.Rob, EdinburghFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals TimeI have been enjoying Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. It is a great mix of open-world exploration, with so much to do and often the game encourages you to explore different lives to get better equipment for exploration. Coupled with a charming art style and a great multiplayer community, I can see myself only further extending my 80 hours in the game.Jonathan, Edenbridge, KentView image in fullscreenSo much to do … Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time.Photograph: Level 5 IncThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredI loved the remastered Oblivion,it’s rare that a less-than-beautiful game from your childhood gets re-released as a beautiful remaster. The gameplay holds up, and all of the quirks that made me love the original game remain. During these quite difficult political times it’s nice to escape into a Lord of the Rings-esque world full of dungeons and lighthearted characters. Even the sequel to Oblivion, Skyrim, feels slightly too serious for these serious times. The biggest reason it was my favourite wasn’t because of the gameplay or even the gorgeous new graphics. I got my partner Emily into gaming a few years back – watching her discover the world of Oblivion brought me back to when I first played it, and I enjoyed watching her discover the fantasy world more than I enjoyed it myself.Jack, BathAvowedI loved Avowed. It came out of nowhere for me, I hadn’t seen any of the publicity leading up to it, but it was just so brilliant to play a mid-sized RPG. Much as I love the enormous sandbox genre, it feels like so many games now want to be the next Skyrim. Avowed took the opposite route, it set you on rails and it focused on the systems it wanted to do really well rather than trying to do everything. The combat, the exploration and the writing were all top-notch.Isobel, LondonView image in fullscreenStory, story, story … Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.Photograph: Warhorse Studios/Deep SilverKingdom Come: Deliverance 2This one is easy for me. It’s all about story, story, story. I have a rule about buying games these days: I wait one month before I consider the purchase. I let everyone else play test the game then make a decision. With all its quirks, KCD2’s story overrides any small bugs or oddities you may experience. I didn’t experience any issues, I was immersed in the story of my Henry and being lost in a world where all my emotional buttons were being pushed. With all that going on, moving through the story was exciting and more so when the big quests finished or act changes occurred. It’s a game that kept revealing itself right up to the last point where you are on a hill talking to your departed parents. It is here that you now realise that you were truly playing and guiding the story of Henry. The choices you made mattered. It’s not until after playing that you can ultimately decide if it was all worth it, good or bad. One of the best RPG video games I have ever played.Andrew, AustraliaExplore more on these topicsGamesBest culture of 2025 so farPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From box breathing to standing on a cold bathroom floor, experts and readers offer tried and tested tips on how to calm your mind and drift back off …Sarah PhillipsFri 4 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTShareDon’t count sheepBad news for that old favourite, counting sheep. “It has been studied and it doesn’t work,” says Dr Eidn Mahmoudzadeh, a Manchester GP and co-founder ofThe Sleep Project, which offers support for sleeplessness at all ages. “It is too simple and mundane; people don’t carry on, they just get bored and their thoughts wander to worrying about sleep.” Counterintuitively, you should go for something more mentally challenging, he says, to distract the brain.Rachel from London counts backwards from 100: “Do it slowly and if thoughts interrupt or you miss where you are, just start again. Sometimes the thoughts overpower, but most times I don’t get much beyond 76.”Alternatively, try a“cognitive shuffle”exercise, saysDr Lindsay Browning, a chartered psychologist and neuroscientist. “It works by thinking of any word, such as ‘cake’ and trying to name as many words as possible that start with the first letter, C. When you have exhausted that list, move on to the next letter, A, and so on.”There are lots of other ways of doing this. Suz Koch from Washington state says she “chooses a category (eg: fruits, dog breeds, colours, movies) and starts at A, naming one thing from the category for every letter of the alphabet. It’s a low-stakes activity that seems to switch my mind off from worrying, and I rarely make it past J.”Do listen tothings thatdistract your thoughtsThere is a school of thought that says having your phone by your bed is a disaster for sleep hygiene, but listening to something on it that distracts your mind can be useful. Julie Hassall from Plymouth listens to exactly the same audiobook every night:Pride and Prejudice on the BBC Sounds app. “The point in listening to the same text,” she explains, “is that you don’t concentrate on it – you don’t need to because you know the story inside out – but the rhythm of the narration stops you thinking about random stuff (what colour to paint the bathroom, cringing over that incident in a nightclub 35 years ago, worrying about an upcoming work presentation) and you will eventually fall asleep. Sometimes it’s a bit weird – if I’m dreaming, the characters in my dream can start quoting the text. But as someone who has never slept well, I find it an invaluable way of getting a little more shut-eye.”Russell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University and the author ofLife Time: The New Science of the Body Clock,is a nocturnal fan of BBC Radio 4, and in particular, “In Our Time, as it is really gentle. You are away within five minutes. The history of Chinese porcelain will do it for me every time.”White noise is another popular choice for zoning out, and can be as niche as you like. Michael Mobley from Colorado says, “I prefer lower-frequency, almost rumbling static with very little high-end hiss, played through a nice bluetooth speaker with good bass response, on a continual one-hour loop all night.”If you don’t want to reach for your phone, you can try recounting a familiar story, like Carol Kolb in Los Angeles does: “I go through the plot of a book I know well in my head, trying to include as much detail as possible. When my mind wanders off to other things I force myself to go back to where I left off in the book. This month it is David Copperfield, but often I use my favourite book of all time, Kazuo Ishiguro’sThe Unconsoled, a winding, dreamlike novel I have been lulling myself to sleep with for years.”Don’t clock watchWhen you wake up, the instinctive thing is to look at the clock, says Mahmoudzadeh. “Then you start to worry about how much sleep you haven’t had, and do some mental maths about what time you have to get up. The brain goes round and round in circles, which is really unhelpful for getting back to sleep.” He recommends “removing all visible clock faces from the bedroom. You don’t need to know whether it is 2am or 6am; your alarm will go off when you need to get up. It does not help your situation at all, and it can only do harm.” Rori Reber from California uses this tactic: “I purposefully do not look at the clock. That is very important.” And no glancing at your phone beyond turning on a podcast. “Every fibre of your being has got to stop you from doomscrolling,” says Foster, which he concedes can be hard to resist.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The GuardianDon’tsufferthe wrong temperature“Ideally, for most people, bedrooms shouldn’t be warmer than about 18C,” says Foster. “The logic is that as you go to sleep, core body temperature drops. If you prevent that drop in temperature, it is more difficult to get to sleep. But under certain circumstances – if you are perimenopausal, menopausal or at a certain phase of the menstrual cycle – hormonal changes can increase core body temperature, and that might make you more likely to wake up.”“If you are waking up with a hot flush, try to cool your body down,” saysDr Zoe Schaedel, a Brighton GP who specialises in menopause and sleep. “Stand on a cool bathroom floor or near a fan and have a drink.” She adds that it is really important to get help for menopause-related night sweats, and there are hormonal and non-hormonal treatments available.“My trick is to get cold then get warm again,” says Caitlin from Liverpool. “I kick off the covers and just when I’m getting uncomfortably chilly, I cover up again. As I get warm, my body and mind are then able to relax and this causes me to fall asleep. It is like a reboot. Works every time.”Do focus on your breathing“There is good evidence that meditation techniques can help people fall back to sleep quicker by down-regulating your stress response,” says Mahmoudzadeh. Breathing exercises that are recommended for insomnia, says Schaedel, include box breathing (breathe in for four, hold for four, breathe out for four, hold for four) and “4-7-8” (breathe in for four, hold for seven, breathe out for eight). “They are really good at reducing the level of alertness,” she says. She also suggests trying a visualisation, where you think of a very detailed experience and try to focus on that, which “shifts the focus off trying to go to sleep”. You can find inspiration on theHeadspaceandCalmapps, she says.Jonathan Guest from Cardiff runs through a 5K running route in his head: “I try to remember in detail everything I could see or hear and the feelings it gave me at each step or stage around the course. I rarely get more than a couple of miles before I’m asleep.” Flora from Sweden opts for a strategy she heard was used by the military: “Focus on your breathing, and starting at the very top of your head, imagine your body turning into lead or something very heavy. You then imagine this heaviness spreading down your neck, chest, along your arms and keep going. Any time you get distracted and start thinking about work or personal dramas, start again from the top of the head.”Chris Hales from Dorset follows advice he received from a doctor about adding a second activity to breathing exercises. “Slowly tapping a finger works for me. Giving the brain two things to focus on at once makes it difficult for the mind to wander and perform other tasks. I found that alternately tapping two different fingers was optimal – easy to do, but complex enough to keep the brain occupied.”Don’t get anxious about being awakeThis is easier said than done, but worrying about being awake is the No 1 enemy of getting off to sleep, so try to suppress such thoughts. “When you wake in the night, the key is to give yourself permission to be awake,” says Dr Guy Meadows, a sleep physiologist and founder ofThe Sleep School. “The more you fight wakefulness, the more alert you become.”If being awake in the middle of the night is a recurrent issue, Meadows suggests consideringacceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), a technique that is used in his school’s apps, which he says encourages a gentler approach, where you “notice your thoughts without judgment, breathe, and let go of the struggle. You may not fall asleep instantly, but by accepting wakefulness, you’re sowing the seeds of long-term healthier sleep – building a trusting, rather than fearful, relationship with sleep. Over time, this shift in mindset helps reduce nighttime anxiety and makes it easier for sleep to return naturally.”“When all else fails,” says Julia Hankin from Newcastle upon Tyne, “I remind myself that even on no sleep, I will survive. Yes, the day might be tough and very long, but I’ll get through it. That seems to take the pressure off, and then I fall asleep.”Do try switching positions in the bed“I don’t do it immediately, but if I’ve tried the usualyoga-ish savasana position (also known as corpse pose) and focusing on breathing and it doesn’t work, I go upside down, taking my pillow to the bottom of the bed and sleeping that way round,” says Sarah from Lincolnshire. “I have no idea why it works, and sometimes I wake up feeling a bit disorientated, as windows and doors aren’t where they should be, but I’ve generally dropped off to sleep quite quickly.”Don’t toss and turn – have a change of sceneLikewise, if you are lying awake for more than 20 minutes (roughly speaking, no peeking at the clock), “it is a good idea to get out of bed and go and do something else for a while to help your brain and body reset”, says Browning. She suggests reading a book, doing some colouring or even (quietly) unloading the dishwasher before returning to bed when you feel sleepy again.By having a break from trying to force yourself to sleep, you should find it easier to sleep when you get back into bed again, as you’ve had some time away from lying there feeling frustrated and anxious.” Wait until you feel genuinely sleepy, says Mahmoudzadeh, when “your eyes are getting heavy and maybe your head is starting to nod, and at that point only, go back to bed and try to sleep. If you fall asleep, great; if not, repeat.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The GuardianDon’t get up in the night to eatSheri DeWeerd from Wisconsin says she “eats a little bit of protein, which has the magical ability to quiet my mind”. However, getting up for a snack isn’t generally advised. “The main concern with eating in the middle of the night is that your body is designed to rest during this time, not to digest food,” says Schaedel.“Over time, it may become a habit – your body starts to expect food, which can then perpetuate the cycle of waking.”“It’s a much better idea, if you are waking in the middle of the night feeling hungry, to have a snack before going to bed.” says Browning. This way, you are less likely to wake up hungry. Ideal pre-bedtime snacks would be a bowl of porridge with milk, as whole rolled oats provide slow-release energy during the night and milk contains tryptophan, which we use to create melatonin [a sleep-inducing hormone]. A brown bread turkey, smoked salmon or peanut butter sandwich would also be a good choice.”Don’t feel bad about sleeping in a separate bed to your partnerFor some, it is a snoring or bed-hogging partner that hinders efforts to sleep. “Often, the reason I’m awake is my husband’s snoring,” says Kavita from Hove in East Sussex, adding that earplugs have helped. If this doesn’t do the trick, sleep separately, says Foster. “It is no great indictment of your relationship. So many people say, ‘I couldn’t possibly sleep in a separate room, it would be the end of our marriage.’ Of course it wouldn’t. It is the beginning of a new phase of one’s marriage, because you’ll be happier, brighter, have a better sense of humour, be less irritable, and therefore have more fun. Just get the sleep you need.”Doconsider how your dayaffects the night“Healthy daytime habits set the foundation for better sleep at night, reducing the likelihood of unwanted awakenings,” says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author ofWhy We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams. Walker emphasises the importance of limiting caffeine and alcohol in the afternoon and evening, and finishing dinner a few hours before bed.“Another key strategy is to support your circadian rhythm: keep a consistent sleep schedule and get some bright light in the morning. Stay physically active – regular exercise is associated with deeper, more continuous sleep (just avoid intense workouts right before bedtime). If you nap, do it early and briefly, or consider skipping it if you suspect it’s interfering with your night sleep. Finally, managing stress through the day and unwinding in the evening can help. Techniques such as relaxation exercises or a soothing pre-sleep routine will make it easier for your body to stay asleep.”Don’t drink too much in the eveningAside from alcohol and caffeine, you should be careful not to drink too much in the evening, experts say, as needing to urinate can impact on wake-ups. “It is really important to try to reduce your fluids in the evenings, if you’re the kind of person who needs to get up and wee in the night,” says Schaedel. “Don’t have too much to drink for a few hours before you go to bed.”Foster adds: “Obviously, it’s a balance between being hydrated and drinking too much, which will mean needing the toilet.”Don’t sleep in“Morning daylight and regular wake times help your body clock promote solid sleep at night,” adds Walker, which means limiting weekend lie-ins, even if you feel desperately in need of catching up.Don’t be afraid to give upFoster rejects the “magical eight hours” obsession and says a good night can be anything from 6-10 hours, as sleep is often biphasic: “Waking up in the middle of the night is not necessarily the end of sleep.”“Sometimes, insomnia is more powerful than all the tips in the world,” says Margery Diamand from East Sussex, who describes herself as a lifelong insomniac. “Get up or stay in bed and do something nice, like watching a cheesy TV show or eating cereal. If you’re going to be awake, you might as well enjoy yourself.”Some names have been changedExplore more on these topicsSleepHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And that’s unfortunate, but I think people have seen that I’m back in business and back out there,” she said.“I went to prime minister’s questions because I thought that was the right thing to do, because that’s where I always am at lunchtime on a Wednesday. You know, in retrospect, I probably wished I hadn’t gone in … [on] a tough day in the office. But, you know, it is what it is. But I think most people can relate to that – that they’ve had tough days.”Her challenging moment in parliament came in the same week that a backbench rebellion forced the government todrop key welfare cuts, which leaves Reeves with a £5bn black hole to fill in the country’s finances.“It’s been damaging,” she admitted. “I’m not going to deny that, but I think where we are now, with a review led by Stephen Timms [a work and pensions minister], who is obviously incredibly respected and has a huge amount of experience, that’s the route we’re taking now.“That’s the right thing to do. It is important that we listen in government, that we listen to our colleagues and listen to what groups outside are saying as well.”Timms is working with disability groups to reform the personal independent payments (Pip) system, which had been the target of government cuts until the huge backbench rebellion drove the government to drop them.Reeves said the government had learned lessons about bringing MPs and the country along with them in the run-up to what is widely expected to be a difficult budget this autumn ahead.“As we move into the budget for the autumn, I do want to bring people into those trade-offs,” she said.View image in fullscreen‘We do need to make sure that we’re telling a story, and a Labour story.’Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAsked whether she was prepared to rule out tax rises, she said: “I’m not going to, because it would be irresponsible for a chancellor to do that. We took the decisions last year to draw a line under unfunded commitments and economic mismanagement. So we’ll never have to do something like that again. But there are costs to what happened.”While tax rises could be on the table, Reeves signalled that her fiscal rules would remain and that “we’ll continue to keep that grip on the public finances”. But she stressed the need to accompany this with a strong explanation of how the Treasury’s choices fit with Labour values.“I’m not going to apologise for making sure the numbers add up,” she said. “But we do need to make sure that we’re telling a story, and a Labour story. We did that well in the budget and the spending review, we increased taxes on the wealthiest and businesses. In the budget last year, I made it really clear that priorities in that budget were to protect working people, to invest in the NHS and to start rebuilding Britain.”Some within government and the Labour party have been pushing for either a reconsideration of the fiscal rules or rethinking the remit of the Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces two forecasts and rulings a year on whether the rules have been met.How to balance the UK books: six options open to Rachel ReevesRead moreAsked whether she would consider one forecast instead of two, Reeves said: “We are looking at how the OBR works, but I think it is really important to have those independent economic institutions, because if you start undermining those … and getting rid of the checks and balances on a government, I do think that is risky. But the International Monetary Fund have made some recommendations about how to deliver better fiscal policymaking. And obviously I take those seriously.”The IMF has suggested that while the OBR could still produce two forecasts, it could be possible to only have one annual assessment of whether the chancellor is hitting her fiscal rules. However, government sources suggested that any changes could be more along the lines of more regular exchange of information to reduce last-minute changes like those in thespring statement.Reeves also spoke of her drive to reduce child poverty but she would not be drawn on whether she would lift the two-child benefit cap. Keir Starmer has said the government “will look at it” but experts have warned it could be more difficult given the hole left by the U-turn on the welfare cuts.The chancellor said she wanted to reduce child poverty but was “not wedded to any specific policy”, adding: “I think people can see how serious I am about making sure that all kids get a good start in life by what we did in the spending review just a few weeks ago.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesLabourEconomic policyWelfareTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

Ammori said: “The home secretary is rushing through the implementation of the proscription at midnight tonight despite the fact that our legal challenge is ongoing and that she has been completely unclear about how it will be enforced, leaving the public in the dark about their rights to free speech and expression after midnight tonight when this proscription comes into effect.”Chamberlain said: “I have concluded that the harm which would ensue if interim relief is refused but the claim later succeeds is insufficient to outweigh the strong public interest in maintaining the order in force.”Ammori sought permission to appeal against Chamberlain’s decision in an 8pm hearing that lasted approximately one hour at the court of appeal on Friday night, in an attempt to prevent the ban coming into force. But at about 10.25pm – less than two hours before it was due to take effect – the three judges, led by the lady chief justice, Sue Carr, refused permission.It means Palestine Action will become the first direct action protest group to be banned under the Terrorism Act, placing it in the same category as Islamic State, al-Qaida and the far-right group National Action.Raza Husain KC, representing Ammori, described the proscription decision in the hearing before Chamberlain, as “an ill-considered, discriminatory and authoritarian abuse of statutory power”. He said it was “absurd” to label a civil disobedience direct action protest group that does not advocate violence as a terrorist organisation.“The main target has been stopping Elbit Systems … which markets itself as the backbone of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” said Husain. “As my client says: ‘The aim of terrorism is to take lives and hurt people, that’s the opposite of what we do.’”He said before making the decision thegovernment had engaged with the Israeli government, Elbit Systemsandpro-Israeli lobby groups, while Palestine Action and other pro-Palestine groups were not consulted.Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC, also representing Ammori, said what was going on inGazawas “an annihilation, it is a genocide” and Palestine Action was “seeking to disrupt and prevent” UK complicity in it.Ben Watson KC, representing the home secretary, focused on the proscription procedure in his submissions. “All of these issues, all of that evidence is supposed to go to the secretaries of state… it’s only after that process, after the secretary of state has had a chance to consider … then the matter goes before Poac [the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission].”He said only then could the case go to the court of appeal and then, potentially, the supreme court.Watson said Palestine Action’s activities met the statutory test for proscription and that if the ban took effect but the group subsequently won a judicial review against proscription it would not cause “irreparable harm” to it.He told the court that if a temporary block was granted, it would be a “serious disfigurement of the statutory regime”.The protest group Defend Our Jurieswrote to the Met police commissioner, Mark Rowley, on Friday to tell him that it “may be committing offences under the Terrorism Act” in Parliament Square from 1pm on Saturday. It said non-violent protesters would hold signs saying: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” The letter said that they “refuse to be bystanders to what’s happening to the people of Palestine, who are bombed, starved and gunned down as they queue for food”.Several hundred protesters gathered, waving Palestinian flags and carrying signs saying “Free Palestine” and “We are all Palestine Action” outside the Royal Courts of Justice.UN experts, civil liberties groups,cultural figuresandhundreds of lawyershave condemned the ban as draconian and said it sets a dangerous precedent by conflating protest with terrorism.Another hearing is scheduled for 21 July when Palestine Action will apply for permission for a judicial review to quash the order. In the meantime, and unless the judicial review is successful, membership of, or inviting support for, the group will carry a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.Explore more on these topicsCounter-terrorism policyUK security and counter-terrorismProtestGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas is fully prepared, with all seriousness, to immediately enter a new round of negotiations on the mechanism for implementing this framework.”Israeli media reported that Israel had received Hamas’s response and it was being examined.Earlier a source told the Guardian that Hamas leaders were close to accepting a proposed deal for a ceasefire in Gaza but want stronger guarantees that any pause in hostilities would lead to a permanent end to the 20-month war.The militant Islamist group has come under immense pressure in recent months, with its military leadership decimated and the Israeli military forcing its fighters out of former strongholds in the southern and central parts of Gaza.In recent days, Israel hasramped up its offensive, launching an intense wave of airstrikes across Gaza, killing more than 250 Palestinians, including many women and children, according to medical and civil defence officials.Hardline factions within Hamas had reluctantly accepted the need for a ceasefire to allow the organisation to regroup and plan a new strategy, one source familiar with the internal debate said.Since aprevious ceasefire collapsed in March, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Gaza and an acute humanitarian crisis has worsened.Efforts for a new truce in Gaza gathered momentum after the US secured a ceasefire to end the12-day conflict between Israel and Iranlast month.On Tuesday, Trump announced thatIsrael had accepted the conditionsneeded to finalise a 60-day ceasefire, during which the parties would work to end the war. When asked on Thursday if Hamas had agreed to the latest ceasefire deal framework, he said: “We’ll see what happens. We are going to know over the next 24 hours.”Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with Trump about the war in Gaza, the recent war between Israel and Iran, and other regional issues.The Israeli prime minister has long resisted a permanent end to the war in Gaza, partly to retain the support of far-right allies in his ruling coalition. But Israel’s successes in the war with Iran have strengthened his political position and opinion polls in Israel show strong support for a deal.Gaza mapA senior Israeli official told Channel 12, a major Israeli TV network: “Judging by the signals from Hamas, there is a high probability that we will start proximity talks in the next few days. If there is consent to proximity talks, there will be a deal.”Other Israeli officials told Reuters preparations were in place to approve the ceasefire deal and that an Israeli delegation was getting ready to join indirect talks brokered by Qatar and Egypt to cement the deal if Hamas responded positively.The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, and the return of the bodies of 18 more, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, an official familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.Hamas seized 251 hostages during the 2023 attack. Less than half of the 50 who remain in Gaza are believed to be alive.Aid would enter Gaza immediately under the agreement, and the Israeli military would carry out a phased withdrawal from parts of the territory, according to the proposal. Negotiations would immediately start on a permanent ceasefire.“We sure hope it’s a done deal, but I think it’s all going to be what Hamas is willing to accept,” Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, told Channel 12 on Thursday. “One thing is clear: the president wants it to be over. The prime minister wants it to be over. The American people, the Israeli people, want it to be over.”The delivery of more aid to Gaza has been a principal demand of Hamas throughout negotiations. Israel imposed an 11-week blockade in March, which was only slightly eased in May under huge international pressure as famine loomed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid at the GHF’s hubs and after gathering in crowds at locations where convoys sent by the UN have been stopped.On Friday,a report by the BBCquoted a former GHF employee describing colleagues firing towards Palestinians who had posed no threat, with many appearing to have been seriously hurt on several occasions.The GHF employee told the BBC he and others had been given no clear rules of engagement or standard operating procedures, and were told by one team leader: “If you feel threatened, shoot – shoot to kill and ask questions later.”The GHF said the allegations, which were also made by former employees quoted by the Associated Press on Thursday, were categorically false and that no civilians had came under fire at their distribution sites. The Israeli military has denied any intent to harm civilians seeking aid, saying it only fired warning shots.Speaking to journalists while on his way to arally in Iowaon Thursday, Trump said: “I want the people of Gaza to be safe. That’s more important than anything else. They’ve gone through hell.”Netanyahu visited Israel’sNir Oz kibbutzon Thursday for the first time since the 2023 Hamas attack. The community was one of the worst-hit in the attack, with nearly one in four residents kidnapped or killed.A ceasefire in Gaza appears to be close.

There are still 20 who are alive and there are also those who are deceased, and we will bring them all back.”The prime minister has been heavily criticised for refusing to take responsibility for the failures that allowed the 2023 attack, during which Hamas-led militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and has been repeatedly accused of prioritising his political survival over the fate of the hostages.View image in fullscreenPeople rallying in Tel Aviv on Thursday to demand the release of all hostages kidnapped by Hamas.Photograph: Shir Torem/ReutersIsrael’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.The Israeli military said it “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm” when striking “terrorist targets”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

However, she said: “There is no single solution to the problem of illegal migration. That’s why we’ve signed landmark agreements with international partners to dismantle gangs and made significant arrests of notorious people smugglers.”Philp said: “It shouldn’t take a visit to an asylum hotel by me as shadow home secretary to shame the government into action. Illegal working by asylum seekers – most of whom also entered the country illegally – is happening from the very hotels Yvette Cooper is using our money to run.“The government could easily stop it. I saw Deliveroo and other bikes parked in the hotel’s own compound - yet all the security guard cared about was me filming.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumGig economynewsShareReuse this content"

Axios reported that a source described the call as a “good conversation”.Russian drone attack on Kyiv injures 14, triggers multiple fires, mayor saysRead moreTrump said he was “very disappointed” after a telephone call withVladimir Putinon Thursday. A Putin aide told reporters that the Russian president was not willing to make concessions on what the Kremlin has called the “root causes” of the war with Ukraine, a list of grievances that includes Nato expansion and Ukraine’s desire to join western economic and security blocs.“I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there,” Trump told reporters after holding a rally in Iowa on Thursday evening. “I don’t think he’s there, and I’m very disappointed. I’m just saying, I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”The US has said that it halted the shipments, some of which were already in Poland, due to a review of US military stockpiles that suggested that the country is running low on munitions for its own troops.Germany has said that it is in “intensive talks” to buy the Patriot missiles forUkraine, although it’s unclear whether those stocks would be available immediately.“There are various ways to fill this Patriot gap,” a German government spokesperson told a news conference in Berlin on Friday.

Not only was Emma Raducanu holding her own againstAryna Sabalenka, she was soaring. More than an hour into one of the most intense matches she has played, Raducanu arrived at set point against the best player in the world.However, Sabalenka, the world No 1, has long grown accustomed to the massive target on her back, which so often spurs her challengers to perform far above their usual levels. In the face of another grand slam champion playing some of her best tennis, Sabalenka elevated her own game to even greater heights in the decisive moments, crushing Raducanu’s hopes of a career-best victory by triumphing 7-6 (6), 6-4 to reach the fourth round atWimbledon.Wimbledon 2025: Sabalenka v Raducanu; Alcaraz, Norrie and Kartal win – liveRead moreAfter failing to convert so many chances on such a significant occasion, Raducanu was understandably emotional afterwards. She held a set point in the opening set before holding a break point for a 5-1 lead in set two. But every time she tried to pull away, Sabalenka raised her level and re-established control.“It does give me confidence because I think the problem before was that I felt like I was gulfs away from the very top,” said Raducanu. “Having a match like that where I had chances in both sets, it does give me confidence. At the same time, it’s very difficult to take right now.”Most of Raducanu’s previous career meetings against the best players in the world had ended in disappointing, one-sided blowouts that exposed her lack of firepower. Here, on grass, a surface that provides her game with more potency, Raducanu rose to the occasion spectacularly at the urging of a thunderous crowd, demonstrating the full capabilities of her well-rounded game, particularly her improved serve, forehand and defensive skills as she pushed Sabalenka for two hours.“I cannot predict anything, but I am definitely sure that, maybe not in a month, but maybe a bit longer period, but she is definitely going to get back into the top 10,” said Sabalenka. “She’s fighting. She’s playing much better. She’s more consistent. I can see that mentally she’s healthy. I think that’s really important. Yeah, I’m pretty sure she’s getting there.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu slips during her third-round match against Aryna Sabalenka and appears for a moment to be injured.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockRaducanu set the tone from the beginning by imposing maximum pressure on her opponent with her forehand aggression, excellent serving and her ability to soak up and deflect Sabalenka’s pace. After losing her early break, Raducanu made an incredible last stand on her serve at 4-5, saving seven set points almost entirely with brilliant serving before closing out an astounding hold. With the momentum behind her, ­Raducanu broke serve to establish a 6-5 lead. But Sabalenka fought back to retrieve the break and force a first set tie-break.At the end of the tie-break, with the crowd’s deafening roars punctuating every winning shot, Raducanu’s brilliant serving and retrieval skills earned her a set point at 6-5. Instead, Sabalenka showed her evolving game and her resilience to turn the set around. After saving Raducanu’s only set point with a delicate drop shot, she swept forward to the net on her eighth set point and closed out an unforgettable 74-minute first set with a drop-volley winner.At the end of such an intense, high quality yet fruitless set of tennis, it would have been reasonable for Raducanu’s intensity to drop. Instead, she kept on going and she soon held a break point for a 5-1 second-set lead. As soon as Raducanu betrayed her nerves, sending an aggressive forehand long on the break point, the world No 1 reeled off the final five games of the match to close out a supreme win.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu showed great resilience in both sets but ultimately lost out to Aryna Sabalenka’s greater power in the key moments.Photograph: Shi Tang/Getty ImagesJust a few weeks after losing control of her emotions during and afterher loss to Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros final, this was also a significant moment for Sabalenka as she maintained her composure in the decisive moments. Her candidacy for a first Wimbledon title has only been strengthened by the mental fortitude she showed in front of a hostile crowd.“Sometimes my ears were, like, really blocked from how loud it was, but I really enjoyed it,” said Sabalenka, smiling. “I was trying to trick my brain, and I was pretending that people were cheering for me. Sometimes when they were screaming ‘Emma’, it sounded like ‘Aryna’.”Even in defeat, this performance represents a significant step forward for Raducanu after an extremely difficult four years. Her level is a reflection of her consistent daily work she has put together over the past few months and the clear progress she has made with her game. She has shown that she is capable of making life difficult for the best players in the world. The next step is beating them.“First thing I did, I had a KitKat in the changing rooms,” said Raducanu. “Then, I don’t know, I’ll probably find it tough to sleep tonight, or I’ll be so exhausted and crash, but I don’t know. It’s going to take me a few days to process that. But at the same time it really motivates me.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuAryna SabalenkaWimbledonTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I’ve today issued instructions for them all to be removed from the children’s section of any of our libraries.“They do not belong in the children’s section of our libraries. Our children do not need to be told they were born in the wrong body.

At this point, we don’t know where they all came from,” he said.He said Donald Trump had been informed of the situation and responded: “Whatever we need, we can have.”The region was inundated when five to 10in of rain fell overnight as part of an intense, slow-moving storm across Kerr and Kendall counties. The runoff from parched land caused the Guadalupe River to crest at one of its highest-ever peaks, with water levels in Kerrville rising more than 22ft in just a few hours overnight.Teams have conducted dozens of rescues as the emergency response continued and an unknown number of people remained unaccounted for. The state senator Pete Flores said: “We are in search-and-rescue mode, and we know that these first 24 hours are very important.”More rain is expected in the state, including around Waco, and flooding is anticipated downriver from Kerr county.Dalton Rice, city manager for Kerrville, the county seat, told reporters the extreme flooding struck with little to no advance warning, precluding authorities from issuing any evacuation orders.“This happened very quickly, over a very short period of time, that could not be predicted, even with the radar,” Rice said. “This happened within less than a two-hour span.”Of particular concern aremore than a dozen summer campsdotted in the rural region that would now be filled with kids.The Texas Hill Country, a scenic and rocky gateway to booming vineyards and vacation rentals, begins west of the state capital and is a popular outdoor summer getaway. Parts of the region are prone to flash flooding.View image in fullscreenWater rises from severe flooding along the Guadalupe River in Kerr county, Texas, on Friday.Photograph: APDozens of people posted on Facebook asking for any information about their children, nieces and nephews attending one of the many camps in the area, or family members who had gone camping during the holiday weekend.The Ingram fire department posted a photo of a statement from Camp Mystic, saying the camp experienced “catastrophic level floods”. Parents with a daughter not accounted for had been directly contacted, the camp said.“We are working with search and rescue currently,” the camp said in its communication. “The highway has washed away so we are struggling to get more help. Please continue to pray and send any help if you have contacts to do so.”Authorities have urged people to exercise caution and avoid driving on water-covered roads as the extreme conditions continue. “Conditions are life-threatening! DO NOT go out onto the roads,” the National Weather Service inSan Angelourged on Friday morning. “Expect roads washed out andrapid riseson rivers and creeks.”The sheriff’s office added that “the entire county is an extremely active scene. Residents are encouraged to shelter in place and not attempt travel. Those near creeks, streams, and the Guadalupe River should immediately move to higher ground.”The rains come after a long drought in the region that has left the soil bone-dry, increasing the chances of runoff leading to flash flooding.Erin Burgess, a resident of the Bumble Bee Hills neighborhood west of Ingram, recounted her harrowing survival ordeal to the Associated Press. She said she woke up to thunder at 3.30am Friday morning, and “it was raining pretty heavy, but no big deal”.Just 20 minutes later, Burgess said, water was coming in through the walls and rushing through the front and back doors. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough that she was able to walk up the hill to a neighbor’s.“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said.Of her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: “Thankfully he’s over 6ft tall. That’s the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him.”The rains in central Texas are expected to continue until later Friday.Strong storms are also being blamed for at least three deaths in central New Jersey, including two men in Plainfield who died after a tree fell on to a vehicle they were traveling in during the height of the storm,according to a city Facebook post. The men were aged 79 and 25, officials said. They were not immediately publicly identified. Fourth of July celebrations were cancelled, the city said, “out of good conscience”.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTexasFloodingNew JerseyExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The former local government worker has felt summers get hotter over her lifetime and says she “couldn’t stand” such high heat herself.But like many who experienced Europe’s first heatwave of the summer, Julie does not sound overly alarmed. She worries about climate breakdown for young people, but is not concerned about herself. She thinks more climate action would be nice, but does not know what can be done about it. She does not have much faith in the government.“It’s like everything else,” she says. “I think it’s all too little, too late.”As heatwaves engulfed large swathes of Europe and North America last week – the latest in a stream of deadly extremes made worse by fossil fuel pollution – green groups are frustrated that increasingly violent weather has not spurred the urgent support for climate action they had expected.Governments across the rich world continue to roll back policies to stop the planet from heating, while far-right parties that deny climate science lash out at environment rules even as disasters unfold. Their voters, while rarely climate deniers themselves, seem to tolerate their energetic attacks on environmental policy, if not support them.The views of someone like Julie – who declined to reveal her voting preference – sounded similar to what was seen across the country, said Ed Hodgson, an analyst at the research group More in Common who has run focus groups on climate action.View image in fullscreenSpectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London try to cool down on Tuesday.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersPolls taken over the second-last weekend of June show most people in the UK found the previous week of weather too hot, are worried it will get hotter, and hold the climate crisis at least partly responsible. But the nonprofit also found the share of people concerned about climate change has fallen over the past year, dipping from 68% to 60%. Support for the UK’s target to hit net zero emissions by 2050 fell even further, plunging from 62% to 46%.“The issue is really that there are so many other concerns now,” said Hodgson, citing the organisation’s data tracking the top issues that people face each week. “Three years ago you’d have the cost of living first, then the National Health Service, and then immigration and climate – those two would compete for third place. Now, when we do those polls, climate is near the bottom of the list.”The contradictions are visible in towns such as Stanford-le-Hope, where Julie lives, which is among the few already represented in parliament by the rightwing populist Reform UK. AYouGov polllast month found just over half of Reform voters wanted a heatwave in the coming weeks.The party, which has promised to scrap the net zero target and “unlock Britain’s vast oil and gas reserves”, is projected to win eight of the 10 most flood-prone constituencies at the next general election, according toan analysis in Mayby the NGO Global Witness and Round Our Way, a campaign group.Far-right parties across mainland Europe have been even more vocal in using the heatwave to take aim at climate policy, even as blazing wildfires force thousands to flee their homes and doctors warn of widespread excess deaths.View image in fullscreenFirefighters battle flames during wildfires on the Greek island of Crete on Friday.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockIn Spain, where the current heatwave brought a record June temperature of 46C, the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, mocked a government promise to regulate fear-based advertising by asking if they were also going to “ban the propaganda of climate religion”. InItaly, which has limited outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day in most of the country, the Lega party MP Claudio Borghi said: “Climate change has always existed, the causes are anything but clear, and the solutions are contrary to what … is correct.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The post took a swipe at the World Economic Forum, the German public broadcaster and the Green party.The biggest political row over the heat erupted in France, where the National Rally figurehead, Marine Le Pen, called for a “major” air conditioning plan – one week after the party failed in its parliamentary push to halt new wind and solar projects. In an opinion article inLe Figaroon Thursday, the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, a conservative, called to stop support for renewable energy and expand France’s nuclear energy sector.View image in fullscreenYoung girls pour water on their heads as temperatures exceed 40C in Berlin.Photograph: Maryam Majd/Getty ImagesThe proposal earned rebukes from the ecology minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who described it as “petty politics” that would write Algeria a check for oil, and the former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who called it an “incomprehensible” misstep. “As we endure several days of an unprecedented heatwave, we are witnessing a troubling resurgence of anti-science scepticism,” he said.Some far-right parties have focused their attention on old-school climate denial, while others have moved from questioning the science to aggressively campaigning against solutions.Support for net zero has fallen faster than concerns about the climate crisis“I don’t think the extreme heat is being weaponised, but the efforts to limit it certainly are,” said Ciarán Cuffe, a co-chair of the European Green party and former Irish environment minister. He added that Le Pen’s call for more air conditioning – which he said should be one solution among many – may even represent a shift in strategy. “It’s a recognition that these heatwaves are happening, and that they are extreme.”The paradox is that far-right parties bashing green rules are polling well above 20% in several European countries, even though the share of people who deny climate science is typically in single digits. In the UK, pollsters find just 6% of Reform voters list environmental policy as a reason for voting for the party, according to More in Common.That said, the level of threat perception among their voters is much higher than in other parties, said Hodgson. “They see threats around them and think we need a strong response. So it makes sense for politicians to campaign around those moments.”View image in fullscreenA man cools off in a fountain in Valencia, Spain.Photograph: Manuel Bruque/EPAClimate campaigners have argued that the far right’s success in dominating the climate narrative is weakening support for action and providing centrist parties cover to scrap green policies, even if it has failed to create a widespread backlash against green policy.“The far right has a strategy but everyone else doesn’t,” said Luisa Neubauer, a German activist from Fridays for Future, which staged its first night-time protest against climate inaction outside the German economy ministry on Wednesday, as a result of the high heat.Too many people in power or with platforms “have not yet understood that we’re in a war of language – and a war of the truth – about the climate”, she added. “And too few of us are actively standing in the way of that.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisExtreme weatherClimate science scepticism and denialGreen politicsFranceGermanySpainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a rollercoaster week in which the prime minister suffered a large Commons rebellion and caused bond markets to spike when he appeared not to back the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, we consider his government’s record in Westminster, Whitehall and across the country.What do voters think?In the first year since the general election, Labour’s stock with the electorate, as measured by opinion polls, has fallen considerably. After a honeymoon period, during which few polls were conducted, the party’s polling has steadily declined. Then came a very strong Reform performance in the 1 May elections, in which Nigel Farage’s party took more than 600 council seats, and won a mayoralty and a byelection. Since then, Reform has continued to rise in the polls, whileLabourhas languished.PollsWhat has Labour been doing in Westminster?The most high-profile piece of legislation in this parliament so far has probably been the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, but that was not a manifesto commitment and was put forward as a private member’s bill, without party whipping. The government has laid 28 bills in this session of parliament. Many of its pledges rely in part on passing this tranche of legislation: the commitment to reduce the number of people arriving in small boats is targeted, along with stronger sentences for people smugglers, in the asylum bill, and the promise of more housing is bound up in an overhaul of planning rules.The table below shows all the government bills in this session. To become law, proposed legislation has to pass three readings in both houses of parliament. There are numerous stages at which amendments may be made and voted upon, chiefly between the second and third readings, during the committee stage. When a bill has passed through a third reading in both houses it is returned to the Commons (where it started) for any amendments made by the Lords to be considered. If MPs do not accept amendments made by peers, or vice versa, the bill can “ping-pong” between the houses until consensus on the exact wording is reached. After that, the bill receives “royal assent” and becomes law.What do the markets think?After Starmer failed to voice strong support for Reeves at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, yields – in effect the interest rate – on UK bonds rose sharply, which was interpreted as concern in the markets that the chancellor might not stay in the job, and the government’s record for financial discipline would be undermined. This was all the more surprising since the markets had barely reacted the previous day when the welfare bill was amended to substantially reduce its financial impact. Over the past year, the bond markets’ response to Labour’s administration has been fairly stable, although it is also true that they are lending to this government at higher interest rates than they did to Rishi Sunak’s. And despite a heated afternoon on Wednesday, there has not been a repeat of the wild swings of Liz Truss’s and Kwasi Kwarteng’s brief time in Downing Street.BondsIs Labour balancing the books?The attitude of the bond markets is possibly explained by the struggle led by Reeves to retain a grip on the national finances. With greater spending on public sector wages, and uncertainty about improved tax receipts from growth, the government has so far struggled to keep the lid on. Whether it can continue, especially after the savings expected from the universal credit bill were slashed by this week’s rebellion, and without raising taxes, remains to be seen.Public financesWhat about immigration and asylum?The picture here is mixed; overall international migration is down, and the government is having some success at continuing an effort under the last Tory administration to reduce the backlog in asylum applications.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the interim, it has signed off improved pay for NHS staff and abolished NHS England, which ran the service in England. But at a day-to-day level, the health service seems to be continuing a trend of slight improvement that began under Sunak.Graph of NHS waiting times from 2005-25What is it doing to help the poorest?The government is under pressure from campaigners and its own MPs not to balance the books at the expense of Britain’s most vulnerable people. It has postponed itschild poverty strategyand just this week narrowly saw off defeat on its universal credit bill. But as the Resolution Foundation thinktank has pointed out, child poverty is rising while the government prevaricates, and abolishing the two-child benefit cap would greatly reduce the number of children living in poverty.Line graph of proportion of children and pensioners living in relative povertyExplore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesEconomic policyPovertyImmigration and asylumHealth policyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Rock ’n’ Roll Star was on a compilation tape on the ill-fated US tour when we broke up. We’d had a punch-up on stage at the House of Blues in Los Angeles and back in my hotel room we were hanging around with a bunch of druggies. I was thinking “Where did it all go wrong?” when this song came on. I knew I’d remember that moment for the rest of my life. To me, Rock ’n’ Roll Star is like Johnny Rotten singing with Slade. It’s punk rock, but in 1994. I love the self-belief: Noel [Gallagher] wrote it before he was a rock’n’roll star but knew it was gonna happen. The difference between the Mary Chain andOasisis that when we reformed we’d buried the hatchet a good few years before we got back together. I’m not sure if they have, but it used to amaze people how William [Reid] and I could be screaming with hatred at each other in the studio, then 10 minutes later it would be: “Do you want a cup of tea?”Johnny Marr: The Hindu TimesIt may come as a surprise to people that I’ve chosen this song, but I think it’s a great example of Oasis doing the thing they do so well. Even though the chorus hook is “And I get so high I just can’t feel it” – a classic Oasis line that only Noel could come up with and Liam could pull off – the melodic hook that makes it so definitive is the bit that follows: “In and out my brain / Running through my vein / You’re my sunshine, you’re my rain.” A “post-chorus chorus” is something that Noel does often and I’ve never heard in other people’s songs. When they recorded The Hindu Times in Olympic Studios, I told Noel it was really good and he kind of shrugged. The next thing, it was No 1. At about the same time I watched from the side of the stage as they played it at the Manchester Apollo. I couldn’t work out if what I was seeing was a band totally at one with their audience or so elevated that they were on another plane. It was both, and I thought to myself, “This is what rock’n’roll means.”Amy Macdonald: AcquiesceI’m not proud of this, but I broke the news of the Oasis split. I was on the same bill as them in Paris [in 2009] and being young and naiveI took it on myself to tell my Twitter followerswhat had happened [“Oasis cancelled again with one minute to stage time! Liam smashed Noel’s guitar, huuuge fight”]. By the time we got to the hotel it was headline news all over the world. My brother and his friends had spent all their money to come over to see them and were devastated. It felt like the end of an era. When I’d started going out with my sisters, pretending I was 18, I’d heard Acquiesce in an indie club called the Attic [in Glasgow] and I’ve listened to it ever since. When I hear it now, I always picture a massive crowd singing the words back at the band: it captures that feeling of being at a concert and everyone feeling united.Jon McClure, Reverend and the Makers: Rockin’ ChairOasis started everything for me. Two brothers of Irish origin scrap like fuck: that was me and my brother. A few years later me and Chris [brother] ended up having a scrap in their dressing room at Wembley in front of Noel and Kate Moss and all these A-listers. It was as if life had gone full circle. The other side of Oasis that people miss is the quiet, sad, loner aspect to Noel’s writing. It’s in Talk Tonight, Going Nowhere, Underneath the Sky, Half the World Away … and Rockin’ Chair is probably the best example. “I’m older than I wish to be / This town holds no more for me” is Noel, in his bedroom, hating where he’s living and fed up with his life. I totally get that and when Noel gets in that mood he’s one of the best songwriters ever. The reunion feels like your mam and dad getting back together. People have moaned about dynamic pricing and such, but in very divisive times they’re gonna make millions of people very happy.Jehnny Beth: Live ForeverLive Forever sounds so at odds with it’s time: 1994. I find it incredible that someone could wrap a “fuck you” inside a song so openly positive. In the wreckage left behind by Thatcher’s Britain and the shadow of Kurt Cobain’s pain, Noel wrote an insolent, unapologetic love letter of self-belief from a place of nothing to lose, against a generation of moaners who have everything and still find reasons to complain. The song is written to step over the corpses of the past, unearthing the flag of romance others have tried to bury. It’s a lesson in (working) class. The kind of optimism they summon is believable because it’s not polished or corporate. It’s radical. They’re not promising a future, they’re daring you to want one.Devendra Banhart: AcquiesceAcquiesce features Liam and Noel singing, which is unusual, but for me this song almost reads like a Bhajan – a [Hindu] devotional song – or a Khajana, where the lyric will be sung and the audience will sing it back. “I don’t know what it is that makes me feel alive / I don’t know how to wake the things that sleep inside / I only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes” … that’s deep and questioning. Then the chorus: “Because we need each other / We believe in one another / And I know we’re going to uncover / What’s sleeping in our soul.” Even aged 13 I realised that what was being communicated was similar to the mystical and devotional poetry that I was surrounded by growing up [in Venezuela] with parents who were yogis. Oasis have been pigeonholed as working-class lads, but they sing about a deep spiritual longing, very similar to what was in those ancient books.Michael Head: Don’t Look Back in AngerI said hello to Noel in passing when he was working as a roadie for Inspiral Carpets, but then when I heard Oasis’s music it just blew me away. When I was young, we had a transistor radio that all the hits came out of: the Beatles, the Stones and so on. Years later I was standing in a garage near my mum’s when Don’t Look Back in Anger came on their little radio and stopped me dead in my tracks like when I was a kid. Noel sort of reversed the David Bowie song, Look Back in Anger, to say “look forward”. I love that attitude.Badly Drawn Boy: SupersonicMy brother Simon – who passed away in 2021 – was a massive influence on me and I remember us seeing a picture of Liam in the 90s and thinking “Who’s that guy?” Soon afterwards, Oasis changed the landscape of Manchester. Suddenly every night there were lads on stage trying to be the next Oasis. When I stood on the balcony at the Hacienda for the launch of Definitely Maybe, I thought Liam caught my eye. In fact, he was looking up at [the Lemonheads’] Evan Dando, who was standing next to me, but I’d always come away from Oasis gigs feeling I could do something with my life. Supersonic is about that: “I need to be myself / I can’t be no one else …” The line “I’m feeling supersonic / Give me gin and tonic” epitomises the swagger they had. When I was in London recording my debut album, Liam swaggered into the Met Bar. It was the first time we’d met, but we ended up in a room with 10 lads on a stag do playing guitars and singing songs. There was a panic at the time because Liam had gone “missing”, but all the time he was with me.Luke Pritchard, the Kooks: She’s ElectricWhen my dad died, he left me his Les Paul guitar. Noel played one, too, and when I was 15 I got it out from under Mum’s bed, took it to school and learned Roll With It. Oasis were my gateway into rock’n’roll, and lately the Kooks have covered She’s Electric. The lyrics are like a conversation with a friend but through the medium of this beautiful, transportive song, sung with such meaning. We’ve supported Noel and Liam separately and I don’t think I’ve been as nervous in my life. When something’s that deeply embedded, you become the teenager again.Fran Healy, Travis: Digsy’s DinnerWhen I was at art school in Glasgow everything appealed to me about Oasis – working-class guys who’d got signed after a gig in King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut – and once I heard Live Forever I was deeply in love with them. Then suddenly we were touring and spending a lot of time with them. On stage, Liam was very “don’t you fuck with me”, but off stage he was a lovely guy. That thousand-yard stare on stage is a cover for doing one of the most vulnerable things a person can do: getting up there and singing. Digsy’s Dinner is Oasis at their most unvarnished. It’s aspirational: he’s singing about being in a bad situation but “What a life it could be / If you could come to mine for tea … We’ll have lasagne”. The simple beauty of that speaks to me, and I love the way the melody explodes when it gets to “These could be the best days of our lives”. It’s an odd song and the runt of the Definitely Maybe litter for some people, but for me it’s got everything.Snail Mail (Lindsey Erin Jordan): Stand By MeStand By Me is the first Oasis song I became obsessed with. It still gives me full body chills listening to it. All the pieces just seem to fit together perfectly and simply, but it takes so much skill to be able to do that. I never knew that the opening line, “Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday”, was about Noel giving himself food poisoning [after his mother told him to “cook yourself a proper Sunday dinner” when he moved to London] but melodically the song changed my life. Their songs are so well done that they kinda sneak into your head. Even now when I’m writing songs I think: “Oh, is that a touch of Oasis?” I find them impossible not to borrow from in some way.Pierce Callaghan, Gurriers: Slide AwayMy dad had an Oasis live CD in the car when I was 13 and from then on they were my favourite band: massive melodies and a real drive to the songs. Gurriers – a Dublin word for “unruly young men” – fits with how rough and ready Oasis were at the time, like the story about them getting arrested on the ferry [to the Netherlands] for fighting. Definitely Maybe is full of attitude, but Slide Away has always made me emotional. The whole feeling is wanting to connect with someone, and if it’s just us against the world we’ll figure it out … but once you realise it’s written in the context of a break up [Noel and first fiancee Louise Jones] it’s gut-wrenching. There’s a bit in the Oasis: Supersonic documentary about a woman and her brother who spent the weekend watching them at Knebworth and singing along together, then he died a few months later. That’s always stuck with me: how so many of our relationships with friends or family are bound up by music.Liam and Noel Gallagher (right) in 1994.Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty ImagesTotal Tommy (Jess Holt): Champagne SupernovaChampagne Supernova was one of the first things I learned to play on guitar. It’s a masterpiece in the way it’s put together: a classic structure, then another part and then another, like a double bridge. Lyrically, it’s reflective and then has that almost tongue-in-cheek “Someday you will find me beneath a champagne supernova …” bit. It’s just beautiful.Juliette Jackson, The Big Moon: WonderwallOasis songs always sound as if they have been written in minutes but are like everything you’ve ever heard and loved before, mixed together. I’ve no idea what a Wonderwall is, but for me this song has soundtracked iconic arms-round-shoulders moments at the end of family weddings and school discos. It sums up that universal experience we have with music, and taught a generation (including myself) how to play guitar and that songs can be basic and instinctive and still feel huge and meaningful. Every guitarist will have a relationship to the opening chords of Wonderwall – whether they love it or hate it, they will know how to play it.Luke Spiller, the Struts: Roll With ItWhen I was 18 or 19, I was a cleaner at a rest home and would roam around with headphones on, soaking up the first three Oasis albums. When Adam [Slack, guitar] and I started playing we used to do Acquiesce, Rock ’n’ Roll Star and Cigarettes & Alcohol, which we’ve played in the Struts many times. Roll With It is my quintessential go-to Oasis song. Lyrically and sonically it encapsulates what they’re about. It starts off quietly then hits you with this Chieftain tank of a groove. This was the song in the infamous chart battle with Blur’s Country House and kinda says “You’re either with us or against us”. They lost the battle [Roll With It reached No 2] but won the war in terms of subsequent popularity. To me, the way they chose Roll With It knowing they had Wonderwall or Don’t Look Back in Anger in the locker is incredibly brave and brilliantly cocky.Oasis’s greatest songs – ranked!Read morePrincess Superstar: Champagne SupernovaIn the 90s, New York was a melting pot of music and, however unlikely it may seem, Britpop felt like an intense wave that reached the city. Even in the hip-hop scene we were obsessed with Oasis. Two gorgeous brothers, quintessentially British, punching each other – and they made amazing pop music. What’s not to love? To me they felt like a new version of the Beatles, Stones and Led Zeppelin albums my dad used to play, but filtered through the rich history of Manchester music such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. Champagne Supernova just makes me feel good inside in ways I can’t explain. I don’t get high now, but back then we loved to sing “Where were you when we were getting high?” as we were doing just that.Sonya Aurora Madan, Echobelly: Rock ’n’ Roll StarWe went to France with Oasis when we were both starting off, which was pretty wild. They were at the centre of a media storm and made sure they lived up to it, although they were really nice guys. In 1994, Echobelly and Oasis were playing New York clubs and went to each other’s gigs. I remember standing right at the front when Liam smiled at me, and Rock ’n’ Roll Star just epitomises the energy of that moment, and those times.

As well as the glory of victory, they might earn an enviable cash prize, a lucrative record deal or a life-changing career boost. But what about those who finish last? Are they philosophical in defeat or throwing tantrums behind the scenes? We tracked down five TV losers to relive their failure in front of millions, reveal how they recovered from humiliation and share what they learned.‘I should have been more vulnerable, maybe cried’Communication scientist Yin Lü was “murdered” in the opening episode ofthe third series ofThe TraitorsUK.I applied forThe Traitorsbecause it’s a show about communication and social dynamics. That’s my obsession, so it was like the perfect experiment. I took 51kg of luggage. One of my strategies was to utilise my wardrobe. I had jumpers with hearts on, tops with big bows and cute hair accessories for a softer look. I wanted to come across as whimsical to make myself less threatening. I decided not to mention my job and said I worked in marketing.I’d chatted to the sisters, Armani and Maia, on the steam train. With hindsight, I was too high-energy and articulate, which marked my card as a potential threat. When Armani was selected as a Traitor, she became the driving force behind my murder. Summoned to the yellow sofa room, I delayed picking up the murder note for as long as possible and read it slowly. As the words percolated, my heart fell out of my chest. It was very visceral. We were all warned we could be first out and to be prepared. But after you’ve met people and bonded, it’s different.View image in fullscreenMurder capital … Yin Lü (far left) and the 2025 cast of The Traitors.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PAI’m sad I didn’t get to experience a breakfast or a Round Table. It felt as if I’d only had a tiny taster of an extravagant 12-course meal. It was gut-wrenching to watch the series after I was booted off. The missions were brilliant. I would’ve loved to topple that giant Traitor statue. I should’ve been less confident, maybe shown some vulnerability by crying. I also wish I’d volunteered to get off the train. I would’ve loved to descend in a cage and talk my way back into the castle! Rhetoric is my speciality.Millions watched my murder on New Year’s Day. My friends and family thought I was robbed. I went into hibernation mode because the online reaction was too much. It’s astounding how people judge you on a few minutes’ screen time. It felt exposing and knocked my confidence quite substantially. January was hellish. What helped was finding my own voice. I starting posting on social media, evensome silly songsI’d written during my time there.The Traitors fandom pointed out that mine was the earliest exit in all the global editions. So embarrassing. With time, I’ve learned to laugh at it. You can’t take life too seriously, and discover so much more about yourself by losing. I’m still getting recognised and people are always positive. It was a privilege to be part of the show – even if it was for just a flap of a lunar moth’s wing.‘I didn’t leave my hotel room for 24 hours’Journalist, presenter and Loose Women panellist Kaye Adams was thefirst celebrity to be eliminated fromStrictly Come Dancing2022.View image in fullscreenSheer desperation … Kaye Adams on Strictly Come Dancing, series 20.Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBCI was about to turn 60, soStrictlyseemed like a sign from the universe. I secretly wanted a journey of self-discovery. I hoped there was something hidden inside me to bring out – but it turned out there was nothing! My professional partner Kai Widdrington was endlessly patient and encouraging. We invented an alter ego for my flamboyant side named Fifi LaTouche, like some kind of superannuated can-can girl. Sadly she didn’t exist.Our first dance was a tango to Abba. Draped on this bordello-type bar, all I could think was that it looked like grab-a-granny night. It was the most petrifying thing I’d ever done. I genuinely considered hypnotism to overcome my nerves. By week two, I was running on empty. We did a Charleston and I utterly blanked. I had a terrible dress rehearsal, so I was cacking myself. One of the makeup girls had some awful Greek liquor she’d bought back from holiday and I took a shot out of sheer desperation. I thought it might do something to me and it did. It made me worse!I read an article that morning which mullered me. The idea started to eat away that people were laughing at me. As a woman of a certain age, you fear being a laughing stock. There are so many old tropes, like mutton dressed as lamb. I’m not usually seeking that kind of approval but on Strictly, you’re seeking approval on a huge scale in a public vote, like it or not. My mood was very low. By the dance-off against Matt Goss, I was done.Shirley Ballas, the head judge, voted for me to stay. I was grateful because it gave me a tiny bit to walk away with. I was as gutted as I’ve been about anything. I didn’t leave my hotel room for 24 hours. I was embarrassed to go out. It was a much bigger deal, emotionally and psychologically, than I anticipated.When I went back for the group dance in the final, they could easily have hidden me at the back but I opened the routine. I’m still thankful for that, because it gave me some self-respect. The female pros could see how nervous I was they were so sweet and supportive, giving me last-minute tips. It went well, which truly helped me get over it.I was in awe of the whole production but personally, it was quite a sore experience. I’m not a terrible dancer but razzle-dazzle takes such confidence. If you allow negative thoughts to creep in, you’re sunk. You go into these shows hoping for growth but Strictly just confirmed my self-doubts. It was difficult for a long time. I didn’t watch the show for two years out of self-preservation. Abba still trigger me! But you’ve got to be able to fail or you’d never try anything. Now I’m grabbing my 60s by the short and curlies.Kaye Adams’ podcast, How to Be 60, is released bi-weekly and will be live at Edinburgh fringe, 10-12 August‘We went for a stiff drink and laughed about it’Sophie Walker captained Reading University to the final of Christmas University Challenge in 2017, only to lose by a record240-0.View image in fullscreenStarter for 10 … Sophie Walker.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhen I was asked to go onUniversity Challenge, my immediate thought was ‘Absolutely not. Next!’ But at the time, I was leading the Women’s Equality party and we got very little media coverage. This was a chance to raise awareness of our work, so eventually I said OK. I assumed I’d be there for one round and out.My teammates – anthropologist Anna Machin, naturalist Martin Hughes-Games and gardener Pippa Greenwood – were lovely people who were equally bemused by how they got into this. Other teams were taking it Very Seriously – capital V, capital S – so we agreed to have fun. I was stunned when we got through. We won the next round too and were suddenly in the final. Our opponents were Keble College, Oxford but we were mainly up against Frank Cottrell-Boyce. He knew vast amounts of stuff and was fast on the buzzer. At one point, he answered 10 in a row. I was like, ‘Alright Frank, enough!’ One reason I don’t feel any despair is that he’s a prince among men with an extraordinary brain. I’d invite anybody to go up against Frank and do better.As questions flew past, I remember thinking: ‘I went to a secondary comp in Glasgow – this wasn’t on the syllabus!’ But we still enjoyed ourselves. At one point, Jeremy Paxman told us to stop giggling. The crosser he got with us, the funnier it seemed. When the gong went, we weren’t cowed by our failure. I gathered everybody up, took them for a stiff drink and laughed about it. Pippa and I were invited on Woman’s Hour to discuss being the first team to get no points. There was lots of mickey-taking, not least from my university chums. They were like, ‘Thanks a lot for that!’Leading a start-up political party, looking like an idiot is an everyday risk. I can think of 10 more embarrassing things I did before breakfast the next day. We set a rather unfortunate record, but not everybody can say they’ve got through to the University Challenge final. I’ll take that.‘At least I beat Dustin the Turkey’Andy Abraham was the UK’s entry in the 2008Eurovisionsong contest and came last with only 14 points.View image in fullscreenEuro star … Andy Abraham at the 2008 Eurovision song contest.Photograph: Sari Gustafsson/ShutterstockIt felt great to win Eurovision: Your Decision – although I thought the public were off their heads. My song was soulful, not a Euro-type tune! Michelle Gayle had been bookies’ favourite and was very upset. As soon as the result was announced, she was off. I thought: ‘Wow, be a bit more gracious.’ Representing your country is a big deal. My only worry was being beaten by Dustin the Turkey. Ireland didn’t want the expense of hosting again, so they sent a puppet. Luckily, he was knocked out in the semi-final. At least I did better than the turkey!Serbia was strange. We were escorted everywhere by machine gun-wielding security but my song, Even If, went down a storm in Belgrade nightclubs. They dug it in the arena, too. The crowd danced and sang along, but it didn’t translate to viewers at home. Jean Paul Gaultier came over from the French delegation and said he loved it. I did myself proud. The rest was in the lap of the gods. We had an inkling that political voting might happen. As the results came in, I wasn’t embarrassed. I might’ve been if I’d forgotten the lyrics, stumbled or been off-key but I was over the moon with my performance. No way we deserved to finish that low down.I went to the BBC booth to see Terry Wogan. He was crestfallen and said ‘I’m so sorry.’ I told him: ‘It’s all good.’ We had a few drinks and the UK delegation – Caroline Flack, god rest her soul, Paddy O’Connell and co – had a brilliant time. They didn’t feel let down by me, only by how severe the anti-UK voting was. That year, Terry quit. He said it had gone too far and was no fun any more.Back home, people sympathised because I was hard done by. I’m a working-class boy – before The X Factor, I was a binman – which keeps things in perspective. If music came to an end, I’d just go back to grafting. The only thing I’d do differently is go out there earlier to promote the song. There wasn’t enough momentum behind it. I was also second on the bill, the dreaded slot of death. Maybe if I’d performed last, who knows?Eurovisionwas a career highlight and wonderful experience. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. In fact, I’d do it again. Whenever I perform Even If live, I joke about it and say ‘Thanks for the 14 points, guys!’ The whole room always starts clapping and cheering.”Everything That You Do, the new single by Benjamin Race feat Andy Abraham, is out on 18 July.‘The showstopper stopped my show’Amos Lilley was the first baker to be sent home from The Great British Bake Off 2023.View image in fullscreenReady, steady, go … Amos Lilley (centre back) in series 14 of The Great British Bake Off.Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4It was surreal walking into the famous tent. I’m 6ft 5in, so they made a little plinth to raise my workbench. The opening round was a vertical layer cake. I was nervous, got into my own head and overdid it. By the technical challenge, I felt calm. We made the iconicBake Offcake from the title sequence and mine came second. I felt elated. Maybe it gave me false hope!It was the showstopper that stopped my show. For my animal cake, I made an orca. Why choose a whale? I should’ve done Colin the Caterpillar! I was disappointed with how it turned out and said it ‘looked like a piece of poo’. Even worse, Paul Hollywood called my sponge ‘tough as old boots’. It was horribly tense, awaiting the result. I knew I was in danger but a few of us were. No way I thought I’d be going home.When Noel [Fielding] called my name, I felt myself leave my body. It was my second time applying, so I’d been building up to this for two years. In an instant, the journey was over. Viewers were outraged. I was inundated with messages, which softened the blow. Thanks, Bake Off fans! I’d planned out all 10 weeks – my outfits, my bakes. I’d bought special equipment and stands. When I went back home, I chucked it all away like a diva. Don’t need this! Don’t need that! But the show changed my life. I quit my job. Now I’m setting up my own bakery, Lilley’s Luxurious Cakes. My early exit knocked my confidence but with time, I realised I’d done well to get that far. It’s two people’s opinion and only a TV show. And I got recognised at Abba Voyage last night, so I must’ve made an impression. It was also a landmark episode – Alison Hammond’s first as co-host and it featured Prue Leith’s beaver innuendo. That clip will be replayed for a long time – and I’m one of the people in hysterics.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsStrictly Come DancingEntertainment TVReality TVEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Historic figures such as Winston Churchill and Jane Austen feature on the current notes, but the central bank is proposing that the next series could move on to new themes.

He doesn’t shy away from showing the world the harsh reality of nature, and not just the cute stuff. His picture on a tenner would be a fitting homage.Donna,Oxfordshire‘Oak, beech, elm and ash trees’I’d choose pictures of oak, beech, elm and ash trees. These trees combine British iconicness with a reminder of the danger facing the environment. Alternatively, we could celebrate the NHS with a picture of a scanner, scalpel, stethoscope and a pair of crutches. We criticise the NHS, but we need a continuous reminder of what it does for us.Patricia Harris, Milton KeynesView image in fullscreenMary Seacole (1805-1881) ‘made important contributions to our sociey’.Photograph: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy‘Mary Seacole would be my choice’We’ve had people like Florence Nightingale on our banknotes before, but Britain is a diverse society and there have been so many contributions to our wellbeing, our health and our wealth from immigrants who you rarely see on our currencies. Sothe nurse Mary Seacole, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, would be my choice. I think most people would agree she made important contributions to our society.Mamta Arnott, Brecon, Wales‘Terry Pratchett, who brought so much joy to people’Let’s not restrict notes to pictures from the long-ago past. Let’s have people likeTerry Pratchett, who brought so much joy to people with his Discworld series. I think he deserves to be memorialised on the bank note. We could also celebrate British achievements, such as theRaspberry Piseries of small computers designed for learning, experimentation and control systems. They’re great examples of British success in technology and engineering.Antony Shepherd, LondonView image in fullscreenTerry Pratchett ‘deserves to be memorialised’.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian‘Alec Guinness, in costume as George Smiley’My choice would be Alec Guinness, in costumeas the spy George Smileywith his big glasses. Star Wars passed me by, but the TV version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was the best thing I’ve ever seen on television. Generally speaking, Alec Guinness is a national treasure, as everybody who has seen him act would agree. Failing that, my favourite authorsJohn le CarréorLen Deighton.Michael Jones, BuckinghamshireView image in fullscreenShould there be ‘more emphasis on the regions of England and key landmarks’ – such as Clifton Suspension Bridge?Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian‘Landmarks like Clifton Suspension Bridge’I’d like less focus on historical figures and more emphasis on the regions ofEnglandand key landmarks. For the £5 note, Skiddaw in Cumberland. For the £10 note, Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. It was designed by Brunel, and perhaps it could encourage tourism to this somewhat overlooked region. I’d have the Houses of Parliament on the £20 note, since they’re world famous, and putting them on what is probably the most used note would be appropriate. And for the £50 note, Salisbury Cathedral, which has England’s – and indeed the UK’s – tallest spire of 123 metres.Ian Cox, Edinburgh‘Ada Lovelace, or Babbage’s difference engine’I’d chooseCharles Babbage’sdifference engine, or Ada Lovelace, whowrote the first programfor it at the birth of the digital age. When they built this mechanical calculator, it was a brand new idea. They preceded Alan Turing in the history of computing – but he’s on the £50 note already.David Hoare, NottinghamView image in fullscreenA model of the difference engine – ‘a brand new idea’ in the 1840s.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer‘Modern icons Bill Shankly and Glenda Jackson’Let’s move toward modern icons likeBill Shankly. I think he was more than just a football manager or football player. He was an understanding, reasonable person who was a unifier of people. AndGlenda Jackson; I’ve always admired her, as an actor and politician. Among all these actors and celebrities we talk about, she rarely gets a mention. She’s from where I grew up, so that’s probably another reason I mention her, but she was probably one of this country’s greatest actors ever.Lee Mault, Merseyside‘The suffragettes, with their flag’I thinkthe suffragettes, with their flag, would look particularly nice on a £20 note with the tiniest splash of green, to match the flag’s colours. I don’t think we hear enough about the suffragettes. We mustn’t forget these people who did so much to make things the way they are now. I’d also like to see the famous “Lest we forget” silhouette of a world war one soldier. I find it quite poignant when I see it at memorials, and it would be great to have it on every note.Jacqueline, LondonExplore more on these topicsMoneyBank of EnglandEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In an article headlined “The meaning of the chancellor’s tears”,a New Statesman columnisttold readers that Reeves’s authority was “beginning to melt away”.The Daily Mailspoke disdainfully of her “waterworks”.But in the longer term the chancellor’s display of distress may prove to have an unexpectedly positive legacy, helpfully normalising a still hugely stigmatised phenomenon: women’s tears in the workplace.No 10 defends chancellor after day of bitter recriminations over welfare bill fiascoRead moreUntil now, tearful outbursts at work have mostly been mired in shame, the source of acute embarrassment. This week’s live broadcast of the chancellor’s silent tears could help shift the taboo, highlighting a little-discussed truth: sometimes women cry at work, and it’s no big deal.Reeves reflected on her own tears with a shrug a day later. “People saw I was upset, but that was yesterday. Today’s a new day and I’m just cracking on with the job,”she said on Thursday. She declined to explain what had prompted her distress, describing it simply as a personal issue and refusing to go into details. Within 24 hoursthe markets had bounced backwith the assurances of the prime minister, Keir Starmer, that she would remain in her job for the long term.Clearly it is far from ideal to befilmed in tearsduring the week’s most-watched exchanges in the House of Commons, but ministerial jobs are immensely tough. Some of Reeves’s male predecessors have exhibited the strain of their roles in more extreme ways, while attracting less attention, because their behaviour is classed as routine and acceptable machismo.When Britain’s former prime minister Gordon Brown was exhausted and under pressure he was known to be prone to volcanic eruptions.One biographer describedhow Brown would stab the seat of the ministerial Jaguar with his pen in fury.Bloombergreported that a new aide was warned to watch out for “flying Nokias” when he joined Brown’s team (although a spokesperson for Brown said at the time that this was “not an account that I recognise”).Reeves’s tears were widely seen as a sign that she was losing control. Brown’s fury was forgiven by many as just a regrettable quirk displayed by a leader under pressure.View image in fullscreenTheresa May’s voice cracked as she delivered her speech announcing her resignation as prime minister in May 2019.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesResearch consistently confirms what we instinctively know: that women cry more frequently than men. So it stands to reason that as we see more women in senior leadership roles, the sight of a powerful woman in tears should become less remarkable. It would be odd to celebrate it, since it’s an exhausting and often mortifying phenomenon, but Reeves’s outburst may help it to be better understood as simply a different way of expressing professional frustration or responding to pressure.Polling conducted by YouGov in the UKrevealed that34% of men claimed not to have cried at all in the previous year, compared with only 7% of women; 18% of women said they cried at least once a week, compared with only 4% of men. Behaviour varies between cultures, but this remains a broadly global phenomenon:a 2011 studyof 5,715 participants from 37 countries found women were more prone to crying and were more likely to have cried recently.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher cried as she left 10 Downing Street for the last time as prime minister in 1990.Photograph: Ken Lennox/AlamyThis week, Germany’s former leaderAngela Merkel revealedthat she “burst out crying from the pressure” during a meeting with the then US president, Barack Obama, on how to handle Greece’s mounting debt crisis in 2015. Theresa Maywas on the brink of tearswhen she stepped down as the UK prime minister in May 2019, her voice cracking and lips wobbling as she stood outside Downing Street, telling assembled journalists that it had been the honour of her life “to serve the country I love”. Margaret Thatcher was in tears when she was driven from Downing Street in 1990. By contrast, David Cameronhummed his wayback inside No 10 after his resignation speech in 2016.Obama wept occasionally when president, but these were mostly dignified occasions, prompted by the memory of tragic events, such as the shooting of schoolchildrenduring a speech about gun control. His tears were not the unattractive and uncontrollable, messy and humiliating variety, but were mostly seen ascommendable expressionsof his humanity. Vladimir Putinappeared emotionala decade ago during a soft-rock song honouring the bravery of the Russian police force, but these too were a different kind of tears.Political behaviour in Britain has been slow to change, despite the rapidly evolving makeup of the Commons. In 2024, the UK electedthe highest number of female MPsever. There are now 264 women in the Commons, holding 41% of the 650 seats. Since the 1997 election of the Labour party saw the proportion of women double from 9% to 18%, there has been a steady rise, but the institution’s combative culture has barely changed.“We’ve had years of men shouting, scoffing, braying, even sleeping in this chamber, so we shouldn’t overreact to a woman showing her frustration with one tear,” said Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a feminist campaigning charity. “It shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that she’s not up to her job. These criticisms feel riddled with sexism and stereotype.”Ask any female colleague, and they will probably reluctantly admit to having wrestled with the challenge of holding back tears at work, often prompted by professional frustration rather than sadness. I’ve done it, during a difficult conversation with an editor, raising my eyes to the ceiling and tilting my head back, hoping that gravity would somehow suck the tears back inside the ducts and that no one would notice.Women know it can be damaging professionally because crying remains categorised as a sign of incompetence and weakness, an unacceptable manifestation of stress. One accomplished acquaintance in a senior role was unfairly nicknamed Tiny Tears in private by her staff because occasionally she responded to challenging situations with involuntary tears. Her colleagues were less familiar with this manifestation of professional dissatisfaction than they might have been with a display of male anger.View image in fullscreenBarack Obama publicly cried on a number of occasions, including during his farewell address as US president, but his tears were mostly seen as commendable expressions of his humanity and not weakness.Photograph: Kamil Krzaczyński/EPAAnother woman described crying on her third day at her new job as a chief executive of a large organisation. “It wasn’t live on the media, but it was in an open-plan office and I was surrounded by senior and junior staff. I’m not remotely comparing my job to the job of the chancellor, but there was a huge burden of responsibility and I was having to take difficult decisions,” she said.She was embarrassed by her own tears because she could see how uncomfortable it made her team. “But I didn’t see it as a loss of control. We shouldn’t assume that displays of emotions represent a loss of control over ability to do your job.” She thinks, however, the episode may unexpectedly have helped her win colleagues’ respect. “They could see I really cared about what we were there to do.”Although there is no difference in the amount male and female babies cry, women cry more frequently than men because of a complex mix of social conditioning and biology. Ad Vingerhoets, a professor of clinical psychology at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, has studied the science of tears, and notes that testosterone acts as a “brake” on the crying response.Sophie Scott, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, who specialises in analysing how emotions are expressed through laughter and tears, said: “How we experience and express our emotions is influenced by our biology and by how we’ve grown up.”Scott made a distinction between tears produced as a result of sadness and tears triggered by anger, noting that these tears of frustration and fury seemed to be more frequently something experienced by women. “If you’re angry and you feel you can’t do something about it, there’s a helpless, frustrated feeling that pushes you to tears,” she said.Women seemed to find themselves more frequently fighting tears of frustration than men, Scott said, adding that this might be because “angry and more aggressive responses are more acceptable in men”.Unusually, Reeves’s misery was caught playing out over the 30-minute duration of the prime minister’s questions session, allowing viewers a rare and uncomfortable view of someone attempting and failing to stem the flow, lips twitching and turning downwards. “A big difference between my job and many of your viewers’ is that when I’m having a tough day it’s on the telly, and most people don’t have to deal with that,” Reeves told the BBC.View image in fullscreen‘Today’s a new day and I’m just cracking on with the job,’ said Rachel Reeves, after she was seen crying in the Commons the day before.Photograph: ReutersScott said many forms of tears were hard to control, adding: “Crying is a very truthful signal. Once it gets hold of you, it’s very hard to stop it. It’s involuntary.”Rosie Campbell, a professor of politics at King’s College London, said she was staggered by the negativity triggered by Reeves’s tears. “In our society, women are more likely to cry. That doesn’t make them worse leaders,” she said. “I don’t want to see politicians crying in the chamber every day, but if it happens a couple of times in a parliamentary career, that should be no big deal.“I’m more worried about emotionally repressed leaders than about someone who realises that the financial security of the nation is in their hands and they feel the weight of that.”Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesWomenPsychologyPolitics pastBiologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Of course I’m writing about it’: Hard Life – formerly Easy Life – on being sued by easyGroup and starting afreshRachel AroestiWhen the Leicester band were forced to drop their old name after a legal threats from a certain budget airline, it could have been curtains. But frontman Murray Matravers’s trip to Japan has prompted a bold new outlook – and an upbeat new albumFri 4 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen writing songs, “95% of the time” Murray Matravers starts with the title. It’s a tactic he picked up from Gary Barlow: a producer once told him the Take That man tends to arrive at sessions touting a load of prospective song titles “cut out on little pieces of paper, and he’d put them on the table and you could just choose one. I was like: that’s fucking brilliant. Ever since I’ve always had loads of titles in my Notes app. It actually changed the way I wrote music,” he says with genuine enthusiasm. “Shout out to Gary Barlow!”Names are clearly very important to the 29-year-old – but in recent years they have also caused him untold stress. By 2023, Matravers’ band Easy Life was thriving, having scored two No 2 albums on the trot by fusing upbeat, synthy bedroom pop with wry emo-rap. But that same year, his career came to a screeching halt when easyGroup – owners of the easyJet brand name with a long history of taking legal action against businesses with the word “easy” in their branding – decided to sue the Leicester band for trademark infringement.Their first reaction was to laugh at such extreme litigiousness. “We thought it was hilarious,” recalls Matravers. They spent the next few weeks “umming and ahhing about fighting” the legal action, buoyed by the support they received from the public: “We thought, we’re gonna start a GoFundMe and fight the system – that was the energy people were giving us.” But ultimately the risk felt too gargantuan. Easy Life wasn’t a limited company, so “if we did lose, any assets that we have would be liable for repossession – and the court case would have been into the millions”. Then there were the years of their lives they would need to sacrifice. “Our court date would have been in July 2025, so we would only now be going to court.”Instead of spending years in legal limbo, the group swiftly rebranded to Hard Life (although the financial impact was still huge; they didn’t gig for 18 months, and the complex task of scrubbing references to their former moniker from online artwork and streaming services was a full-time job in itself for a while). Last June, they released a ludicrously catchy comeback single called Tears, which paired Matravers’ Midlands-accented sprechgesang with a chipmunk-soul sample and lyrics that prodded at the controversy by calling out easyGroup’s founder. Unsurprisingly, this attracted further legal pushback, with the company’s lawyers calling it “disparaging and defamatory”. It has subsequently been bleeped out of the song.Matravers doesn’t regret it … well, maybe just a teensy bit. The musician is deeply committed to candour: in conversation, he is garrulous and funny, but makes no attempt to hide how beleaguered he clearly still feels; when it comes to his lyrics, he says anything is fair game (“other than a few deeply buried secrets of mine that will never come out”). The lawsuit “was my life for such a long time, of course I’m going to write about it. Fair enough, I could have been smarter and not name-dropped the owner of the company on the first song back after they had sued. But I was fucking angry as well.”It’s a Hard Life for band changing their name after objection from easyGroupRead moreTears opens the band’s forthcoming third album, Onion, which features one other reference to the company (“I’m sure they’re gonna listen to the album on the day that it drops and I’m sure I’ll hear from [their lawyers],” he says wearily). Yet the rest of this infectiously upbeat record betrays little trace of the strife that preceded it. That may be because it was largely written after Matravers decided to make a fresh start in Japan. Today he is Zooming from the island of Kyushu (“Studio Ghibli vibes”), where he is staying with the grandparents of a friend he met in Tokyo. Following a break-up and craving some respite from expensive London (“so many of my friends are leaving: we don’t party or eat out as much as we used to because we can’t afford to”), he “ran away” to the city last year, and now spends more time in Japan than the UK.Tokyo was where Matravers met the Australian-Japanese producer Taka Perry, his main collaborator on Onion. The pair quickly became inseparable – “He’s actually next door on a futon, asleep” – and began making music together. (Hard Life is in many senses a solo project; Matravers’ touring bandmates have never written with him and “there’s only a few [recorded] songs they’ve actually played on”.) They worked at a studio called Onion; Matravers liked the fact the name chimed with the already-released Tears – onions make you cry – and ideas started percolating. But he still didn’t envisage these sessions becoming the new Hard Life album: “I never thought that I would go back to England with the album, present it to Island Records, this big major label, and they’d be like: yeah, let’s put that out. And yeah, put a big fucking picture of an onion on the front if you want.”View image in fullscreenWhat a life … Hard Life on stage in Brixton, south London, in 2021.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsAs per Matravers’ song-title fixation, the Onion references kept coming. Philosophical break-up ballad Ogre nods to the famous Shrek line (“Ogres are like onions, they have layers”); they also had a song called Rings, which was cut from the final tracklist. At the moment, the musician loves going on Reddit “because all the fans are coming up with these theories about onions”.That said, Matravers is not fastidious about the allium allusions: tracks such as the surprisingly moving Tele9raph Hill have nothing to do with them. An ode to the south-east London neighbourhood with panoramic views, it sees Matravers visualise his own future from the vantage point while grappling with his mental health history – an evergreen subject for the artist. He was “incredibly anxious as a younger man” – triggers included flying, buses and trains – but things have improved recently. “I’m not teetering on the edge of a panic attack right now, which is a nice feeling.”Nowadays, Matravers is surrounded by “lots of delicate, fragile men like myself, so we all can cry as much as we want”, but in retrospect he thinks he began writing songs at 15 to “make sense of the world because I didn’t know who to talk to”. Growing up on an organic cattle farm near Loughborough, he spent much of his time making music with his older brother. Unlike most of his friends, he didn’t go to university, which he links to the fact “my parents existed outside of mainstream society. My dad had come over from South Africa and never fully assimilated to being here and lived on this farm. They never leave the farm; they’re self-sufficient.” Actually, he may be giving himself a bit too much credit. “To be honest, I couldn’t be bothered to go to uni – it was that sort of energy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Soon after, he formed Easy Life, plugging away with no luck for years and supporting himself by working on a market. Then, in 2017, he released Pockets, a song about failing to make it in the music industry. Ironically, it got him noticed: the band’s lineup was overhauled and they were signed to Island. At 21, Matravers was “receiving more money than I ever thought I would make”.Despite achieving longed-for commercial success, band life was not always healthy. In early interviews, the group claimed to eschew rock star hedonism for tea, lasagne and novels in bed. Now, Matravers says he was “fairly wild” and that the money led him “down a certain path. I’m beating around the bush here – you can read between the lines”. On new song Proximityeffect, he mentions being “black-out drunk on stage” – something he says was happening a lot. The intra-band dynamics were also deteriorating. After the threatened lawsuit, they seriously considered packing it in entirely. “It wasn’t like: oh no, this perfect thing has been destroyed. Being in a band is like being in a dysfunctional family.”That family lost a member last year when bassist Sam Hewitt – a school friend of Matravers and the only remaining member of the original lineup – decided to quit. The lawsuit “gave us all a chance to take a long look at ourselves and ask: is this what I want to do? For Sam, maybe the answer to that was no.” Proximityeffect is mainly about the pair’s fractured friendship, as Matravers hops between antsy confrontation (“What’s up with the unfollow?”) and misty-eyed childhood nostalgia. Has he played the song to Hewitt? “No, I’ve not spoken to Sam for a very long time, sadly. Life sucks without him, he was my best friend.”But Matravers is also not the person he once was. On Tears, he considers how distant he feels from his roots: old pals tell him his accent’s changed; he drinks oat milk now (“I’m from a farm!”). There is a wistfulness, but also a sense of excitement. A lawsuit, a lost friend and brand new beginning: in recent years, Matravers’ life has actually been quite hard, but also thrillingly unpredictable. “I’m so far away from where I started. I would never have guessed a year ago that I’d be here now,” he muses from his bucolic Japanese getaway. “I can’t imagine what next year is going to look like, either.”Onion is released on 18 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

By the second over of the day England were 84 for five, five hundred runs and a thousand miles behind. Their best batter, Joe Root had just been caught off the ninth ball of the morning, and their captain, Ben Stokes, who has worked so many miracles for them before, had been caught off the 10th, done by a wicked, lifting delivery, nasty, brutish and short, which brushed off his glove on its way through to the keeper.The bowler, Mohammad Siraj, was on a hat-trick, and here comes England’s No 7, Jamie Smith, 24 years old, playing his 19th Test innings.Jamie Smith’s sensational century gives England hope but India seize their momentRead moreThe field was set, the slips were waiting, the crowd was up. There was, everyone watching felt sure, only one way the game was heading. The ball was a good one, on a length just outside off and moving in towards middle. Smith took a half-step forwards and, crack, thumped it back down the ground for four.Everyone else in this England team had to unlearn a lot of what they had been taught to begin to bat like this. But not Smith. He and Harry Brook are hothouse kids.Brendon McCullum is the only coach they have had in Test cricket and his way of playing is all they have known. Between the two of them, they turned this into one the great days of Test cricket. If you offered the 25,000 fans who were lucky enough to be inside the ground the chance to spend this July Friday anywhere else, you would have struggled to find one person among them who would not have turned you down flat and snapped their head back to the match.You can berate England, you can shake your head, puff out your cheeks and suck your teeth, but you surely can not take your eyes off them. Where any number of England sides before them would have tried to poke, prod and block their way towards the end of the innings, and the inevitable defeat lying beyond it, this one decided to crash, bang and wallop their way ahead instead. It was like watching Butch and Sundance come charging out of the building in the final reel.Inthe first innings in the first Test at Headingley, Smith had been caught on the boundary when he had scored 40, trying to hook a second consecutive six off a short ball from Prasidh Krishna. Time was when English cricket would not have forgiven a shot like that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which Smith said left him thinking he would do the same thing all over again the next time he found himself in a similar position.That happened sooner than Smith might have imagined. After he had been in for 20 minutes on Friday, Krishna hammered a short ball in at his ribs, which Smith whipped away for four. India already had two men back on the leg-side boundary, waiting for him to play it that way, and Shubman Gill decided to move a third back to join them.Krishna bowled a second short ball and Smith hit this one up and over the fielders for six. So Gill moved two more fielders over to the leg side. India now had six men there ready and waiting. Krishna bowled a third short ball and this time Smith whistled his pull shot away for four. So Krishna tried a fourth and Smith hit it the same way.Krishna pitched the sixth ball up full. So Smith hit it back past him for four more. The over went for 23 and counting from that first four onwards Smith took 35 off 13 balls Krishna bowled to him.The game changed in that 20-minute stretch. All of a sudden, England were up and running. Smith had raised his fifty one minute and overtaken Brook in the next and before you knew it he was closing in on Gilbert Jessop’s record for the fastest Test century by an Englishman. He did not quite make it. His hundred came in the last over before lunch off the 80th delivery he had faced.When it was all over, at the far end of the day, England trailed by 180 and had 10 wickets left to get.

It’s a bit different to England in 2022. I’m very excited but so much has changed, so I’m intrigued to come back and enjoy this ­tournament football.”England face fiendish path to glory but Euro 2025 is capturing hearts of hostsRead moreEngland look different from the team that beat Germany in the final in 2022. Millie Brightstepped backto protect her mental and physical health and Jill Scott, Ellen White, Rachel Daly,Mary Earpsand Fran Kirby have retired completely or, in the case of the last two, retired from ­international duty. The mantra has been that this is a new England.“The team has been a bit in ­transition, of course,” the manager, Sarina Wiegman, said, “and we ­absolutely cherish what we have done before, and we never forget it, and those are lifetime experiences for us and for our families and also for the fans. But you have to move on and you have to be on top. Things are changing very quickly, so we have to, too. We came together in February and we said: ‘It’s a new challenge.’ The approach was there anyway, but we called it the New England.”France have changed too, but there are familiar faces everywhere, not least in the dynamic Chelsea forward Sandy Baltimore. How do you stop her? “Whisper in her ear,” said Lucy Bronze, her Chelsea teammate, with a grin. What do you say? “Nothing in English,” the England full-back said, still grinning.Bronze, competing at her seventh major tournament having been part of every Euros and World Cup squad since 2013, has probably played with or against most players in ­Switzerland for Euro 2025.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze is competing in her seventh major tournament.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThere is one absent face in ­particular she will miss, though – that of the France centre-back Wendie Renard, who was dropped by the manager, Laurent Bonadei, along with Kenza Dali and Eugénie Le ­Sommer. It is a testament to Bronze’s competitive nature that she was unhappy about Renard’s omission.“I want to play against Wendie,” she said of her former Lyon ­teammate. “I want to play against the ­strongest French team. I want Wendie to be playing, defending corners and I can jump over her and win the ball. ­Winning a header over Wendie Renard, that’s an achievement.”Renard’s replacement as France’s captain, Griedge Mbock, another former Lyon clubmate of Bronze’s, is a doubt. The Paris Saint-Germain centre-back has been training ­separately after a calf injury. The potential stand-in, 21-year-old Alice Sombath, who has four caps, was also at Lyon with Bronze. “She’s probably got more maturity than people might give her credit for,” Bronze said.France have an enviable ­attacking lineup that includes Kadidiatou Diani, Baltimore and Marie-­Antoinette Katoto. “I think England have one of the best attacking lineups,” said Bronze. “The type of attackers France have got, we have quite similar, and as defenders we defend against that every day in training.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even someone like Michelle [Agyemang], who is relatively young, just runs into ­people and bodies them because she’s so strong.”James is ready to play more ­minutes, said Wiegman, after returning from a hamstring injury as a ­substituteagainst Jamaicalast weekend. “I won’t give you the lineup but she played 30 minutes last week so she can play more than that,” the manager said.After France, England face the 2017 European champions, the ­Netherlands, on Wednesday before completing the group stage against Wales. It has been referred to as the group of death. There is little room for error.Bronze said it was “a good and a bad thing” having to start against a serious contender. “If we lose that game, everyone says it’s the worst; if we win that game, it’s the best,” she said. “We just try to look at the positives: the fact that we get to test ourselves against the good teams straight away.

It came on the brutalCol de la Loze, in July 2023, when the Slovenian, dropped by another violent Vingegaard acceleration, announced wearily into his team radio: “I’m gone, I’m dead.”By last summer, as the recent Netflix series Unchained reveals, the tables had turned. Pogacar barked angry insults at the Dane after Vingegaard refused to make the pace with him on the gravel stage around Troyes. He went on to dominate the race and win his thirdTour de Franceby more than six minutes.The pair, whose rivalry is becoming one of the Tour’s most longstanding, will be locked in battle again this month with Pogacar widely expected to hammer home the supremacy of the past 18 months with another win.Tour de France 2025: full team-by-team guideRead moreThe UAE Team Emirates leader says he is “confident and ready”. Certainly his team, memorably bushwhacked by Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Simon Yates on thepenultimate stage of this year’s Giro, will want payback.In a tricky and tortuous opening to the Tour that will test every rider’s mettle, the biggest threat to Pogacar will be crashing. He has already ended up in a ditch this year, during the Italian gravel race Strade Bianche. Even then, hewent on to win.“The first week of the Tour is one of the most intense and nervous weeks,” he said. “You can quite easily lose the race in the first 10 days to the first rest day.“A lot can happen in such a long race, but I’m looking forward to racing against Jonas again. He’s in great shape. It will be a great month for people in front of the TV and beside the road.”The duel between the pair remains the headline act, but Pogacar, a winner 11 times this year, definitely has the upper hand. “There’s also been a lot of tension in the past years between UAE and Visma,” he said. “When you compete for the biggest race, there will be tension but we have big respect towards each other, too.”View image in fullscreenJonas Vingegaard, in a red helmet, trains with his Visma-Lease a Bike teammates in Lille.Photograph: Thibault Camus/APThe duo will return to some of their old battlegrounds, including the vertiginous climb of the Loze, above Courchevel. Stage 16’s visit to Mont Ventoux, where Vingegaard first skipped away from Pogacar in July 2021, is also familiar terrain.As for his televised four-letter outburst at the mild-mannered Dane, the 26-year-old sounded almost sheepish. “It’s not nice to ‘flip off’ at someone,” he said. “But in all sports, it’s easy to sometimes say something in the heat of the moment you might regret afterwards.“When you finish a stage you congratulate each other, regardless of what happened on the road. That’s the beauty of sport in a way, you’ve left it all out on the field, you’re a competitor, but you cross the line and then you show respect to each other afterwards.”The Tour de France’s version of VAR? Get ready for yellow card controversyRead moreFor his part, Vingegaard is dutifully talking up his chances, but the impression is that the 28-year-old is increasingly a shadow of rider that took the yellow jersey in 2022 and 2023. Some of this would appear to be attributable to the aftermath of thedevastating crashhe suffered in the spring of 2024, when racing in the Basque Country in Spain.“I really believed I was going to die,” he said after winningthe Tour stage to Le Lioranthat year. “I would never have believed it would have been possible for me to get this far.”This spring, he crashed again, in Paris-Nice, arriving disoriented, bloodied and concussed at the finish in La Côte-Saint-André. His injuries forced another long break and he resumed racing at June’s Critérium du Dauphiné, whenPogacar inflicted yet another defeat, although by a slimmer margin.As Vingegaard quit Paris-Nice, his understudy, Matteo Jorgenson, rode on to take his second win in the Race to the Sun. The 26-year-old, derided for being too heavy to succeed in a climber’s Tour de France,is waiting in the wingsand has said “it’s time to set the bar higher”.Alongside the American, Simon Yates, fresh from his win in the Giro, and Wout van Aert, recovering from a bout of illness in the buildup to the Tour, give Vingegaard’s team a powerhouse feel, but as they glance across at the rest, Pogacar’s support is no less impressive.View image in fullscreenSimon Yates, the 2025 Giro d’Italia winner, offers powerhouse support to Jonas Vingegaard.Photograph: Luca Bettini/AFP/Getty ImagesHe can rely on proven back-up that includes the Tour of Oman winner, Adam Yates, twin brother of Simon; João Almeida, winner this season of the Tours of the Basque Country, Romandie and Switzerland; and a crew of other steadfast support riders, including Pavel Sivakov, Nils Politt and Tim Wellens.There are 184 riders starting the Tour, but the Pogacar-Vingegaard narrative will inevitably dominate. There are, however, other storylines to follow: the return of the once-dominantDave Brailsford to the Tour, seeking to reboot the Ineos Grenadiers in the world’s biggest race, is one of them, although privately the 61-year-old admits he has some catching up to do after his stint at Old Trafford.The sense that the British team have lacked urgency, while leaning on constant talk of transition, has been evident for some years. Brailsford, meanwhile, is back in his happy place – that is as long as you do not bring upthe Department for Culture, Media and Sport.The French, yet again, are simply making up the numbers and the host nation’s 40 years of hurt shows no sign of ending. They have become a curmudgeonly presence at their own anniversary party, desperate for their own Lycra-clad Andy Murray.Ironically, it could be the strategy of former BritishCyclingand Team Sky alumni Rod Ellingworth, that fuels hope. The 52-year-old is leading Project Lenny, the attempts of the Bahrain Victorious bid to develop the 21-year-old prodigy Lenny Martinez into that rare thing: a genuine French Tour contender.As they say in the brasseries around Lille’s Place de la République, “bon courage”.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogačarJonas VingegaardTour de FranceCyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Wales, this tourist magnet marks the potentially awkward junction between the heady optimism of an exhilarating journey towards their first major tournament and the reality of the formidable challenge posed by Saturday’s opening match against the Netherlands.Perhaps appropriately, Mount Pilatus towers above Stadion Allmend where Wales kick-off their Group D campaign. But the good news for their fans is that Rhian Wilkinson, the head coach, believes mountains are there for climbing. Indeed, Wilkinson clambered up Snowdon before announcing her squad for the tournament on the mountain’s summit last month.England face fiendish path to glory but Euro 2025 is capturing hearts of hostsRead moreWhile she acknowledges reaching the knockout phase would be a feat akin to ascending Everest, there is quiet optimism over Wales’s chances of startling Netherlands.“We hope this is going to be a long tournament,” said the 43-year-old. “Until today it hasn’t felt real, but now I can’t wait for the bus to the game and to watch these women walk on to the field.“This has been a long time coming, but these players are ready to be on the biggest stage and to be tested against some of the world’s best.”If mountain metaphors have been a feature of Wilkinson’s 15 months in charge, the former Canada defender, who led Portland Thorns to the 2022 National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) title, should not be underestimated.Wilkinson was capped 183 times and won two Olympic bronze medals. She describes managing Wales as being “right up there with anything I’ve done in my career”.Well aware that central Europe is often pretty warm in July, Wilkinson prepared her squad with a week’s tough training in Portugal’s Algarve. Uefa observers have been impressed by the intensity of sessions at their base near Lake Constance.By Friday, Wales’s players were deloading, dictating that Jess Fishlock, Sophie Ingle and co contented themselves with a gentle walk around Stadion Allmend.Jess FishlockWhile Wilkinson would not reveal any last-minute fitness doubts – instead insisting onlookers “keep calm, don’t panic” – she did suggest Ingle would begin on the bench after her recovery from an ACL injury.Much, as ever, hinges on the contribution of the 38-year-old Fishlock. As Wilkinson pointed out, the Seattle Reign midfielder “understands space, understands how to connect the pieces and, at her best, is pretty unplayable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jonker, deeply unimpressed by the decision, therefore has something to prove, but his side made heavy weather of qualifying and are widely tipped to struggle in a group also containing England and France.France seeking end to years of hurt and internal conflicts at Euro 2025Read moreA lot probably hinges on whether Vivianne Miedema is properly fit after an injury-punctuated season. A goal against Wales would be the Manchester City striker’s 100th for her country. Yet if Miedema and the Netherlands, 11th in the world rankings, can be contained, Wales, 30th, will have indicated that the international game is levelling up.One of the many good things about Switzerland is that its railways largely utilise a level boarding system. This dictates passengers have no need to negotiate steps up and down to the platform but can simply wheel luggage straight on and off trains. This system makes railway travel more accessible to anyone with restricted mobility, small children or heavy suitcases. Wales, for their part, are intent on showing they are closing the once apparently insurmountable gap between themselves and Europe’s elite.“Success for us is making sure our team shows up,” said Wilkinson. “But we’re here for a reason and I want my players to be confident. I want Wales to show the world who we are.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballNetherlands women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Germany needed something special to break through Poland’s stubborn resistance. Within a blink of an eye, the net was bulging and Germany were making a winning start to their campaign.A well-coached Poland side can be proud of their performance but, once Brand’s stunning strike went in in the 52nd minute, the result looked inevitable and Lea Schüller headed in Germany’s second to give them a perfect springboard to the tournament.Germany v Poland: Women’s Euro 2025 – liveRead moreThe record eight-time European champions have failed to reach the final only twice since the first time they qualified in 1989, but it was not until the second half when they were able to demonstrate why so many pundits are tipping them to go deep into the competition yet again.They were by no means perfect, but a pleased player-of-the-match Brand said: “We do have room for improvement, especially with our final pass, but the first game of a Euros is really difficult. That’s why it’s great we got the three points.”With St Gallen lying less than 15 miles from the German border, this was almost a home fixture for the 2022 runners-up and their supporters brought energy and passion to the streets of the seventh-century city, surrounded by rolling green hills on another picture-perfect, warm evening in Switzerland. After the hosts, German citizens have bought more tickets for this tournament than any other nation, and it showed, as they paraded in vast numbers through the streets towards the stadium before kick-off, eager to see if their team could continue their formidable run of five straight victories in which they had scored 24 times.View image in fullscreenGermany captain Giulia Gwinn looked devastated as she was forced to come off in the first half with an injury.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAThe determined and hard-working debutants Poland, however, had nothing to lose and executed their gameplan impressively in the first half. Without the ball, they often appeared to be playing with a back six, but they proved tricky for the Germans to break down and then, in the transitional moments, they had the pace of the Barcelona striker Ewa Pajor in attack to worry the Germany back four. Emilia Szymczak volleyed wide of the far post when unmarked at a deep free-kick, before Ann-Katrin Berger tipped a Pajor shot over the crossbar, although the offside flag was raised.Such was Christian Wück’s frustration, he sent his team out for the second half more than three minutes early. Brand responded with the moment of individual quality that was needed, cutting in on to her left foot and driving her strike past Kinga Szemik. The sea of white shirts behind the goal erupted.Sjoeke Nüsken inexplicably headed wide when a goal seemed certain, before Schüller’s far-post header made the win safe. Poland did not give up and Pajor was thwarted by a fine reaction save from Berger and while Germany did not quite send out the same statement that Spain stamped across the competition on Thursday, they are in form.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Filippa Angeldahl scored the only goal in the game to give Peter Gerhardsson’s side an early advantage in Group C.It took one moment of carefully crafted play from two of Sweden’s seasoned stars to finally unlock the hard-working Denmark defence. Angeldahl had looked the most likely to find the breakthrough as she grew in influence. Her well-timed one-two with Kosovare Asllani and the finish that followed was an example of how creative this Sweden team can be when they put their minds to it.Anxiety and excitement combine for Williamson with Wiegman’s new EnglandRead more“Joy and relief,” Angeldahl said. “There are many nerves when you start a tournament so it was a wonderful feeling to score that first goal.”Always the bridesmaid, never the bride – that is the slightly unfortunate tagline that has followed this team around in the latter part of Gerhardsson’s tenure. An Olympic silver and two World Cup bronze medals have marked significant progress under his leadership but, all too often, they have failed to find that extra per cent. This tournament represents the last opportunity for him and several members of his squad to win their first European trophy in 41 years.The 65-year-old oversees a highly experienced side that certainly has the quality on paper to go better than Euro 2022, where they got knocked out in thesemi-final by England. Asllani, their leader at the heart it all, was making her 200th international appearance in Geneva, a feat only previously achieved by Caroline Seger and Therese Sjögran.View image in fullscreenDenmark and Sweden players battle for the ball from a set piece.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersSweden’s impressive form – they are unbeaten since July 2024 – certainly suggests that they could once again mount a challenge. They will have been full of confidence coming into this opener with rivals Denmark. These two are very familiar, having played twice in this year’s Nations League campaign. Sweden won both fixtures and humbled Denmark with a 6-1 victory in their last outing in June. Gerhardsson made just one change from that encounter with Madelen Janogy coming into attack in place of Fridolina Rolfö, who is still lacking fitness after picking up an ankle injury.It had been a chastening experience for the Danes and Andrée Jeglertz with Sweden constantly exploiting the space in behind. This is the first and last major tournament for a manager whose appointment as Manchester City head coach after this campaign was strangely announced on the eve of their opener. He made two changes to the side that had capitulated in Solna. The 24-year-old defender Emma Færge made her Euro debut while Karen Holmgaard slotted into midfield after winning her fitness race.The Stade de Genève proved a stunning location for this encounter. Sweden’s travelling support– known as the Soft Hooligans – made themselves heard behind one goal, decked in yellow and singing renditions of ABBA-based chants.View image in fullscreenSweden fans look to get behind their team in Geneva.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAThe intensity of the play caught the eye with both sides exerting plenty of energy in an end-to-end display. They were each finding joy down their right sides with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Frederikke Thøgersen constant thorns in the side of the full-backs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSweden were controlling the play without creating much when faced by some much-improved Denmark defending. Angeldahl was a threat, however, and created the best opportunity of the first half when she stung the gloves of Maja Bay Østergaard with a sweetly struck free-kick.It was, therefore, of little surprise that it was the 27-year-old who struck 10 minutes after the break. It was the spark Sweden needed as a succession of chances followed although they were unable to make them count.Their inability to extend their lead, however, gave a tiring Denmark hope. A moment of magic from Pernille Harder almost salvaged a point but her curling effort crashed off the woodwork leaving the captain with her head in her hands.Gerhardsson was understandably pleased with his side’s start in a difficult group. “There are always a lot of feelings and emotions in the first match,” he said. “For analysis, you’ll have to join us on the bus. We suspected Denmark would do something different … At half-time we discussed upping the tempo a bit and not allow Denmark any rest.” They will take those positives from the second half in particular when they play Poland next in Lucerne on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Denmark women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We have to have the humility to admit that,” admits Sakina Karchaoui, one of the team’s vice-captains, referring also to the 2019 World Cup on home soil, when they lost to the USA in the quarter-finals.France’s Grace Geyoro: ‘We must look England straight in the eyes’Read moreThe list of failures is so long that the word “finally” is added to any question aboutLes Bleues’chances. France have only managed to reach the semi-finals of a major women’s competition on three occasions: the 2011 World Cup, the 2012 Olympic Games and Euro 2021. Repeated disappointments have taken a toll.“Since we prepare for tournaments a year or two years in advance, when you arrive at the competition and you get eliminated quickly, yes, at some point it also has an impact on the mind,” says Grace Geyoro. “It can be exhausting, especially when you see the [quality in the] team we have.”On Saturday, they start their latest mission at Euro 2025 against England in Zurich. It could not have been a tougher opening, the Lionesses having the last Euros in 2022 with a coach who also won the previous tournament, in 2019 with the Netherlands. The Dutch are also in France’s group in Switzerland, together with Wales.France have always had individual quality. As far as the 2000s there have been players such as Louisa Nécib Cadamuro, Camille Abily, Marie-Laure Delie, Sandrine Soubeyrand and Laura Georges, before the arrival of Eugénie Le Sommer and Wendie Renard. All of which begs the question: Why haven’t France triumphed in a major tournament.“If we knew why France weren’t winning, I think we’d have put things right by now,” says Abily, the fifth-most capped player inLes Bleueshistory with 183 caps between 2001 and 2017. “I think there’s a tendency in France to see football as an individual sport, thinking more about oneself before thinking about the team. That’s what’s been a bit lacking in the French team.”View image in fullscreenFrance suffer more tournament pain, going out to Brazil in the last eight of the Paris Olympics.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/ReutersGrace Geyoro agrees: “We’ve relied a lot on individuals, on the fact that one player can make the difference. Now we need to focus more on the collective, because we can only win together.”The team has often been shaken by internal conflicts, whether it bedisagreements with the coach Corinne Diacreor players clashing such as Kheira Hamraoui andAminata Diallo in 2021.Elise Bussaglia, who earned 192 caps between 2003 and 2019, says: “The group hasn’t always coped well, for various reasons. And it’s true that at one point it could have had a detrimental effect on our results.” One of the areas of tension was the disconnect between the players from Lyon, who were professionals at the time, and those from Juvisy (later Paris FC) and Paris Saint-Germain, who were still semi-professional.The current Chelsea head coach, Sonia Bompastor, touches on the subject in her bookUne vie de foot, which was published this year, writing: “We weren’t on the same wavelength at all, and we didn’t have the same conception of what it meant to be a footballer. For me, losing a match was the end of the world; not for them.”Abily, who is Bompastor’s assistant at Chelsea, insists that in her day, the team “didn’t realise” the quality it had. “I remember that when we qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2011, we said to ourselves: ‘Wow! That’s great, we’re here, we’ve qualified!”Bussaglia, who finished fourth with France at the 2011 World Cup and the following year’s Olympics, adds: “There are times when the French team should have at least won a medal, if not the title, and it didn’t happen. There needs to be a bit more of a winning culture. But it’s not just the federation, it’s everyone: the players, the staff, the fans, everyone. Around this French team, there’s still not enough desire to win.”Bompastor has also spoken about the lack of interest from the French FA in the women’s team in the past. “Nobody gave a damn about the French women’s team,” she wrote in her book. “We used to go and see Noël Le Graët, the president of the federation, to explain to him that the reason Lyon were European champions was because we’d put certain processes in place, and not because we’d gone off to summer camps with a singing coach [referring to Bruno Bini,Les Bleuescoach from 2007 to 2013 who wrote songs for the players]. The only thing that mattered to him was our popularity rating and our good image.”There was a feeling by some players that the French FA was using the women’s team to restore its reputation after the catastrophic 2010 World Cup when the men’s team went on strike and refused to train by staying on the team bus.A lack of ambition is no longer true today, says Eric Blahic, who was assistant coach to Corinne Diacre and then Hervé Renard (2023-24) and was delighted to see the latter end the “famous semi-final complex”. “For years, the girls were told that they had to be in the sem-finals,” he says. “That doesn’t mean anything. Third or fourth is not the same thing. You have to say: the objective is the final.”View image in fullscreenFrance head coach, Laurent Bonadei, describes his team as ‘outsiders’ for Euro 2025.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/APHe also rejects the idea that France have failed to go all the way because of a mental block. “In 1982, when the French men’s team played in the semi-final in Seville, when we led 3-1 and ended up being eliminated, people were already saying that it was mental problems. If that’s all it was, the federation would have taken action a long time ago.”Laurent Bonadei was appointed as Renard’s successor in August 2024 and since then a full-time mental performance coach, Thomas Sammut, has been part of the team “to break this glass ceiling”. He has made other changes too, dropping three key players – Le Sommer, Renard andKenza Dali – just before the Euros, saying that “if it doesn’t work you have to try something new”.Bonadei will also have to deal withLes Bleues’ misfortune when it comes to penalties in major tournaments. Bussaglia says of the Olympics semi-final defeat to Japan in 2012: “At the Olympics, in the semi-final, we were 2-1 down and I missed the penalty to make it 2-2. I’d never missed a penalty in my life but I missed that one.” Blahic, meanwhile, recalls the shootout loss to Australia in the 2023 World Cup, when Kenza Dali missed her spot kick against club teammate Mackenzie Arnold not once but twice as it was retaken. “All the girls had taken lots of penalties in training, in all different forms, against three different goalkeepers,” he explains.Bonadei prefers to refer to France as “outsiders” rather than favourites, despite having won their eight last games going into the tournament. “Confidence is good for developing our game, but overconfidence is the trap that awaits us,” warns Bonadei.In Switzerland there is unlikely to be overconfidence as France have to battle against not only their opponents, but their past too.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025France women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The bodies of the two professional footballers were returned toPortugallater that day. Jota was 28 and had married his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso, 11 days before his death. They had three young children.José Manuel Macedo, parish priest at the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar in São Cosme, said that a vigil for the brothers was taking place at the nearby Capela da Ressurreição on Friday before their funeral at the Igreja Matriz church on Saturday at 10am. Jota and Silva grew up in Gondomar, a small city east of Porto.Senseless death of Diogo Jota will not stop us celebrating what he brought life | Barney RonayRead moreLiverpool have chartered a plane to take club staff to Portugal before the funeral service.Liverpoolplayers, most of whom are currently on holiday, will also be in attendance. The majority were due to report back for the start of pre-season training early next week but all football-related activity at the club, from first team to academy level, has been put on hold. The club’s priority is supporting Jota’s bereaved family.On Friday Mohamed Salah said Jota’s death had left him dreading going back to Liverpool. “I am truly lost for words,” he wrote on social media. “Until yesterday, I never thought there would be something that would frighten me of going back to Liverpool after the break. Teammates come and go but not like this. It’s going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won’t be there when we go back.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Darwin Núñez and his partner Lorena Manas visit a public wake for Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva.Photograph: Octávio Passos/Getty Images“My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten.”Jota had been working with Dr Miguel Gonçalves in Portugal before his return to pre-season training, having undergone a procedure on his lung. In an interview with Portuguese media outlet Record, Dr Gonçalves said: “I said goodbye to him and his brother, André, at around 8.30pm. His brother was a great companion and decided to go with him, to accompany him on the trip, and that way they would also spend more time together.“They were going to travel at night because it was cooler, but they weren’t going direct. He told me that the journey would take about eight hours but that they would stop at a hotel in the Burgos area to rest. Diogo was very aware of his professionalism. They were only supposed to arrive in Santander today [Friday], catch the boat and then go to England. The family would arrive later by plane, organise their lives over the weekend and then, on Monday, they had a medical appointment scheduled in Liverpool to assess the situation.”Dr Gonçalves claimed Jota was receiving specialist treatment over a collapsed lung. He added: “I started working with him last Saturday and I was with him every day until this Wednesday. I said goodbye to him at dinner time. He made an extraordinary recovery, he was undoubtedly an unparalleled professional. He strictly followed what I told him, as you could see in the way he was recovering.“The base of his right lung had collapsed a little, but with the post-surgery physiotherapy he was practically flawless. When I left him yesterday he was no longer in pain and was going to return to Liverpool. He was excited, confident in his recovery and enthusiastic about the next season. He told me that he would not go on the pre-season tour that Liverpool is going to Japan to strengthen his recovery, he believed he was going to have a great season.”View image in fullscreenA visibly upset Jordan Henderson pays tribute to a former Liverpool teammate outside Anfield on Friday.Photograph: Temilade Adelaja/ReutersLiverpool players have spoken of their pain in paying tribute to their teammate. Virgil van Dijk, the captain, said on Instagram he was “absolutely devastated and in total disbelief”. The defender wrote in a post alongside a picture of Jota with the Premier League trophy: “What a human being, what a player, but most importantly what an unbelievable family man.“You meant so much to all of us and you always will! For your family to lose two sons, a husband and a father is just unimaginable. So cruel and unfair. My heart is breaking for all of your beautiful family, for Rute and for your kids. I promise you that in these difficult times and beyond we will always be there for your family.Diogo Jota gave Liverpool fans goals and a glorious song. He will never be forgotten | Sachin NakraniRead more“A champion forever, number 20 forever. It’s been a privilege to have stood by your side on the pitch, and to have been your friend off it. We will miss you beyond words and never forget you. Your legacy will live on, we will make sure of it! Rest in perfect peace Diogo & André.”Andy Robertson, a close friend of the popular striker, also paid an emotional tribute. “The ones I’m thinking about most right now are the family. Their loss is too much to bear,” the Scotland left-back posted on Instagram. “I’m so sorry that they have lost two such precious souls – Diogo and André. For the team and the club, we’ll try to cope with this together … however long that takes.“For me, I want to talk about my mate. My buddy. The bloke I loved and will miss like crazy. I could talk about him as a player for hours, but none of that feels like it matters right now. It’s the man. The person. He was such a good guy. The best. So genuine. Just normal and real. Full of love for the people he cared about. Full of fun. He was the most British foreign player I’ve ever met. We used to joke he was really Irish ... I’d try to claim him as Scottish. I even called him Diogo MacJota. We’d watch the darts together, enjoy the horse racing. Going to Cheltenham this season was a highlight – one of the best we had.“The last time I saw him was the happiest day of his life – his wedding day. I want to remember his never-ceasing smile from that magical day. How much he was bursting with love for his wife and family. I can’t believe we’re saying goodbye. It’s too soon, and it hurts so much. But thank you for being in my life, mate – and for making it better”.The former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson returned to Anfield on Friday to pay his own respects to Jota. Henderson was visibly moved as he laid flowers among the huge number of tributes to the striker and spent time reading some of the messages in memory of Jota and his brother. The Ajax captain, who played alongside Jota for three seasons, later signed the book of condolence that Liverpool have opened inside the stadium.“Jots it was a pleasure to share a pitch with you but more importantly a friendship,” Henderson wrote on Instagram. “All the laughs we had off the pitch and trying to find ways to wind milly [James Milner] up and get him fined, which we never could. Taking pictures of me asleep on the bus travelling then sending them to me later. You always wanted to have a laugh and were a pleasure to be around.“I know how much Rute and your family meant to you and I know you will always be looking down on them. Thank you for everything you brought into this world, we will all miss you.”A delegation from Everton that included their two Portuguese-born forwards Beto and Youssef Chermiti also visited Anfield to pay tribute to Jota, whose final goal came against them in the Merseyside derby in April. The Everton players and club ambassador Ian Snodin were applauded by Liverpool fans as they each left a wreath outside the stadium. One read: “Our city is united in grief. With deepest sympathy from all at Everton Football Club.”At Wimbledon, the Portuguese pair Nuno Borges and Francisco Cabral paid tribute to their compatriot by wearing black ribbons on court. Borges wore the item on his cap during his third-round singles match with 17th seed Karen Khachanov after Cabral donned one on his shirt sleeve during his doubles match earlier on Friday as the All England Club relaxed its strict all-white dress code to allow tributes to the Liverpool forward.Uefa has announced that a moment of silence will be observed at Women’s Euro 2025 matches on Friday, as they were on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFootballLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)PortugalEuropeDiogo JotanewsShareReuse this content"

Lauren Bell put down a tricky chance off Ghosh, diving forward at short fine leg, but Charlie Dean held on to a brilliant diving catch in the deep in the 19th to make good the error.India were left needing 12 from the final over, bowled by Bell, and six from the final ball, but Harmanpreet Kaur could only fire it straight into the hands of mid-off.Dunkley said: “I thought our bowlers did such a great job to take it that deep. We weren’t at our top in all three departments but we fought through it and we got the win, which is the most important thing.”It should never have got that close: earlier, England had suffered a mind-boggling late-innings collapse of nine for 31, ­squandering the hard-won ­advantage of a 137-run opening partnership between Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British & Irish Lions are still trying to construct the fundamental forward pillars underpinning their game while some key Wallaby figures are nursing injuries and are missing from their side’s warm-up game against Fiji. These are the moments when, behind the scenes, elite coaches really earn their money.Despite two comfortable victories on Australian soil so far, Andy Farrell will certainly be wanting his side to shift everything up a gear, both for the sake of the collective and their own individual ambitions. For one or two this is in effect a final trial for places in the Test matchday 23, particularly so in certain fiercely contested positions.A penny for the thoughts of Fin and Marcus Smith, for example, after thehigh-profile call-up of Owen Farrellto replace the injured Elliot Daly. Professional sport is a relentless dog-eat-dog world and there is a sense that Farrell Sr is seeking a bit more snarl and bite from his Lions, young and old, than he has seen to date.David Porecki returns to Wallabies team to face Fiji after 643-day international absenceRead moreIt certainly feels like one of the primary reasons he has opted to summon his son, whose competitive edge is never in doubt. And if Owen’s arrival does happen to coincide with the Lions’ most purposeful performance to date, will that be entirely coincidental? Andy Farrell is a proven winner and, as was the case with Warren Gatland’s decision to drop Brian O’Driscoll before the decisive final Test here in 2013, he has not travelled to Australia to enter a popularity contest.Ultimately his players all respect and understand that reality, not least those who have previously taken the field with Farrell Jr. “You don’t lose class,” stressed his England colleague Luke Cowan-Dickie, brushing aside any external doubts about the 33-year-old’s recent fitness and form issues. “Faz is a class player, so I’m well happy. He’s one of those players who will definitely add to the group.”Another squad member keen to renew old acquaintances is this weekend’s captain, Tadhg Beirne, who toured with Farrell in South Africa four years ago. “I’ll be really excited to see him,” insisted Beirne, after his team’s gentle eve-of- game session at the picturesque North Sydney Oval. “Playing with him four years ago I’ve seen all those leadership qualities that he brings. Any type of leadership is only going to enhance the squad.”Clearly they would say that – and this has not yet been a tour notable for its relaxed communications approach – but, equally, the most successful Lions tours are built on blunt honesty and a prevailing over-my-dead-body attitude. Chugging along against moderate opposition simply hoping for the best is not a recipe for guaranteed Test fulfilment.Hence why Farrell has been reluctant to shower his players with post-match platitudes, even though the Lions have so far scored 16 tries and 106 points in their two fixtures in Australia and have yet to concede a second-half point. To his mind the Lions’ defence has to be tighter in the first quarter of games, in particular. “We want to keep improving our defence because that’s the main thing you’d want to stand for. I know our defence has been pretty good but there’s still room for improvement.”Then there is the ever-crucial battle of the breakdown where Australia will definitely look to come hard in the Test series. If the Lions aspire to the high-tempo game that will give their talented backs the best chance of running free, their coaches have been re-emphasising the need to go harder around the contact area. “As a forward pack the main thing for us is just the ruck,” revealed James Ryan, Beirne’s fellow Ireland international. “The Waratahs put a huge amount of pressure on the ruck, they’ve the most amount of turnovers in Super Rugby. It’s just about getting that bit right and challenging them when we have the ball.”View image in fullscreenJames Ryan, who will start against the Waratahs, is wise to the threat the Lions face.Photograph: Steve Christo/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesHoping to stand firm, among others, will be the English-born flanker Jamie Adamson, formerly of Durham University and England sevens, who came out to Australia to play a season of local club rugby and, to his credit, now finds himself on the bench against the Lions. There will also be a familiar face in the home coaching box where Mike Catt, a Lion in 1997 and 2001, is now the attack coach.In the corresponding tour game on that 2001 expedition the Waratahs opted to “go the biff”, with Ronan O’Gara being infamously punched up to 11 times on the floor by the Waratahs’ Duncan McRae and Tom Bowman receiving a yellow card –there were five in the game– for catching Danny Grewcock with an elbow within three seconds of the kick- off. The then Lions coach Graham Henry called it “a black night for rugby” but Catt insists these are different times. “Those days are gone,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald. “It’s too fast. You can’t get away with it. Which Lions star are you going to rough up anyway? They have so many good players so they don’t really rely on one person, do they?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tupou needs a big game – he rarely has a small one, to be fair – to restore the faith of the Wallaby selectors, already minus the massive Will Skelton and Rob Valetini against Fiji on Sunday.Quick GuideNSW Waratahs v British & Irish Lions teamsShowSydney Football Stadium, Saturday 5 July, 8pm AEST/11am BSTNSW Waratahs:Creighton; Kellaway, Foketi, Walton, Lancaster; Bowen, Wilson; Lambert, Dobbins, Tupou, Lee-Warner, Amatosero, Leota, Gamble, Sinclair (capt).Replacements:Vailanu, Barrett, Botha, Philip, Adamson, Grant, Edmed, O’Donnell.British & Irish Lions:Keenan; Hansen, Jones, Tuipulotu, Kinghorn, F Smith, Mitchell; Schoeman, Cowan-Dickie, Bealham, Beirne (capt), Ryan, Pollock, Van der Flier, Earl.Replacements:Sheehan, Genge, Furlong, McCarthy, Cummings. Morgan, White, M Smith.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Lions front row, though, are united in their motivation to make their own sizeable impact, their props having even formed a clandestine tea-drinking society from which every other position is excluded. “We are like bison migrating together … we have a secret meeting every night,” revealed the ever-entertaining Pierre Schoeman, the Scotland loose-head who has rapidly forged a bond with England’s Ellis Genge.“I think loose-heads all around the world are very similar. They are quite weird people. Something isn’t right. We always say that playing rugby you must have a screw loose but playing rugby as a loose-head prop … I won’t even go into the tight-head props. We’re different but similar. We are almost like a gladiator when all the gladiators come together.”Which just leaves the squad’s scrum coach John Fogarty – “he has the key for the cage to unlock the gladiators, that’s probably the best way to describe him” – with the job of harnessing all this latent horsepower and encouraging the Lions to unleash hell. Lay down a properly physical marker now and the pressure on Australia will further increase.Explore more on these topicsBritish & Irish LionsLions tour 2025Rugby unionAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But voters don’t quite view it that wayFri 4 Jul 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 13.56 EDTShareHe doesn’t look like the innovative type, butKeir Starmeris staging a radical experiment. He is testing out a theory of politics a matter of months after it was seemingly – and spectacularly – disproved and, in the process, hoping to pull off a turnaround that would constitute a comeback so stunning it would be closer to a resurrection.The theory in question is that if you deliver practical improvements to the lives of voters, they will reward you at the ballot box. Its guiding principle is “show, don’t tell”, with the emphasis on results rather than talk, pragmatism rather than ideology. He’s not the first to try it: this was also the animating creed ofJoe Biden’s presidency– and we know how that worked out.So far the approach seems to be bearing similarly sour fruit in Britain. As Starmer marks one year since his landslide victory, Labour has suffered thebiggest post-election dropin public approval since the Conservatives were tanked by Black Wednesday in 1992. The prime minister’s personal numbers are the lowest ever recorded for a PM 12 months in: his net approval stands at -54 points. At the equivalent moment in October 2023, Rishi Sunak scored -37. No one has ever come back up from such depths.The PM appears unfazed by all this. It’s not that he insists he knows how to climb out of the current hole; rather, he refuses to accept he or his government are in a hole at all. He has a list of first-year achievements he is proud of and, besides, he believes he was written off once before, early in his spell as leader of the opposition – only to plough on, methodically reaching each of the milestones he had set himself and, finally, to win.By way of an anniversary gift, let’s assess Starmer as he wants to be assessed. Let’s put aside the various missteps of the past year as “noises off”, or as the mere teething pains of a new government. Let us look past both the fiasco of this week’s near-defeat on welfare, staved off only by a series of panicked concessions and U-turns, and last summer’s baffling determination to strangle at birth any feelgood factor that may have greeted the ejection of a despised Tory government, filling the air instead with gloom and the promise that things would get worse before they got better. Let’s not dwell on the one act of these past 12 months thatcut through mostto voters: the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance from millions of pensioners.Let us instead judge Labour on its own terms: delivery. On that list of Starmer’s, there’s a decent range of items, from thethree trade dealsthat had eluded the Conservatives – with the US, EU and India – to a fall in NHS waiting lists, down to their lowest level in two years; from the expansion of free school meals provision to increased wages. The trouble is, none of those achievements goes anywhere close to repairing the damage Labour itself says was done over the past decade and a half.Inside Downing Street, they still profess their shock at the state they found the country in. Whether it’sovercrowded prisonsor a dysfunctional water industry, so much is “busted”. It is a herculean task to turn all that around, and especially to do it fast – all the more so when there is so little money to spend. Starmer might be calm about the fact that a great change hasn’t happened within a year, but it requires a Panglossian optimism to believe it will come even within five, in time for the next election.In whichever direction you look, delivery is maddeningly hard. To take just one example, the government has won plaudits for its first moves on housing, including a target of an additional 1.5m homes in England by 2029. That means building 300,000 each year. But for the most recent 12-month period, the tally stood atjust over 200,000. If everything goes right, Labour’s planning reforms should eventually boost housebuilding by 25% – but that still won’t be enough to reach its goal.Still, let’s be like Starmer and hope his various plans work and the government really does deliver. The lesson of Biden is that even that won’t be enough. In fairness, Labour’s high command does get that point, acknowledging mere “lines on a graph” or stats won’t cut it. The improvement has to befeltin people’s lives.And yet, that too may not be sufficient. Voters don’t usually go in for gratitude; they are as likely to credit themselves as the government for a material advance in their circumstances. What’s needed, and Team Starmer swear they understand this too,is a story, a narrative of where the country has been and where it could go next, that the public can follow.Land on the right one, and it gives you the time and space this government has been denied. Margaret Thatcher’s self-proclaimed mission to wean Britain off a sclerotic state was compelling enough to make a virtue even of economic hardship: the bitterness of her medicine was deemed proof that it was working. With no equivalent story, every setback of Starmer’s is taken in isolation, evidence that the government doesn’t know what it’s doing. The PM offers no persuasive explanation of what is happening or why it may take a while. That wrecks a party’s relationship with the electorate, obviously, but alsowith its own MPs, as the increasingly restive and frustrated parliamentary Labour party attests.For all the errors and crises, the blight on Starmer’s first year is still the lack of vision | Martin KettleRead moreMost Labour folk admit this narrative weakness is their achilles heel, and that it stems from a deficiency in the leader himself. A lawyer, a technocrat, a manager: whatever word they use to describe the prime minister, no one ever accuses him of being a storyteller.The man who seems least worried by this narrative void is Starmer himself. The formative experience of his (short) political career was his early tenure as Labour leader, half a decade ago. Trailing far behind his then opponent, he read commentaries daily telling him that Boris Johnson was going to dominate British politics for the next 10 years and that his destiny was to replicate Neil Kinnock as a transitional figure, preparing the ground for someone else more capable of winning. Those prognosticators got him wrong then and, he believes, they have got him wrong now.Besides, in his mind, the narrative of his government is obvious. How could anyone look at all he has done so far and not see that the common thread is an earnest effort to improve the lives of ordinary working men and women? To him, it’s so clear it scarcely needs to be spelled out.Unfortunately, as the last US president discovered, everything needs to be spelled out, a hundred times a day, on every conceivable platform and very loudly. The days of quiet, patient, unflashy achievement, eventually recognised by a grateful electorate, are long gone, if they ever existed. Starmer and those around him need to adapt to that reality soon. If he fails, there is a grinning master of the new politics, who revels in the primacy of talk over action, of grievance over solution, who is currently10 points ahead– and waiting to pounce.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Many have tried and failed to create one that wins and then holds a significant number of seats in parliament.Labour, founded 125 years ago, has been the only successful example. Others have been defeated by the electoral system, the sheer number of interests ranged against the left, loyalty to Labour and the left’s tendency to over-promise and quarrel.Could Zarah Sultana’ssudden announcementlast night that she “will co-lead the founding of a new party” with Jeremy Corbyn and other “independent MP’s… and activists across the country” – a statement that he did notacknowledgeuntil lunchtime today – finally begin to change the rigid shape of British left-of-centre politics? And would that help the left – or help destroy it?The 31-year-old MP for Coventry South, who had already been suspended from Labour last yearfor opposingits retention of the two-child benefit cap, is usuallyone of the most effective political communicators in the country. She has more followers on TikTok thanany MP except Nigel Farage. Unlike him, she has an ability to talk with moral force and clarity: about Palestine, inequality, the rightward shift of Keir Starmer’s government and other issues particularly important to Britain’s large minority of leftwing voters, a neglected electoral bloc since Corbyn’s Labour leadership ended in 2020.She has been the great hope of some on the left for years. As a young woman and a Muslim, she represents parts of the population where the left remains strong. As an MP for a seat in the Midlands, one of the few Labour MPs to increase their majority at the last election, she has succeeded, so far, in the kind of place where the left needs to do better, away from its metropolitan heartlands. In 2022, after only three years in parliament, and with Starmer struggling as Labour leader, as he is now, she was already being spoken of by some on the left of the party as hispotential challenger.Who’s really to blame for Labour’s troubles – Rachel Reeves or the invisible PM? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThat won’t happen now, as she has resigned from Labour. But the prospectof her building a new party with Corbyn has considerable potential. As his comfortable victory over Labour as an independent candidate at last year’s election showed, the 76-year-old MP for Islington North remains a much better electoral politician than many of his enemies think. His decades of experience, connections right across the left and continuing moral authority for millions of Britons – especially as his criticisms of Starmer and Israel are ever more borne out by events – could dovetail well with Sultana’s more youthful and abrasive brand of politics. And with Labour in crisis, leftwing ideas such as nationalisation back in fashion, and the electorate more fragmented and fickle than it has probably ever been, conditions for a new leftwing party are unusually favourable.Yet difficulties remain. One is that the Green party is already absorbing some of the left’s talent and energy, especially with the leftwingerZack Polanskistanding for its leadership.Another is deciding exactly what form a new leftwing party should take. Should it stand in local and parliamentary elections as soon as possible – or should it build an activist movement first, establishing its credibility in communities? And should it try to mobilise across the country – or should it concentrate its almost certainly limited resources on a few winnable seats?Leftists have been debating and pondering these questions for months, which is one reason why the new party, discussed at private and public gatherings since at least last autumn, has yet to assume a definite shape. Today, Corbyn finally said that he was “delighted” that Sultana “will help us build a real alternative. The democratic foundations of a new kind of political party will soon take shape. Discussions are ongoing…”. As for who should lead it, he did not say. An unhurried politician by nature, he has spent much of the year since the election working with the other four leftwing independent MP’s to create and solidify the Independent Alliance, which has as many representatives in the Commons as Reform UK.Yet one of the lessons of our unstable politics over the past decade is that things can happen slowly and then very fast. Now that Sultana has made her move, having reportedly considered her options for months, she and Corbyn may quickly get over any tactical differences, as leftwing activists are drawn to their project and the scale of its opportunity dawns.For Labour, in the middle of its worst week in office so far, the new partycould be a serious threat. Even if it only wins a few seats, or none, it could split the left-of-centre vote across the country. Reform could be the ultimate beneficiaries of Starmer’s carelessly contemptuous treatment of the left.But there is another possibility. If the next election leaves a hung parliament, which looks increasingly likely, a new leftwing party with, say, a dozen MPs, could hold the balance of power. Coalition talks between Corbyn, Sultana and their old party would be interesting.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZarah SultanaOpinionLabourJeremy CorbynKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Do you crave being cosseted and showered with gifts, having every door opened and every chair pulled out? Perhaps you’d rather not pay for your clothes; maybe you’re sick of deciding what to eat and where.Courtney Palmer can help. The self-proclaimed housewife princess has a series of TikTok videos on “princess treatment” and how to get it. It’s a matter of accepting compliments graciously, dressing the part, being unapologetically good to yourself (disappointingly, this seems to mean exercising and drinking water) but mostly ministering to your partner, who is treated as a weirdly needy and highly suggestible man-baby. Would-be princesses should create a calm, frictionless domestic paradise for their provider prince, “speaking in a feminine way – we’re not screaming, yelling; we’re not cursing”, thanking him for picking up his dirty underwear. Princess treatment is the reward and it comes in the form ofdiamond earrings, Chanel flats, flowers and old-school chivalry.It’s emetic and, in a recent TikTok that catapulted Palmer into a more critical spotlight, disturbing. Explaining what princess treatment looks likeat a restaurant, Palmer said: “I do not interact with the waitress; I do not open any doors and I do not order my own food … You do not need to talk unless you are spoken to … You’re not going to be laughing loudly, speaking loudly, demanding the attention of the restaurant.” Yikes.Palmer called it “letting your husband lead and be masculine” and “a fun princess treatment thing”. Commenters found it cult-like, concerning and bizarre. “As a former waitress, I would have slipped you a note and asked if you’re OK or if I should call the police,” one said.Welcome to the femosphere, the latest dark, toxic corner of the internet… for womenRead moreI do wonder how real any of this is. Does “princess treatment” exist beyond its social-media shop window? Tradwives aren’t tradwives, after all – they are content creators, and winding people up with jaw-droppingly regressive gender messaging generates revenue: outrage drives eyeballs and eyeballs mean dollars. Nara Smith, famed for wearing OTT dresses while making her own bubblegum and breakfast cereal, was recently reported byCosmopolitanto be earning an estimated $200,000 a month on TikTok.Most relationships are nothing like what Palmer presents, or like otherpearly-toothed, wholesome TikTok coupleswho jokily quiz each other on what constitutes princess treatment or a relationship “bare minimum”. My own husband occasionally gives me “goose treatment” – a careful wide berth – but our marriage is not a transactional game. Couples of all varieties mostly muddle through, trying to be decent to each other.But Palmer et al are servicing areal aspiration, or at least a relatable fantasy. I get it, kind of – it would be nice if every day were like my birthday (but not nice enough to spend my life cooking and cleaning while wearing broderie anglaise to achieve it). And I suppose that in a time of global turmoil, having a “provider” can feel like security. But it’s the opposite: relinquishing autonomy – bodily, financial, intellectual – leaves women dangerously vulnerable.And this stuff isn’t anodyne: it confirms the manosphere’s misogynistic assumptions about “alphas” and “high-value females”, and empowers rollers-back of reproductive rights, reinforcing the idea that it’s OK to take decisions on women’s behalf (they don’t even want to order a side of fries for themselves!).I was a big orca fan – but their skincare regime is giving me the ick | Emma BeddingtonRead moreThe “princess” label is pretty accurate. Historically, princesses provided beauty and babies, and were largely powerless; royal marriages were transactional arrangements. Andas Hilary Mantel was unfairly criticisedfor writing about the then-Duchess of Cambridge, princess life is still stultifying, mostly about projecting irreproachable, mute perfection. There’s definitely no “cursing”.Maybe some women enjoy imagining a life of calm, cared-for passivity – but could content at least get more creative? How about “goddess treatment”: demand offerings and sacrifices, keep people on their toes with the prospect of being turned into something nasty?If that’s not passive enough, how about “pet treatment”? Imagine being treated like a house cat: loved unconditionally and lavished with gifts for nothing more than napping, shedding hair, eating, demanding strokes and occasionally lashing out for no reason. If a TikToker could tell me how to get “cat treatment”, I’d definitely like and follow.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Cue a wave of commentary pitting “big pharma” against fitness, as if we must choose between pills and planks. It’s an appealing narrative – but it’s also misleading.We don’t need to choose between the two. In fact, the best health outcomes often come from combining medicine with a broader view of health that includes movement, diet, social connection and mental wellbeing.Let’s consider whatthe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, actually looked at. It focused on colon cancer – the third-most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Between 2009 and 2024, researchers set up a randomised trial across 55 centres – mainly in Australia and Canada – where 889 patients who had had surgery for colon cancer, and who had completed chemotherapy, were split into two groups randomly. Over a three-year period, one group received a structured exercise programme (the exercise group of 445 patients) and the other received health education materials alone (the health education group of 444 patients).One thing you may already have clocked here is that the patients all received chemotherapy after their cancer surgery. So nothing about the experiment put exercise head-to-head with cancer medicines. Instead, they asked what kind of exercise support after surgery and chemotherapy treatments might improve overall health, and potentially keep the cancer from recurring.The structured exercise group received health education materials, such as an exercise guidebook for colon cancer survivors, and support from a certified personal trainer for three years. In the first six months, they received 12 mandatory in-person behavioural-support sessions, 12 mandatory supervised exercise sessions plus 12 optional supervised exercise sessions. Over the next two and a half years, the frequency of in-person and supervised sessions slowly decreased to help patients transition to more independent exercise routines. In contrast, the health education group received only general health education materials on the benefits of physical activity and a healthy diet.At a median follow-up of almost eight years, disease-free survival was significantly longer in the structured exercise group (90.3%) than in the health education group (83.2%). Both groups increased their physical activity levels over the three years, but the structured exercise group met the goal of increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity. This roughly added to their existing activity levels about an hour of brisk walking three to four times a week or a 30-minute jog three to four times a week. The better health outcomes could also be linked to the social contact that patients in the exercise group had, given they were enrolled in a structured and supervised programme with a personal trainer to support them and not left on their own.What struck me, and the authors, from their study is that knowledge alone – even among those who have had colon cancer and have been advised to exercise – isn’t enough to shift activity levels. Structure, supervision and social contact matter. Being told to “move more” is easy. Actually changing your habits – especially after cancer treatment – is hard. That transition requires coaching, encouragement, and the support and time to build confidence.We have known for a long time that a generally physically and socially healthy life can be very effective in warding off disease, even cancer. What this study actually gives us is some direction for the best way to make that happen, and a look at how positive the effects can really be.Perhaps I’m biased as a personal trainer, but structured exercise is one of the best investments you can make for your health – whether it’s in recovery from cancer or trying to prevent getting cancer. This doesn’t have to be one-on-one gym sessions, which can be costly and out of reach for many. It could be joining affordable boot camps in the park – that cost as much as your morning latte – or free classes in discount gym chains. Plus, you might make a few new friends and improve your social life too. The real headline isn’t that exercise is better than drugs for cancer recovery. It’s that just telling people to move without offering support – ie the health education movement – isn’t enough.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsCancerOpinionBowel cancerHealthMedical researchCancer researchcommentShareReuse this content"

Any government will oppress its people if not constantly and inventively challenged. And the task becomes ever-more urgent as new technologies of surveillance and control are developed.The UK government is run by a former human rights lawyer. Its home secretary, Yvette Cooper, hasexpressed her admirationfor the Suffragettes in parliament. Yet such credentials do nothing to defend us from attacks on our fundamental rights. With a huge majority, no formal constitutional checks and a ruthless, scarcely accountable governing machine, this administration is abusing its power to an even greater extent than its Conservative predecessors.Though there is tough competition, Cooper’sproscriptionof the protest group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act 2000 is probably the most illiberal thing any home secretary has done in 30 years. If Palestine Action’slegal challengeto the order fails, you could receive 14 years in jail as a terrorist merely for expressing support. It’s a massive threat to the right to protest and to free speech.In 2001, as the act came into force,I warnedthat it could be used to ban nonviolent protest groups and imprison those who support them. Supporters of Tony Blair’s government told me I was talking rubbish: its purpose was to keep us safe from people who wanted to kill and maim us. At the time, Cooper was a junior minister. She must have known what the act could do. Now she vindicates the warning.Like the drafting of theTory anti-protest laws, this application of the act appears to be a response to lobbyists. The junktanks ofTufton Street, in concert with the billionaire media, have called forever-more extreme measuresfor protesters demonstrating against the genocide in Gaza. The government seems to have beensharing the contact detailsof police and crown prosecutors with the Israeli embassy: there appears to be deep entanglement between domestic law enforcement and the interests of a foreign state.In response to lobbying, the UK has become arguably themost repressiveofall nominal democracies. Both in legislation and application, it looks more like a repressive autocracy. You can see this not only in theextreme sentencesfor peaceful protest but also in the extraordinary double standards deployed – a classic sign of theauthoritarian mindset: “for my friends everything, for my enemies the law”. While climate protesters are arrested for setting foot in the road, even when a group of farmers in tractorsblocked the roadwhere Keir Starmer was giving a speech, forcing him to flee, not only were no arrests made but, as far as I can discover, no minister said a word about it.Pressure grows on Yvette Cooper to abandon plans to ban Palestine ActionRead moreFar from repealing the draconian anti-protest laws imposed by the Tories, Labour is augmenting them with a clause (section 124) slipped into the currentcrime and policing bill. Scarcely noticed by either legislators or the public, it greatly increases police powers to stifle protest. The police will be able to ban demonstrations close to a place of worship that they decide could be intimidating to worshippers. As almost every urban area contains a place of worship, this empowers the police, using only their own discretion, to shut down any expression of dissent.Palestine Action is not a danger to democracy. But Cooper is. I have no doubt that, were they active today, the home secretary would proscribe as a terrorist organisation the Suffragettes she claims to honour.One of the causes of the global democratic recession is the escalating inequality of arms between governments and their people. At the time of the French Revolution, governments feared the people, as the distance between pikes and pitchforks was not so great. But as states developed ever-more sophisticated weapons, their powers could no longer be matched by those they sought to crush. In combination with facial recognition technology, now beingwidely deployed in the UKamong many other nations, autonomous weapons systems, for both military and civil use, would greatly increase the distance between state and citizen power. This is the future we appear to be rushing towards, with scarcely any democratic debate.All over the world, autonomous weapons systems are in development, largely for use in warfare. Ukraine and Russia are in the midst of arobot arms race, accelerating at shocking speed. In Gaza, Israel hasautomated its target selection, with horrifying results.Why is Palestine Action being banned and what happens next?Read moreAs security sourcesexplainedto +972 magazine in April 2024, Israel’sLavender AIprogram had marked about 37,000 Palestinians as suspected “Hamas militants”, selecting them as potential targets for assassination. A further program, with the sinister name of Where’s Daddy?, was tracking them to their homes so that they could be bombed at night, often killing not only their families but many other people in the same block. “Once you go automatic,” one of the sources told the journal, “target generation goes crazy.” Almost everyone in Gaza had been given a Lavender rating of between 1 and 100. As soon as the number in the AI system was high enough, the name wouldbe added to the kill list. That would be treated as a military order, even though the operators knew that at least 10% of the targets were misidentified.Anyone who imagines that such systems would not be embraced by governments for use against their citizens is deceiving themselves. As autonomous target selection aligns with the autonomous delivery of munitions, which could range from teargas to rubber bullets to metal bullets, governments will acquire terrifying new powers to contain dissent. Real robocops are likely to have propellers, not legs.As theStop Killer Robotscampaign points out, such machines dehumanise us: we become a set of data points, to be interpreted by an algorithm. Once an autonomous weapons system has been programmed, oppressive regimes can absolve themselves of responsibility for what it does. AIreinforces prejudiceand discrimination: the way it develops ensures that Black and brown people and other minorities targeted by the police will be disproportionately selected.Once such systems are in place, they will be very hard to dismantle. When you create a market you create a lobby, and the lobby will insist on retaining and expanding its investments. Autonomous weapons systems, for both military and civilian use, should beprohibited under international lawbefore they progress any further.Technologies of control are ramping up while democratic rights are ramping down. We drift towards extreme political repression, driven by the demands of capital and foreign states, accelerated by automation. This is why we must protest – now, while we still can.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests discussing the forces driving climate denialism, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

Did we grow up – or get boring?Fri 4 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 09.01 EDTShareOasis didn’t invent the concept of the gobby, tabloid-baiting British rock’n’roll star, but they did perfect it. Combining the Beatles’ irreverent cheek, Sex Pistols’ raucous hedonism and Morrissey’s dour Mancunian wit, the Gallagher brothers arrived in 1994 with their comedy act – built around acerbic sibling banter and knowingly ludicrous levels of braggadocio – down pat. For the music press, they really were God’s gift: inone their earliest interviews, Liam informed Melody Maker that he pitied “anyone who doesn’t buy our records,” while Noel insisted they were planning to win the Eurovision song contest with a new number called All Around the World. “It’ll sail it by at least, ooh, 30 points. This is the track to end all tracks.”Oasis split in 2009, but the bon mots that buoyed Britpop and Cool Britannia kept flowing – three decades on from their debut, the brothers’ rivalry, egotism and brutal putdowns still power a significant subsection of our news cycle. You couldn’t claim it overshadowed their music – the majesty of Oasis’s biggest hits drowns out any petty squabbling – but since the band’s heyday ended the Gallaghers have been dealing primarily in persona. When the 1975’s Matty Healy claimed that “the difference between me and Noel is that I do a series of interviews to promote an album, whereas he does an album to promote a series of interviews”, he wasn’t far off.In some ways, the Gallaghers’ lasting legacy is this archetype: the mercilessly funny, unapologetically arrogant yet resolutely down-to-earth British rock star. But as they return to the stage on Friday, does that pisstaking and swagger feel outdated? Or has British music got wretchedly dull and safe without it?In the 1990s, they embodied new laddism – football, pints, loutish demeanour, but make it self-aware – and while their Britpop peers were more sensitive (Damon Albarn later likened them to school bullies), their mouthiness was mirrored in the era’s pop giants including the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams. By the 2000s, it certainly seemed like everybody was reading from the same hymn sheet. An indie scene’s young stars were reared on Oasis (a proto Arctic Monkeys mimed to Morning Glory in primary school assembly; an adorable 18-year-old Pete Doherty informed a news crew that he subscribed “to the Umberto Eco view” of the band in the release day queue for Be Here Now) and were cultivated by a music press scrambling to anoint new headline-generating stars in the Gallagher vein. “Oasis have gone, WE are the biggest band in Britain now,” declared Kasabian on the front of the NME, while Lily Allen’s cover came accompanied by the strapline: “I can’t stop slagging people off!”View image in fullscreenThe great pretenders … Kasabian in 2015.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFor Allen and a new generation of female singers – Amy Winehouse, Kate Nash, Adele – loudmouthery was practically a prerequisite to success. As Sylvia Patterson put it in this newspaper: “In 2008, it’s still all about the gobby young girls.” Blur v Oasis may have been long dormant at this point, but copycat feuds were being ignited at a rate of knots: Kasabian v Keane; Allen v Cheryl Cole; Winehouse v Dido. Still, nobody had one-liners as perfect as the Gallaghers, from Liam’s assertion that Chris Martin looked like a geography teacher to Noel’s claim that the Libertines resembled “lads with no teeth and their grandad’s hats”.Other artists still don’t match up, but that’s mainly because slagging off other musicians has been largely erased from the rock star playbook. Telling it like it is with an exquisitely comic turn of phrase may seem like harmless fun; in reality, it is usually synonymous with body shaming (or worse). Nowadays, nobody wants to be offensive, nobody wants to traumatise – it’s not cool to be casually cruel, and the combination of virulent online fanbases and cancel culture mean it’s too risky anyway.Oasis’s brand of cocksure self-confidence, though, is in rude health. At last weekend’s Glastonbury, fellow Mancunian Healy (a “slack-jawed fuckwit,” according to Noel) declared himself the “best songwriter of [his] generation,” as graphics mocking his lyrics flashed up on the screens around him. Charli xcx brought the party-starting egomania, while CMAT declared she had “an amazing ass and the best Irish country rock’n’roll band in the world.” A group of working-class, betracksuited lads who like drugs, pubs and incendiary jokes performed one of the festival’s most popular sets.View image in fullscreenSelf-confidence … CMAT performing at Glastonbury.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockAnd yetKneecapare in many ways the inverse of Oasis. While Noel has been busy lambasting Glastonbury as “woke”, “preachy” and “virtue-signalling”, the Belfast band doubled-down on their protest against the genocide in Gaza, while maintaining their original MO of promoting Irish language and culture. In fact, this year’s festival proved that the no-fucks-given gobbiness of Oasis has been redirected to earnestly expressed humanitarianism. The outspoken, straight-talking indie musician Nadine Shah read out an open letter in support of Palestine Action, while Kate Nash generated column inches with her expletive-laden tirade against JK Rowling and transphobia (which “is not fucking feminist”), something CMAT has also spoken passionately against.Now, you might argue, is not the time for rock stars in the Oasis mould: empty bluster and nasty (if amusing) zingers directed at peers isn’t exactly fun escapism in the Trumpian age. Yet the Gallaghers did stand for something. One accusation directed towards Oasis is that they made guitar music blander, and you could say they did the same for the rock star persona, too. They were never boring, but beyond the banter there was nothing particularly wild or weird about them; they were missing the Beatles’s zaniness, Sex Pistols’ radical sneer, Morrissey’s intellectual snobbery.However, in the wake of the upwardly mobile 1980s, they exemplified and glorified run-of-the-mill life and run-of-the-mill people: like much of the best British culture, they made normality seem valuable and worthwhile. Oasis always aimed to be accessible – in that Melody Maker interview, Noel said he made music for “the guy who walks down the street to get his copy of the fucking Daily Mirror and his 20 Bensons every day, and who’s got fuck all going for him”. He and Liam grew up on a council estate. In a rock and pop scene currently dominated by the middle classes and graduates of the Brit school, it is hard to find an equivalent trajectory.What would British culture be like if Oasis had never existed? | Dorian LynskeyRead moreThis is just one reason the search for the new Oasis – once the chief preoccupation of a now severely diminished music press – has ground to a halt, for better (no more bullying jibes) or worse (no more jokes). One consolation: despite their wealth and fame, Liam and Noel have stayed as consistent and normal as you might reasonably hope; they didn’t move to LA, they didn’t find enlightenment, they didn’t become right-wing edgelords (for all that Noel occasionally grumbles about the left) and they haven’t got entirely lost in their own legend (just before Oasis split, Noel described his guitar playing as “average at best”). We may not have any worthy successors to what many consider the platonic ideal of British rock stardom, but for this summer at least, we do still have Oasis.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockKneecapcommentShareReuse this content"

The audience gasped and the markets plunged. The critics loved it. Foreigners are famously envious of British politics played as fun.I always thought it cruel to attack a person in tears. Tell that to the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch. Hersavaging of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, at prime minister’s questions (PMQs) on Wednesday might have been a scene from Les Misérables. It was great theatre, but what had it to do with governing the country?The issue at stake, the runaway cost of sickness and disability benefits, was always clear. The number of new disability benefit claimants betweenJuly 2021 and July 2022 doubled. A welfare reform bill, introduced by the new Labour government, was an emergency stopgap, curbing some payments and saving about £5bn a year.Badenoch declared that the billdid not go far enoughand should have been more radical. To the casual observer this bordered on hypocrisy, since she had sat in the cabinet that ran this system. At the very least, she could have accepted the bill as a move in the right direction and voted in its favour. The bill was a curb on public spending, which Badenoch supported in principle, and an attempt to avoid raising taxes, which she also supported. It might even go some way to meeting the £7bn a year forthe HS2 project, which Reeves still lacks the guts to cancel.Most of Europe’s democratic assemblies, such as Germany’s Bundestag or France’s National Assembly, see legislative compromise as the outcome of shifting coalitions. Britain is hopeless at forming such coalitions. They go against the grain of the petty bickering and staged insults with which theHouse of Commonswhiles away its time.The greatest tragedy in recent British politics was the failure of Jeremy Corbyn’sLabourMPs to forge an alliance with Theresa May’s anti-Brexit Tories to back her soft Brexit bill in 2019. She lost and eventually fell. Corbyn’s MPs preferred to see her squirm at the dispatch box rather than do the right thing for the country. Labour could have averted much of the Brexit disaster, but crucifying May was more fun.There was initially some talk of the Tories supporting Starmer’s original bill and voting it through against the rebel Labour backbenchers. It was better than no bill, and Badenoch could have revelled in Starmer having to rely on her. Any time you need help running the country, she could have said, just knock on my door. Always happy to oblige. Tony Blair borrowed half his policies from the Thatcher/Major era. Join the club, Starmer.Reports indicate that the shadow cabinet did indeeddiscuss this possibility. Some members were prepared to show themselves ready to act in the national interest as a responsible governing party. Others were more downmarket. For them, being in opposition meant a good scrap and Starmer writhing in pain. Badenoch decided to go with the latter view.In the event, Starmer won a stripped-down bill and was indeed humiliated, but by his own side. It is thanks to the Tories that welfare reform will nowonly save £2bnrather than £5bn a year of taxpayers’ money, and taxes may rise as a result. All the Tory leader had in return was a few seconds on television being brutal to Reeves. The tactics adopted by her parliamentary party bordered on the childish.There is no doubt that Badenoch has brought an aggressive voice to the theatre of British politics. Nowadays, virtually the only time MPs crowd the chamber or appear on television is for PMQs. The undergraduate badinage suits the 24/7 style of news and the increasingly short-term nature of policymaking. It suits Badenoch’s fondness for going on the attack.Another tragic fact about this disastrous welfare bill: it proves Labour hasn’t learned and doesn’t truly listen | Polly ToynbeeRead moreShe is less good at defence. She hasrefrained from making policydeclarations or stating any ideological beliefs, protesting that she is too far from an election to take such risks. This is understandable, but it leaves her exposed as little more than a partisan figure. She may try to upstage Reform UK’s Nigel Farage at every turn, but she makes him seem almost emollient and broad-minded amid her unreasonable barrages.Badenoch seems to crave enemies rather than friends. She is under persistent pressure to come out fighting. But leaders who become prisoners of their court circle tend to come to grief. Just now there are plenty of knives sticking into Starmer. The Tory leader need not add to their number. She should rather develop a character of her own above the fray.That is why Badenoch should have voted for Starmer’s bill. She should have taken on the role of a responsible leader ready to assist in the conduct of the nation’s affairs. Instead she chose merely to assail a weeping chancellor in distress.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionWelfareConservativesLabourBenefitsHouse of CommonsKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

But a brutal week revealed he hasn’t delivered it, and his failure to lead with vision may be his undoingFri 4 Jul 2025 12.54 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 13.51 EDTShare“Nothing is inevitable until it happens,” wrote AJP Taylor, rejecting the idea that history unfolds according to a plan. Taylor distrusted grand visions.Sir Keir Starmerseems afraid to have one. A year into power, the prime minister doesn’t act like a man chosen by history, but one hoping to avoid its glare. Modern politics shifts quickly and governing as if nothing has changed is a risk. Yet Sir Keir treats pragmatism as principle and surrounds himself with advisers recyclingNew Labour-erahabits: technocracy, market deference andfiscal discipline.In a world of Trumpianshocksandgeopoliticalrealignments, that strategy risks looking less like responsible government than crippling rigidity. What once passed for prudence now borders on denial. Change is happening regardless; the onlychoiceis how to meet it. Retreating to the relative safety of the global stage is no substitute for leadership. Sir Keir cuts a confident figure abroad. At home, the instincts stumble. When a rebellion gutted his own government’sdisability benefit cuts, he blamed his failure to grip the issue on being “heavily focused” on foreign affairs. In seeking gravitas overseas, he found mutiny at home.The prime minister seems like a politician suited to managing decline, rather than overcoming it. Rather than offer a transformativevision, he aims to stabilise a reeling country after a decade of tumult. He is not aThatcheror Attlee. His gamble is that, in a chaotic time, people do not want a charismatic leader; just someone who won’t make it worse. But his year in office has been marked by churn with little direction. By avoiding Labour values, he dulls the party’s voice on justice and solidarity. Under Sir Keir, Labour has consistently misread where its electoral threats lie. While it obsesses over the radical right, theleftis regrouping, young voters are alienated and Muslim support is fracturing. If a charismatic leftwing rival emerges, Labour’selectoral coalitioncould be seriously damaged.Sir Keir hasmissions; the electorate has other ideas. In 2024 Britainvotedfor change. In a moment of rupture what cuts through isn’t often competence but conviction and the ability to summon belief, not just manage process. A leader needs more than detailed plans; they need to make history feel possible again. In a nation riven by anger, inequality and economic torpor, the prime minister offers normality and patience. But post-Covid thenational moodhas moved past what he’s willing to provide.The prime minister is a serious and cautious politician, favouring small steps. But a structurally and emotionally broken Britain requires more than moderate gradualism. This week’srebellionhas left him detached from the mechanics of leadership and exposed as being uncomfortable with the demands ofintraparty politics. There’s a small and shrinking chance he is theright leaderfor a damaged but fixable Britain. However, thepollssuggest he is on course to be the last steward of a disappearing post‑2008 order. Sir Keir is not flippant, nor obviously cynical. But nor is he the man many imagined when he ran for Labour leader. The question ofauthenticityshadows his pragmatism.After a decade ofausterity,stagnant living standardsand eroded institutional legitimacy, the country Sir Keir leads feels no longer patient – or stable – enough for the kind of politics he believes in. Whether he can change that, or is already being shaped by forces beyond his control, remains to be seen.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet one of the less convincing moments inJurassic World Rebirth, the latest in the franchise, is unrelated to oversized velociraptors. It’s the palaeontologist Dr Henry Loomiscomplaining of shrinking public interestin his field.This spring, the BBC revived its 1999 hit series Walking With Dinosaurs. Not a week goes by without headlines announcing the discovery of a new species ornew theories on how they behaved. Publishers produce an endless stream of dino-related fact and fiction, particularly for children. Palaeontology – at least when focused on the dinosaurs of the Mesozoic, or our hominin forebears – has long exerted an extraordinary hold on the public imagination.Yet it’s a marginal field in terms of academic prestige and scientific funding, as Dr Chris Manias, a historian of science, points out in the essay collectionPalaeontology in Public, published last year. (Dinosaurs are themselves a small part of the discipline; the vast mass of fossils are invertebrates, micro-organisms or plants. Good luck getting a movie made aboutstromatolites).The spectacular scale and fearsome nature of creatures such as Spinosaurus, the magic of conjuring extraordinary life from a handful of rocks tens of millions years old, and the mirroring of myths about dragons and other ancient beasts may all play a part in its appeal. Entertainment has always helped: theCrystal Palace dinosaurswere created in the 1850s to encourage interest in recent discoveries (Richard Owen, who coined the term dinosaur, provided advice.) Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1912 novel The Lost World portrayed a South American plateau where prehistoric creatures still roamed. Some of today’s palaeontologists were drawn to the field by watching the first Jurassic Park movie as children.But the science itself has been central too. In the 19th century, the US palaeontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope vied to outshine each other in the bitter “Bone Wars”, with academic rigour and ethics taking second place to headline-grabbing glory. In the“dinosaur renaissance”of the 1960s, experts showed the creatures to be more sophisticated, active and interesting than previously imagined. Thefeathered dinosaursfound in Liaoning, China, in the 1990s have revolutionised our understanding – even if the Jurassic franchise makers, and many dinosaur fans, still draw the line at adowny Tyrannosaurus rex. In recent years, experts haveidentified a new dinosaurevery week or so. New technology is unlocking details of their appearance and behaviour.The original Jurassic Park was a tourist resort inhabited by dinosaurs brought back from extinction. In the latest film, the plot is driven by big pharma’s hunt for prehistoric DNA that could drive a medical breakthrough. That parallels the tension Dr Manias notes around palaeontology itself: is it primarily a “luxury”, which entertains more than it enlightens, or “useful”? Jaw-dropping giants like Patagotitan still captivate adults and, especially, children. But there are lessons here too. In the past, the field appeared to offer a narrative of progress, as lumbering creatures gave way to mammals and ultimately – tada! – the triumph of humans. Now it is an instructive tale of uncertainty, offering powerful insights into time, nature and how life has fared at times of huge and rapid changes in climactic conditions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We’ve never had anything like that before.”Trump previously touted the legislation’s passage as a “birthday present for America”, speakingbefore a crowd ata campaign-style rally in Iowa on Thursday evening, even as Democrats expressed their displeasure at the spending package.“If you see anything negative put out by the Democrats, it’s all a con job,” Trump said of opposition to the bill.Trump signed the bill while surrounded by supporters, including the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who gave Trump the gavel he used to enact it.After months of deliberations, the bill passed by a single vote in the Senate and later passed the House with a 219 to 213 vote on Thursday, with only two Republicans voting against it. The sweeping legislation accomplishes what rightwingers have pushed for, for decades, as the Guardianexplainedthis week, and provides Trump a huge legislative win.The law will significantly cut taxes, building on the 2017 tax cuts during Trump’s first term. Although temporary tax exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest are included,researchfrom the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that the bill is skewed to the rich, with the wealthiest in the US benefiting the most from the tax relief.“After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” Trump said during Friday’s event.Additionally, the law will add new restrictions to Medicaid, which provides healthcare to low-income and disabled people, and Snap, also known as food stamps, which helps low-income people afford food. Researchersestimatethat the Medicaid cutbacks will leave as many as 11.8 million people without healthcare, while 8 million people will lose their Snap benefits. Critics say that the Medicaid cuts will have massive ripple effects on healthcare nationwide.“This is highway robbery,” the Democratic senator Raphael Warnockpostedon X, formerly known as Twitter. “The bill Republicans just passed steals from you to give to the rich.”Proponents of the law say that the Medicaid and Snap changes are designed to root out waste and abuse.Additionally, the spending package will allocate $170m to immigration enforcement, a monumental amount of money that will help support the Trump administration’s push to engage in “mass deportations”.“This disgraceful, anti-immigrant budget hands the Trump administration a blank check to further ramp up its shameful efforts to terrorize American communities and separate families,” said Nicole Melaku, the executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, an immigrants’ rights organization. “Instead of safeguarding people’s access to healthcare and wellness, the bill gives tax cuts to big corporations and funnels billions of dollars to hire more immigration agents, build more immigration jails and deny people their fair day in court.”Already, the Trump administration has engaged in widespread attacks on immigrant communities, by increasing resources to immigration enforcement operations.“This budget promises to supercharge US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests that disappear community members, leave children parentless and threaten constitutional and due-process rights for all of us,” said Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center, alegal organization.A recent Guardian analysis shows that undocumented immigrants without any criminal history have been arrested at an exponentially increasing rate, after top White House officials instructed agents to increase arrests.Trump’s Medicaid cuts are coming for rural Americans: ‘It’s going to have to hit them first’Read moreTrump temporarily walked back some of Ice’s aggressive immigration enforcement actions after complaints from leaders in the farming and hospitality industries: last month, the Trump administration engaged in a short-lived pause on raids at farms, restaurants and hotels. But at Thursday’s event, Trump again brought up the idea of pausing large-scale enforcement on farms.“If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people in some way, Kristi, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” Trump said to the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem. “We don’t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms.”In addition to tax cuts, restrictions on Medicaid and Snap and the aggressive supercharging of immigration enforcement, the law seeks to end green energy incentives created under Joe Biden, seen as a further blow against efforts to combat the climate crisis.The US budget deficit will increase with this law, leading to opposition by some Trump allies. The non-partisan congressional budget office estimates the law will add $3.3tn to the country’s debt through 2034, leading to clashes with some rightwingers.One of the two Republicans who voted against it, Thomas Massie,saidhe opposed the spending bill “because it will significantly increase US budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates”.Elon Musk, the rightwing billionaire who established the federal government’s office tasked with slashing federal spending during the first few months of the Trump administration, has also publicly called out the spending bill. Days before Congress passed the bill, Muskrepeatedhis call for the creation of a new political party to oppose the Republicans and Democrats.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS taxationTrump administrationUS politicsUS healthcareUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He died the next day with a spinal cord injury and fractured ribs.Last month, Mr Justice Turner sentenced the 15-year-old boy who punched and kicked Kohli to seven years in custody. A 13-year-old girl who encouraged the attack by filming parts of it while laughing was sentenced to a three-year youth rehabilitation order.Both children, who cannot be named because of their age, denied their crimes, but were convicted of manslaughter by a jury at Leicester crown court.A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office said the case would be reviewed under the “unduly lenient” sentence scheme. “The solicitor general, Lucy Rigby KC MP, was appalled by this violent, cowardly attack on an innocent man. She wishes to express her deepest sympathies to Bhim Kohli’s friends and family at this difficult time.“After undertaking a detailed review of the case, the solicitor general concluded the sentence of the 15-year-old boy could be referred to the court of appeal. The court will determine if the sentence is increased or not.”Kohli’s daughter has previously expressed anger and disappointment at the sentences, saying they did not “reflect the severity of the crime”.Speaking outside court after the sentencing hearing last month, Susan Kohli said her family’s “lives had been changed for ever”, adding: “The death of my dad has left a hole in our family, a hole that can never be filled because of the actions of two teenagers on that Sunday evening last September.“I believe on that day the two teenagers made a choice. The teenage boy chose to attack my dad and the girl chose to film him being attacked. They knew what they were doing.“I feel angry and disappointed that the sentence they have both received today does not, I believe, reflect the severity of the crime they committed. However, I understand the judge has guidelines. But they have taken a life and, as a result, our lives have been changed for ever. When they are released, they still have their full lives ahead of them. They can rebuild their lives. We can’t.”In his sentencing remarks the judge praised Bhim Kohli’s family for their “dignity” throughout the trial. “No one could fail to be deeply moved by what his daughter, in court, and his grandson, in a statement, have said. Their grief and anger will cast a long shadow over all of their lives.”Turning to the convicted pair, the judge said: “I am sure Mr Kohli did nothing at all to deserve what you did. What you did was wicked.” He told the boy he had “made a cowardly and violent attack on an elderly man”.Explore more on these topicsCourt of appealUK criminal justiceLeicestershireCrimeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Canadiens Go!” on digital banners used on 1,000 buses within the city.However, the language police told Montreal’s transit agency it needed to remove the word “go” from the electronic signs to stay within the confines of the province’s language laws. The transit agency acquiesced, replacing the signage with “Allez! Canadiens Allez!”.Following on the reporting by the Montreal Gazette, however, French-language minister Jean-François Roberge intervened and said “Go Habs Go” is part of Quebec culture and pledged to dismiss any future complaints about the slogan. The Canadiens, the country’s oldest professional hockey team, are also colloquially known as the ‘Habs’ – a reference toles habitants, the settlers of French origin who came to Quebec beginning in the 17th century.Quebec’s fastidious attempts to protect the French language havemade headlines in the past.In 2022 the owner of a bar and barbershop received a warning from Quebec’s language police that his establishment was in violation of the province’s language laws after someone filed a complaint claiming the bar’s Facebook page wasn’t bilingual enough.“All consumers have the fundamental right of being informed and served in French in Quebec,” the OQLF said in a statement at the time.And in 2019 the government proposed banning the popular greeting “Bonjour-hi”, only to quickly backtrack amid outrage and ridicule from residents.Most famously, however, isthe “pasta-gate” scandal of 2013, when the owner of the Italian restaurant at Buonanotte was told he had run afoul of the law when he used the words “pasta” on the menu and “bottiglia”, the Italian word for bottle, instead of the French word “bouteille”. For many, the row reflected an over-zealous language watchdog eager to flex its muscles. The incident culminated in the resignation of the head of the OQLF less than a month later.In both 2021 and 2023, the language watchdog received complaints from the public over the use of the word “go” when used to cheer on the Canadiens, according to the Canadian Press.The word “go” is a borrowed anglophone term with “well-established” use in the province, the language watchdog said, but noted that public entities, such as the city’s transit service, are nonetheless obliged to use “exemplary” French.Earlier in the week, Montreal’s transit agency said it was now “beginning its reflection on the subject” of returning the word “go” to the fleet of buses, but no decision would be made imminently.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMontreal CanadiensAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, protesters will arrive at the Bridehead estate in Dorset, hop across a low stone wall and take part in a “peaceful trespass” to express their anger and sadness atthe loss of accessto a spot in the sort of landscape Hardy wrote about so evocatively.They will picnic near a lake, listen to songs and some will join a writing workshop, while drawing attention to the closure of a permissive path that local people and visitors have used for generations.Last year the family that had lived there for more than two centuries sold the estate, in the village of Littlebredy, which includes a manor house and thatched cottages, to theOxfordshire-based Belport,which specialises in acquiring and managing rural property.To the consternation of people who loved visiting the grounds, last month the path to the lake and a tumbling waterfall, which was used as a crime scene in the television drama Broadchurch, was closed.The campaign groupRight to Roamhas taken up the case and has organised the trespass.View image in fullscreenThe new owners of the estate have stopped access to the grounds.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianLewis Winks, of Right to Roam, said: “We’ll be celebrating the connection people have had with the Bridehead estate for decades. We’ll be peacefully enjoying the grounds just as people have done for generations and drawing attention to the fragility of permissive access when landowners can withdraw that permission just at a whim.“We’re encouraging the [UK] government to protect existing access and to extend access to the countryside, particularly in places likeDorsetwhere there’s a real lack of meaningful access to nearby countryside for people. This isn’t about a mass trespass; this is about sort of asserting a historic customary right.”People have expressed dismay at the loss of access, including some who have scattered ashes of loved ones there and cannot now get back to the spot.The visitors’ book inthe village church, St Michael and All Angelsis being used as a place to record their displeasure. One said: “We came too late. We’ve missed a treat.” Another said: “It’s a tragedy it won’t be shared with those that value it so much.”View image in fullscreenSt Michael and All Angels church in Littlebredy. Its visitors’ book is being used to record displeasure at the loss of access.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianKevan Manwaring, a university lecturer in creative writing, to planning to join the trespass. He said: “Bridehead is a very special place that deserves to be open to the public. They have prevented people from going there. I think this is illustrative of a wide problem about public access to nature inEngland. It’s not just a nimby-ish issue.”Hardy knew this area well, with one of the main characters in his novel Jude the Obscure named Sue Bridehead. Manwaring said he liked to think the author would have been sympathetic to the cause: “His novels depict an unenclosed England, written with a post-enclosure longing. His Egdon Heath [which features prominently in The Return of the Native] was based upon the heathland that stretched from his family cottage at Higher Bockhampton to Poole and Bournemouth. It would be very difficult to walk that now.”During the trespass, Manwaring plans to read a poem he has written about the River Bride, which rises beneath the artificial lake at Bridehead: “You have shaped the land and lives/with your steady, gentle, Brydian ways.”Some worry about the future of the estate cottages. One household has left so their home could be used as an estate office. A long-term resident told the Guardian this week that there was a “fog” around what would happen next.Ahead of the protest, Belport said it may reopen the path if “issues” could be addressed.A spokesperson said: “Having bought the Bridehead estate, our principal focus is to orchestrate a sequence of upgrade works to each of the estate properties in Littlebredy, which will bring them up to current and anticipated minimum energy and safety standards required of all landlords.”It said one resident “was asked to vacate via the vendor”, adding: “This was to provide an estate office and accommodation for staff.” There were no plans for any other evictions, it said.“In a similar vein, access to some small areas of the estate has been temporarily suspended pending a health and safety review of access routes, trees and open water. If we can address any issues sufficiently, we intend to reopen the area to the public.”Explore more on these topicsDorsetAccess to green spaceThomas HardyEnglandRural affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Soon flat owners and renters in the UK could be able to use the same “plug-in” technology, which is currently prohibited.The DIY systems, whichhave grown in popularityin countries such as France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, are typically plugged straight into the home’s power sockets, saving money on electricity bills and allowing people access to a new source of power.So why can’t balconies in the UK simply have the same systems installed?British regulations around solar systems and wiring mean that professionals must be involved in their installation and the panels cannot simply be plugged into the mains like a toaster.In some European countries, where electrical systems are different to the UK, residents are allowed to put in place their own small systems – such as a few panels being hung off a balcony.Thomas Newby of the Leeds-based engineering company Morgan & Newby says this difference in regulation means the technology has grown in popularity. In Germany,Balkonkraftwerk(balcony power plant) systems are now installed at 1.5m apartments.“Various countries permit systems limited in output to 800W to be connected via a standard appliance plug to a socket-outlet,” he says. “As a result of this lower-cost entry point, well suited to apartments where the solar modules can be hung or positioned on the balcony, uptake has increased significantly of late.”This week the UK government said it would launch a safety study “with the aim of unlocking opportunities for plug-in solar over the next few years” as part ofa new plan to triple the UK’s solar capacity by 2030.In theory, this could mean people in flats would have a much cheaper way to access solar energy, as the cost of labour is taken off the bill. And renters could take the systems with them when they move from flat to flat. This would give people who usually do not have access to cheap power a way to reduce their energy bills.Newby said a typical kit containing two solar panels, a battery to store energy and the plugs needed to convert it to the household electrics would cost about £2,000. Batteries are used to store energy, which is generated and not used immediately in the home, especially on sunny days such as those experienced last month, whentemperatures reached 33C.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There are other practical considerations including the location of electric sockets and cable protection – we do not tend to have electrical sockets installed on balconies in this country,” said Gemma Grimes, director of policy.“The installation of all electrical equipment comes with risks, and it is important that any risks are fully understood prior to widespread rollout.

Since the site boasts the UK’s largest population of the butterflies, the ecologists said they were confident the numbers were high nationwide.View image in fullscreenThe Knepp project has boosted the numbers of several species since rewilding began.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianKnepp’s purple emperor expert Neil Hulme emphasised that butterfly populations experienced fluctuations rather than steady growth year on year, but he suggested the “top quality rewilded landscape” had allowed the purple emperors to flourish. In particular, he said, Knepp’s “mosaic” of sallow scrub provided a crucial location for female emperors to lay their eggs.Nature lovers have long been fascinated by the purple emperor, and for at least 250 years have been using unusual methods to lure them from the treetops where they reside. Despite their apparently delicate nature, the butterflies are renowned for feeding on cowpats and decaying animal carcasses. Those in search of a sighting attempt to entice purple emperors with anything fromdirty nappies to blue cheese.Alongside their love for animal flesh, purple emperors can become “intoxicated” on oak sap, enhancing their reputation as “brawling thugs”.Hulme stressed that although the purple emperors may be the most “glamorous” success story at Knepp, other species had also benefited from the rewilding.Butterfliessuch as purple hairstreaks and the silver-washed fritillary, as well as nightingales and swifts are also being sighted in record numbers.

It will continue to examine the other six.In its provisional statement of reasons, the CCRC said the four grounds did not reach the threshold for a referral to the court of appeal. Bamber has a right to challenge the provisional decision, and his legal team says it will judicially review the decision.The White House Farm murders, which occurred in August 1985 in Essex, are one of the most infamous and controversial criminal cases of the 20th century. Bamber’s parents, Nevill and June, his sister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas were killed.Initially, the police concluded that Caffell, who had recently been hospitalised with paranoid schizophrenia, had killed the family with one of her father’s guns. But in 1986, Bamber, then aged 24, was convicted of the murders. There was no direct evidence linking him to the killings.The conviction relied on complex forensic arguments about the possible use of a silencer (which the prosecution argued, if used, would have made the rifle too long for Caffell to kill herself with), and Bamber’s former girlfriend Julie Mugford changing her initial statement to the police to say he had told her beforehand that he was planning to kill the family and that he had hired a hitman. When the hitman she named proved to have an alibi, Mugford again changed her story to say it was Bamber who had murdered his family.The four issues the CCRC examined concerned the existence of a second silencer, which Bamber’s team suggested undermined the significance of the supposed single firearm moderator that proved so significant at his trial; a phone call allegedly made by his father to Essex police saying Caffell had gone “berserk” with a gun; the integrity of the crime scene, which was compromised by Essex police; and a 999 call that police records discovered before Bamber’s 2002 appeal showed had been made from within White House Farm at 6.09am on the day of the murders.Last year, the New Yorker magazine published a 17,000-word investigation by the journalist Heidi Blake examining whether Bamber had been wrongfully convicted. She interviewed surviving police officers including Nicholas Milbank, who had been monitoring the open line into White House Farm on the morning of the shootings. Milbank told Blake that a 999 call had come in at 6.09am from inside the farm (by which time Bamber had been standing outside with police for more than two hours) and that he heard human activity.According to Milbank, it was an emergency call on an exchange line, meaning that someone had dialled 999 rather than using the open line. He denied any knowledge of a statement made in his name to a 2002 inquiry known as Operation Stokenchurch saying he had monitored the open line but heard nothing until the police entered. This 2002 statement, which was typed and unsigned, had been used by Essex police to prevent the issue of the 999 call being raised at the 2002 appeal.Bamber’s submission to the CCRC said Milbank’s comments to the New Yorker indicated that his 2002 witness statement was fabricated by Essex police to conceal the fact that a 999 call had been made at 6.09am on 07 August 1985 by someone within the farmhouse.However, in its provisional statement of reasons, the CCRC said that subsequent to publication of the Blake article, Milbank provided a statement, dated 10 October 2024, saying: “I have never to my knowledge spoken to the New Yorker,” and that he did not know he had been talking to a journalist. Milbank, who was still an officer with Essex police at the time, has died since making the statement.TheJeremy BamberCampaign has expressed its anger that the CCRC approached the Essex force rather than go directly to Blake or Milbank. “Unbelievably, the CCRC just accepted this revisionist account, and endorsed the view that Ms Blake, and the New Yorker, had obtained this material under false pretences, and it was, consequently, not worth considering,” it said.The New Yorker has issued a statement saying: “Heidi Blake’s piece was meticulously reported and scrupulously factchecked. The New Yorker stands by the story.”This is the third time the CCRC has reviewed Bamber’s case. In 2002, his case was sent back to the appeal court on DNA evidence. A panel of three judges rejected the appeal. In 2011, the CCRC refused to refer the case, stating that the evidence did not raise a real possibility that the court would find his convictions unsafe.The CCRC has been criticised for the percentage of submissions it refers back to the appeal court (currently about 2%); its failure to investigate cases; the time it takes to deal with submissions; its work from home policy; and for not having the legal minimum number of commissioners.Explore more on these topicsJeremy BamberCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Both defendants assaulted PC Marsden,” Greaney said.“In the moments that followed, the first defendant also assaulted PC Cook and then PC Ward, too, breaking her nose. The defendants used a high level of violence.”Amaaz is alleged to have assaulted Marsden and Ward, causing them actual bodily harm. He is also accused of the assault of Cook and the earlier assault of Abdulkareem Ismaeil at Starbucks.Amaad, 26, is alleged to have assaulted Marsden causing actual bodily harm. Both men, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, deny the allegations.Greaney said the defendants had travelled to the airport with their young nephew to collect their mother, who was due to arrive back on a flight from Qatar.The prosecutor said: “A man named Abdulkareem Ismaeil was on the same flight as the defendants’ mother. He was travelling with his wife and three young children. It is clear that on the flight and/or shortly after it landed, something happened between the defendants’ mother and Abdulkareem Ismaeil that made the defendants’ mother unhappy.“The defendants met their mother in the arrivals area of Terminal 2 and began to walk to the car park with her and the child that was with them. As they did so, they passed a Starbucks coffee house. Abdulkareem Ismaeil was in there with his wife and children. The defendants’ mother spotted Abdulkareem Ismaeil and pointed him out to her sons.“At just after 8.20pm, the defendants entered Starbucks and confronted Abdulkareem Ismaeil. During that confrontation, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz delivered a head-butt to the face of Abdulkareem Ismaeil and punched him, then attempted to deliver other blows, all in front of a number of children. The prosecution case is that this was obviously unlawful conduct.”Jurors were shown CCTV footage from the incident at Starbucks, lasting about a minute and 50 seconds.Greaney told jurors that the prosecution’s position was this was “not a complicated case”. He said: “The events you are concerned with were captured by CCTV cameras and, in relation to the events in the payment area, on the body-worn cameras of police officers as well. So you will not have to depend only on the recollections of witnesses. You will also be able to see with your own eyes what happened.“The two defendants assert, as we understand it, that at all stages they were acting in lawful self-defence or in defence of the other.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the least deprived areas the figure stands at 80.7%.“We’re seeing increasing levels of poverty because of things like the cost of living crisis, which has pushed more households into food insecurity states,” Frew said. “We think of ourselves as being quite a developed country, but there are parts of the country that have economic and health outcomes much more similar to developing countries.”Compared with the pre-coronavirus pandemic period of 2017-19, life expectancy at birth in England in 2020 to 2022 has decreased in the most deprived areas by 1.4 years for men, to 72.6 years, and by 1.1 years for women, to 77.7 years.“We’ve got people who still have a similar level of life expectancy, but not healthy life expectancy. I think that’s the key metric healthcare service and local authorities are really targeting, because it is not just getting people to live longer, but we need to get people to live healthier and longer,” Frew said.“There needs to be a really concerted health and equality strategy that looks at those gender differences.”Explore more on these topicsLife expectancyHealthEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

His wife, daughter, sister and son-in-law were also killed in the attack.His surviving daughter Lobna said the airstrike specifically targeted the room her father was in. “All the rooms were fine except for his, the missile hit it precisely,” she said.His son Ahmed said there was “no other explanation” other than that his father was deliberately targeted by the Israeli military. He also added that the floors where his father and their extended family were staying were the only parts of the block hit in the airstrike.View image in fullscreenThe apartment building in Gaza City where Dr Marwan al-Sultan and several family members were reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrikePhotos and videos taken by local journalists and given to the Guardian, showed that the apartment block had been hit on the front side of the fourth and fifth floors, while the rest remained intact.“Until the last minute of his life, he did not leave his job. He paid for this dedication with his life,” said Ahmed. “I was there only 10 minutes before the airstrike and the scene I faced when I went back to the apartment after the attack is indescribable. I didn’t know who had survived and who had died. Some people were only now shattered body parts. Most of those who died were women and children.”He said his father’s death was not just a loss for the family but for the whole ofGaza. Sultan was an experienced cardiologist and a leading figure in Gaza’s medical community. He was also one of only two remaining heart specialists in the territory, according to Healthcare Worker Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.“My father was loved by all people,” said Ahmed. “He had been besieged at the Indonesian hospital and also at the Kamal Adwan hospital but he did not leave. For the first few months [of the war] we did not see him except a few hours of the day because he was always at the hospital.”His death means that all of the directors of the hospitals in northern Gaza have either been killedor detainedby the Israeli military forces.Video footage of a bombed out apartment in GazaThe director of Kamal Adwan hospital, Dr Ahmed al-Kahlout, and his fellow acting director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, as well as Dr Ahmed Muhanna, the director of al-Awda hospital in northern Gaza, are all being held in an Israeli prison.In a statement, the IDF said: “On Wednesday, the IDF struck a key terrorist from the Hamas terrorist organisation in the area of Gaza City. The claim that as a result of the strike uninvolved civilians were harmed is being reviewed.‘Shock and grief’ as senior doctor killed in Israeli airstrike in GazaRead more“The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to mitigate harm to them as much as possible. The Hamas terrorist organisation systematically violates international law while using civilian infrastructure for terrorist activity and the civilian population as human shields. The incident is under review.”According to data from HWW, Sultan was the 70th healthcare worker to have been killed by the Israeli military in the past 50 days. The UN says that overall more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war in October 2023.Under the Geneva conventions,the set of international laws that police the conduct of warring parties, attacks on healthcare workers during conflict could be war crimes. The conventions state that doctors and other healthcare professionals should be protected, not targeted or attacked during conflict, and must be allowed to carry on providing medical care to those who need it.Explore more on these topicsGazaRights and freedomIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Independent since 1975, it is still one of the poorest countries in the region, yetSurinamehas recently discovered significant offshore oil reserves that could generate billions of dollars in revenue over the coming decades. The country is not expected to begin production until 2028.Geerlings-Simons began her rise to power on 25 May, whenvoters elected the 51 membersof Suriname’s National Assembly, though the results produced no clear winner.Her National Democratic party secured a narrow lead with 18 seats, just ahead of Santokhi’s party, which won 17. In the days that followed, she managed to form a coalition with five other parties, giving her the minimum 34 seats required to be appointed president.Last Thursday, which was the deadline for registering presidential candidates, Santokhi’s Progressive Reform party announced it would not be putting forward a nominee.Geerlings-Simons’s party was founded by Dési Bouterse, who ruled as a dictator from 1980 to 1987, a period during which his regime was accused ofexecuting 15 political opponents in 1982. Following Suriname’s return to democracy, Bouterse was elected president in 2010 and re-elected in 2015, before handing over to Santokhi.The current president told local media there would be a “smooth transition” of power.Corruption scandals marked his five-year term, and he was forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the economy. While his austerity measures helped restructure Suriname’s public debt, they also triggered violent protests in the country of 600,000 people.During his presidency, oil reserves were discovered 90 miles (150km) off Suriname’s coast. The project to extract them is led by the French multinational TotalEnergies, which announced in October that it would invest $10.5bn to develop the oilfield.Santokhi went so far as to propose a “royalties for everyone” scheme, under which every Surinamese citizen would receive US$750 in a savings account, with an annual interest rate of 7%. The plan was one of his key re-election pledges – but it wasn’t enough to secure his party a majority.With more than 90% of its territory covered by tropical rainforest, Suriname has come under increasing pressure overillegal gold mining and logging, practices that Geerlings-Simons publicly condemned during her time as chair of the National Assembly, where she played a role in advancing environmental regulations.Explore more on these topicsSurinameWomenAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In sum, the statements had asserted Ábrego García’s guilt “without regard to the judicial process or the presumption of innocence”, the filing said.According to the documents filed on Wednesday, officials within the prison acknowledged that Ábrego García was not a gang member, and that his tattoos did not indicate a gang affiliation.“Prison officials explicitly acknowledged that plaintiff Ábrego García’s tattoos were not gang-related, telling him ‘your tattoos are fine’,” according to the filing, and they kept him in a cell separate from those accused of gang membership.The prison officials, however, threatened to move Ábrego García into a cell with gang members whom officials said “would ‘tear’ him apart”.Separately, US prosecutors have agreed with a request by Ábrego García’s lawyers to delay his release from Tennessee jail over fears that the Trump administration could move to deport the Salvadorian national a second time.In a filing on Friday, lawyers for Ábrego García asked the judge overseeing a federal complaint that he was involved in human smuggling to delay his release because of “contradictory statements” by the Trump’s administration over whether he’ll be deported upon release.The justice department has said it plans to try the Maryland construction worker on the smuggling charges, but also that it plans to deport him but has not said when.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS prisonsUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Known as the Beaufort Gyre, this fluke of geography and oceanography was once a proving ground for ice to “mature” into thick sheets.But no more. A rapidlychanging climatehas reshaped the region, reducing perennial sea ice. As ocean currents spin what is left of the gyre, chunks of ice now clog many of the channels separating the northern islands.Canada’s coast guard has an expression for this confounding phenomenon: less ice means more ice.“Most people think climate change means that you won’t need heavy icebreakers,” said Robert Huebert, anArcticsecurity expert at the University of Calgary. “And the experience of the coast guard is: no, you need far more icebreakers.”I’m obsessed with icebreaking: I was trained not to hit anything – now I drive my ship into ice 24/7Read moreTo address the problem, Canada is building a new fleet of ships to fight through the once-impenetrable sea ice. It is not alone, with the prospect of new shipping routes opening up – and with them access to critical minerals in the Arctic – Russia, China and the United States are also rushing to build new icebreakers.‘A one-off floating city’At Seaspan’s shipyards in north Vancouver, bound on one side by ocean and the other by mountains, teams have started cutting steel for a 520ft polar-class icebreaker that will operate in temperatures near -50C (-58F). The project is expected to take at least five years to complete and cost C$3.15bn ($2.32bn).When finished, the heavy icebreaker will be the centrepiece of Canada’s recently announced national shipbuilding strategy that looks to further entrench its presence in the Arctic – and distance itself from decades of delay, bureaucratic fumbling and broken promises.The challenge of building an icebreaker is that the end result must operate in some of the most inhospitable places on Earth with little risk of failure, experts say.It’s twice the thickness and really, twice the ship. You have to operate and think at a whole different levelEddie Schehr, Seaspan“Shipbuilding is one of the older industries, but it’s still it’s one of the last industries to perfect, because the reality is, you’re building a one-off floating city,” said Eddie Schehr, the company’s vice-president of production. Walking through the hangar-like “shops” where pieces are gradually welded with the aim of eventually crafting a hull, he likens the complex assembly to a costly, often error-ridden form of Lego. “And so it’s often not until the very, very end that you find problems. And you will find them.”Even the supposedly simpler parts require steel that often measures 60mm thick and requires special machinery to stress-test.“Because of the strength and capabilities the ships needs to have, it’s twice the thickness and really, twice the ship,” he said. “You have to operate and think at a whole different level.”Delay and demandThe ship will be a class 2 icebreaker, meaning it can operate year-round and push through ice as tall as 10ft. The last time Canada built a similar vessel domestically was in the 1960s and that ship, theLouis St Laurent,still remains the larger of Canada’s only two heavy icebreakers.Canada first announced it would replace Louis St Laurent in 1985,but those plans were scuttled. It wasn’t until 2008,when the prime minister, Stephen Harper, announced his government would build another replacement: a heavy icebreaker called the John G Diefenbaker. It too was never built, but Schehr recalls studying plans for the boat in university.“Time’s a big circle. Now I’m here and we’re now actually finally building that very ship,” said Schehr.View image in fullscreenAt Seaspan’s shipyards in north Vancouver, teams have started construction for the polar-class icebreaker, a 520ft ship.Photograph: Leyland CeccoFor sceptics, Seaspan can point to the Naalak Nappaaluk, anoffshore oceanographic science vesselit recently finished that can operate in ice nearly 4ft thick and is tasked with “identifying the true impact of climate change” when out at sea, says Schehr.Canada’s federal government has also commissioned another company, Quebec’s Davie shipyards, to build a second icebreaker, framing the decision as one that reflects the gravity of the moment: large icebreakers, incredibly slow to produce, are needed fast.In 2024, Davie purchased a shipyard in Helsinki. And in mid-June, the company also purchased a shipyard in the US, part of an effort to bring future production down south as a way aroundrestrictive American legislationthat prohibits foreign companies from building ships.“If we were building two icebreakers and two shipyards, that’s the surest way to make it inefficiently,” said Huebert. “The coast guard is going to have to train on two different ships. And for the next 50 years, there will be little commonality in repairs and parts. If you asked me what is the most expensive and inefficient way of building more than one vessel, just look to Canada and its icebreakers.”The Arctic will always remain a dangerous place. And that’s why we will always need the Canadian government to make or buy these ships.Michael Byers, University of British ColumbiaInternally, Canada’s historic inability to marshal the resources to build a new ship has become both a running joke and embarrassment. Butthe recently signed Ice Pact, a tripartite agreement between the Finland, Canada and the United States, could shift global production as Canada looks to revive its shipbuilding industry.Finland has already built 80% of the world’s ice-capable ships operating in frigid waters.But the deal, announced during the Nato summit in Washington, will see as many as 90 icebreaker ships produced in the coming years, by the three countries. Both Seaspan and Davie hope to be a supplier to the US Coast Guard in coming years if they can successfully produce a heavy icebreaker.The race for dominanceRussia is believed to have at least 50 icebreakers and more than a dozen can operate in the harshest climates. China probably has four that are suitable for the Arctic ice, though which seasons it can operate in is unclear.Donald Trumphas signalled he wants as many as 40 icebreakers, suggesting allied Arctic nations are entering an arms race for the ships.Shipping experts say the president’s interest in a fleet of icebreakers reflects a fervour in the multibillion-dollar shipping industry: clearing the North-West Passage of ice for more of the year could year could trim weeks off of shipping times between Europe and Asia.But it’s not just about money. In recent months, Canada’s federal government has pledged significant investment for the Arctic in a show of military force.“We see the centrality of the Arctic for the Russians, and as the Russians become a much more aggressive state, the importance of that capability becomes much more clear,” he said. “But if you’re building icebreakers for sovereignty, it starts going beyond the icebreakers. Now you need to invest in satellite, radar and submarines. They’re all part of a system. Icebreakers alone aren’t enough.”‘The world order could start to evolve from the Arctic’: Trump, thin ice and the fight for the Northwest PassageRead moreSome are sceptical that the push for new icebreakers reflects a burgeoning arms race.“We need Canadian government ships that can operate in the Canadian Arctic when there is other shipping there. There is no question about that,” said Michael Byers, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia. “But politicians and pundits often escalate the concern: ‘Oh my God, the Russians are coming,’ or ‘The Chinese are coming.’ I see no evidence of that. The Russians already own half of the Arctic. They don’t need any more.”Byers notes that Russia has a different, larger coastline it needs to maintain for year-round shipping, necessitating more ice-worthy vessels.Instead, Byers points to a reality in which more ships clamour for Arctic passage. “With less ice in the Arctic, it actually becomes more challenging and risky.”When ships moving in open water encounter gale-force conditions and cold air temperatures, ocean spray can freeze on to the vessels and in some cases, accumulate so much it capsizes them.“We’ll always need icebreakers because the Arctic will always remain a dangerous place. And that’s why we will always need the Canadian government to make or buy these ships.”This article was amended on 4 July 2025 to remove a reference to the name of the new polar ice-breaker, which has not yet been confirmed.Explore more on these topicsCanadaSeascape: the state of our oceansArcticIceAmericasClimate crisisOceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty ImagesAhead of the first tour date tonight, the poet laureate explores the ‘brotherhood and chemistry’ that forged the band, repelled the Gallaghers and brought them together againBySimon ArmitageFri 4 Jul 2025 00.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 04.43 EDTShareIn retrospect it all seems so obvious. Form a band, plunderthe Beatles’ back cataloguefor riffs, guitar tabs, chord changes and song structures, then bang it out in a key that a stadium crowd could put their lungs into but which suited the subway busker, too.The resulting success now looks so inevitable. In 1994, dance music flooded the UK charts but not everyone thought a rave DJ wearing oversized headphones and playing records counted as a gig. Some people – a vast number, it turned out – still yearned for meat-and-two-veg pop-rock with guitars and drums, and for songs played by groups. Throw in some Manc bluster, the death throes of a Tory government that had occupied Downing Street since for ever, and the first glimmers of a cooler Britannia, and hey presto:Oasis.Even if the dates don’t quite stack up, that’s how cultural theorists tend to describe the preconditions for one of the world’s biggest ever acts, staring at them through the rear view mirror of musical history after their 2009 implosion. But luck must have played its part, as it always does, along with something more elemental to do with brotherhood and chemistry: the sparks that flew between the Gallaghers were the same sparks that lit their creative drive.View image in fullscreenOasis at Knebworth prior to their two shows in August 1996.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAOasis made seven studio albums, all hugely successful. The third, 1997’s Be Here Now, was released with so much fanfare and expectation that a commercial triumph was guaranteed. But it felt bloated and indulgent, and even if it wasn’t quite a parody of the group’s status and smugness, it had enough calculated familiarity to make them sound like their own tribute band. Upstart effrontery and spiky provocation are evidently hard to maintain when the millions are rolling in. Undeterred,Oasispressed on, the music going through its motions with only the odd gem to be discovered here and there.‘I’ve waited 25 years for this moment’: Oasis, the reunion – and what made them greatRead moreThe first two records, though, remain magnificent. I can’t really remember (and don’t care) which is which – they were two halves of the same whole, both full of pounding, adrenalised songs that sounded great on a transistor radio and unbelievable on a proper stereo system. When most bands enter the studio, start dickering with all the toys and turn it up to 11, sonic elements usually get distorted or drowned out.The audio clarity onDefinitely Maybeand (What’s the Story) Morning Glory is astonishing – it feels as if you’re in the room with them. The lyrics are … interesting: rhyme-driven breeze block couplets for the most part, ranging from the rousing, to the mysterious, to the trippy, to the witty, to the laughable, to the moronic. And I’ve sung along with them all, at the top of my voice, especially in the car, where Oasis are the perfect in-vehicle karaoke. Maybe Noel and his studio engineers had figured this out; he always maintained that to be mega successful you need to appeal to the dudesandthe squares, and a lot of the squares are motorists with cash to splurge.In 1995, Oasis andBlurslagged each other off and slugged it out in the singles chart for theBattle of Britpop, Blur coming out on top among accusations of retail skulduggery on both sides. It made the news headlines, because this wasn’t just a popularity contest, it was a media-framed fight between rock’n’roll cats and dogs. Blur were the feline, slippery, ironic, unbiddable, enigmatic art school smart Alecs, and Oasis the muscular, barely-house-trained mutts with a bark and a bite (Suede’s Brett Anderson called Oasis “the singing plumbers”). Characterised by some as a battle for music’s very soul, Blur v Oasis was also seen as a conflict between north and south, and I probably wanted Oasis to triumph for regional rather than aesthetic reasons.The Oasis back line came and went in the years that followed, with no noticeable effect. Most of its members turned out to be interchangeable and disposable, with fans not really caring who was beating the skins or twanging the bass. In essence, Oasis are the brothers Gallagher, like the twin stars of Sirius, pulsing in the firmament, forever revolving around each other in captured orbit but never able to embrace.Liam was the couldn’t-give-a-toss gobshite, with not so much a potty mouth as the oral equivalent of a sewage works for a large metropolitan area, and that was OK because he had the cockiness and looks to back it up. He also had a fantastic voice: all tonsil, adenoid, teeth and tongue, loud enough to crowd-surf to the back of a stadium, sharp and sneery enough to enunciate.Noel took the role of scheming mastermindand ace guitarist. It was his idea to conquer the planet and his compositions that would do it. When he stepped into the rehearsal room of his kid brother’s wannabe outfit, he found a shambles, and he gave them material, discipline and direction. That’s the received wisdom, at least – he couldn’t have done it without a frontman like Liam.View image in fullscreenOasis on Channel 4’s The White Room in 1996.Photograph: Des Willie/RedfernsThe brothers’ obscenity-ridden slander was a joint enterprise, tearing into other artists and bands with merciless and sometimes hilarious savagery, calling out banality, mediocrity and inability with a refreshing lack of caution. But for all of Liam’s bladed comments and boorish behaviour there was something funny and even innocent about him. Noel, by comparison, seemed wily and defensive; the role of lovable arsehole never came as naturally to him as it did to his younger sibling.Across two decades the weird psychodrama of their fraternal dynamic has been hard to keep up with. Noel stormed off more than once, sometimes returning to the lineup when only the diehard aficionados knew he’d quit. And the barneys weren’t just artistic flouncing or creative hissy fits, they were proper brawls with weaponised tambourines, guitars and cricket bats. It felt tiresome on occasions, especially as Oasis’s significance waned and cultural sensibilities shifted, but undoubtedly it’s one of the elements that make the planned reunion so compelling.What would British culture be like if Oasis had never existed? | Dorian LynskeyRead moreBecause the enmity can’t simply have melted away, can it? There was genuine bad blood between Noel and Liam, which found expression through genuine violence. It’s not impossible to imagine the upcoming tour abandoned on day one, with the brothers in separate luxury hotels, one soothing a bruised fist with a packet of frozen peas, the other with a cartoon rib-eye steak on his face taking the sting out of a shiner.But when Oasis do finally appear together after a16-year absence, fans will be back on each other’s shoulders or arm in arm, singing gnomic phrases and occasional nonsense, united by some irresistible bond. If they play Acquiesce – the verses sung by Liam, the choruses by Noel – it’s interesting to wonder what silent thoughts might pass between the warring siblings when they get to the bit about needing and believing in each other. The roar of the crowd, hymning back the lyrics, will be telling them it’s true.This article was updated with a correction on 4 July: Armitage is the current rather than former poet laureate.

Consumed in one sitting – so long, so many songs performed at such an unwavering high intensity – any undecideds might find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer onslaught of the thing. But if you’re ready for the whole plunge, Jon M Chu’s Wizard of Oz prequel remains a total extravaganza. The performances are fantastic; especially Ariana Grande, whose years spent toiling down the Disney Channel mines manifest themselves in a remarkable lightness of touch. The ambition is faultless. And if you aren’t moved by the walloping final performance of Defying Gravity, you might be dead inside.Friday 11 July, 10am and 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereKing RichardView image in fullscreenFamily affair … Will Smith, Saniyya Sidney, and Demi Singleton in King Richard.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyUntil the end of time,King Richardis destined to be known as Will Smith’s meltdown film – he won an Oscar for his performance, directly between slapping Chris Rock and being banned from the Oscars for a decade – which is a shame, because it deserves to stand on its own merits. A biopic of Richard Williams, the man who drove his daughters Venus and Serena to become the world’s best tennis players, the film enjoys a rocketship trajectory that starts in the backstreets of Compton and ends at the top of the world. And, yes, even with all his baggage, Smith gives a career-best performance.Saturday 5 July, 10:20pm, BBC OneDie Hard 2View image in fullscreenUnstoppable charisma … Bruce Willis in Die Hard 2.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIsDie Hard 2the best Die Hard film? Absolutely not. Judged against the elegance of its predecessor, this seems as if it was made by crayon-wielding toddlers. However, once you critically disengage, it is a concentrated dose of sheer fun, full of hilariously gratuitous swearing – “No pictures, you pinko bitch,” is a personal favourite, but you will have your own – and a disregard for human life so comprehensive that it borders on the psychopathic. That Bruce Willis retains his unstoppable charisma while murdering an airport full of baddies is testament to the man’s talent.Sunday 6 July, 10:30pm, BBC OneThe Wicker ManView image in fullscreenA masterpiece of folk horror … Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man.Photograph: British Lion/Studiocanal/AllstarDon’t worry, this isn’t the Nicolas Cage one with the bees. This is Robin Hardy’s superlative1973 original, in which Edward Woodward travels to a remote Scottish island full of pagans and slowly comes to learn he’s in over his head. A masterpiece of folk horror, brimming with uncomfortable eeriness, The Wicker Man has left a long and impressive legacy. There is more than a fighting chance this was scheduled to capitalise on the popularity of 28 Years Later. If that’s the case, it’s a very smart move, because the fingerprints of this are all over that.Tuesday 8 July, 11.50pm, BBC Twoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nicolas Roeg’s 1973 Daphne du Maurier adaptationis a disorientating swirlof creeping dread. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a grief-stricken couple who travel to Venice and find themselves plagued by malevolent clairvoyants and terrifying sightings. The final sequence, in which Sutherland follows a figure through the city, is as nightmarish as anything you will ever see.Wednesday 9 July, midnight, BBC TwoBrickView image in fullscreenTrapped … Matthias Schweighöfer and Ruby O Fee in Brick.Photograph: Sasha Ostrov/NetflixPhilip Koch, last seen directing Netflix’s sadly truncated Tribes of Europa sci-fi series (which was cancelled after one season), returns here with a horror thriller with a chilling premise.

Romantic salvation seems to arrive in the shape of Will Sharpe’s winsome indie rocker Felix. But is he really all he seems? Written byLena Dunhamand Luis Felber, this comedy is delightfully unafraid to shred both the stuck-up Britons and the gormless American interlopers. And Stalter, who is equal parts bratty and brittle, carries the show superbly.Netflix, from Thursday 10 JulyJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside StoryView image in fullscreenOpen wide! … Jaws being filmed at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts.Photograph: Universal Studios Licensing LLCOne working title for Peter Benchley’s novel was, apparently, What’s That Noshing on My Leg?.

Then, Joyce decides she wants to know more work gossip and find out who’s dating who.HRFilm choiceWhite House Down,Friday, 9pm, E4View image in fullscreenAn impossibly silly film … Channing Tatum in White House Down.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyIf you couldn’t get enough of Heads of State on Amazon Prime, here’s a film that must have at least partly inspired it. Although it suffered at the time from comparisons to Olympus Has Fallen – Gerard Butler’s dour action film about a terrorist attack on the presidential residence – White House Down is a far lighter affair. Sure, the same things happen, but this has Channing Tatum instead of Butler, and he’s intent on delivering all his lines with the biggest wink imaginable. This is an impossibly silly film and, if you’re drunk enough, it forms a perfect double bill with Heads of State.Stuart HeritageExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like the first film, it is based on the original BBC drama (the second series, in fact) and Brian Donleavy is back as Quatermass himself: the brusque, unsmiling American rocket scientist working closely with the British government and permanently exasperated with them.Once again, Quatermass finds himself at the centre of a deadly alien attempt to take over Planet Earth. While debating whether or not to fire a nuclear powered rocket up into space, Quatermass comes into contact with a woman whose boyfriend has been injured by what appear to be football-sized meteorites, which his white-coated assistants have been already tracking on their radar scopes. It appears that these sinister rocks are marking the skin of those humans unlucky enough to come into contact with them, the victims becoming brainwashed by the aliens.These aliens have already infiltrated humanity so extensively that there is a top-secret conspiracy at the heart of the government to develop a vast secure facility in the remote English countryside, supposedly to develop synthetic food but really to nurture the invaders. The Shell Haven oil refinery in the Thames estuary doubles as this eerily vast domed complex – some audacious action sequences result – while director Val Guest has at his disposal some classic British character acting talent, with William Franklyn and Bryan Forbes as Quatermass’s assistants.The extended shootout at the end accounts for this sequel’s bigger budget, although overall it drags a bit. It’s good to see Sidney James as the chucklingly inebriated journalist who Quatermass thinks might come in useful to print the truth; sadly, we never find out if his paper ever actually published the sensational story he was dictating down the phone.Quatermass 2 is in UK cinemas from 6 July, and is on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 14 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsBBCTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, their last label joked that their tracks were “perfect for Balearic DJs”. But the project actually has its roots far away from the flurry of the white isle: many of the songs were made from a kitchen table in a Greater London suburb where the duo are based.Made up of wife and husband Naomi Pieris and Ronan MT (ddwy means “two” in Welsh), the project was born in 2020 from Covid-era home experiments. Their tracks conserve that intimacy: layered around guitars, percussion and washes of synths, Pieris’s vocals are soft and half-murmured, while field recordings are drawn from visits to her native Sri Lanka and voicemails from relatives.Some of their material has an almost ambient quality – spacious, drumless – but other parts adopt more of a club sensibility, drawing on progressive and deep house. In the years since those early lockdown jams, the pair have gone on to release a small handful of records which they perform live at clubs and beachside festivals across Europe, as well as dimly lit DIY venues closer to home.On their new EP Beaming Backwards, ddwy continue to explore these (interlocking, rather than clashing) sides. Alongside the pulsing late-night rollers (Beaming Backwards, Peak Smile), there’s a blissed-out downtempo moment (Stars, Stars), and a gorgeous take on a Sri Lankan lullaby, complete with piano and strings (Heuldro’r Haf – Welsh for “summer solstice”). It’s the perfect soundtrack for this time of year, when the days are still long and the nights are still warm: sweet, but a bit melancholy too.Safi BugelThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenUniverse-sharpening … Mammo.Photograph: Publicity imageMammo – TractionOne of six universe-sharpening tracks on the Dutch producer’s stunning new album, this has the ethereal throb of dub techno’s greats, but with counter-rhythms inveigling themselves from the edges.​George Riley – SlowAfter recent appearances on tracks from Logic1000, HiTech andSherelle, one of UK dance’s best vocalists keeps the werk rate high with this exquisite house track, Riley holding back from a too-intoxicating romance.Oasis – Acquiesce (Unplugged)As the band play their first reunion tour date tonight in Cardiff – follow the Guardian’s live blog later! – Noel Gallagher has brilliantly remixed a version of their classic B-side, making it more insistent and grooving.Ethel Cain – Fuck Me EyesNot what a Yorkshire person says when it’s a bit bright out, but rather pulp fiction done as a synthpop power ballad, about a wayward young woman who “goes to church straight from the clubs”.View image in fullscreenJohn Glacier performing at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images​John Glacier– Fly With MeComing after an excellent Glastonbury set, and rolling over a distorted head-nodding beat, the British rapper casts herself as a supernaturally powerful figure transcending earthly bonds thanks to her own skill.Perfect 100 – SundayThe debut single from this solo​ grunge-pop project by Brooklyn’s Andrew Madore is a ripper, with distorted guitar ​reminiscent of Yo La Tengo or Dinosaur Jr, and​ harmonised vocals adding a dash of vanilla sweetness.Naemi – Hutchison​Closing out their gorgeous new dream-pop album Breathless, Shorn, this track features acoustic guitar and bass motifs repeating around bird-chirrups and reverb: one for post-picnic snoozing this summer.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taking their name from the daytime parties held by second-generation immigrants in the late 80s and 90s, Daytimers have spent the past five years throwing raucous parties of their own, with residents such as Rohan Rakhit and Mahnoor mixing everything from jungle andBollywoodvocals with dubstep, grime instrumentals and Punjabi folk for a new generation born and raised in the UK.View image in fullscreenDaytimers: Alterations.Following in the footsteps of their Asian underground forebears such as Nitin Sawhney and Talvin Singh, who mixed the sounds of 90s Britain with thesouth-Asian music they grew up listening to, Daytimers’ latest compilation has 13 south-Asian producers remixing Bollywood hits from the Sony India catalogue with an eye on today’s dancefloor culture.There is ample bass-weight across the record’s 10 tracks, with German-Pakistani producer Zeeshan’s take on the score of 2022 Tamil film Vikram transforming the original’s keening vocal melody into a chipmunk snippet skittering over an ominous, growling bassline and siren-like synths. Daytimers co-founder Provhat, meanwhile, layers a thunderous jungle breakbeat over the wedding classic Suraj Hua Maddham – sure to turn receptions into raves – and Rea’s take on Anirudh Ravichander’s Dippam Dappam flips the cinema standard into a rumbling Afro-house groove.While certain edits work less well – with Baalti’s take on AR Rahman’s Tere Bina merely speeding up the original over two-step drum programming and Zenjah and Mrii’s version of Where’s the Party Tonight struggling to wrangle the kitsch, Vengaboys-style vocal of the 2006 Bollywood original into a UK garage groove – the majority of the album produces remarkable rearrangements. Reframing this nostalgic cinema music for the modern dancefloor, Alterations proves there is still plenty of space for future generations of diaspora artists to celebrate and find inspiration in their heritage.Also out this monthUgandan rapperMC Yallah’s second album with Berlin producerDebmaster,Gaudencia (Hakuna Kulala), is typically abrasive and full of irrepressible energy. Employing a languorous flow over Debmaster’s growling beats, Yallah spits venomously on Muchaka while showcasing scatter-gun dexterity on highlight Kekasera. Iraqi vocalistHamidal-Saadi’s first record of traditional maqam music in over 25 years,Maqam Al-Iraq (Maqam Records), is a delight. Soaring over intricate santour lines, Saadi’s sprawling, 20-minute compositions expand on a centuries-old tradition through his indefatigable voice. Syrian producerKhaled Kurbehreleases the ambient electronic albumLikulli Fadāin Eqāéh (Research Records). Whispers of guitar strumming and washes of melody create an imaginative and sometimes ominous palette – a sense of beauty bordering on dread.This article was amended on 4 July to correct Zeeshan’s nationality from British to German-Pakistani.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthElectronic musicDance musicBollywoodalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

On Hyperdistillation, a man dies sleeping rough outside uninhabited penthouses as NHS backlogs threaten lives, and the ravey Diagnoses presents mental health issues as “the right response to a world gone wrong,” while Statue in the Square’s doomy grime reckons with a climate of transphobia (Tempestcame out as non-binaryin 2020 and earlier this year revealed his gender transition).View image in fullscreenKae Tempest: Self TitledAnd yet, there is something irrepressibly joyous about this album, which is essentially a collection of love letters: to the trans community, to the Londoner’s home town, to his partner. Tempest’s ability to imbue societal decay and personal torment with strange beauty, via lyricism honed on the performance poetry scene, is unparalleled, and his roots in the art form are still very much evident in his earnest, rhythmic delivery.Sometimes, the actual music struggles to keep up and fit in. While 2022’sThe Line Is a Curvelet the words shine over a backdrop of classy, unobtrusive indie electronica, here the instrumentals are far more attention-grabbing: magisterial strings, gospelly R&B and, on Neil Tennant collaboration Sunshine on Catford, full-beam 1980s synth-pop. It can feel like a random grab bag of genres, and the potent sonics are sometimes overbearing. Then again, the effusiveness does help to underline the hope and hard-won happiness that, against all odds, underpins this rich, compelling and timely record.Explore more on these topicsKae TempestRapSpoken wordHip-hopPoetryPop and rockElectronic musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

There wasn’t much to read – the prose is what’s now called “spare” – but I vividly remember the pleasure of poking a finger through the holes punched in the page. And that final twist!My favourite book growing upI was a fanatical member of the Puffin Club at school, and so many of those books embedded themselves in me; E Nesbit’s Dragons, Narnia, of course, the Molesworth books, which I barely understood and found hysterical. But my favourite were Tove Jansson’s Moomins, particularly the chilly later books, with their very particular melancholy. Other books seemed to be reaching for laughter or excitement, but there was a pleasure in all that sadness and solitude.The book that changed me as a teenagerGreat Expectationswas my first “proper classic” and I was tremendously pleased with myself for getting through it, and startled, too, by how familiar the characters felt. The foolishness, the passionate friendships, the empty aspiration and unrequited love, it all made perfect sense to me, even across 120 years.The book that made me want to be a writerI’m not sure if I ever dared voice that ambition, even to myself, but I remember laughing hysterically at Sue Townsend’sThe Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4,and thinking what an achievement that would be, to make a reader laugh with marks on a page. In many ways, the early 80s was a golden age of comic writing but so much of it had a rather rather self-satisfied Oxbridge tone. Suddenly, here was an authentic working-class voice, writing with an almost supernatural such precision and insight into the teenage boy’s mindset. I loved it and, as with Great Expectations, turned the pages thinking “How does the author know?The book or author I came back toI’m a little nervous to admit this but I used to struggle with Jane Austen, recognising her subtlety and brilliance but finding that ironic tone a little relentless and, despite many attempts, never making it to the end. But in lockdown I picked upPersuasionand finally, after 40 years of trying, something fell into place.The book I rereadIf I ever find myself stuck or jaded, I pick up Marilynne Robinson’sHousekeeping. The prose is just perfect, that atmosphere of a water-logged small town so vivid. There’s a warmth and generosity of spirit, particularly in the character of Aunt Sylvie, I find incredibly moving. I feel sure that it’s one of the very best American novels.The book I could never read againI’ve been lucky enough to adapt several of my favourite novels for the screen, but the process is prolonged, intricate and exhausting. The patient never survives the operation and I struggle to imagine the circumstances in which I would ever pick upFar from the Madding Crowdagain.The book I discovered later in lifeI’m so pleased that Helen Garner is getting the praise and attention she deserves. I love her wonderfully frank and spiky diaries and nonfiction but there are two very different novels of hers that I think about all the time.The Spare Roomis a tough, unsentimental book about the demands and limits of friendship.The Children’s Bachis wildly different, a spare, moving portrait of a loving family falling apart. Those final pages!The book I am currently readingI tend to read two books at a time, one fiction and one nonfiction. Yiyun Li’s memoir,Things in Nature Merely Grow, is extraordinarily wise, thoughtful and affecting, and the best case I can think of for the power of the written word. Alongside that, I’m reading the wonderfulThe Country Girls, my first Edna O’Brien but not my last.My comfort readAnita Brookner.

That novel was told through a young child’s limited perspective, so daily life was described vividly – almond trees and coloured kaftans – while bigger issues, such as why she didn’t see her father, remained vague and mysterious.Some 30 years later, Freud has returned to the same narrator, Lucy. But in this accomplished new novel, she explores how Lucy grows up and starts to question the impact of her unconventional upbringing. My Sister and Other Lovers opens with teenage Lucy, her mother and sister once again on the move. It’s the 1970s, her mother has a new son from another failed relationship, and they are on a ferry to Ireland, as they have no money and nowhere else to go.Bohemian rootlessness in Morocco at least meant sunshine, but this is an altogether murkier existence. The family wait for buses in the rain, hitch lifts, share rooms in communal houses. Walls are cracked, carpets moth-eaten. Even a stay in a Scottish manor seems feral and dangerous: the girls eat tinned ravioli off the floor, play lethal games on frozen lakes, and roam in packs with other unsupervised teens.The book occupies an interesting grey area between novel and memoir, creating something all of its ownSensing opportunity, men sniff about the sisters: they are girls without boundaries, grateful for any attention. This is a pre-#MeToo, pre-internet, pre-smartphone world. Messages are left on answering machines. Letters are left with pub barmen. Children are left with strangers. “I love your mother,” says one of Lucy’s friends later. “Remember how she never minded what we did?”Once, the family stay at a farm where they are woken by screaming because the farm dog has killed its own puppies. The mother briskly tells her daughters that the dog did it “for their own good”. This is the book’s main concern: the damage that can be done to children by their parents.Both Lucy and her author seek to understand rather than condemn. We learn that Lucy’s mother had kept her daughters secret from her Irish parents, preferring the hardship of a rackety life to the risk of ending up in an institution for unmarried mothers. Her defiance is admirable, but her refusal to conform has consequences, especially for elder sister Bea, who is preyed upon by one of her mother’s boyfriends. One of the darkest elements of the novel is the mother’s refusal to believe Bea. “How could she remember? She was only six years old!”In the absence of a stable family, the relationship between the sisters becomes vital – and is beautifully drawn. Furious Bea is determined to make her escape, while Lucy is desperate to keep them together. Lucy is an appealing narrator, both as a sensitive teenager and later as a young mother, aware of her own failings: “I’d searched for a family with every job I’d done. How often I’d adopted one, only to find it more precarious than my own. I’d chosen men – I was starting to discover this – loved them in direct relation to how likely they were to leave.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It has three parts, each showing Lucy and Bea at different points in their lives, but doesn’t provide dates. Some characters appear in all three sections, but others simply vanish; unusual in a novel, yet close to the way life really is. Similarly, the decision not to name either parent in the book – they are always “mother” or “father” – seems both a refusal to identify them and a refusal to fictionalise.Intriguingly, Freud also explores the impact of sharing your family story. Bea ends up making a film about their childhood (as Hideous Kinky was made into a film starring Kate Winslet) and, in an interview, tells a journalist she “never felt safe”. This public exposure infuriates their mother. “Write and tell them it’s not true,” she demands.It’s especially interesting as Lucy, our narrator, who we may have assumed is a stand-in for Freud, is here left to wonder why Bea’s version of events is the one accepted as truth, while her memories remain private. There are, the novel suggests, multiple versions of every family story – even the one we are reading. It’s a fascinating tangle of fact and fiction that refuses easy answers, and a subtle, clever, evocative book.My Sister and Other Lovers by Esther Freud is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

Isherwood’s point of departure is the profound sense of dissociation induced by grief, and in casting a dancer, former Royal Ballet principalEd Watson, as George’s body, and singer-songwriterJohn Grantas his mind, Watkins at a stroke shows us his riven, dislocated self: Watson on the ground, Grant raised on a platform, motion and music operating on different planes.If Grant’s voice is always fluent, even mellifluous, moving from low growl through easy baritone and even up to eerie countertenor, Watson’s body begins blocked – all angle and effort, no flow. On one level, the piece is the story of its unblocking, through the reawakening of desire: there’s a tennis match that morphs into homoerotic fantasy; there are passionate memories of his dead lover Jim (Jonathan Goddard); a drunken evening with old friend Charley (Kristen McNally), who has desires of her own; and finally a baptismal night-swimming escapade with a student, Kenny (James Hay), that plunges George back into the waters of life.On another level, it is an enactment of Isherwood’s main plot points as he recounts a day in the life of a university teacher – though here, you might do well to read a synopsis in advance, to be able to place the settings and the secondary characters, or to follow their interweaving of action, recollection and imagination.There’s a varied and talented creative team. Holly Waddington and Eleanor Bull’s costumes flip from 60s Americana to abstract-expressionist leotards as the dance ensemble transform between portraying specific characters and generic human beings, gathered into choruses of yearning, desire or defiance. Chiara Stephenson has created a superb set, able to indicate kitchen, bathroom, bar or classroom, and semi-concealing Jasmin Kent Rodgman’s instrumental ensemble, who set the mood-music between Grant’s songs.Does it gel, though? Intermittently. Rodgman and Grant’s music often feel at odds with each other, and the choreography, though finely danced, seems more to pursue Isherwood’s text than to find its own rhythms. The end, which I won’t give away, does veer from the text but opts for comfort and closure where Isherwood had left us before a more open, unflinching vision, not of grief but of mortality.At Aviva Studios, Manchester, until 6 July;Linbury theatre, London, 8-20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceEdward WatsonChristopher IsherwoodBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

Duuuuude,” Tom Araya exhales, reflecting on Slayer’s maiden, gob-spackled UK show at London’s Marquee Club in 1985. They were just kids then, on the verge of becoming the most belligerent force in thrash metal’s “big four” with Reign in Blood, but time hasn’t dulled their blade. The bassist-vocalist’s mane might be streaked with grey as he addresses the heaving pit but he still has bile to spare, immediately calling up a take on War Ensemble fit to loosen teeth a dozen rows from the front.View image in fullscreenBile to spare … Tom Araya.Photograph: Maxine Howells/Getty ImagesOrbiting their contribution to Black Sabbath’s forthcoming final show in Birmingham, this is Slayer’s first UK date in six years after a final tour that, not unsurprisingly given metal’s spotty record in this regard, wasn’t so final after all. There’s little sense of a sheepish re-emergence, though, with a lengthy video package on the history of the band teeing up South of Heaven’s inimitable riff, which is immediately in the throats of the crowd before drummer Paul Bostaph’s double-kick sparks kinetic mayhem.Their set is lean and unforgivingly mean. There are no breathers, no ballads. Its most melodic moment is Seasons in the Abyss, which even in these bucolic surroundings is a needling nightmare of a song. Guitarist Kerry King plays with punishing intensity, his squalling solos meshing with dextrous leads from a swaggering Gary Holt, the Exodus riffer who took over from the late Jeff Hanneman a little more than a decade ago. The duo assemble Jihad’s constituent parts methodically, building piece by piece in anticipation of its descent into chaos.There is spectacle – amid a gnarly Disciple two upside down crosses made from Marshall cabinets go up in flames – but it’s pointed. Where main support Amon Amarth’s towering Viking warriors and drinking horns are obviously in service of fun, Slayer are still a shocking proposition, their churning riffs punctuated by gross-out gore and grim images from endless war. During Raining Blood, which remains a perfect metal song, the screens make it look like the red stuff is pouring from the sky, dousing audience and band alike. Subtle? No. Effective? Absolutely.Slayer play Back to the Beginning, Villa Park, Birmingham, 5 July; and Finsbury Park, London, 6 JulyExplore more on these topicsSlayerMetallive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Peruvian artist Santiago Yahuarcani creates his works by applying paint prepared from pigments, seeds, leaves and roots, to large sheets ofllanchama,a cloth made from the bark of theojétree. His works are often inspired by the hallucinations brought on by the ritual ingestion of tobacco, coca, ayahuasca and mushrooms – substances long used by the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon when in search of help, knowledge or revelation.

He uses his work to preserve the history of his people, confront the violence they have had to endure, and fight for a future that is relentlessly under threat. In his paintings, celestial beings dance in starlight. Hybrid creatures – part-human, part-dolphin – wade through rivers. Bodies meld with nature and jungle melds with body. These dizzyingly shamanistic paintings of mythological creatures and Indigenous spiritualism are a celebration of his home, his people and his past.The show - part of theManchesterInternational festival - opens with three vast, chaotic paintings on traditional bark canvas, a rough, dense material that he painstakingly hammers flat with a machete. Each work is filled with a whorl of licking tongues, gawping mouths and endless hybrid creatures. A woman with webbed fingers and scales down her back gathers fish in her arms as a man inhales big clouds of smoke being puffed out by a grey figure with crab claws for hands. Rocks have eyes and teeth, birds become lizards, fish brandish spears. If it sounds like it’s fuelled by hallucinogens, that’s because it is: medicinal plants like ayahuasca, as well as coca and tobacco, are an integral part of Uitoto culture.Yahuarcani’s wild visions are filled with references to creation myths, to the way rivers, animals and forests are carriers of memory. Spirits are everywhere, their stories passed down by elders in ritual storytelling sessions (Yahuarcani comes from a family of artists). He paints a world where man and nature flow into each other, inseparable, interrelated, interconnected.A lot of the works have a direct narrative. An image of coca and tobacco leaves tells the story of Moo Buinaima, the father creator whose tears allowed humanity to walk the earth, with those sacred plants allowing communication between the Uitoto and the divine. A figure with splayed bird feet is Juma, the heron man, Yahuarcani’s first ancestor, responsible for Moo Buinaima. A painting of hands describes the way Uitoto-Aimeni counting works. A whole system of knowledge is delineated, a whole history of humanity is told, in swirling patterns of brown, red and blue.View image in fullscreenColonial violence looms darkly … Here It’s hot by Santiago Yahuarcani.Photograph: CRISIS Gallery/© Santiago YahuarcaniBut one presence looms darkly over all of this: colonial violence. Bodies are thrust into a pit of fire by figures brandishing machine guns in one painting. A woman bleeds an endless stream of white fluid in another. More than 30,000 Indigenous people died between 1879 and 1912 at the hands of the Peruvian Amazon Company. It brutally exploited the people and the land for profit, and the pain of those atrocities – experienced directly by Yahuarcani’s grandfather – endures in these paintings.More modern threats appear too, as Covid is depicted as a furry monster ravaging the world. But throughout all of this shocking imagery, Yahuarcani’s work is still filled with leopards, crocodiles, pink dolphins and gods, figures resisting, fighting the onslaught of exploitation and violence. These fantastical creatures represent his land, his people, his history all surviving despite the adversity they’ve faced.‘They came for our land, our wood, our gold’: Santiago Yahuarcani, Peruvian painter of dancing dolphins – and genocideRead moreYahuarcani’s work is intricate, detailed, colourful and passionate. It tells important, powerful stories, and it tells them urgently. But you have to tread a fine line here, being careful not fetishise the work or Yahuarcani’s background – yet at the same time, you can’t just view it all through the lens of western art history. It’s not good because it looks like western painting, and it’s not good just because it tells a story that’s incredibly affecting. It’s good because it’s relevant, because it’s emotional, because it’s an artist using painting as a tool of survival, endurance and communication.At a time when Indigenous cultures are increasingly under threat, Yahuarcani’s work feels necessary, crucial. It doesn’t hurt that it’s also deeply beautiful and hugely moving.Santiago Yahuarcani: The Beginning of Knowledge is at theWhitworth, Manchester, as part of the Manchester International Festival, until 4 January.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingArtManchesterColombiaColonialismreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, in details revealed today, visitors will be able to order up items to look at closely, while V&A archivists and star curators will make selections to go on display in a series of rotating showcases. Tickets will be free.Nile Rodgers, the Chic bandleader and guitarist who worked with Bowie on the hit album Let’s Dance, has curated one of these areas, with items including correspondence between the two, studio images taken by Peter Gabriel during the making of Bowie’s Rodgers-assisted 1993 album Black Tie White Noise, and a bespoke suit designed by Peter Hall for the Serious Moonlight tour.“My creative life with David Bowie provided the greatest success of his incredible career, but our friendship was just as rewarding,” Rodgers said, announcing the partnership. “Our bond was built on a love of the music that had both made and saved our lives.”View image in fullscreenGuest curators the Last Dinner Party marvel at items in the Bowie archive.Photograph: Timothy Eliot Spurr/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonAlso playing guest curators are the members of chart-topping alt-pop band the Last Dinner Party, whose selections include handwritten lyrics for the Young Americans album, studio photos by Mick Rock and – rather nerdishly – the manual for Bowie’s EMS synth, heard on the so-called Berlin trilogy of albums.“David Bowie continues to inspire generations of artists like us to stand up for ourselves,” the band said in a joint statement. “When we first started developing ideas for TLDP, we took a similar approach to Bowie developing his Station to Station album – we had a notebook and would write words we wanted to associate with the band. It was such a thrill to explore Bowie’s archive, and see first-hand the process that went into his world-building and how he created a sense of community and belonging for those that felt like outcasts or alienated – something that’s really important to us in our work too.”Rodgers and the band’s choices will be included in an area featuring items that are rotated every six months or so, with fresh guest curators each time.There will also be eight other sections showcasing around 200 Bowie items curated by the V&A team in collaboration with young people from the neighbouring London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest, with each area refreshed every few years.These will include a look at Bowie’s unrealised projects, such as film tie-ins with the Diamond Dogs and Young Americans albums, and even a mooted adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984. Other areas will spotlight iconic moments such as his 1987 Glass Spider tour, his collaborations with bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and the creation of the Ziggy Stardust persona.View image in fullscreenSketch for a film version of Diamond Dogs, which was never made.Photograph: © The David Bowie ArchiveTM/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonThere will also be an interactive installation tracing Bowie’s impact on pop cultural figures from Issey Miyake to Lady Gaga, and a film compiling live performances across his career.What will really provoke Bowie fans’ fascination, though, is seeing objects up close, “including costumes, musical instruments, models, props and scenery” according to the V&A. Visitors will be able to book to see five items each visit, with two weeks’ notice, using the V&A’s “order an object” service. Bookings will begin in September.More than 70,000 of the archive items are photographic prints, negatives and transparencies, and these, along with other paper-based items – “notebooks, diaries, lyrics, scripts, correspondence, project files, writings, unrealised projects, cover artwork, designs, concept drawings, fanmail and art” – will also be available to view by special appointment.The V&A first acquired Bowie’s archive in 2023, with director Tristram Hunt promising the David Bowie Centre would be a “new sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow”.Fancy a masterpiece? Just pop one in your basket! V&A’s new open-access outpost will thrill art-loversRead moreHe and his team will hope the centre will be a major tourist draw to its new V&A East Storehouse, which opened in May in the Olympic Park, Stratford. Like the David Bowie Centre within it, the building showcases items from the V&A’s collection, and allows visitors to book to see other items close up.“We wanted it to feel like an immersive cabinet of curiosities,” the building’s architect Liz Diller told the Guardian. “So you land right in the middle, at the very heart of the building, flipping the usual progression from public to private.”The Guardian’s architecture criticOliver Wainwright saidthe buildings gives “a thrilling window into the sprawling stacks of our national museum of everything”, while art criticJonathan Jones saidin a five star review: “This is what the museum of the future looks like – an old idea that’s now been turned inside out, upside down, disgorging its secrets, good and bad, in an avalanche of beautiful questions, created with curiosity, generous imagination and love.”Another V&A outpost in the Olympic Park, the more traditional gallery space of V&A East Museum, will open in spring 2026.Explore more on these topicsMusicDavid BowieV&AMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

A reliable cool box is your best defence against such disappointments, and today’s models are designed to keep your provisions frosty, long after you’ve lost your phone signal. But which ones are actually up to muster?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.From insulated picnic bags to heavy-duty ice chests, I’ve tested 14 of the best coolers and rounded up the ones that should keep you (and yourhummus) fresh. Because no one should have to settle for tepid wine after the effort of pitching a tent.At a glanceBest cool box overall:Coleman Pro cooler box£135 at MilletsBest budget cool box:Campingaz Icetime Plus£29.46 at B&QBest electric cool box:Outwell Ecocool£149.44 at AmazonBest cool bag:Quechua Backpack Cooler 100£24.99 at DecathlonBest cool box for multiday chilling:Oyster Tempo cooler£353 at OysterBest cool box on wheels:Yeti Roadie 48 wheeled cool box£400 at John LewisWhy you should trust meA keen camper and festival goer, I’ve learned the hard way that a decent cool box can make or break a trip. With a background in biology, I’m also acutely aware of the risks of food poisoning from ill-stored sausages and suspect coleslaw. So I put my scientific mind to devising a battery of tests to separate the coolest coolers from the lukewarm letdowns.How I testedView image in fullscreenMilking it: few things can test cool boxes’ chilling abilities like good old dairy.Photograph: Linda Geddes/The GuardianIce retention, temperature consistency, portability and durability: I put all these metrics to the test. But my first (and most important) criteria was how long each cooler stayed cool. I prechilled each cool box with one standard ice pack per 6-7l capacity, then added a frozen one-pint plastic flagon of milk, and recorded how long it took for the internal temperature of the cool box to cool down to 8C – the maximum recommended by theUK Food Standards Agencyto stop harmful bacteria from growing – and how long it took for the milk to defrost completely.I used digital wireless thermometers to monitor the temperature inside the cool boxes, and each box was opened every four hours and after being left overnight to recreate the comings and goings of a campsite cook. My shortlisted cool boxes were then half filled with ice cubes, and I timed how long it took for these to completely melt.For the electric cool boxes, I tested how long it took each one to reach its lowest temperature on the maximum setting, and then unplugged them and followed the same protocols as for the passive cool boxes to put their thermal performance to the test.I filled each cool box (or bag) with 10kg of provisions and assessed how easy it was to lift into a car boot or carry 100 metres. Points were deducted for coolers that were too shallow to allow an opened bottle of wine to stand upright, and points added for features that enabled contents to be separated, thus avoiding such horrors as bacon juice mingling with your brie. Wheeled cool boxes were then hauledoutside, where I tested how easily they rolled up and down kerbs and grassy slopes, and over asphalt and tree roots.Below are the 10 cool boxes that performed best in my tests.Tested cool boxes will either be returned to their manufacturers or donated toKitsquad, a UK-based scheme that helps people with low incomes get out into the great outdoors.The best cool boxes and cool bags in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nic Fleming/The GuardianBestcool box overall:Coleman Procooler boxView image in fullscreen£135 at Millets£129 at AmazonThe Coleman Pro takes its job seriously. With thick polyurethane foam insulation in both the lid and the body, it claims to keep food and drinks cold for up to 3.5 days – ideal for long weekends at festivals or off-grid campsites. At 24 litres, this cool box isn’t cavernous – but larger 42.5l and 52l versions are available that claim to retain ice for even longer (4.5 and 5 days respectively).The metal latch is a small but satisfying detail, reducing the risk of this cooler spilling its contents if it gets knocked over; the antibacterial liner, which should help to keep bad smells at bay, is another; while its rugged plastic casing should render it tough enough to withstand muddy campsites and bumpy car boots.Whywe love itThis cool box ranked near the top in my ice retention tests, staying below 8C for 28 hours and keeping my milk partially frozen for 30 hours. It would doubtless perform better if it were filled with more contents and ice, too: indeed, when half filled with ice and left in an 18C room with the lid closed, it took four days and six hours for the ice to fully melt.I also loaded up this cool box and took it to a festival for four days with only four medium ice blocks, and my food still felt acceptably cool by the end of it – although I’d have needed additional ice if camping for any longer than this.This is a sturdy cool box, easily strong enough to double as a seat if needed, and it comes with a five-year guarantee. Its water drain is well designed, with only minimal liquid remaining after tipping, and I appreciated the inclusion of both side-handlesanda padded and adjustable shoulder strap.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t have cup holders in the lid, like its cousin the Coleman Xtreme Marine 28QT (below).

The thick foam insulation in both its lid and body aims to keep contents cool for up to 24 hours, while its lid locking handle is designed to ensure a tight seal, helping to maintain the interior temperature.Whywe love itThis no-frills cool box may not turn heads, but it’s sturdier than it looks and would make a solid companion for overnight camping trips or festivals – where your main objective is keeping drinks cool. After adding ice blocks and a frozen bottle of milk, the cooler’s internal temperature dipped to a better-than-average 2.6C, and it stayed reliably at 8C for a respectable 15 hours – while the milk remained partially frozen for 22.5 hours. Remarkably, when this budget cool box was half filled with ice, it took nearly three days for it to melt – easily long enough to see campers through a weekend.The lid is robust enough to double as an emergency seat, while the tough plastic shell feels capable of withstanding the usual campsite and festival indignities. It’s probably not built for prolonged heatwaves, but it should earn its keep in milder conditions.It’s a shame that …the lid is hinged rather than fully removable, which may slightly hinder cleaning.Capacity:26lInnersize:33 x 24 x 33cm (WDH)Outersize:41 x 32 x 42cm (WDH)Weight:2.4kgClaimed ice retention:24 hoursHandles:solid plastic swing (top) handleWater drain:noWheels:noBest electric cool box:Outwell EcocoolView image in fullscreen£164.99 at Mountain Warehouse£149.44 at AmazonDesigned to operate on both 12V and 230V power supplies, the Outwell Ecocool can be plugged in to your car (12V) or the mains (230V), and it will cool its contents to 18-25C below ambient temperature – or helpfully heat them to 60C if you’ve packed pasties rather than prosecco.With a capacity of up to 35l, this cool box is tall enough to store 2l bottles upright. An internal divider also functions as an ice pack to assist cooling and further reduce energy consumption, while making it easier to locate objects within its cavernous interior.The insulation is beefed up with polyurethane foam, and there’s an antimicrobial lining to fend off the bacterial horror show that can bloom in other such containers.Whywe love itThe Ecocool didn’t disappoint. It took five hours to consistently hit 2.75C – respectable for a unit of this size. Its internal divider, which doubles as an ice pack, should significantly accelerate this process, although I didn’t test this.Where the Ecocool really shone was in cold retention. After switching off the power, it took one day and 9.5 hours for the internal temperature to reach 8C, and another 1.5 hours for a pint of milk to fully defrost. When half filled with ice, it took three-and-a-half days to fully melt.Like most electric cool boxes, it produced a noticeable hum in Max mode. While Eco mode was quieter, it was still audible. However, given its excellent insulation, the Ecocool could easily be switched off while you sleep without compromising food safety.Another feature that impressed me was the split lid. Dividing the top into two hinged sections means you can open one side at a time, reducing cold air loss, and making it easier to grab a bit of milk without disturbing everything else inside.It’s a shame that …the plastic carry handle wasn’t the sturdiest of those I tested; that said, as an electric cool box, it’s unlikely to be hauled far on foot. It’s also annoying that the lid automatically closes and must be manually held open – although this is presumably to reduce cold air loss and energy.Capacity:35lInnersize:44 x 25.5 x 31cm (WDH)Outersize:52 x 32 x 43cm (WDH)Weight:7.4kgClaimed ice retention:not stated (cools to 18-25C below outside temperature; warms to 50-60C)Handles:solid plastic swing (top) handleWater drain:noWheels:noBest cool bag:QuechuaBackpack Cooler 100View image in fullscreen£24.99 at Decathlon£25 at ArgosDesigned to keep food and drinks cool during daylong outings, this insulated backpack is well stocked with storage options for stashing other necessities such as your wallet, keys and sunscreen. It has two mesh side pockets and two zipped compartments as well as the insulated inner zone. It also has adjustable straps, a foam back and waist and chest belts, and can be folded down for easy storage when not in use.Whywe love itSometimes the simplest ideas are the most effective: you’re hiking to the beach and want your sandwiches and drinks to stay cool, but you’ve also got towels,sun creamand other paraphernalia to carry, and lugging a handheld cool bag isn’t practical. This backpack offers a hands-free solution.My expectations for its cooling capacity weren’t particularly high, so I was delighted to discover that it outperformed many of the solid cool boxes I tested. The internal temperature stayed below 8C for an impressive 23 hours, and my bottle of milk took 27 hours to fully thaw. I didn’t deploy the ice cube test because this product is designed to be used with ice packs and isn’t fully waterproof.The bag is also comfortable to wear, looks decent, and comes with enough side pockets to rival the day bag I usually use for our (all too tepid) family lunches. For a short hike or an overnight camping trip with minimal provisions – its capacity is only 20l – it’s a clever and affordable solution.It’s a shame that …although the insulated compartment can be wiped clean, it’s not fully waterproof – something Decathlon clearly states on its website. This means that condensation from the chilled contents may sometimes leak through the seams, and spillages may also not be contained.Capacity:20lInnersize:28 x 18 x 38cm (WDH)Outersize:29 x 19 x 42cm (WDH)Weight:0.48kgClaimed ice retention:seven hoursHandles:backpackWater drain:noWheels:noBest cool box for multiday chilling:Oyster TempocoolerView image in fullscreen£353 at OysterThe Oyster Tempo cooler introduces a novel approach to portable cooling: using vacuum insulation to maintain low temperatures without the need for large quantities of ice. Just two large ice packs should be enough to reach and hold temperatures three times colder than ordinary premium coolers, the company suggests. In theory, this should mean more usable space, plus days and days of chilled food – with no electric socket in sight.Constructed with a lightweight aluminium body, Oyster claims the Tempo is both durable and recyclable. With its sleek lines and matt silver exterior, it also looks rather beautiful. These cool credentials come at a cost, however: at £353, this is the second most expensive product I tested.Whywe love itStrong claims demand strong evidence – so I ran my milk test twice: the first time, using standard ice blocks at the same ratio of frozen milk to ice as the other cool boxes; the second using my standard one-pint flagon of frozen milk plus the two large Tempo-branded ice blocks.My results were impressive: after my first test,the internal temperature dropped to 1C and was still just 2.2C after 24 hours. It didn’t rise above 8C until the next day (37 hours) – and even then, the milk took another three hours to thaw.Swapping in the Tempo ice blocks gave even chillier results: after plunging to -1.6C, it took just over two days (49.5 hours) to cross the 8C threshold, and it took a further 2.5 hours before the milk was fully thawed. When half filled with ice, it took five days and 17 hours for the ice to completely melt.The Tempo was straightforward to use. I loved the sturdy latches, which enabled the lid to hinge open – or be taken clean off, if necessary.It’s a shame that …the price tag is high – and higher stillif you want thealuminium carry handle (£41)or twoice packs (£54). The shoulder strap isn’t padded, so carrying heavy loads is quite uncomfortable. The cool box isn’t tall enough for a standard bottle of wine to stand upright, and its aluminium interior dented when I accidentally dropped a can of beer into it, so this may not be the most durable cool box on the market.Capacity:23lInnersize:41.5 x 21.2 x 26.8cm (WDH)Outersize:51.2 x 30 x 32cm (WDH)Weight:5.5kgClaimed ice retention:not statedHandles:adjustable fabric shoulder strap.

Equipped with PermaFrost™ insulation (polyurethane foam injected into the walls under pressure), an Interlock™ lid system, a ColdLock™ gasket (tightly fitting lid with a thick rubber seal) and a Quicklatch™ (soft, flexible latch system), this cool box is engineered to keep food fresh for days.It’s been moulded from a single, seamless piece of plastic designed to enhance its durability and resistance to impacts, and is equipped with solid, puncture-resistant tyres and tough, Neverfail™ hinges. If these ruggedness claims aren’t enough, the Roadie 48 also comes with a five-year warranty.Whywe love itThis is a hulking tank of a cooler, fit for an expedition to Death Valley rather than a weekend in Devon. While it lacks integrated ports to padlock it shut, and therefore hasn’t been certifiedbear-resistantas some other Yeti models have, it’s still averyrobust cool box, possibly to the point of overkill.If a 48l cool box isn’t gigantic enough for your needs, there’s also a 60l version (as well as smaller 15, 24 and 32l designs). Yet, despite its size, trundling the Yeti Roadie over various surfaces was a breeze.Its ice retention was also impressive: the internal temperature took 22 hours to climb from 1.9C to 8C; and 24 hours for my pint of milk to fully defrost.Yeti doesn’t make specific claims about ice retention, emphasising that this varies based on ice quantity, ambient temperature, and how often the cooler is opened. However, when I half filled it with ice and left it in an 18C room, it took five days and 20 hours to fully melt.I also tested the much larger Coleman Pro 55QT wheeled cooler box (£222.99 at Decathlon), which I’d recommend as a cheaper alternative (it was so big, my 12-year-old son could fit inside it). It was narrowly pipped to this list because the Yeti was easier to pull on grass and lumpy ground and had a smaller footprint. However, it kept its cool for longer than the Yeti in my frozen milk test (26 hours v 24 hours), and Coleman claims this model can retain ice for up to five days.It’s a shame that …the interior of this cool box is so huge, making it hard to organise and locate specific contents. Although it comes with one dry goods basket, it can accommodate two – however, you need to buy this separately. Given that this cool box already costs £400, this feels a bit miserly.The water drain also wasn’t great. Even when the cool box was tipped and wiggled about, a small amount of water remained in the bottom. There was no way of attaching the plug to the cool box, either, so care should be taken not to lose it.Capacity:48lInnersize:36.8 x 29 x 40.1cm (WDH)Outersize:50.3x 51.1 x 52.3cm (WDH)Weight:11.7kgClaimed ice retention:not statedHandles:telescopic pull handle plus built-in grip slots on either sideWater drain:yesWheels:yesThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Linda GeddesNinja FrostVaultwheeled cool box with dry zoneView image in fullscreen£179.99 at Ninja£179.99 at CurrysBest for:festivalsThe Ninja FrostVault comes with a “dry zone” – a chilled storage drawer below the main compartment to keep items separate – meaning no more digging through leaky packages of meat to find the hummus.The box felt solid and was a breeze to wheel to the park, including over various obstacles. It could be a good option for festivals with a long walk in – although, given its high price tag, you’d want a means of concealing it from thieves. Some users also complain that it is heavy to lift and pull long distances when fully loaded: I didn’t find this, but I’m 5ft 8in and quite strong.Its ice retention was also pretty cool: it took 29 hours for the internal temperature to hit 8C, and 30 hours for a frozen pint of milk to fully thaw. When half loaded with ice, it took three days and 22 hours to melt.This cool box also had the best-designed drain of all those I tested, requiring minimal tipping or agitation to empty itself. 42 and 61l versions of this cooler are also available, and Ninja offers a five-year guarantee upon registration of these products.It didn’t make the final cut because …it takes up a lot of space for a 28l cool box – with a footprint almost as large as the 48l Yeti Roadie.

In my tests, it stayed below 8C for 19 hours and kept a pint of milk semi-frozen for a similar amount of time (19.5 hours). The detachable shoulder strap was comfortable, and the fabric loop handles were well constructed, while the inner lining was waterproof and easy to wipe clean.It didn’t make the final cut because …though attractive and well-designed, the Hydro Flask is expensive for what it is.

I also loved the incorporation of four cup-holders into its lid, and it’s robust enough to sit on. When loaded with a frozen pint of milk and four standard ice blocks, its interior stayed below 8C for 25 hours, with the milk fully defrosted after 27, making it better than the average of all those on test.Overall, this would be a sturdy investment for regular weekends away outdoors, with some clever design features.It didn’t make the final cut because …its ice retention, although respectable, wasn’t the best.

VonHaus claims it will chill to 14C below the ambient temperature – although in my own tests, it fared slightly better, taking just 1hr 50mins on full power to reach an internal temperature of 1.2C in an 18C room. Its internal temperature then stayed below 8C for an impressive 30.5 hours with the power switched off – after which a pint of milk had also just about defrosted. When half filled with ice, it took three days (72 hours) for the ice to become liquid with the power switched off.This cool box can also be used for heating food to 50C, has an Eco mode for saving electricity, and comes with three power leads: a three-pin hole plug, 12V car plug and a USB-A lead.It didn’t make the final cut because …if you only need to keep small amounts of food cool, you probably don’t need an electric cool box. It also wasn’t as well insulated as the other electric cool boxes I tested.Capacity:20l;innersize:22 x 32 x 35cm (WDH);outer size:25 x 38 x 40.5cm (WDH);weight:3.71kg;claimed ice retention:not stated;handles:solid plastic swing (top) handle;water drain:no;wheels:noWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nic Fleming/The GuardianPassive cool boxes vs electric modelsThe choice between a passive and an electric cool box depends on how and where you’re planning to use it. Passive cool boxes rely on ice or ice blocks to keep cool. These take up valuable space, leaving less room for food and drinks, and can leave the contents soggy as the ice melts (particularly if there’s no water drain to let out melted ice). On the plus side, they require no power, and high-performing models can keep ice solid for days.Electric cool boxes offer consistent plug-in cooling without the need for ice, but tend to be bulkier. You’ll also need an electricity source, such as a mains hook-up point, or a car/van battery (although they will quickly drain your battery if plugged in without the engine running). Many models can also be used to warm up food – although a stove or microwave will do so faster.How to keep cool box contents cool for longerWhether passive or electric, preparation is key to getting the best out of your cool box. Prechilling the box beforehand is a good idea – either using ice blocks or items from your freezer, such as frozen peas. Where possible, also try to precool food and drinks. You could even consider freezing items such as milk – but don’t attempt to freeze anything in a glass bottle or can, as they could burst.When loading up your cool box, start by placing large ice blocks or frozen water bottles at the bottom or around the sides, then layer food and ice or ice blocks, packing the box as full as possible to reduce warm air pockets. Many manufacturers recommend a ratio of 2:1 ice to contents for the best performance, although this will reduce the amount of space available for food.Once at the campsite, keep your cool box in the shade, cover it with a reflective blanket or light-coloured towel, and open it as little as possible, as every rummage lets in warm air. If your campsite has a freezer, consider bringing extra ice blocks so you can rotate them. Alternatively, many supermarkets sell bags of ice that you can use to top up your cool box on longer camping trips.For electric cool boxes, precooling with ice blocks and/or mains power before switching to 12V can help to reach frosty temperatures faster.Linda Geddes is a former Guardian science correspondent, renowned for inserting herself into her own mini-science experiments.

Serve with a ta-daaa!Helen GohFri 4 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere’s a certain charm to jelly in summer: its playful wobble, its glassy sheen, its ability to delight adults and children alike. This dessert leans into that charm and the unbeatable pairing of a softly set strawberry jelly with a silky vanilla panna cotta. It’s light and cool, and ideal for long, warm evenings when no one wants anything too heavy: simple but balanced, the berries bright and tangy, the cream smooth and gently sweet. Best of all, everything can be made ahead, so all that’s left to do is unmould and enjoy the wobble.Strawberry jelly panna cottaPrep10 minChill6 hr+Cook1 hr20 minMakes6For the strawberry layer500g strawberries, washed and hulled, plus extra for serving200g caster sugar40ml lemon juice1 vanilla bean pod2 tsp almond oil, or sunflower oil3 leavesplatinum-strength gelatineFor the panna cotta layer300ml double cream100ml milk50g caster sugar2 leaves platinum-strength gelatinePut the strawberries in a food processor and pulse a few times until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add 50ml water, the sugar and the lemon juice. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds (save these for the panna cotta) and put the empty pod in with the strawberries. Put the pan on a low heat and cook, stirring gently, for about two minutes, until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, allowing it to drip naturally – avoid pressing the pulp, because that can cloud the jelly (if your sieve is small, work in batches). You should end up with about 400ml strawberry juice (save the strained pulp to stir into yoghurt for breakfast).Meanwhile, lightly oil six dariole moulds or small glasses (150-200ml) with a paper towel dabbed in almond or sunflower oil, and put on a tray.Soak the gelatine leaves in very cold water for five minutes. Warm the strained strawberry juice (do not let it boil), squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine, then stir the leaves into the warm juice until dissolved. Divide the jelly between the moulds (about 60ml each) and refrigerate for about three hours, or until just set.Once the jelly has set, make the panna cotta layer. Combine the cream, milk, sugar and reserved vanilla seeds in a small saucepan. Heat gently, stirring, until steaming (do not boil), then take off the heat. Soak two gelatine leaves in cold water for five minutes, then squeeze out the excess water and stir into the warm cream until fully dissolved. Cool for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.Carefully pour about 60ml of the panna cotta mixture over the set strawberry jelly. Refrigerate for at least three hours, or overnight, until set.When ready to serve, run a small knife around the edge of each mould just enough to break the seal. As air slips in, a soft bubble should form between the panna cotta and the mould. Invert on to serving plates, wait patiently and the panna cotta should release in one smooth, satisfying sigh. Serve immediately, garnished with the extra strawberries.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodFruitSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

All eyes are on Sydney, the quietly competent sous chef played by Ayo Edebiri, who has been breaking the internet with her own white tee.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Designed by a small independent US brand calledEverybody.World, and worn as she is prepping in the opening episode, it mirrors the tight white T-shirt by Merz b. Schwanen preferred by her erratic boss. His crashed the company’s website – and helped propel Jeremy Allen White to become theface (and body) of Calvin Klein.As a unisex top, and coming in at a third of the cost of Carmy’s, it suggests there is more toThe Bearthan costume and drama.“Audiences are more fashion-aware than ever” says Julie Garlejo, who started an Instagram account, @thebearoutfits, logging the show’s clothes. “We don’t just want drama – we want characters who feel real, who look like someone we’d pass on the street or follow on Instagram.”A fashion photographer, Garlejo began documenting the clothes in season 1 “before the hype fully hit”. She says: “I think we’ve moved from theatrical styling to authentic, lived-in fashion. These aren’t just costumes, they’re actual wardrobes.”The Bear is a gritty fairytaleabout family, ego and financial survival – not fashion per se. But as television has gained more respect as a medium, there has been a knock-on effect on the clothes worn by its stars, which now inform, reflect and even approximate the wider culture.View image in fullscreenKristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker rock Christian Louboutins on the set of the film Sex and the City 2.Photograph: Henry Lamb/BEI/Rex FeaturesThis is not news to anyone who watched Sex and the City or Mad Men, which deliberately nudged products and placement. Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin all benefited from the former’s popularity, while sales of Lucky Strike increasing by 10bn over the seven seasons the 1950s period drama aired.Yet Sydney’s T-shirt feels different. Unlike big companies with familiar branding, Everybody.World is not well known. Choosing a T-shirt from an indie company with sustainable supply chains, made in LA with cotton from post-industrial waste, is more than just “sartorial diplomacy”.It’s a narrative shorthand for the identity and value system upheld by Sydney’s character: most of her clothes come from independent or vintage shops; in contrast, Carmy wears a lot of Ralph Lauren. That it’s cheaper – and unisex – than Carmy’s simply underlines her battle for equality in a man’s world.Given the scrutiny these kinds of shows are under, you can’t fudge the details, as makers of the forthcoming Kennedys Netflix series, American Love Story,learned at their peril.“Viewers feel emotionally connected to the characters, and what they wear becomes part of that intimacy,” says Garlejo.TV Easter eggs – covert messages planted within TV shows – are now part of our culture. Garlejo describes her “logbook” as “part detective work, part obsession”. She starts by zooming in on labels and logos, although reverse image search and the online community have been invaluable. It is not uncommon for online detectives to be in cahoots with the costume designers either – Garlejo has a direct line to its costumer designer Courtney Wheeler and assistant Lariana Santiago, and has published an ebook about the clothes.For small brands, appearing on a show can be life-changing. After the first season aired, Carmy’s T-shirt sold out immediately (it’s now in back in stock), while Sydney’s $600 Madewell jacket, made from upcycled blankets, sold out in hours.Ariel Katz, who made Sydney’s T-shirt for Everybody.World, says he has seen significant interest since it was identified by fans, while an Everybody.World overnight tote bag carried by Sydney in episode 4 is also sold out. It helps, says Katz, that the clothes are worn “so well” by Edebiri. Last year, Edebiri told the New York Times that her styling had played a crucial role as her profile rose as an actor.For a show preoccupied by realism, just how realistic is it for a chef to wear a white T-shirt anyway? Dara Klein, head chef and founder of Tiella in north London, has worn everything, but admits: “A white T-shirt can be striking, resembling a traditional chef’s jacket and also motivating you to work clean. These sorts of choices also depend on whether you’re working in an open kitchen or not. Restaurants are similar in essence to a performance.”When Klein opens her own trattoria, she will wear a black T-shirt “so I can work efficiently”, she says. “In my experience, it’s not a choice that is imbued with a great deal of gendered expectation.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's shirtsThe BearTelevisionDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are footpaths and bridle paths across the Leas, so it attracts cyclists, dog walkers and runners all year round. The local parkrun uses the paths and it must be one of the most scenic in the country. The rock stacks along the coast are a great place for spotting cormorants, fulmars and kittiwakes among others.

This extraordinary place of sea-sucked mudflats, salt marsh and vast skies is cut off daily at high tide. I cross the causeway in May when the sea pinks (sea thrift) are flowering and the air is bright with the cries of birds – oystercatchers, curlew and redshanks. It feels remote, but in the 18th century Sunderland Point was a bustling port for Lancaster’s transatlantic trade, which brought prosperity but also inhumanity. A walk round the peninsula leads to the grave of an unknown child slaveabandoned here in 1736, now adorned by visitors with painted stones.

Culmore Point is where Derry’s River Foyle meets the North Atlantic. Some days you can see a line in the water where the silt-filled Foyle meets the sea. Beautiful old-money houses look out across the water to a power station and chemical plant. Farther downstream the weird treeless landscape of the reclaimed land of Eglinton Embankment catches the eye. Spare a thought too for the young men who trained on these river beaches in May 1944 for the Normandy assaults a month later.KeiranFossils, tidal flats and birds in MerseysideView image in fullscreenHilbre Island at the mouth of the Dee estuary.Photograph: Jason Wells/AlamyFrom West Kirby on Wirral, you can walk across the tidal flats of the Dee estuary to the red sandstone formations of Little Eye, Middle Eye, and Hilbre Island, a string of uninhabited islands offering naught but spectacular nature. In summer you can spot grey seals hauling themselves on to sandbanks, and three types of terns (common, little and sandwich) darting past. Listen out for skylarks and meadow pipits too. For an extra challenge, search for the Triassic-era Chirotherium footprint. Always check tide times carefully, and for extra awe, time your return to the sun setting low, framed by the distant Welsh hills.SarahA cycle by the sea in AberdeenshireView image in fullscreenThe art deco tea pavilion at Tarlair.Photograph: John Bracegirdle/AlamyCycling along theNorth East Coastal Trailfrom Portsoy to Macduff in Aberdeenshire is my idea of heaven. In stunning coastal countryside you cycle through charming fishing villages with historic harbours. I’ve spotted dolphins, porpoises and seals on the route. On a rocky coastline just beyond Macduff, there’san old tidal pool at Tarlair. Though no longer used for swimming, its beautifully restored art deco tea pavilion is the perfect spot to refuel before your journey back. While there, take a short wander to the secluded Salmon Howie beach tucked behind the cliffs – it’s such a beautiful spot.Peter DienderWinning tip: fin-du-monde vibes in East YorkshireView image in fullscreenBarmston Beach, near Bridlington.Photograph: Imagebroker/AlamyWhen, as a child, I readZ For Zachariah, I imagined a landscape with the exact fin-du-monde energy of the East Yorkshire beach from Ulrome to Bridlington.

But if six miles of uninterrupted beach walk – in the company of nothing more glamorous than pure air, weather and proper decay (not the genteel sort) – is your thing, this is a place you should visit.

When we sit down for dinner, we count up how many crops from the garden we’ve managed to incorporate into our meal. As I’ve said in previous columns, I’m not having the best growing season despite the abundance of sunshine, so I’m relying on small, edible wins this summer. (Edible flowers have become more of a feature than ever in our kitchen.)There aren’t many plants that I grow solely for their blooms – edible or not – but fortunately, there are a fair few crops that just happen to produce flowers you can eat, meaning it’s likely you, too, might be growing some edible flowers already.For the first few springs in my veg patch, I sowed the seeds of calendula, violas and nasturtiums as beneficial companion plants to encourage pollinators. Six growing seasons later and these stalwarts reappear reliably when the soil is warm enough. Calendula produce bright flowers whose petals can be scattered on a salad, but my preference is nasturtiums, which have a punchy, peppery flavour. The smiley-faced violas taste subtly sweet and are ideal for decorating cakes.The cute little flowers of peas and beans taste like a sweet, floral iteration of the fruit counterpartMany of the annual and perennial herbs in our vegetable gardens not only produce flavoursome leaves but beautiful and delicious flowers, too. Chives develop bright purple pom-poms that taste like the oniony leaves but are milder. Dill is another plant that I adore but, given it often bolts before I’ve harvested all the leaves I’d hoped for, I’m grateful that their flowers are also edible. Rosemary, thyme and, of course, lavender flowers are all edible and make a pretty garnish on a summer dish or cake.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Courgette flowers – both pollen-bearing and fruit-bearing – are delicious, especially when prepared the Italian way – stuffed with a mild cheese and herbs, lightly battered and fried. The cute little flowers of peas and beans taste like a sweet, floral iteration of the fruit counterpart. (Be careful not to mistakenly harvest ornamental sweetpea flowers as these are toxic.)It’s worth bearing in mind that harvesting the flowers of fruiting plants will have an impact on your yield. Not a problem if you’re picking more courgettes than you can comfortably offload, but an issue if you’ve only got a few beanstalks and were hoping to fill your freezer.When harvesting, be mindful not to crush petals as you gently shake off any creatures that might be hiding inside. Petals don’t take kindly to being vigorously washed but you can dip them in water and leave on a tea towel to dry. While not all these flowers offer up palate-igniting flavours, our dinners have never been prettier.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensVegetablesFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, one key element is missing from the analysis that has frustrated the implementation of such necessary innovations: the way that undergraduate students are educated and socialised into medicine within longstanding conservative curricula.Historically, doctors gain an identity that is grounded in the sanctity of the “clinic” (primarily the hospital) as a well-patrolled territory with idiosyncratic rituals and language. Patients are kept on the other side of the fence. Medical education traditionally affords little work-based experience in the first two years, but after that students gain increasing exposure to clinical work. However, this is largely focused on secondary care (hospital and clinic) settings, and on cure rather than prevention.Medical students soon learn that their professional identity construction depends on strict separation from community-based practices such as social work as they identify with the curative rituals of the clinic. Healthcare as a whole will not be able to focus on prevention, asWes Streetingwishes, until medical students’ miseducation into the sanctity of clinical cure is addressed. This is a pedagogical challenge that must no longer pass under the radar.Dr Alan BleakleyEmeritus professor, Peninsula school of medicine, University of PlymouthOf course Denis Campbell is right to say that moving theNHSfrom treatment to prevention is a great idea. The problem is, and has been for years, that finding the money for preventing ill health is apparently impossible while the NHS still has to treat ill health that wasn’t prevented. Treasury rules seem to forbid investing for future savings.Christina BaronFormer NHS trust chairYour report (29 June) on “medieval” levels of healthcare inequality affecting the poorest sections of society is borne out by the National Diabetes Foot Care Report 2022 for England. This found that people with diabetes living in the most deprived areas of England are 82% more likely to undergo a major amputation than those in the least deprived. Such a predisposition to major amputation in the circumstances of poverty contributes to a postcode lottery with a 4.8-fold variation in major amputation rates, ranging from 3.5 to 16.8 amputations per 10,000 population with diabetes per year.People in deprived areas face economic and social barriers to care and restricted referral pathways, resulting in delayed access to specialist care. They are then too late for conventional treatment and require amputation, with all the suffering, costs and life-changing effects these have. Thus the income and home address of people living with diabetes can contribute significantly to whether they lose or keep their legs.However, it should be possible to prevent most major amputations. Such an aspiration is in keeping with the preventive ethos of the 10-year NHS plan, which it is hoped will facilitate more rapid and equitable access to initial care in the community and prevent amputations in all people living with diabetes.Prof Michael Edmonds, Jonathan Hunt(patient), Dr Erika Vainieri and Dr Chris ManuKing’s College Hospital, LondonThe excellentBlack report on inequalities in healthwas commissioned by Labour in 1977 and published in 1980, by which time the Tories were in government and the report was marginalised and ultimately dismissed by them. The report recommended improvements in child benefits, childcare allowances, preschool education, school milk and meals, disablement allowances, housing and working conditions. Nothing new there, then. We know what needs to be done to make the quality of life more equal for all of us. Anyone who lives in or is familiar with those parts of the north (and elsewhere) suffering extreme deprivation knows that things must change. The situation is intolerable. It is a blight on our so-called civilised society.Val CooperLondonThe ministerial U-turn on planned health-related benefit reforms included a welcome pledge to “listen”. They would do well to study the link between deprivation and the “lifestyle diseases” arising from obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. As well as explaining the 11-year life expectancy gap between the most and least deprived parts of the country, it is a vital but often overlooked factor in the debate over health and disability benefits.My research reveals that people in the poorest communities typically experience poor health up to 21 years earlier than those in richer areas. In Blackpool, for instance, “healthy life expectancy” is just 53.5 years, compared to 74.7 years in Rutland. People in Blackpool are therefore far more likely to leave the workforce before state pension age – and therefore claim health and disability benefits – than those in Rutland.The government must pursue a longer-term approach to curb the rising welfare costs of poor health and disability. We need a comprehensive public health strategy to tackle the root causes of premature poor health. For too long successive governments have shied away from bold actions around smoking, obesity and alcohol to significantly improve public health.Prof Les MayhewCity St George’s, University of LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

These are typically produced by heating calcium carbonate (limestone), releasing CO2and requiring large amounts of energy, producing yet more CO2. If the used pellets are heated in a kiln for reuse, even if with renewable energy, the captured CO2is released again and nothing is gained. Quicklime production creates yet more CO2, so without removing these emissions, Seabound’s process would make shipping even dirtier.TheInflation Reduction Actpassed under Joe Biden is funding development of cement production from calcium silicate. Once turned into concrete, this process sequesters CO2overall, and in even larger amounts if green electricity fuels the kilns. Seabound should take note, else their technology is just another carbon-capture con.Wind turbines are turned off when too much electricity is being produced, and, bizarrely, we pay to turn them off. This excess could fuel kilns instead as well as the production of hydrogen for steel furnaces. Small nuclear reactors, as used in nuclear submarines, could also fuel energy-hungry kilns and furnaces. Vitrified nuclear waste could be put into deep-ocean subduction-zone trenches in the casings of US bunker-busting bombs or fired at the sun when Elon Musk’s Starships stop auto-dismantling, rather than wasting these rockets on the futile race to Mars.Blue-green algae sequestered vast amounts of CO2over 2bn years; now mankind is busy releasing it again over a few decades. We had best harness these little helpers and farm other CO2fixers such as mussels, clams and oysters, if we wish to sequester CO2in an environmentally safe way.Dr Richard RichardsBrant Broughton, LincolnshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Even socialist governments have balked at dealing with the issue of land monopoly, and we have failed to hold them to account.In 1909, when landed power was largely synonymous with the aristocracy, Tom Johnston, later to become secretary of state for Scotland, noted that land titles had originally been created “either by force or fraud”. He urged the people to “shatter the romance that keeps the nation numb and spellbound while privilege picks its pocket”.As George Monbiot’s article shows, land monopoly today is not confined to the aristocracy. The most effective way to neutralise its power would be through land value taxation, which would ensure that those who claim to own the country bear its running costs.In 1910, the Inland Revenue initiated afull survey of land use, value and ownership across Britain. It was completed in five years, but the outbreak of war and a change of government meant the proposed tax measures were never implemented. Our present Labour government has four years to repeat the exercise and reform our broken tax system. It should start now.John DigneyStirlingThe eviction of the inhabitants of Littlebredy in Dorset by their new owner Bridehead Estate Ltd, excoriatingly exposed by George Monbiot, has a strong historical echo from the 1770s at Milton Abbas, less than 30 miles away.Lord Milton bought Milton Abbey, near Dorchester, in 1752. Capability Brown was brought in to “improve” the surrounding landscape. He faced the problem of what to do about the unsightly medieval village of more than a hundred households. The solution was to move it. In 1774 Brown drew up plans for a new “model village” of new homes. Over the next decade the villagers were decanted, some against their will, to new homes in Milton Abbas. Barely a trace of the old village exists.Lord Milton is often cited as one of the worst examples of the callous ostentation common among the English landowning Whig oligarchy of the 18th century. But at least he felt obliged to rehouse his tenants. Judging from Monbiot’s piece, it seems that a corporate landowner in today’s Britain is not even obliged to do that when it decides to socially engineer an inconvenient community out of house and home.Robin GutchLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Over four-plus days I had virtually continuous access to a wide range of events, fuelled by my own food and drink (unlike most festivals). The cost per event is extraordinarily good value; my son has paid half the price of a Glasto ticket for one Oasis concert, and he’ll have to pay for expensive bar drinks and food. He is a musician working full-time in hospitality to pay his rent, as the commercial music industry does not reward people like him.

This is a pandemic, and pandemics have no borders,” she said in an interview with the Guardian at the UNinternational development funding summitthis week in Seville, Spain.Byanyima, a Ugandan aeronautical engineer and politician who has led UNAids since 2019, said seeing the impact of Donald Trump’s cuts had been the worst experience of her life.Q&AWhich countries are worst affected by the HIV epidemic?Show• The countries of eastern and southern Africa are at the centre of the HIV/Aids epidemic, and are home toabout halfof all people living with HIV.• In 2023 the number of people living with HIVwas 7.7 millionin South Africa, about 12% of the population. Adult HIV prevalence exceeds 10% of the population inEswatini,Botswana,LesothoandZimbabwe.• Globally, in 2023 there were 1.3 million new cases to add to theworld totalof about 39.9 million people. Of those, 53% are women and girls.Since the start of the epidemic in1981, 42.3 million people have died of Aids-related illness.•In the early days, Aids denialism in Europe and North America caught on in South Africa and became a huge problem for medical professionals.The interventionof Nelson Mandela in 2000 is thought to have turned the tide.•The UN-agreed target(Sustainable Development Goal) is to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030 and to dramatically reduce new HIV infections, but it is not on track.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Personally I am devastated. Appalled. Shaken and disgusted. I don’t have the English words to use,” she said, admitting that the sheer scale of the challenge in the face of such massive cuts had made her consider resigning from her role.“But I can’t run away. I told myself I’m going to fix it. I need to take my gloves off.”US global health funding has stagnatedover the past few years, and countries including the UK have been actively moving away from investment in aid from the target spending of 0.7% of GDP that UN member states set themselves in 2015. But in February,Trump abruptly halted Pepfar– the president’s emergency plan for Aids relief set up by Republican George Bush in 2003 to provide treatment, prevention and care for people living with or affected by HIV/Aids. A later vaguely worded waiver on certain parts of Pepfar funding had not had an effect on the ground, said experts.“Every year, donors were reducing and the war in Ukraine saw that accelerate,” Byanyima said. “But the shock … Pepfar was 60% of my budget.“It is a drop, a drop of money that is nothing in one of these rich G7 countries,” she said. “And it did so much for people who are so vulnerable. And yet you are spending so much more on wars. The rich men at the top take away from the poorest at the bottom.“To create such crisis, such pain and such anger on the ground. This cut, that’s dedicated people losing jobs, loyal support gone, research ended, vulnerable people abandoned. And it is deaths. What went away immediately was prevention services, so we are very worried about the new infections and about deaths. Then support services and clinics. Now research, cutting edge research, is going.“I myself had to have therapy to keep myself strong to be there for others. We have to make sure people who are staying do not burn out to try to even out our workload.“This is a huge shift because it is so connected to geopolitics and to power shifts. It is seismic. But after the first wave of panic, and of pain, we have now to work hard, on less than half of what we had, to get change quickly to save lives.“We already lost 12 million people we should not have lost if ARVs [antiretrovirals] had been shared immediately around the world instead of held on to by the pharmaceutical companies making money. We now face this, more deaths. Health is a human right, no one should die if we can prevent it.“But of course many people will die, so many vulnerable people have already lost support, young girls, men who have sex with men, these are people who hide, who are shunned.“There will be an additional 6 million newly infected persons in the world,” she said. “That has started already.”South Africa is at the heart of the HIV pandemic. What happens now the money has been cut?Read moreByanyima said the loss of overseas development assistance on all sides was now focusing attention on the unfair way in which Africa was treated by the west in terms offinancing, debt interest and risk rates, and regarding illicit funding flows.“African countries are struggling. Some much more than others. But they are not lying down and dying, and they are not holding out a begging bowl for more aid. Huge efforts are being made to fill the funding gaps in smart ways.“We need debt justice, we need tax justice. The amount of money flowing from the south to the north has been greater than what has gone the other way for a long time and that is clear to see.“The message for us all is clear too. The aid model cannot stand any more, it’s too unpredictable, the future has to be less about charity and more about international solidarity.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthAids and HIVUSAIDUgandaAidAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Canadiens Go!” on digital banners used on 1,000 buses within the city.However, the language police told Montreal’s transit agency it needed to remove the word “go” from the electronic signs to stay within the confines of the province’s language laws. The transit agency acquiesced, replacing the signage with “Allez! Canadiens Allez!”.Following on the reporting by the Montreal Gazette, however, French-language minister Jean-François Roberge intervened and said “Go Habs Go” is part of Quebec culture and pledged to dismiss any future complaints about the slogan. The Canadiens, the country’s oldest professional hockey team, are also colloquially known as the ‘Habs’ – a reference toles habitants, the settlers of French origin who came to Quebec beginning in the 17th century.Quebec’s fastidious attempts to protect the French language havemade headlines in the past.In 2022 the owner of a bar and barbershop received a warning from Quebec’s language police that his establishment was in violation of the province’s language laws after someone filed a complaint claiming the bar’s Facebook page wasn’t bilingual enough.“All consumers have the fundamental right of being informed and served in French in Quebec,” the OQLF said in a statement at the time.And in 2019 the government proposed banning the popular greeting “Bonjour-hi”, only to quickly backtrack amid outrage and ridicule from residents.Most famously, however, isthe “pasta-gate” scandal of 2013, when the owner of the Italian restaurant at Buonanotte was told he had run afoul of the law when he used the words “pasta” on the menu and “bottiglia”, the Italian word for bottle, instead of the French word “bouteille”. For many, the row reflected an over-zealous language watchdog eager to flex its muscles. The incident culminated in the resignation of the head of the OQLF less than a month later.In both 2021 and 2023, the language watchdog received complaints from the public over the use of the word “go” when used to cheer on the Canadiens, according to the Canadian Press.The word “go” is a borrowed anglophone term with “well-established” use in the province, the language watchdog said, but noted that public entities, such as the city’s transit service, are nonetheless obliged to use “exemplary” French.Earlier in the week, Montreal’s transit agency said it was now “beginning its reflection on the subject” of returning the word “go” to the fleet of buses, but no decision would be made imminently.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMontreal CanadiensAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Independent since 1975, it is still one of the poorest countries in the region, yetSurinamehas recently discovered significant offshore oil reserves that could generate billions of dollars in revenue over the coming decades. The country is not expected to begin production until 2028.Geerlings-Simons began her rise to power on 25 May, whenvoters elected the 51 membersof Suriname’s National Assembly, though the results produced no clear winner.Her National Democratic party secured a narrow lead with 18 seats, just ahead of Santokhi’s party, which won 17. In the days that followed, she managed to form a coalition with five other parties, giving her the minimum 34 seats required to be appointed president.Last Thursday, which was the deadline for registering presidential candidates, Santokhi’s Progressive Reform party announced it would not be putting forward a nominee.Geerlings-Simons’s party was founded by Dési Bouterse, who ruled as a dictator from 1980 to 1987, a period during which his regime was accused ofexecuting 15 political opponents in 1982. Following Suriname’s return to democracy, Bouterse was elected president in 2010 and re-elected in 2015, before handing over to Santokhi.The current president told local media there would be a “smooth transition” of power.Corruption scandals marked his five-year term, and he was forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the economy. While his austerity measures helped restructure Suriname’s public debt, they also triggered violent protests in the country of 600,000 people.During his presidency, oil reserves were discovered 90 miles (150km) off Suriname’s coast. The project to extract them is led by the French multinational TotalEnergies, which announced in October that it would invest $10.5bn to develop the oilfield.Santokhi went so far as to propose a “royalties for everyone” scheme, under which every Surinamese citizen would receive US$750 in a savings account, with an annual interest rate of 7%. The plan was one of his key re-election pledges – but it wasn’t enough to secure his party a majority.With more than 90% of its territory covered by tropical rainforest, Suriname has come under increasing pressure overillegal gold mining and logging, practices that Geerlings-Simons publicly condemned during her time as chair of the National Assembly, where she played a role in advancing environmental regulations.Explore more on these topicsSurinameWomenAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In sum, the statements had asserted Ábrego García’s guilt “without regard to the judicial process or the presumption of innocence”, the filing said.According to the documents filed on Wednesday, officials within the prison acknowledged that Ábrego García was not a gang member, and that his tattoos did not indicate a gang affiliation.“Prison officials explicitly acknowledged that plaintiff Ábrego García’s tattoos were not gang-related, telling him ‘your tattoos are fine’,” according to the filing, and they kept him in a cell separate from those accused of gang membership.The prison officials, however, threatened to move Ábrego García into a cell with gang members whom officials said “would ‘tear’ him apart”.Separately, US prosecutors have agreed with a request by Ábrego García’s lawyers to delay his release from Tennessee jail over fears that the Trump administration could move to deport the Salvadorian national a second time.In a filing on Friday, lawyers for Ábrego García asked the judge overseeing a federal complaint that he was involved in human smuggling to delay his release because of “contradictory statements” by the Trump’s administration over whether he’ll be deported upon release.The justice department has said it plans to try the Maryland construction worker on the smuggling charges, but also that it plans to deport him but has not said when.Explore more on these topicsKilmar Ábrego GarcíaUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS prisonsUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

A former arts adviser to the federal government also told Guardian Australia that the CEO should step down.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailCallum Morton, professor of fine art at Monash University who chaired the selection panel for the 2017 biennale, said he did not believe the current selection process – where the chief executive, informed by a panel of experts, makes the final decision – was flawed.It was a process that delivered last year’s Archie Moore exhibition at Venice, which won the Golden Lion, he pointed out.But Morton added that a series of “kneejerk reactions that caved into baseless scaremongering” on the part of the executive and board ultimately betrayed the artist.“It speaks to a CEO and board who frankly didn’t seem to understand or at least trust the power and complexity of the visual arts,” Morton said.“I think the conversation should be less about the process and more about how we choose board members, so that the right industry experts are given proper place and a voice to advise on these matters.“This will help boards avoid these self-inflicted crises that hurt artists and arts workers and embarrass our reputation nationally and internationally.”The Blackhall & Pearl report also expressed surprise that Creative Australia management had not requested a contentious issue report into the selected artist, given this appeared to be standard practice in the organisation’s other grant and investment decisions.Another senior arts figure told Guardian Australia that although a panel of experts acting in an advisory capacity recommended Sabsabi for Venice, “either way, it was Adrian Collette, the CEO of Creative Australia, who made the final decision”.“Firstly, he’s got no visual arts expertise. Secondly, the board doesn’t seem to have been involved in the deliberations at all,” they said.“This is the most important thing Creative Australia does – it’s the biggest decision they make. You would expect the CEO to have appropriate expertise, and the board to be fully engaged. That simply didn’t happen.”Creative Australia apologises to Khaled Sabsabi for ‘hurt and pain’ after Venice Biennale reinstatementRead moreProf Jo Caust, a principal fellow at the University of Melbourne’s school of culture and communication, said the Blackhall & Pearl report highlighted serious problems with governance at Creative Australia.“If you look at the current board, some are arts people, but some clearly are not,” Caust said. “You need people who understand the sector, who can stand up and be counted.”The Blackhall & Pearl report did not identify a failure of process, governance or decision on the part of the Creative Australia board, but said that “with the benefit of hindsight there are things the Board might have done differently”.Whether the board erred in its decision to decommission Sabsabi was an assessment outside the scope of its terms of reference, the report said, but added that it believed “the board and Creative Australia are able to learn from this exercise and be better prepared should a similar situation arise in future”.Guardian Australia has requested comment from Collette and the acting chair of the Creative Australia board, Wesley Enoch.Explore more on these topicsCreative AustraliaAustralian artVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

She has owned and lived at the Cleveland Street property in Surry Hills since the 1980s, and rented it out to the two men for at least a decade.Officers arrived at the property at about 2pm on Thursday and located the body of a man inside the house, police said. A crime scene was established, and a short time later, a second body was found in a separate room.Both men, aged in their 70s and 80s, were believed to have died in the house at different times within the past month, NSW police said, but how and when wasn’t known.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailNSW police hoped autopsy results would progress the investigation. Detectives have spoken to Barker. Guardian Australia is not suggesting that she was involved in the men’s deaths.Guardian Australia understands police don’t suspect any foul play and are unlikely to lay charges.Police tape was wrapped over the fence on Friday afternoon. Behind it, faded tinsel drooped over the front door. Clutter filled the yard: an upturned bicycle, a walker, a succulent sprawling out of an upturned watering can.The residents of the terrace, who had intellectual disabilities but lived independently, were well known in the neighbourhood.Neighbours often saw Barker riding her motorised scooter up and down the street and drinking beers at the nearby Crown hotel.The two men spent less time out of the house but were known to sit on the porch and drink longneck Victoria Bitters in the sun.While neighbours on both sides of the property had seen Barker in recent days, they hadn’t seen either of the men for at least three weeks.Neighbours said the house had been slowly descending into disrepair in recent years.One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, has lived on the street for about six years and got to know Barker via her “firing her buggy down the street every morning”.He was out on the street yesterday afternoon when the police arrived.“I was just out doing my hard rubbish and suddenly there’s four ambulances, 10 cop cars, forensics all overnight, it was pretty full on,” he said.He estimated it had been three weeks since he had seen the men, but he said he saw Barker most days.“The older guy would hang out on the front step and drink beers,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They thought the house was abandoned.Mitchell Morri lives a few doors down and often used to come across the elderly men on the street or on their porch.“It’s quite a sad situation due to the living arrangements there, and the fact it seems that they’ve passed away in the house,” he said.“They were both really nice. I’ve only met [Barker] once, but it seemed like everyone knew her. She was quite friendly.”Another neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said one of the men was non-verbal, but he often communicated with the other male and Barker.“I saw him three weeks ago, walking down the street,” he said. “He was quite slow – he didn’t look well.“The house has been deteriorating badly lately, and we’ve had a few issues in the past six months – rats were climbing into our attic from their house, which is falling apart.“I woke up in the middle of the night last night because you could hear police inside next door.

It was one of the most severe assaults of the entire war and a “clear interpretation of how Moscow interprets diplomacy”, he added.The sustained and coordinated night-time attack involved more than 550 Russian drones and ballistic missiles – a record. Families in Kyiv spent the night in metro stations, basements and underground parking garages.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows over Kyiv after a Russian drone attack. At least 23 people were injured in the assault, officials said.Photograph: Alina Smutko/ReutersDrones could be heard circling the skies above the Ukrainian capital one after another. There were numerous booms and explosions, and the rattle of machine-gun fire, as Ukrainian air defence units tried to shoot down the missiles.The air raid ended at 9am local time, leaving a thick pall of choking black smoke over the city. Residents were advised to keep their windows shut because of fires. According to officials, one person was killed and at least 23 people were injured. Fourteen were taken to hospital. Blasts damaged apartment blocks, cars and warehouses.There was also disruption to the normally reliable rail network. Passengers arriving at Kyiv’s main station on Thursday night had to file out through underground tunnels, with the main concourse closed and many services on Friday delayed.After his conversation with Putin on Thursday, Trump said they had discussed the war “in a pretty long call”. But he said there was no movement towards a ceasefire, with Putin reportedly insisting on Ukraine’s capitulation. “I’m not happy about that. No, I didn’t make any progress with him today at all,” Trump said.View image in fullscreenFirefighters battle a fire after the Russian attack on Kyiv.Photograph: Libkos/Getty ImagesThursday’s attack came after the Pentagon this week halted the delivery of some weapon shipments to Ukraine, including replacement interceptor missiles used in Patriot air defence systems. Ukrainians have said the decision leaves their cities defenceless, emboldens Russia and facilitates deadly attacks.The Ukrainian government has been careful not to criticise the US president directly. But it wants Washington and other allies, including the UK and EU, to put further pressure on Moscow to stop the war and its relentless aerial attacks on civilians.“There must be consequences – not eventually, but now,” Zelenskyy said. “Strengthened sanctions. Immediate delivery of air defence systems. A shift from caution to clarity. The Kremlin is watching the world’s reaction. So are others.”Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump on Friday about the supply of US weapons, amid low expectations of a change in White House policy.View image in fullscreenThick smoke covering Kyiv after the seven-hour assault.Photograph: Libkos/Getty ImagesOne senior Ukrainian official suggested Trump’s apparent strategy of appeasing Putin was not working. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Zelenskyy’s office, said any US phone call with Putin “inevitably results in massive demonstrative shelling of Kyiv – with enormous destruction”.Putin treated these conversations as “an opportunity to publicly humiliate the other side’s reputation”, and it was a “way to demonstrate his [Putin’s] boundlessness and willingness to kill ever more brazenly”, Podolyak posted on social media.With supplies of anti-aircraft missiles running low, Ukraine is increasingly using home-produced drones to take down incoming Shahed drones. But it is struggling to cope with the overwhelming numbers flooding its skies. According to the Ukrainian air force, 72 out of 550 drones and missiles hit their targets in Thursday’s raid.On Friday, volunteers and pupils were sweeping up debris from their school, number 22, which was damaged during the attack. An intercepted Russian drone landed on the yard and ignited, setting fire to cars and shattering windows and balconies. A second drone hit a nearby apartment block on Vidradnyi Avenue, in the south-west of Kyiv.“It was a terrible night. It’s roulette. You don’t know where the drones will land,” said Yaroslava Savchenko, a teacher. She spent the night sheltering in the corridor of her home and cradling her terrified cat. “I counted the Shaheds [Iranian-made drones]. There were so many I gave up and started praying. Around 4am there was a massive bang. Dust blew into my flat. In the morning I left footprints like Santa,” she said.Another resident, Artur Katroshenko, said Putin was terrorising Ukrainians so they would tell their government to “give up”. “The strategy won’t work. Russia doesn’t understand our mentality. Our problem is how we should live in the fourth year of war. There’s no point in renovating your apartment, or buying a new car, if it can get smashed at any moment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Emergency diesel generators had been switched on, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.Poland’s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, said the Polish consulate in Kyiv was damaged early on Friday. “President Trump, Putin is mocking your peace efforts. Please restore supplies of anti-aircraft ammunition to Ukraine and impose tough new sanctions on the aggressor,” he posted on X.Former head of Nato Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Russia’s president “senses weakness – from the US and from Europe”.

Macron has been involved in Iranian diplomacy for a decade and came close to engineering a rapprochement between Trump and the then Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in 2018.But Iran, faced with what it regards as craven European support for Israeli and American airstrikes that killed more than 930 people and injured as many as 5,000, is not placing much faith in the continent’s ability to influence the White House.View image in fullscreenDamage to Evin prison in Iran after an Israeli strike.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAFor Europe, this signals a slow slide into irrelevance. The three major European powers known as the E3 – France, Germany and the UK – were once key fixtures in Iran’s diplomacy and played a central role in brokering theIran nuclear deal, which they signed alongside the EU, the US, China, Russia and Iran in 2015.Europe had little input in the US’s recent negotiating strategy with Iran, led by Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and was given just over an hour’s official warning before the Israeli and US attacks. The one meeting that the E3 foreign minsters held during the crisis with Iranian diplomats in Geneva on 20 June proved a failure and was followed by the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Franceclaimed it helped Israel repel Iranian drones.Trump crowed afterwards that “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.”From the Iranian perspective, Europe has long been a disappointing negotiating partner, repeatedly failing to show any independence from the US. When Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal in 2018, the E3 condemned the move in a joint statement issued by its then-leaders, Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Macron. But it did nothing effective to pursue an independent strategy to lift European sanctions on Iran as it had promised. The fear that European firms trading with Iran would be put under US sanctions was too great.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel in 2018 condemned the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal.Photograph: Vassil Donev/EPAThe view from Tehran, it was felt, was that Europe’s timidity left it with no choice but to follow the policy of nuclear brinkmanship, including gradually increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium.At the start of Trump’s second term, the E3 plus Kallas tried again to insert themselves into the process by holding three low-key meetings with Iranian negotiators. But Araghchi was always angling to speak to Washington, telling the Guardian of his discussions with the Europeans: “Perhaps we are talking to the wrong people.” After Trump indicated he was willing to speak to Iran bilaterally and showed some flexibility about Tehran’s right to enrich uranium, Iran cast Europe aside.Iran believes Europe played a role either through naivety or complicity in opening the door for the Israeli attack by tabling a motion of censure at the board of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency.Such motions have been passed before at the IAEA and usually led to Iran retaliating by increasing its stocks of enriched uranium. But the 12 June motion was different – for the first time in 20 years the board found Iran in breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.Europe had to take that step to use its right as a signatory to the 2015 deal to reimpose sanctions on Iran before expiry of the deal on 15 October. Because of the way the deal was negotiated, neither Russia nor China can veto Europe reimposing sanctions. America is no longer party to the deal so this power to reintroduce UN sanctions is Europe’s diplomatic re-entry point into the Iranian file.European diplomats insist that the IAEA censure motion was necessary, and that they had no option owing to Iran’s mounting stocks of highly enriched uranium that had no possible purpose in a civilian nuclear programme. Europe also still hoped the talks between the US and Iran, mediated by Oman, would bear fruit, and had not foreseen the US giving Israel the green light to attack.Since the Israeli strikes, European unity has frayed further. Britain has largely opted for opacity, but it was obvious from what ministers did not say that the government’s legal advice was that the Israeli attack could not be justified as an act of self-defence under the UN charter. France openly asserted that the attack was unlawful.By contrast,Germanyendorsed all that Israel has done. At the G7 summit in mid-June, the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said: “This is the dirty work that Israel is doing, for all of us.”View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz, the German chancellor, told parliament that Israel was doing the ‘dirty work’ for ‘all of us’.Photograph: dts News Agency Germany/ShutterstockGermany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, told parliament that “Israel has the right to defend itself and protect its people. Let me say clearly that, if Israel and the US have now managed to set back the Iranian nuclear programme, it will make Israel and its neighbourhood more secure.”Asked by the newspaper Die Zeit if he believed Israel’s actions were lawful, he said Germany did not have the same quality intelligence sources as the US and Israel, but he had to trust their belief that Iran was close to acquiring a nuclear weapon. “They told us that, from their perspective, this is necessary – and we must accept that.”Such remarks have left Iranian diplomats spitting about European double standards over the sanctity of international law.By contrast, Enrique Mora, the EU’s point person on Iran from 2015 to early 2025, has written a scathing piece in which he says Israel has killed nuclear diplomacy and Iran’s nuclear knowledge cannot be destroyed.He wrote: “If Iran now chooses the militarisation of its nuclear capabilities, if it now decides to move toward a bomb, it will do so following a clear strategic logic: no one bombs the capital of a nuclear-armed country. June 21, 2025, may go down in history not as the day the Iranian nuclear programme was destroyed, but as the day a nuclear Iran was irreversibly born.”There are different strategies Europe can pursue. It can, like Germany, show Iran there is no daylight between the E3 and Israel and assert that Iran can only have a civil nuclear programme that excludes domestic enrichment of uranium. It can press ahead with the reimposition of sanctions and hope that Iran buckles.Alternatively, it can champion a compromise that Tehran can wear. In a recent statement, the European Council on Foreign Relations said “maximalist demands on Iran – including negotiating over missiles now viewed by Tehran as its main deterrence umbrella – will likely push the country to use every means still available to reach nuclear breakout. A more viable endgame would involve a return of wide-scale inspections by international monitors and an immediate, substantial roll-back of Iranian uranium enrichment. The goal should be Iran pursuing this enrichment through a regional consortium backed by the United States.” That is broadly closer to the French position.Europe will never hold sway like Israel or the US, but it has one last chance to help create something durable, and prevent the Iranian crisis becoming a nuclear proliferation crisis for the whole region.Explore more on these topicsIranEuropeNuclear weaponsIran nuclear dealIsraelFranceGermanyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Axios reported that a source described the call as a “good conversation”.Russian drone attack on Kyiv injures 14, triggers multiple fires, mayor saysRead moreTrump said he was “very disappointed” after a telephone call withVladimir Putinon Thursday. A Putin aide told reporters that the Russian president was not willing to make concessions on what the Kremlin has called the “root causes” of the war with Ukraine, a list of grievances that includes Nato expansion and Ukraine’s desire to join western economic and security blocs.“I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there,” Trump told reporters after holding a rally in Iowa on Thursday evening. “I don’t think he’s there, and I’m very disappointed. I’m just saying, I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”The US has said that it halted the shipments, some of which were already in Poland, due to a review of US military stockpiles that suggested that the country is running low on munitions for its own troops.Germany has said that it is in “intensive talks” to buy the Patriot missiles forUkraine, although it’s unclear whether those stocks would be available immediately.“There are various ways to fill this Patriot gap,” a German government spokesperson told a news conference in Berlin on Friday. One option being considered was for the German government to buy the Patriot missile batteries in the United States and then send them to Ukraine.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hamas is fully prepared, with all seriousness, to immediately enter a new round of negotiations on the mechanism for implementing this framework.”Israeli media reported that Israel had received Hamas’s response and it was being examined.Earlier a source told the Guardian that Hamas leaders were close to accepting a proposed deal for a ceasefire in Gaza but want stronger guarantees that any pause in hostilities would lead to a permanent end to the 20-month war.The militant Islamist group has come under immense pressure in recent months, with its military leadership decimated and the Israeli military forcing its fighters out of former strongholds in the southern and central parts of Gaza.In recent days, Israel hasramped up its offensive, launching an intense wave of airstrikes across Gaza, killing more than 250 Palestinians, including many women and children, according to medical and civil defence officials.Hardline factions within Hamas had reluctantly accepted the need for a ceasefire to allow the organisation to regroup and plan a new strategy, one source familiar with the internal debate said.Since aprevious ceasefire collapsed in March, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Gaza and an acute humanitarian crisis has worsened.Efforts for a new truce in Gaza gathered momentum after the US secured a ceasefire to end the12-day conflict between Israel and Iranlast month.On Tuesday, Trump announced thatIsrael had accepted the conditionsneeded to finalise a 60-day ceasefire, during which the parties would work to end the war. When asked on Thursday if Hamas had agreed to the latest ceasefire deal framework, he said: “We’ll see what happens. We are going to know over the next 24 hours.”Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to fly to Washington on Sunday for talks with Trump about the war in Gaza, the recent war between Israel and Iran, and other regional issues.The Israeli prime minister has long resisted a permanent end to the war in Gaza, partly to retain the support of far-right allies in his ruling coalition. But Israel’s successes in the war with Iran have strengthened his political position and opinion polls in Israel show strong support for a deal.Gaza mapA senior Israeli official told Channel 12, a major Israeli TV network: “Judging by the signals from Hamas, there is a high probability that we will start proximity talks in the next few days. If there is consent to proximity talks, there will be a deal.”Other Israeli officials told Reuters preparations were in place to approve the ceasefire deal and that an Israeli delegation was getting ready to join indirect talks brokered by Qatar and Egypt to cement the deal if Hamas responded positively.The proposal includes the release of 10 living Israeli hostages held in Gaza since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict, and the return of the bodies of 18 more, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, an official familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday.Hamas seized 251 hostages during the 2023 attack. Less than half of the 50 who remain in Gaza are believed to be alive.Aid would enter Gaza immediately under the agreement, and the Israeli military would carry out a phased withdrawal from parts of the territory, according to the proposal. Negotiations would immediately start on a permanent ceasefire.“We sure hope it’s a done deal, but I think it’s all going to be what Hamas is willing to accept,” Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, told Channel 12 on Thursday. “One thing is clear: the president wants it to be over. The prime minister wants it to be over. The American people, the Israeli people, want it to be over.”The delivery of more aid to Gaza has been a principal demand of Hamas throughout negotiations. Israel imposed an 11-week blockade in March, which was only slightly eased in May under huge international pressure as famine loomed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds have been killed by Israeli fire while seeking aid at the GHF’s hubs and after gathering in crowds at locations where convoys sent by the UN have been stopped.On Friday,a report by the BBCquoted a former GHF employee describing colleagues firing towards Palestinians who had posed no threat, with many appearing to have been seriously hurt on several occasions.The GHF employee told the BBC he and others had been given no clear rules of engagement or standard operating procedures, and were told by one team leader: “If you feel threatened, shoot – shoot to kill and ask questions later.”The GHF said the allegations, which were also made by former employees quoted by the Associated Press on Thursday, were categorically false and that no civilians had came under fire at their distribution sites. The Israeli military has denied any intent to harm civilians seeking aid, saying it only fired warning shots.Speaking to journalists while on his way to arally in Iowaon Thursday, Trump said: “I want the people of Gaza to be safe. That’s more important than anything else. They’ve gone through hell.”Netanyahu visited Israel’sNir Oz kibbutzon Thursday for the first time since the 2023 Hamas attack.

There are still 20 who are alive and there are also those who are deceased, and we will bring them all back.”The prime minister has been heavily criticised for refusing to take responsibility for the failures that allowed the 2023 attack, during which Hamas-led militants killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and has been repeatedly accused of prioritising his political survival over the fate of the hostages.View image in fullscreenPeople rallying in Tel Aviv on Thursday to demand the release of all hostages kidnapped by Hamas.Photograph: Shir Torem/ReutersIsrael’s retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 57,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to a count by the territory’s ministry of health that is considered reliable by the UN and many western governments.The Israeli military said it “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm” when striking “terrorist targets”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

His departure came after he apologised for amplifying online material with antisemitic connotations. He had reposted a video about Gaza that contained a picture of a rat, imagery used in the Nazi era to attack Jews.A clearly emotional Lineker was speaking at a private viewing of theGazamedics documentary in London on Thursday night, where he led a question and answer session with the producers after the showing.“It needed to be seen, it really did need to be seen – I think everyone would agree with that,” he said. “I think theBBCshould hold its head in shame.Gaza film’s producer accuses BBC of trying to gag him over decision to drop itRead more“As someone who’s worked for the corporation for 30 years, to see the way it’s declined in the last year or two has been devastating, really, because I’ve defended it and defended it against claims that it’s partial. It talks about impartiality all the time.“The truth is at the moment, [there is a problem] at the very top of the BBC. Not [all] the BBC, because there are thousands and thousands of people that work at the BBC, that are good people, that understand what is going on here and can see it. We see it on our phones every day. The problem is they’re bowing to the pressure from the top. This is a worry and I think time’s coming where a lot of people are going to be answerable to this, and complicity is something that will come to many.”The BBC Radio 5 presenter Nihal Arthanayake responded to a video of Lineker’s comments by saying: “Gary Lineker is a good man. He is spot on about the BBC.”The BBC did not wish to respond to Lineker’s comments. It has previously said it had been attempting to find ways to use the documentary material in news coverage, but a final decision was made to drop the film entirely after talks broke down with its producers, Basement Films.BBC sources insisted the final decision not to use any of the documentary’s material came after two incidents risked creating “a perception of partiality”.They pointed to comments from one of its executive producers, who publicly took aim at the BBC director general,Tim Davie, over failing to run it. Meanwhile, Ramita Navai, the documentary’s presenter, appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and described Israel as “a rogue state that’s committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing, and mass-murdering Palestinians”.This timeline and explanation is disputed.There has been considerable internal unrest over the failure to broadcast the programme, withDavie facing questionsabout it at a recent virtual meeting with staff. More than 100 BBC staff signeda lettercriticising the decision to drop the film.It ends a torrid week for the BBC, which has also been hit with the fallout from its failure to cut the live feed of Bob Vylan’s Glastonbury performance. Davie has come under significant pressure from ministers over the broadcast. During the live stream, Bobby Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster,led chantsof “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces, at Glastonbury last Saturday.While Davie has received a vote of confidence from the BBC board and its chair, Samir Shah, more junior figures appear to be expected to take the blame for the incident. There have been unconfirmed reports that Lorna Clarke, who oversees pop music commissioning at the BBC, has stood back from her duties.A BBC spokesperson said: “We would urge people not to speculate, particularly in relation to any individuals.”BBC insiders have pointed to editorial cuts as aggravating issues around the monitoring of live streams. One said many of the BBC staff who worked on Glastonbury were volunteers from other teams, especially on digital-only streams.Explore more on these topicsBBCGary LinekerGazaIsrael-Gaza warTim DavieDocumentaryFactual TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts predict a formal announcement after Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, arrives in Washington on Mondayon his third visit to the White Housesince Trump began his current term.If a new ceasefire does come into effect, it will be the third during the war, in which about 57,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died.The first lasted just 10 days in November 2023. The second was forced on a reluctant Netanyahu by Trump in February this year andended in Marchwhen Israel reneged on a promise to move to a second scheduled phase that could have led to a definitive end to hostilities.The terms of the new deal include the staggered release of hostages held by Hamas; freedom for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli jails; desperately needed aid for Gaza; and the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from some parts of the strip seized in recent months.Once again, the ceasefire will last for 60 days, during which time talks about what happens next will be held. Trump and regional powers are offering guarantees to reassureHamasthat Israel will not simply return to an all-out offensive and that meaningful discussions about a permanent end to the war will actually take place.One factor that has brought a new ceasefire closer is the brief conflict last month between Israel and Iran, which ended in a US-brokered ceasefire. That capped a series of military and political developments that had seriously weakened Tehran and the various militant groups it had supported around the region, which include Hamas.More important is the boost that gave Netanyahu. Though polls record only a slight increase in support for his Likud party and in his personal popularity, many Israelis nonetheless rejoiced in what was seen as a crushing victory over a much-feared foe.If Netanyahu brings the war in Gaza to what voters see as a successful, or at least acceptable, close, Netanyahu can stand in elections – probably next year – claiming to be the man who made Israel safer than it has ever been, even if few have forgotten the security and strategic failures that led to the Hamas attack of October 2023 in which militants took 251 hostages and killed 1,200, mostly civilians.By the end of this month, Israel’s parliament will have risen for a three-month recess and courts will also not sit, giving Netanyahu respite from the threat of a no-confidence vote or dissolution motion as well as from continuing cross-examination in his trial for corruption. This undermines the threats to collapse the government made throughout the conflict in Gaza by far-right coalition allies bitterly opposed to a deal with Hamas.Successive opinion surveys show that an agreement that brings back hostages would be very popular with Israelis, so this, too, would help Netanyahu in elections. Israeli casualties in Gaza –20 soldiers died in June– are also causing concern. A poll published by Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, on Friday showed a further boost for the prime minister as hopes of a ceasefire rose.As for Hamas, analysts and sources close to its leaders say the militant Islamist organisation is divided, much weakened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza and aware that it has few allies who can or will offer any practical support. The main aim of its leaders now is to retain some presence in Gaza, even a residual one. This alone would constitute some form of victory, and partly explains the determination with which Hamas seek a permanent end to the fighting.Whether it will get one is still not clear. Israeli media have been briefed by “sources close to Netanyahu” that if Hamas cannot be disarmed in Gaza and its leaders exiled from the devastated territory through negotiations then Israel will resume military operations, and that Washington would support its decision to return to war. Many “close to Netanyahu” also continue to support mass “voluntary” emigration from Gaza, or the relocation of much of its population to an area in the south, or both.Recent days have been noisy with voices: American, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Qatari and many others. Barely heard have been the voices of the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel’s offensive continues. On Friday, local officials and medics said Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in the territory and another 20 people died in shootings while waiting at food points.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

In a statement early on Friday morning it said would submit its response to mediators once those talks conclude.Hamasis seeking clear guarantees that the ceasefire will eventually lead to the war’s end, a source close to the group told Reuters.Meanwhile a senior Israeli official close to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the news wire that preparations were in place to approve a ceasefire deal. A separate source familiar with the matter said thatIsraelwas expecting Hamas’ response by Friday and that if it was positive, an Israeli delegation would join indirect talks to cement the deal.Donald Trumpalso said on Friday it would probably be known in 24 hours whether the Palestinian militant group had agreed to accept what he has called a “final proposal” for a ceasefire inGaza.The US president also said he had spoken to Saudi Arabia about expanding the Abraham Accords, the deal on normalization of ties that his administration negotiated between Israel and some Gulf countries during his first term.Trump was asked on Friday ifHamas had agreed to the latest ceasefire deal framework, and said: “We’ll see what happens, we are going to know over the next 24 hours.”In other developments:When asked by a reporter on Thursday whether he still wanted the US to take over Gaza, Trump said: “I want the people of Gaza to be safe more importantly.” He added: “They’ve gone through hell.”Trump firstfloated his plan for a “Riviera of the Middle East”, which included ethnically cleansing Gaza, in February.At least 73 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on Thursday including 15 killed inan attack on a school, Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said.Those killed included 38 people waiting for humanitarian aid at three separate locations in central and southern Gaza, and a child killed by a drone in Jabalia in the north.Israel hasescalated its offensive in Gazabefore the imminent ceasefire talks, with warships and artillery launching one of the deadliest and most intense bombardments in the devastated Palestinian territory for many months this week. In all, about 300 people may have been killed this week and thousands more injured, according to officials.Among those targeted by Israel was one of Gaza’s most senior doctors,Dr Marwan al-Sultan.Tributes were paid on Thursday to the renowned cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in theGazaStrip, who was killed alongside several members of his family. He was the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the last 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.The UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupiedPalestinian territorieshascalled for sanctions and an arms embargo on Israeland for global corporations to be held accountable for “profiting from genocide” in Gaza. Areport by Francesca Albaneseto the UN Human Rights Council on Thursday pointed to the deep involvement of companies from around the world in supporting Israel during its 21-month onslaught in Gaza.Iranon Thursday affirmed its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as it accused Germany of “malice” over its criticism ofTehran’s decision to suspend cooperationwith the UN nuclear watchdog. “Iran remains committed to the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) and its Safeguards Agreement,” foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. “The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbors anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.The producer of a film about medics inGazathat was dropped by the BBC hasaccused the corporation of trying to gag himand others over its decision not to show the documentary.Gaza: Doctors under Attack, which was finally broadcast on Channel 4 on Wednesday night, recounts how hospitals in the territory have been overwhelmed, bombed and raided.

His wife, daughter, sister and son-in-law were also killed in the attack.His surviving daughter Lobna said the airstrike specifically targeted the room her father was in. “All the rooms were fine except for his, the missile hit it precisely,” she said.His son Ahmed said there was “no other explanation” other than that his father was deliberately targeted by the Israeli military. He also added that the floors where his father and their extended family were staying were the only parts of the block hit in the airstrike.View image in fullscreenThe apartment building in Gaza City where Dr Marwan al-Sultan and several family members were reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrikePhotos and videos taken by local journalists and given to the Guardian, showed that the apartment block had been hit on the front side of the fourth and fifth floors, while the rest remained intact.“Until the last minute of his life, he did not leave his job. He paid for this dedication with his life,” said Ahmed. “I was there only 10 minutes before the airstrike and the scene I faced when I went back to the apartment after the attack is indescribable. I didn’t know who had survived and who had died. Some people were only now shattered body parts. Most of those who died were women and children.”He said his father’s death was not just a loss for the family but for the whole ofGaza. Sultan was an experienced cardiologist and a leading figure in Gaza’s medical community. He was also one of only two remaining heart specialists in the territory, according to Healthcare Worker Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.“My father was loved by all people,” said Ahmed. “He had been besieged at the Indonesian hospital and also at the Kamal Adwan hospital but he did not leave. For the first few months [of the war] we did not see him except a few hours of the day because he was always at the hospital.”His death means that all of the directors of the hospitals in northern Gaza have either been killedor detainedby the Israeli military forces.Video footage of a bombed out apartment in GazaThe director of Kamal Adwan hospital, Dr Ahmed al-Kahlout, and his fellow acting director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, as well as Dr Ahmed Muhanna, the director of al-Awda hospital in northern Gaza, are all being held in an Israeli prison.In a statement, the IDF said: “On Wednesday, the IDF struck a key terrorist from the Hamas terrorist organisation in the area of Gaza City. The claim that as a result of the strike uninvolved civilians were harmed is being reviewed.‘Shock and grief’ as senior doctor killed in Israeli airstrike in GazaRead more“The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to mitigate harm to them as much as possible. The Hamas terrorist organisation systematically violates international law while using civilian infrastructure for terrorist activity and the civilian population as human shields. The incident is under review.”According to data from HWW, Sultan was the 70th healthcare worker to have been killed by the Israeli military in the past 50 days. The UN says that overall more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war in October 2023.Under the Geneva conventions,the set of international laws that police the conduct of warring parties, attacks on healthcare workers during conflict could be war crimes. The conventions state that doctors and other healthcare professionals should be protected, not targeted or attacked during conflict, and must be allowed to carry on providing medical care to those who need it.Explore more on these topicsGazaRights and freedomIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

However, she said: “There is no single solution to the problem of illegal migration. That’s why we’ve signed landmark agreements with international partners to dismantle gangs and made significant arrests of notorious people smugglers.”Philp said: “It shouldn’t take a visit to an asylum hotel by me as shadow home secretary to shame the government into action. Illegal working by asylum seekers – most of whom also entered the country illegally – is happening from the very hotels Yvette Cooper is using our money to run.“The government could easily stop it. I saw Deliveroo and other bikes parked in the hotel’s own compound - yet all the security guard cared about was me filming.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumGig economynewsShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t believe it. I don’t know what to say – I was 18 again.”Oasis kick off reunion tour in Cardiff with triumphant, nostalgic gigRead moreHe had attended with his 22-year-old daughter and her boyfriend. “They didn’t know Oasis and came for the experience. It was the best night. They’ve been to concerts before but never like this – it was a new level.” During Stand By Me, the trio had a cuddle – or acwtch, in Welsh – “two generations together. I’ve convinced her throughout the years that they’re the best band, and she was ecstatic to get to this point on her journey.”The show had been “100%” worth the money, he said. “I could’ve gone away with the family for two weeks, all-inclusive, in the sun, but I wouldn’t swap it.”Jack from Stockport, described the concert as “biblical: the presence, everything,” he said. “There was no silence during the set at all, everyone was singing as one.”It wasn’t until the very end of the set that Liam and Noel Gallagher acknowledged each other: Liam walked towards his brother, clapped him on the back twice, and then immediately escaped in a Range Rover waiting on the side of stage to drive him to sanctuary; presumably a similar car awaited Noel on the other side. “The one time they interacted, they looked like actual brothers,” said Jack. “Though Liam didn’t look as if he was giving Noel a lift home.”View image in fullscreenOasis fans singing along inside.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersHis partner, Beth, appeared out of the women’s loos, heavily pregnant with the pair’s twins – their first in utero gig. Beth was born a month after the band’s famous performance at Knebworth in August 1996. Had they considered Noel and Liam as potential names? “They’re girl twins,” she said. “But we did think about Lyla” – a song from 2005’s Don’t Believe the Truth – “as a name for a little bit.”Couple Jarvis and Valentina had travelled from north London for the show. “It was absolutely incredible,” he said. “Liam’s voice hasn’t sounded that good since the mid-90s. At the end of the 00s his voice was shot. That’s incredible.”Brothers in arms: Noel and Liam reunite on the Oasis reunion tour – in picturesRead moreThe pair knew what they were talking about: Valentina said they saw them about 40 times during their initial incarnation. She had moved from Italy to the UK in the year 2000 because of her love for the band. “We used to follow them everywhere,” she said of herself and her teenage girl friends. Once in Florence, she said, they snuck into the band’s hotel “and spent the afternoon drinking with them.”She clarified: “There was no malice. We were good Italian girls. But Liam was drinking from 2pm until 7pm, and by the end I was seeing double. We talked about the Beatles. We would follow them everywhere and if we didn’t have a ticket, they would say, ‘Girls, do you have a ticket?’ and get us in.”Tonight’s show, she said, brought back “so many memories of happy, better times, lots of us cried. They’re a working-class band and they attract that audience: no band has touched a generation like that.”“If I’d dreamed it,” said Jarvis, “they couldn’t have been better.”Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

A backstage bust-up in 2009 brought Oasis to an end, after a 16-year career in which they became the pre-eminent British rock’n’roll band, and the Gallaghers continued to snipe at each other in the press and social media in the following years – most memorably withLiam dubbing Noel a “potato”.Even when Oasis announced a reunion in August 2024 – “The guns have fallen silent. The stars have aligned. The great wait is over” – some fans wondered if another ruction between the brothers would scupper the plans.But following support slots from Britpop peers Cast and Richard Ashcroft, Oasis did indeed appear, with Liam’s arm around his brother as they stepped out on stage. They kicked straight into gear without a word to the crowd, playing Hello, the song that begins (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?, their 18-times platinum album which is outsold in the UK only by Queen and Abba’s greatest hits.“Because we need each other, we believe in one another”, Noel sang on the second track, Acquiesce: a statement of unity that inspired delirious moshing and crowd surfing. But the actual relations between the Gallaghers were relatively frosty, with little acknowledgment of each other thereafter aside from a brief pat on the back at the end, and original guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs stationed between them on stage.View image in fullscreen‘This one is for all the people in their 20s who have never seen us before’ … Noel Gallagher performing at the Principality Stadium, Cardiff.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAThe Gallaghers were backed by Arthurs, the rhythm guitarist on their era-defining first two albums Definitely Maybe (1994) and (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), plus 1997 follow-up Be Here Now, which was less critically acclaimed but still enormous in terms of sound and commercial success. More recently, Arthurs had played with Liam’s solo band.‘Liam hasn’t sounded that good since the 90s’: fans react to the first night of the Oasis reunion tourRead moreArthurs, who was successfully treated for tonsil cancer in 2022, was replaced in Oasis in 1999 by Gem Archer, who also features in the new lineup having played with both Liam and Noel during their solo careers. Andy Bell, the co-founder of Ride – Oasis’s labelmates on Creation Records – and another 1999 Oasis appointee, played bass. The American musician Joey Waronker, known for his work with Beck, REM and Radiohead’s Thom Yorke, was on drums, having recently collaborated withLiam Gallagheron his 2024 album with Stone Roses guitarist John Squire.Noel took the lead on a three-song run of Talk Tonight, Half the World Away and Little By Little – the only post-millennium song, from 2002’s Heathen Chemisty – in the middle of the set, with Liam bringing his trademark sneer and brio back for D’You Know What I Mean?, which led into another Be Here Now song, Stand By Me.Thereafter it was a return to the middle of the mid-1990s, with one-off singles and B-sides such as Whatever and The Masterplan, and a run of the band’s very biggest hits including Live Forever, Rock ’n’ Roll Star, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova.The latter-day Oasis albums aren’t as well loved as the first three, but they certainly contain songs fans might have expected to hear including Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Lyla, Songbird and Go Let It Out. But there were no curveballs or deep cuts, and Oasis delivered the crowdpleasers most fans were hoping for.Brothers in arms: Noel and Liam reunite on the Oasis reunion tour – in picturesRead moreThere were also tributes to the late Portuguese footballer Diogo Jota, who died yesterday in a car crash at the age of 28: he was well known to British fans, having won the Premier League and FA Cup with Liverpool. Cast dedicated their own football anthem, Walkaway to him, and an image of Jota was displayed during Oasis’s performance of Live Forever.For a famously gobby band, there was relatively little stage banter, though Liam beseeched the crowd at one point: “I want you to turn around and put your arms around each other … and jump up and fucking down.”He also made a brazen reference to the pricing scandal that made headlines when tickets went on sale: a “dynamic pricing” mechanism meant that the popularity of the tickets drove up the cost, prompting anger from fans and promises from culture secretary Lisa Nandy to look into the practice. “What’s happening? Everyone having a good time yeah? Is it worth the £4,000 you paid for a ticket?”, Liam asked the crowd.Noel meanwhile thanked the band’s younger fans as he began the encore with a rendition of The Masterplan: “This one is for all the people in their 20s who have never seen us before who have kept us shit hot for the last 20 years.”Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockWalesCardiffLiam GallagherNoel GallaghernewsShareReuse this content"

At this point, we don’t know where they all came from,” he said.He said Donald Trump had been informed of the situation and responded: “Whatever we need, we can have.”The region was inundated when five to 10in of rain fell overnight as part of an intense, slow-moving storm across Kerr and Kendall counties. The runoff from parched land caused the Guadalupe River to crest at one of its highest-ever peaks, with water levels in Kerrville rising more than 22ft in just a few hours overnight.Teams have conducted dozens of rescues as the emergency response continued and an unknown number of people remained unaccounted for. The state senator Pete Flores said: “We are in search-and-rescue mode, and we know that these first 24 hours are very important.”More rain is expected in the state, including around Waco, and flooding is anticipated downriver from Kerr county.Dalton Rice, city manager for Kerrville, the county seat, told reporters the extreme flooding struck with little to no advance warning, precluding authorities from issuing any evacuation orders.“This happened very quickly, over a very short period of time, that could not be predicted, even with the radar,” Rice said. “This happened within less than a two-hour span.”Of particular concern aremore than a dozen summer campsdotted in the rural region that would now be filled with kids.The Texas Hill Country, a scenic and rocky gateway to booming vineyards and vacation rentals, begins west of the state capital and is a popular outdoor summer getaway. Parts of the region are prone to flash flooding.View image in fullscreenWater rises from severe flooding along the Guadalupe River in Kerr county, Texas, on Friday.Photograph: APDozens of people posted on Facebook asking for any information about their children, nieces and nephews attending one of the many camps in the area, or family members who had gone camping during the holiday weekend.The Ingram fire department posted a photo of a statement from Camp Mystic, saying the camp experienced “catastrophic level floods”. Parents with a daughter not accounted for had been directly contacted, the camp said.“We are working with search and rescue currently,” the camp said in its communication. “The highway has washed away so we are struggling to get more help. Please continue to pray and send any help if you have contacts to do so.”Authorities have urged people to exercise caution and avoid driving on water-covered roads as the extreme conditions continue. “Conditions are life-threatening! DO NOT go out onto the roads,” the National Weather Service inSan Angelourged on Friday morning. “Expect roads washed out andrapid riseson rivers and creeks.”The sheriff’s office added that “the entire county is an extremely active scene. Residents are encouraged to shelter in place and not attempt travel. Those near creeks, streams, and the Guadalupe River should immediately move to higher ground.”The rains come after a long drought in the region that has left the soil bone-dry, increasing the chances of runoff leading to flash flooding.Erin Burgess, a resident of the Bumble Bee Hills neighborhood west of Ingram, recounted her harrowing survival ordeal to the Associated Press. She said she woke up to thunder at 3.30am Friday morning, and “it was raining pretty heavy, but no big deal”.Just 20 minutes later, Burgess said, water was coming in through the walls and rushing through the front and back doors. She described an agonizing hour clinging to a tree and waiting for the water to recede enough that she was able to walk up the hill to a neighbor’s.“My son and I floated to a tree where we hung onto it, and my boyfriend and my dog floated away. He was lost for a while, but we found them,” she said.Of her 19-year-old son, Burgess said: “Thankfully he’s over 6ft tall. That’s the only thing that saved me, was hanging on to him.”The rains in central Texas are expected to continue until later Friday.Strong storms are also being blamed for at least three deaths in central New Jersey, including two men in Plainfield who died after a tree fell on to a vehicle they were traveling in during the height of the storm,according to a city Facebook post. The men were aged 79 and 25, officials said. They were not immediately publicly identified. Fourth of July celebrations were cancelled, the city said, “out of good conscience”.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTexasFloodingNew JerseyExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve never had anything like that before.”Trump previously touted the legislation’s passage as a “birthday present for America”, speakingbefore a crowd ata campaign-style rally in Iowa on Thursday evening, even as Democrats expressed their displeasure at the spending package.“If you see anything negative put out by the Democrats, it’s all a con job,” Trump said of opposition to the bill.Trump signed the bill while surrounded by supporters, including the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who gave Trump the gavel he used to enact it.After months of deliberations, the bill passed by a single vote in the Senate and later passed the House with a 219 to 213 vote on Thursday, with only two Republicans voting against it. The sweeping legislation accomplishes what rightwingers have pushed for, for decades, as the Guardianexplainedthis week, and provides Trump a huge legislative win.The law will significantly cut taxes, building on the 2017 tax cuts during Trump’s first term. Although temporary tax exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest are included,researchfrom the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that the bill is skewed to the rich, with the wealthiest in the US benefiting the most from the tax relief.“After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” Trump said during Friday’s event.Additionally, the law will add new restrictions to Medicaid, which provides healthcare to low-income and disabled people, and Snap, also known as food stamps, which helps low-income people afford food. Researchersestimatethat the Medicaid cutbacks will leave as many as 11.8 million people without healthcare, while 8 million people will lose their Snap benefits. Critics say that the Medicaid cuts will have massive ripple effects on healthcare nationwide.“This is highway robbery,” the Democratic senator Raphael Warnockpostedon X, formerly known as Twitter. “The bill Republicans just passed steals from you to give to the rich.”Proponents of the law say that the Medicaid and Snap changes are designed to root out waste and abuse.Additionally, the spending package will allocate $170m to immigration enforcement, a monumental amount of money that will help support the Trump administration’s push to engage in “mass deportations”.“This disgraceful, anti-immigrant budget hands the Trump administration a blank check to further ramp up its shameful efforts to terrorize American communities and separate families,” said Nicole Melaku, the executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, an immigrants’ rights organization. “Instead of safeguarding people’s access to healthcare and wellness, the bill gives tax cuts to big corporations and funnels billions of dollars to hire more immigration agents, build more immigration jails and deny people their fair day in court.”Already, the Trump administration has engaged in widespread attacks on immigrant communities, by increasing resources to immigration enforcement operations.“This budget promises to supercharge US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests that disappear community members, leave children parentless and threaten constitutional and due-process rights for all of us,” said Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center, alegal organization.A recent Guardian analysis shows that undocumented immigrants without any criminal history have been arrested at an exponentially increasing rate, after top White House officials instructed agents to increase arrests.Trump’s Medicaid cuts are coming for rural Americans: ‘It’s going to have to hit them first’Read moreTrump temporarily walked back some of Ice’s aggressive immigration enforcement actions after complaints from leaders in the farming and hospitality industries: last month, the Trump administration engaged in a short-lived pause on raids at farms, restaurants and hotels. But at Thursday’s event, Trump again brought up the idea of pausing large-scale enforcement on farms.“If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people in some way, Kristi, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” Trump said to the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem. “We don’t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms.”In addition to tax cuts, restrictions on Medicaid and Snap and the aggressive supercharging of immigration enforcement, the law seeks to end green energy incentives created under Joe Biden, seen as a further blow against efforts to combat the climate crisis.The US budget deficit will increase with this law, leading to opposition by some Trump allies. The non-partisan congressional budget office estimates the law will add $3.3tn to the country’s debt through 2034, leading to clashes with some rightwingers.One of the two Republicans who voted against it, Thomas Massie,saidhe opposed the spending bill “because it will significantly increase US budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates”.Elon Musk, the rightwing billionaire who established the federal government’s office tasked with slashing federal spending during the first few months of the Trump administration, has also publicly called out the spending bill. Days before Congress passed the bill, Muskrepeatedhis call for the creation of a new political party to oppose the Republicans and Democrats.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS taxationTrump administrationUS politicsUS healthcareUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Sitting approximately 50 miles (80km) west of Miami, the remote facility is managed by the state but in large part funded the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).“It might be as good as the real Alcatraz. A little controversial, but I couldn’t care less,” Trump said on Tuesday after touring the site. During the tour, Trump joked about immigrants being pursued by snakes and alligators if they attempted to escape.Since Trump took office, Florida has been assisting the administration’s goals in rounding up a large number of immigrants to be detained and deported. Through a program called 287(g), local law enforcement agencies partner with DHS and become deputized to carry out immigration enforcement operations. According to thestate government, Florida has more 287(g) deputizations than any other state in the US, which has allowed it to engage in widespread operations targeting immigrant communities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Data analysis by the Guardian shows that there has been a dramatic nationwide increase in the arrest of undocumented immigrantswith no criminal record. The White House has pressured immigration officials to arrest 3,000 people per day, with the reported goal of reaching one million a year.Two non-profit groups havesuedDHS, claiming the site’s buildup is violating environmental policies.

Among other things, the plan will increase immigration enforcement, cut social security, damage the green energy industry and extend and deepen the large-scale tax cuts – which benefit wealthy earners most – that Trump first enacted in 2017.Democrats erupted inoutrageover the bill’s passage. The congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Bluesky: “I am grieving the barbarism that is going to unfurl from all this. People are going to die. Livelihoods gone. All to feed a corrupt kleptocracy.”What will it mean for deportation policy?Thousands of new immigration enforcement officers, tens of thousands of extra detention beds, fees on asylum applications and further construction on the border wall. Here’s how Trump’s bill will supercharge mass deportations byfunneling $170bnto Ice.What about social security?According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the welfare cuts will result in about 10.6 million people losing their Medicaid healthcare and 8 million people losing their Snap food stamp benefits.And the deficit?It comes with a huge price tag, increasing the deficit by$3.3tn through 2034, according to the non-partisan congressional budget Office. Most of that is the extension of the 2017 tax cuts.Israel steps up deadly bombardment of Gaza before ceasefire talks1:36Footage shows aftermath of deadly Israeli strike on Gaza school turned shelter – videoIsrael has escalated its offensive in Gaza before imminent talks about a ceasefire, with warships and artillery launching one of the deadliest and most intense bombardments in the devastated Palestinian territory for months.Medics and officials in Gaza reported thatabout 90 people were killed overnight and on Thursdayby Israeli bombing, including many women and children. On Tuesday night and Wednesday the toll was higher, they said. Casualties includedMarwan al-Sultan, a cardiologistand director of the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, who died in an airstrike that also killed his wife and five children.In all, about 300 people may have been killed this week and thousands more injured, the officials say.What’s the latest on ceasefire talks?Hamas leaders are close to accepting a proposed deal for a ceasefire in Gaza but want stronger guarantees that any pause in hostilities would lead to a permanent end to the 21-month war, sources close to the group have said.

It found the levels downstream were higher for at least onePfascompound 95% of the time, suggesting that the sludge sites are behind the increased pollution levels.“We have an indication of very widespread problems and significant exposures that people are going to be facing,” said Kelly Hunter Foster, an environmental attorney with the Waterkeeper Alliance, which conducted the study.Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds that are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and accumulate in the human body and environment. The chemicals are linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, liver disease, kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity.Sludge is a mix of human and industrial waste that is a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process. Its disposal is expensive, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows it to be spread on cropland as “biosolid” fertilizer because it is also rich in plant nutrients.But public health advocates have blasted the practice because the nation spends billions of dollars annually treating water only to take the toxic byproduct, insert it into the food supply and re-pollute water.Wastewater treatment plants’ effluent, or allegedly clean water that they spit back into water systems, often contain high levels of Pfas.Most of the levels far exceeded the EPA’s draft guidance for Pfas in surface waters, which is as low as 0.0009 parts per trillion for PFOA, one of the most common and dangerous types of compounds.The authors looked at water in 19 states, and found the highest levels in Detroit’s Rouge River, which showed 44ppt of PFOA; North Carolina’s Haw River; South Carolina’s Pocotaligo River and Maryland’s Potomac River.The largest increase around a wastewater plant was found in the Rouge River, where Detroit’s mammoth facility spits Pfas-tainted effluent. The chemicals’ levels jumped by 146% to about 80ppt for all Pfas. The Pocotaligo, Haw, and Santa Ana River in southern California saw similar spikes.The largest increase around a field on which sewage sludge was spread was found in the Dragoon Creek near Spokane, Washington, where total Pfas levels jumped from about 0.63 ppt to about 33ppt, an increase of over 5,100%.The EPA has long resisted calls to ban the spreading of sewage sludge on agricultural fields, thougha 2024 lawsuitthat alleges Clean Water Act violations could force some regulatory action. The Trump administration hasscrapped the rulemaking processfor industrial discharges of Pfas that Joe Biden’s EPA began. That would have forced treatment plants to rein in their pollution.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPfasnewsShareReuse this content"

Not only was Emma Raducanu holding her own againstAryna Sabalenka, she was soaring. More than an hour into one of the most intense matches she has played, Raducanu arrived at set point against the best player in the world.However, Sabalenka, the world No 1, has long grown accustomed to the massive target on her back, which so often spurs her challengers to perform far above their usual levels. In the face of another grand slam champion playing some of her best tennis, Sabalenka elevated her own game to even greater heights in the decisive moments, crushing Raducanu’s hopes of a career-best victory by triumphing 7-6 (6), 6-4 to reach the fourth round atWimbledon.Wimbledon 2025: Sabalenka v Raducanu; Alcaraz, Norrie and Kartal win – liveRead moreAfter failing to convert so many chances on such a significant occasion, Raducanu was understandably emotional afterwards. She held a set point in the opening set before holding a break point for a 5-1 lead in set two. But every time she tried to pull away, Sabalenka raised her level and re-established control.“It does give me confidence because I think the problem before was that I felt like I was gulfs away from the very top,” said Raducanu. “Having a match like that where I had chances in both sets, it does give me confidence. At the same time, it’s very difficult to take right now.”Most of Raducanu’s previous career meetings against the best players in the world had ended in disappointing, one-sided blowouts that exposed her lack of firepower. Here, on grass, a surface that provides her game with more potency, Raducanu rose to the occasion spectacularly at the urging of a thunderous crowd, demonstrating the full capabilities of her well-rounded game, particularly her improved serve, forehand and defensive skills as she pushed Sabalenka for two hours.“I cannot predict anything, but I am definitely sure that, maybe not in a month, but maybe a bit longer period, but she is definitely going to get back into the top 10,” said Sabalenka. “She’s fighting. She’s playing much better. She’s more consistent. I can see that mentally she’s healthy. I think that’s really important. Yeah, I’m pretty sure she’s getting there.”View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu slips during her third-round match against Aryna Sabalenka and appears for a moment to be injured.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockRaducanu set the tone from the beginning by imposing maximum pressure on her opponent with her forehand aggression, excellent serving and her ability to soak up and deflect Sabalenka’s pace. After losing her early break, Raducanu made an incredible last stand on her serve at 4-5, saving seven set points almost entirely with brilliant serving before closing out an astounding hold. With the momentum behind her, ­Raducanu broke serve to establish a 6-5 lead. But Sabalenka fought back to retrieve the break and force a first set tie-break.At the end of the tie-break, with the crowd’s deafening roars punctuating every winning shot, Raducanu’s brilliant serving and retrieval skills earned her a set point at 6-5. Instead, Sabalenka showed her evolving game and her resilience to turn the set around. After saving Raducanu’s only set point with a delicate drop shot, she swept forward to the net on her eighth set point and closed out an unforgettable 74-minute first set with a drop-volley winner.At the end of such an intense, high quality yet fruitless set of tennis, it would have been reasonable for Raducanu’s intensity to drop. Instead, she kept on going and she soon held a break point for a 5-1 second-set lead. As soon as Raducanu betrayed her nerves, sending an aggressive forehand long on the break point, the world No 1 reeled off the final five games of the match to close out a supreme win.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu showed great resilience in both sets but ultimately lost out to Aryna Sabalenka’s greater power in the key moments.Photograph: Shi Tang/Getty ImagesJust a few weeks after losing control of her emotions during and afterher loss to Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros final, this was also a significant moment for Sabalenka as she maintained her composure in the decisive moments. Her candidacy for a first Wimbledon title has only been strengthened by the mental fortitude she showed in front of a hostile crowd.“Sometimes my ears were, like, really blocked from how loud it was, but I really enjoyed it,” said Sabalenka, smiling. “I was trying to trick my brain, and I was pretending that people were cheering for me. Sometimes when they were screaming ‘Emma’, it sounded like ‘Aryna’.”Even in defeat, this performance represents a significant step forward for Raducanu after an extremely difficult four years. Her level is a reflection of her consistent daily work she has put together over the past few months and the clear progress she has made with her game. She has shown that she is capable of making life difficult for the best players in the world. The next step is beating them.“First thing I did, I had a KitKat in the changing rooms,” said Raducanu. “Then, I don’t know, I’ll probably find it tough to sleep tonight, or I’ll be so exhausted and crash, but I don’t know. It’s going to take me a few days to process that. But at the same time it really motivates me.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Emma RaducanuAryna SabalenkaWimbledonTennismatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He issued a withering assessment of the president’s tenure as he aired his platform for the vote, which will be held on 12 December.McLaren go from busking at back of F1 field to Silverstone’s headline actRead more“If you look at the number of people who have resigned from the FIA who have gone in with the best intentions but cannot effect change, or say ‘No this is a bad idea, Mr President’. It is a reign of terror,” he said. “You are wondering when the next scandal is.”The 59-year-old American, who enjoyed a long career in motorsport organisation, gave a damning verdict on a highly controversial period of leadership by Ben Sulayem that has been publicly criticised by many in F1, including the drivers.Ben Sulayem has presided over rifts with drivers and a string of high-profile departures from the sport’s governing body, including most recently the deputy president for sport, Robert Reid, who left citing a “breakdown of governance standards” in April, which Mayer also addressed.“We have been left with illusion of progress and illusion of leadership while the most senior team he has appointed has departed,” Mayer said. “The illusion of inclusion, while capable voices, women and people from diverse backgrounds, were pushed out when they spoke out.“We have had the illusion of transparency and engagement. And perhaps most corrosive, the illusion of integrity. We have witnessed wave after wave of statute amendments ushering in the greatest centralisation of power in the FIA’s history.”Mayer left his role as an F1 steward last November, claiming that he had been let go by text message amid fallout from an issue relating to the United States GP in which he held a different role. He insisted revenge was not the reason for his candidacy.The FIA structure heavily favours the incumbent against a challenger and Ben Sulayem recently received a letter of support from 36 member clubs, about which Mayer was also scathing.“When a letter is shoved under your nose and you are told ‘sign this, or else’ anyone is going to sign it,” he said. “But the only vote that counts are in December, that process will still have full democracy.”Ben Sulayem and the FIA have been contacted for comment.On track, Silverstone basked in warm sunshine with huge numbers turning up for practice. They were rewarded in the first session when Lewis Hamilton, in his first run for Ferrari in the UK, topped the timesheets. He has won here a record nine times before, including a remarkable victory last year but with the Ferrari off the pace admitted that he was “hoping and praying” to make the podium.He has yet to have a top-three finish since joining the Scuderia this season, the longest he has gone into a year without a trophy, but he at least opened well, just quicker than McLaren’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in second and third.In the afternoon running Norris continued his run of form after his win at the last round in Austria, going quickest, two tenths clear of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Hamilton, with Piastri fourth and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in fifth.The McLaren was expected to be strong through Silverstone’s sweeping high speed turns but Ferrari too will be pleased with their performance, suggesting the upgrades to the floor they brought to Austria have delivered a genuine step forward.Explore more on these topicsBritish Grand PrixFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Trump is weaponizing themJules BoykoffAs the IOC ushers in new leadership, Donald Trump’s second term is already wreaking havoc on LA 28 – and turning a global celebration into a national security crackdownFri 4 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 05.50 EDTShareWhen the International Olympic Committee first handed Los Angeles the 2028 Summer Olympics back in 2017, IOC president Thomas Bachcalledit “a golden opportunity” for all involved. Fast forward to last month when Kirsty Coventrytookthe reins from Bach at the IOC. So much has changed.In January, LA was hit with deadly wildfires. That same month a different sort of natural disaster took shape as Donald Trump returned to the White House. Bach had previouslypraisedLA for its “strong foundation”, but that foundation has crumbled under the weight of the wildfires, a citywidebudget crisisand an erratic president whose marauding Immigration and Customs Enforcementlooklike they arrived straight from robbing a liquor store to instill fear across Los Angeles.The LA28 Olympics are now a slow-motion train wreck.Just ahead of his inauguration, TrumpassuredCasey Wasserman, the chair of the LA28 Olympic Organizing Committee, that “These are America’s Olympics,” adding, “These are more important than ever to LA and I’m going to be supportive in every way possible and make them the greatest Games.” Then, in March, speaking to the IOC, Wassermaninsistedthat “irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics.” He added, “LA is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.”On one hand, that may be true. Trump is not likely to squander an opportunity to engage insportswashing: using sports to self-aggrandize on the global stage while stoking nationalism, bolstering the state security apparatus and deflecting attention from domestic social problems. Trumpfrequently yammersabout how the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics and the 2026 World Cup are among the events in his second term that gets his fascist heart a-tittering the quickest. Staging the mega-events is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to appear important on the world stage. Moreover, during Trump’s first term, heassuredLA28 Olympic organizers that the federal government would supply security to protect the event.On the other hand, to say Trump is erratic is to make an Olympian understatement. Plus, he has an in-built incentive to make life hard for California governor Gavin Newsom – his perpetual nemesis and a possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidate – and LA’s left-of-center mayor Karen Bass. Last month, vice-president JD Vance parachuted into LA and immediately slid into attack-dog mode,callingthe activist pushback against Ice raids “a tragedy” of Newsom and Bass’s making. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law,” hesaid, “and you had rioters, egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job.”Angelenos are at the Trump administration’s mercy in other ways, too. Olympic organizersare banking on scoringaround $3.2bn in federal funding for transportation that’s crucial to the Games running smoothly. But Trump’s transportation secretary Sean Duffy recentlythreatenedto cut off funding for cities like LA that have experienced anti-Ice protests. A federal judgeissueda temporary order pausing the plan, but congressional Republicans hold tremendous leverage over the fiscal spigot, and this is a clear stick-it-to-the-libs moment they are unlikely to fritter away.But even more alarming is the fact that Trump and Vance have a secret weapon in their arsenal: theNational Special Security Eventdesignation, or NSSE. When an event such as the Olympics, a Super Bowl or an egotisticmilitary paradeis designated as an NSSE by a president or their Department of Homeland Security, it triggers widespread latitude for a bevy of federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement.View image in fullscreenIn 2024, Joe Biden designated the LA28 Olympics a ‘National Special Security Event’, some four full years ahead of the Games.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for LA28Few know this but the NSSE for the Los Angeles 2028 isalready in effect. In 2024, then-president Joe Bidendesignatedthe LA28 Olympics a “National Special Security Event”, some four full years ahead of the Games – the furthest in advance of an event since Bill Clinton concocted the designation in the late 1990s.Everyday people in Los Angeles, as well as their elected officials, need to wake up to the reality that this relatively unknown acronym is about to change their life, if it is not already changing it. After all, some900,000undocumented people live in LA, according to the University of Southern California.Let’s be clear, the National Special Security Event status only emboldens impunity. The security crackdown on Ice protests, featuring the National Guard and Marines, offers Angelenos a frontal view at what that mega-event “security” might look like over the next three years.NSSEs enable also secrecy. When LA city council member Imelda Padilla recentlyaskedLos Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell whether he’d be willing to warn city officials if he got wind of upcoming federal immigration raids. McDonnell’s response raised alarm bells: “You’re asking me to warn you about an enforcement action being taken by another agency before it happens? We can’t do that.” He added, “That would be completely inappropriate and illegal.” But is this stance just standard-issue obstruction-of-justice pap? Or is it entangled with the hierarchies of the National Special Security event?McConnell may have offered us a hint when hesaid, “All of the crimes we investigate potentially could be in partnership with [federal agencies],” The police chief added, “It is a partnership, and without that partnership, we wouldn’t be able to go into the World Cup, the Olympics ... that require that we work with federal, state and local partners.” Big questions linger about how the NSSE designation is already affecting policing in LA. The closer we get to the Olympics, the more urgent this issue will become.To further complicate matters for LA28 Olympic organizers, the Trump administration hatched plans to institute a freshtravel banthat affects countries like Iran, Haiti and Libya. Then, itannouncedthat an additional 36 countries could be subjected to its travel ban. Every singlecountrylisted on Trump’s travel ban lists – all 48 of them – sent athletes to theParis 2024Games.Then the Trump administrationdenied visasto players and staff from Senegal’s women’s basketball team, forcing the squad to cancel its trip. The team had planned a training camp in the US to ready itself for LA 2028 Olympic qualifiers.What a time for Kirsty Coventry to take over at the IOC. The first woman and first African – she hails from Zimbabwe – elected to the presidency, Coventry faces a misogynist and bully in Donald Trump. The Olympic Charterstatesplainly that “the IOC’s role” in accordance with its mission, is “to act against any form of discrimination affecting the Olympic Movement”. Will Coventry stand up to Trump and defend these principles? That’s what real leadership would look like. And only then would a new era at the IOC truly begin.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Then when I knew the words I found it hard to sing them. Mainly because there seemed to be too many, leading to lines being tripped over and bafflement with the sound of everyone around me sticking with it. But they were, so I did too, and eventually I got it, and loved it, and, as such, I sang it, over and over again.“Oh, he wears theNo 20 / He will take us to victory / And when he’s running down the left wing/ He’ll cut inside and score for LFC / He’s a lad from Portugal / Better than Figo don’t you know / Oh, his name is Diogo!”Senseless death of Diogo Jota will not stop us celebrating what he brought life | Barney RonayRead moreLiverpool supporters love a song and few in recent years have been belted out with as much joyful lustiness as theone dedicated to Diogo Jota. Based on Bad Moon Rising by Creedence Clearwater Revival, it took some Reds longer than others to grasp but we eventually all did and so it roared from the stands of Anfield and elsewhere. A brilliant celebration of a brilliant player and one we expected to continue chanting for a few more seasons at least. And no doubt we will, but its words will now be tinged with sadness. Grief, even.These things are simply not meant to happen and, more than anything,Jota’s deathis a personal tragedy. He was 28, recently married, a father of three and lost his life alongside his brother. One can only imagine the immense heartbreak being felt by his family and friends. And you only have to glance across mainstream and social media to see his passing has had a wider impact, few places more than at the club he called home for the past five years. Not for the first time, Liverpool Football Club are in mourning.Staff and players have paid their own tributes to Jota, as have fans, seen most vividly with the array of flowers, shirts, scarves and messages of condolences left outside Anfield after news from Spain emerged on Thursday morning. The collective sense of shock and devastation is palpable, as well as heartfelt, because Jota was adored by those who watched him play after his arrival from Wolves for £45m in September 2020. And yes, we knew he wasn’t better than Figo, but we could also see that he was good. Seriously, seriously good.Quite simply, Jota was a supreme goalscorer. There were 65 in 182 appearances and when he got a chance he more often than not took it, something you inherently felt watching him and which is backed up by data. As the statistics-based football writer Andrew Beasley posted on Bluesky, 39 players have had 50-plus shots on target forLiverpoolin the Premier League, with Jota’s 47% conversion rate the highest of them all. More than Mohamed Salah, more than Michael Owen, more than Fernando Torres. And what made Jota’s potency especially noteworthy was that he was neither particularly big nor fast. Instead he found his way to goal via a combination of quick thinking, bravery and determination, traits that came together to produce his trademark move: the drop of the shoulder, the surge through defenders, the shift of weight and, finally, the ice-cold shot.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota takes in the acclaim of teammate Curtis Jones and a jubilant home crowd after scoring the crucial goal in a 1-0 victory over Everton at Anfield in April.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesTo some extent Jota’s biggest strengths were also his biggest weakness, in that his willingness to take physical contact from opponents in order to score or set up a teammate to do so – he also provided 22 assists at Liverpool – led to collisions that on more than one occasion sidelined him for an extended spell. And injuries were sadly a notable aspect of Jota’s time at Liverpool. He missed more than 150 games through various bone breaks and muscle tears, and the absences became so frequent and lengthy that Liverpool fans increasingly felt he could be sold this summer or become a back-up option.Whatever the future might have held, Jota would always have been cherished by Kopites. It took us a year to watch him in the flesh given his arrival coincided with the Covid-hit behind-closed‑doors season but from a distance a bond was quickly established, not only because of his goals and commitment but also because of a hugely likable nature. And soon he could be enjoyed up close, with his song taking off during the 2021-22 season, his most prolific at the club, with 21 goals scored in 55 appearances (with many indeed coming from the left wing), a contribution that was key to Liverpool winning two domestic trophies and coming agonisingly close to an unprecedented quadruple.And the goals continued, many of them memorable, including winners in a4-3 victory over Tottenham in April 2023and a1-0 triumph over Everton in April of this yearthat moved Liverpool a step closer to winning a 20th league title. Indeed, Jota’s last act as a Liverpool player was lifting the Premier League trophy at a joyous Anfield after the 1-1 draw with Crystal Palaceon the final day of last season. The next time players and fans convene there the mood will be strikingly different. But the Jota song will again be sung and he will again be celebrated. It’s the least we can do for a player, a person, who gave us so much.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolDiogo JotacommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a bit different to England in 2022. I’m very excited but so much has changed, so I’m intrigued to come back and enjoy this ­tournament football.”England face fiendish path to glory but Euro 2025 is capturing hearts of hostsRead moreEngland look different from the team that beat Germany in the final in 2022. Millie Brightstepped backto protect her mental and physical health and Jill Scott, Ellen White, Rachel Daly,Mary Earpsand Fran Kirby have retired completely or, in the case of the last two, retired from ­international duty. The mantra has been that this is a new England.“The team has been a bit in ­transition, of course,” the manager, Sarina Wiegman, said, “and we ­absolutely cherish what we have done before, and we never forget it, and those are lifetime experiences for us and for our families and also for the fans. But you have to move on and you have to be on top. Things are changing very quickly, so we have to, too. We came together in February and we said: ‘It’s a new challenge.’ The approach was there anyway, but we called it the New England.”France have changed too, but there are familiar faces everywhere, not least in the dynamic Chelsea forward Sandy Baltimore. How do you stop her? “Whisper in her ear,” said Lucy Bronze, her Chelsea teammate, with a grin. What do you say? “Nothing in English,” the England full-back said, still grinning.Bronze, competing at her seventh major tournament having been part of every Euros and World Cup squad since 2013, has probably played with or against most players in ­Switzerland for Euro 2025.View image in fullscreenLucy Bronze is competing in her seventh major tournament.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThere is one absent face in ­particular she will miss, though – that of the France centre-back Wendie Renard, who was dropped by the manager, Laurent Bonadei, along with Kenza Dali and Eugénie Le ­Sommer. It is a testament to Bronze’s competitive nature that she was unhappy about Renard’s omission.“I want to play against Wendie,” she said of her former Lyon ­teammate. “I want to play against the ­strongest French team. I want Wendie to be playing, defending corners and I can jump over her and win the ball. ­Winning a header over Wendie Renard, that’s an achievement.”Renard’s replacement as France’s captain, Griedge Mbock, another former Lyon clubmate of Bronze’s, is a doubt. The Paris Saint-Germain centre-back has been training ­separately after a calf injury. The potential stand-in, 21-year-old Alice Sombath, who has four caps, was also at Lyon with Bronze. “She’s probably got more maturity than people might give her credit for,” Bronze said.France have an enviable ­attacking lineup that includes Kadidiatou Diani, Baltimore and Marie-­Antoinette Katoto. “I think England have one of the best attacking lineups,” said Bronze. “The type of attackers France have got, we have quite similar, and as defenders we defend against that every day in training.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been referred to as the group of death. There is little room for error.Bronze said it was “a good and a bad thing” having to start against a serious contender. “If we lose that game, everyone says it’s the worst; if we win that game, it’s the best,” she said. “We just try to look at the positives: the fact that we get to test ourselves against the good teams straight away.

Germany needed something special to break through Poland’s stubborn resistance. Within a blink of an eye, the net was bulging and Germany were making a winning start to their campaign.A well-coached Poland side can be proud of their performance but, once Brand’s stunning strike went in in the 52nd minute, the result looked inevitable and Lea Schüller headed in Germany’s second to give them a perfect springboard to the tournament.Germany v Poland: Women’s Euro 2025 – liveRead moreThe record eight-time European champions have failed to reach the final only twice since the first time they qualified in 1989, but it was not until the second half when they were able to demonstrate why so many pundits are tipping them to go deep into the competition yet again.They were by no means perfect, but a pleased player-of-the-match Brand said: “We do have room for improvement, especially with our final pass, but the first game of a Euros is really difficult. That’s why it’s great we got the three points.”With St Gallen lying less than 15 miles from the German border, this was almost a home fixture for the 2022 runners-up and their supporters brought energy and passion to the streets of the seventh-century city, surrounded by rolling green hills on another picture-perfect, warm evening in Switzerland. After the hosts, German citizens have bought more tickets for this tournament than any other nation, and it showed, as they paraded in vast numbers through the streets towards the stadium before kick-off, eager to see if their team could continue their formidable run of five straight victories in which they had scored 24 times.View image in fullscreenGermany captain Giulia Gwinn looked devastated as she was forced to come off in the first half with an injury.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAThe determined and hard-working debutants Poland, however, had nothing to lose and executed their gameplan impressively in the first half. Without the ball, they often appeared to be playing with a back six, but they proved tricky for the Germans to break down and then, in the transitional moments, they had the pace of the Barcelona striker Ewa Pajor in attack to worry the Germany back four. Emilia Szymczak volleyed wide of the far post when unmarked at a deep free-kick, before Ann-Katrin Berger tipped a Pajor shot over the crossbar, although the offside flag was raised.Such was Christian Wück’s frustration, he sent his team out for the second half more than three minutes early. Brand responded with the moment of individual quality that was needed, cutting in on to her left foot and driving her strike past Kinga Szemik. The sea of white shirts behind the goal erupted.Sjoeke Nüsken inexplicably headed wide when a goal seemed certain, before Schüller’s far-post header made the win safe. Poland did not give up and Pajor was thwarted by a fine reaction save from Berger and while Germany did not quite send out the same statement that Spain stamped across the competition on Thursday, they are in form.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Filippa Angeldahl scored the only goal in the game to give Peter Gerhardsson’s side an early advantage in Group C.It took one moment of carefully crafted play from two of Sweden’s seasoned stars to finally unlock the hard-working Denmark defence. Angeldahl had looked the most likely to find the breakthrough as she grew in influence. Her well-timed one-two with Kosovare Asllani and the finish that followed was an example of how creative this Sweden team can be when they put their minds to it.Anxiety and excitement combine for Williamson with Wiegman’s new EnglandRead more“Joy and relief,” Angeldahl said. “There are many nerves when you start a tournament so it was a wonderful feeling to score that first goal.”Always the bridesmaid, never the bride – that is the slightly unfortunate tagline that has followed this team around in the latter part of Gerhardsson’s tenure. An Olympic silver and two World Cup bronze medals have marked significant progress under his leadership but, all too often, they have failed to find that extra per cent. This tournament represents the last opportunity for him and several members of his squad to win their first European trophy in 41 years.The 65-year-old oversees a highly experienced side that certainly has the quality on paper to go better than Euro 2022, where they got knocked out in thesemi-final by England. Asllani, their leader at the heart it all, was making her 200th international appearance in Geneva, a feat only previously achieved by Caroline Seger and Therese Sjögran.View image in fullscreenDenmark and Sweden players battle for the ball from a set piece.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersSweden’s impressive form – they are unbeaten since July 2024 – certainly suggests that they could once again mount a challenge. They will have been full of confidence coming into this opener with rivals Denmark. These two are very familiar, having played twice in this year’s Nations League campaign. Sweden won both fixtures and humbled Denmark with a 6-1 victory in their last outing in June. Gerhardsson made just one change from that encounter with Madelen Janogy coming into attack in place of Fridolina Rolfö, who is still lacking fitness after picking up an ankle injury.It had been a chastening experience for the Danes and Andrée Jeglertz with Sweden constantly exploiting the space in behind. This is the first and last major tournament for a manager whose appointment as Manchester City head coach after this campaign was strangely announced on the eve of their opener. He made two changes to the side that had capitulated in Solna. The 24-year-old defender Emma Færge made her Euro debut while Karen Holmgaard slotted into midfield after winning her fitness race.The Stade de Genève proved a stunning location for this encounter. Sweden’s travelling support– known as the Soft Hooligans – made themselves heard behind one goal, decked in yellow and singing renditions of ABBA-based chants.View image in fullscreenSweden fans look to get behind their team in Geneva.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAThe intensity of the play caught the eye with both sides exerting plenty of energy in an end-to-end display. They were each finding joy down their right sides with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Frederikke Thøgersen constant thorns in the side of the full-backs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSweden were controlling the play without creating much when faced by some much-improved Denmark defending. Angeldahl was a threat, however, and created the best opportunity of the first half when she stung the gloves of Maja Bay Østergaard with a sweetly struck free-kick.It was, therefore, of little surprise that it was the 27-year-old who struck 10 minutes after the break. It was the spark Sweden needed as a succession of chances followed although they were unable to make them count.Their inability to extend their lead, however, gave a tiring Denmark hope. A moment of magic from Pernille Harder almost salvaged a point but her curling effort crashed off the woodwork leaving the captain with her head in her hands.Gerhardsson was understandably pleased with his side’s start in a difficult group. “There are always a lot of feelings and emotions in the first match,” he said. “For analysis, you’ll have to join us on the bus. We suspected Denmark would do something different … At half-time we discussed upping the tempo a bit and not allow Denmark any rest.” They will take those positives from the second half in particular when they play Poland next in Lucerne on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Denmark women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

For Wales, this tourist magnet marks the potentially awkward junction between the heady optimism of an exhilarating journey towards their first major tournament and the reality of the formidable challenge posed by Saturday’s opening match against the Netherlands.Perhaps appropriately, Mount Pilatus towers above Stadion Allmend where Wales kick-off their Group D campaign. But the good news for their fans is that Rhian Wilkinson, the head coach, believes mountains are there for climbing. Indeed, Wilkinson clambered up Snowdon before announcing her squad for the tournament on the mountain’s summit last month.England face fiendish path to glory but Euro 2025 is capturing hearts of hostsRead moreWhile she acknowledges reaching the knockout phase would be a feat akin to ascending Everest, there is quiet optimism over Wales’s chances of startling Netherlands.“We hope this is going to be a long tournament,” said the 43-year-old. “Until today it hasn’t felt real, but now I can’t wait for the bus to the game and to watch these women walk on to the field.“This has been a long time coming, but these players are ready to be on the biggest stage and to be tested against some of the world’s best.”If mountain metaphors have been a feature of Wilkinson’s 15 months in charge, the former Canada defender, who led Portland Thorns to the 2022 National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) title, should not be underestimated.Wilkinson was capped 183 times and won two Olympic bronze medals. She describes managing Wales as being “right up there with anything I’ve done in my career”.Well aware that central Europe is often pretty warm in July, Wilkinson prepared her squad with a week’s tough training in Portugal’s Algarve. Uefa observers have been impressed by the intensity of sessions at their base near Lake Constance.By Friday, Wales’s players were deloading, dictating that Jess Fishlock, Sophie Ingle and co contented themselves with a gentle walk around Stadion Allmend.Jess FishlockWhile Wilkinson would not reveal any last-minute fitness doubts – instead insisting onlookers “keep calm, don’t panic” – she did suggest Ingle would begin on the bench after her recovery from an ACL injury.Much, as ever, hinges on the contribution of the 38-year-old Fishlock. As Wilkinson pointed out, the Seattle Reign midfielder “understands space, understands how to connect the pieces and, at her best, is pretty unplayable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jonker, deeply unimpressed by the decision, therefore has something to prove, but his side made heavy weather of qualifying and are widely tipped to struggle in a group also containing England and France.France seeking end to years of hurt and internal conflicts at Euro 2025Read moreA lot probably hinges on whether Vivianne Miedema is properly fit after an injury-punctuated season. A goal against Wales would be the Manchester City striker’s 100th for her country. Yet if Miedema and the Netherlands, 11th in the world rankings, can be contained, Wales, 30th, will have indicated that the international game is levelling up.One of the many good things about Switzerland is that its railways largely utilise a level boarding system. This dictates passengers have no need to negotiate steps up and down to the platform but can simply wheel luggage straight on and off trains. This system makes railway travel more accessible to anyone with restricted mobility, small children or heavy suitcases. Wales, for their part, are intent on showing they are closing the once apparently insurmountable gap between themselves and Europe’s elite.“Success for us is making sure our team shows up,” said Wilkinson. “But we’re here for a reason and I want my players to be confident. I want Wales to show the world who we are.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballNetherlands women's football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Uefa’s judgment included the detail thatChelseawould be forbidden from including new players in their squad for Europe next season and in 2026-27 unless they can show they have generated a cost saving with sale of players against acquisitions.Chelsea have bought Liam Delap for £30m and João Pedro in a deal worth up to £60m. They have agreed a deal to sign the Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens and will add Palmeiras’s Estêvão Willian to their squad after the Club World Cup.

Walker had interest from across the globe but wanted to stay close to his family. Everton were previously interested in signing the defender but Walker has eventually been lured to Burnley.Walker, who has 96 international caps, won 17 trophies during his time with City but was keen for a new challenge last season. Pep Guardiola sanctioned the temporary move to Milan and left him out of the Club World Cup squad, signifying he would not return to the first-team fold once his loan had come to an end.He will become the club’s fourth signing of the summer after fellow defenders Axel Tuanzebe, Quilindschy Hartman and goalkeeper Max Weiss.Meanwhile, Newcastle have agreed a£55m fee with Nottingham Forestfor Anthony Elanga, with the winger set to complete a move to the Champions League side in the coming days.The winger’s personal terms are not thought to be an issue and the signing of the Sweden international will end a year-long pursuit by Eddie Howe.

Three days later the midfielder, who had departed Arsenal after his contract expired, was charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.What happens next with Partey’s career will be determined by the outcome of legal proceedings scheduled to start with his appearance at Westminster magistrates court on 5 August. The allegations relate to three women who reported incidents between 2021 and 2022. Partey denies all the charges and “welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name”, his lawyer said.Thomas Partey, former Arsenal footballer, charged with rape and sexual assaultRead morePartey, 32, had been linked with moves to Spain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia in recent weeks after talks over extending his Arsenal contract hit an impasse, even though Arsenal’s manager, Mikel Arteta, had insisted in May that he wanted him to stay. “Consistency-wise it’s been his best season,” Arteta said. “The way he’s played, performed, his availability, has been exceptional and he’s a really important player for us.”Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in a record fee paid for a Ghanaian player – £45m – in October 2020. He struggled with injuries during his first two seasons at the Emirates but became a regular during the 2022-23 campaign when Arsenal finished as runners-up behind Manchester City. A hamstring injury in November 2023 kept Partey out for most of the following season before he emerged as a key performer last season at the base of Arsenal’s midfield.The impending arrival of Martín Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a £51m deal that has been in the pipeline since January affected Partey’s status as a first choice, with the Spain international expected to line up alongside Martin Ødegaard and Declan Rice in a recalibrated midfield.Partey is understood to have been offered a new deal on slightly reduced terms and confirmation of his departure came with Arsenal having agreed a fee that could rise to £15m to bring in Brentford’s Christian Nørgaard as his replacement. Partey made 52 appearances last season. Arsenal will face questions about whether it was appropriate for him to have continued playing while being investigated by the police over such serious allegations.Partey moved to Europe after being spotted playing for Ashaiman Revelation FC in Accra as a teenager. “I played for them until I was 18, which is when I moved to Spain,” Parteytold Arsenal’s website. “But that was the club I grew up at as a footballer. We had a good, young, talented team at the time, and I still have a few mates from that time who are now playing elsewhere in Europe. They are not at the very top now but they are still playing and I still talk with them a lot.”He was encouraged to attend trials in Spain by his father, who coached him as a junior, and joined Leganés before moving to Atlético in 2012. The tough-tackling player was sent on loan to Mallorca and Almería before eventually making his debut for Diego Simeone’s side in 2015. He made almost 200 appearances for Atlético and was part of the side beaten in the 2016 Champions League final by Real Madrid before winning the Europa League two years later.Partey has played 52 times for his country, scoring nine goals. Ghana confirmed last month that Partey had been “given a break by head coach Otto Addo” after he wasn’t included in their squad for the Unity Cup tournament in London. He also missed their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Angola and Niger last November after holding “confidential” talks with Addo.Partey has represented Ghana at three Afcon finals and the 2022 World Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stages. He remains one of the country’s most famous figures.Explore more on these topicsFootballprofilesShareReuse this content"

His career has largely been a runaway success ever since, to the extent that Forbes named him the world’s top sports agent in 2019, when he negotiated $1.42bn (£1.04bn) in active contracts and transfer fees.The following year Stellar was sold to the American entertainment agency ICM Partners, before it in turn was acquired by the Hollywood giants Creative Artists Agency in a deal worth a reported $750m. Within 12 months CAA had been ranked as the world’s most valuable sports agency on Forbes’ 2022 list.After the CAA acquisition Barnett stayed to run the football division as executive chair of CAA Stellar before stepping down in February 2024.Barnett faces allegationshe “trafficked” a woman from Australia to the UK in 2017and kept her as a “sex slave”. Barnett denies the allegations. CAA said it first learned of the allegations in January 2024.Football made him wealthy but Barnett’s initial move away from his family’s casino business, the Curzon House Group, was in advising promising heavyweight boxer Lennox Lewis to pursue a professional career. Stellar’s first clients were the Pakistan cricketers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis during their controversial 1992 tour of England, but it was West Indian Brian Lara who helped them really make their mark.Barnett and Manasseh helped arrange Lara’s move to Warwickshire shortly before he scored a then world-record 375 against England in Antigua in April 1994, and two months later he broke the record for the highest first class score by scoring 501 not out for his new county against Durham. “We were the best at that [cricket] in a short time, but there was no money,” Barnett said in an interview with ESPN in 2017.View image in fullscreenJonathan Barnett is best known as a football agent but has been involved in a variety of sports.Photograph: Peter Luckhurst/ShutterstockSuch brashness was typical of Barnett’s professional style, although it was allied to a work ethic that delivered his big break and also underpinned Stellar’s relentless rise to represent 600 footballers at their peak a decade ago. He was also polite and approachable when on business, ending phone calls with the words “God bless!”As Stellar was growing other agents reported with a mixture of bewilderment and awe that Barnett was never in his Hyde Park office and appeared to live in his Bentley, driving around the country to watch youth-team fixtures and reserve games in the hope signing the best up-and-coming talent. One day trip to Chesterfield for an England Under-18 game in the mid-1990s was particularly productive, as he returned to London with agreements to represent two future senior England internationals, Ashley Cole and Ledley King.Volume and youth soon became the company’s modus operandi, with Barnett once estimating that 95% of Stellar’s ever-growing players had signed for them before the age of 18. Unlike other agents Barnett rarely showed any interest in representing managers, instead focusing on securing the best youngsters with increasing success.From the late 1990s onwards almost every England squad contained several of Barnett’s players, including players such as Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe, Kieron Dyer, Darren Bent, Mason Mount and Ben Chilwell. Following the American buyouts they have remained dominant, with current England stars Jordan Pickford, Jack Grealish, Ivan Toney and Dean Henderson on the company’s books, while Manasseh negotiatedLiam Delap’s £30m movefrom Ipswich to Chelsea last month. As the game has globalised CAA Stellar’s fleet of Bentleys has been replaced by private jets, with their agents flying all over Europe and more recently to Saudi Arabia to seal transfer deals.The biggest deal of Barnett’s career was Gareth Bale’s £85.3m transfer from Tottenham to Real Madrid in 2013, then a world record. The Wales international’s move to Tottenham was also brokered by Barnett, who had represented him since he was on a schoolboy contract at Southampton.While Bale won 16 trophies including three La Liga titles and five Champions Leagues at Real his time at the Bernabéu ended sourly, not helped by a very public argument between Barnett and the club’s manager Zinedine Zidane, who he accused of freezing Bale out.View image in fullscreenZinedine Zidane, the then Real Madrid manager, was criticised by Barnett in 2019.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThat row was not the first time Barnett attracted controversy in a colourful career. In 2006 he was banned from working as an agent for nine months by the FA for being found guilty of orchestrating a meeting between Cole and the Chelsea manager José Mourinho, when the player was under contract to Arsenal. The fallout damaged Cole’s relationship with Arsenal and he subsequently signed for Chelsea anyway.After dabbling with the then-growing Chinese market, holding talks about selling Stellar to the Rastar Group in 2016, Barnett focused on expansion in the US. Repeated attempts to recruit NFL players brought only occasional successes, but repeatedly touring the US ultimately led to the ICM and CAA sales.Explore more on these topicsFootball agentsprofilesShareReuse this content"

I won last time on grass, but very different grass, in different circumstances. So, you know, it’ll be a new day,” said the 31-year-old Sydneysider.Earlier, Rinky Hijikata’s hopes of pulling off the greatest of Wimbledon escapes against American big-hitter Ben Sheltonlasted less than a minutewhen the pair resumed their match after it had been controversially suspended on Thursday evening.Hijikata had got the unexpected chance to live to fight another day after saving three match points and then being reprieved by a controversial postponement of play on Thursday night amid farcical scenes as darkness descended.View image in fullscreenBen Shelton, left, shakes hands with Australia’s Rinky Hijikata.Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty ImagesBut when the match resumed on No 2 Court in the Friday afternoon sunshine with No 10 seed Shelton serving for the match, everyone could see the funny side once he won all four points in just 55 seconds, including three booming aces, to complete the straightforward 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 victory in two hours 12 minutes.Sydneysider Hijikata, who had been unable to dent the two-time grand semi-finalist’s delivery all match, grinned ruefully as any chance of him becoming the fourth Australian to qualify for the third round was blasted away.Hijikata, who had in the last game on Thursday saved three match points to extend the match, paid tribute to Shelton.“Last night’s experience was bizarre … but that was probably an absolute clinic on how to serve out a match if you’ve got one game to go,” said Hijikata. “Yeah, credit to him. It’s not easy to come out and serve out a match when you have a bit of pressure and you’ve had the night off. I thought it was bloody good effort by him.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025TennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That precipitated a collapse as England slumped from 387 for five to 407 all out.Jamie Smith’s sensational century gives England hope but India seize their momentRead more“I’ve never had it before,” Brook said of the cramping. “It was probably the death of me at the end. I was knackered. It probably didn’t help that we fielded for two full days and then I batted for nearly a full day. It wasn’t ideal. I’m very tired now.”Between them Brook and Smith accounted for 84% of England’s first-innings runs, scoring 158 and 184 respectively when six of their teammates got ducks and none scored more than 22. India then reached stumps on 64 for one to hold a lead of 244. “Hopefully we’ve clawed ourselves back into the game,” Brook said. “I just tried to bat as long as I could. If I hadn’t got out we wouldn’t be in this situation now, but we saw [at Headingley] last week how quickly it can change. India are in the driving seat but hopefully we can put pressure with early wickets and make them crumble.”Brook said he was motivated by memories of the first match of the series, when he was dismissed without scoring in England’s second innings – “I was off the back of a golden duck so I just wanted to get off the mark,” he said of his somewhat wild approach when he first came in on Thursday – and for 99, having been dropped while yet to score, in their first.“I was definitely hungry to get a hundred today,” he said. “Obviously with the situation of the game, we were behind the eight-ball and to try to get the momentum to swing back in our favour, along with Smudge, was a good moment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We didn’t get it quite right tonight. Hopefully we can do that tomorrow morning. There’s plenty of wickets to be had out there.”Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Harry BrookEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The Brazilian side, who entered the tournament as one of the biggest long shots, will now face the winners of Friday’s other quarter-final clash between Palmeiras and Chelsea.Fluminense opened the scoring when João Cancelo failed to clear his line, allowing Gabriel Fuentes to roll the ball to Martinelli who brilliantly picked out the far post with a left-footed strike into the top right corner.“Many people didn’t believe in our potential, in our team but each game and each step we proved we can be tough,” said Martinelli, who will miss the semi-final after picking up a yellow card shortly after his goal. When we step on the pitch it’s difficult to beat our team.”During first-half stoppage time, a rising Kalidou Koulibaly headed the ball on target but a fully-stretched Fabio used his left hand to swat it away and keep Fluminense in front.Al-Hilal made a quick start to the second half and drew level after a cushioned header from a wide-open Koulibaly hit the legs of Leonardo, who quickly reset his feet and fired home from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, she was 5-2 up in the final set against Jasmine Paolini in the fourth round only to pull her hamstring, watching on in disappointment as the Italian reached the final. In 2022, she missed Wimbledon altogether due to an abdominal injury.Winningthe Australian Open in Januaryfor her first grand slam title was meant to free her up, perhaps marking a turn in fortunes, but on Friday she was beaten 6-3, 6-3 by the 37-year-old Laura Siegemund. A couple of hours later, reporters were informed that the American would not be doing her mandatory press conference due to illness.Wimbledon 2025: Alcaraz in action, Norrie, Kartal and Fritz win, Keys and Osaka out – liveRead moreKeys had struggled through her opening two matches and, whatever the reason, she was well below par against Siegemund. The German can get under the skin of her opponents at the best of times, her drop shots outstanding and the strength of her grunting at the louder end of the spectrum, and Keys looked out of sorts from the start.In all, the sixth seed sprayed 31 unforced errors in two sets, threw in four double faults and won just one point from 19 on her second serve. Siegemund took full advantage, becoming the oldest woman in the open era to reach the last 16 at Wimbledon for the first time, testament to the longevity and perseverance of a player who lost 10 times in qualifying at slams before making the main draw here for the first time in 2015.“You can’t not be happy when you beat a great player like Madison,” said Siegemund, who will now playKatie Boulter’s conqueror, the lucky loser Solana Sierra from Argentina. “It was not easy today, it was quite windy and swirly, at times it wasn’t the best quality. But I managed and in the end I found solutions and kept my nerves.”Keys was not the only big name to fall.Naomi Osakahad been showing good improvement on grass this year but was worn down 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 by Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Osaka fought back from 3-0 down to level at 3-3 in the decider but could not force it home.View image in fullscreenNaomi Osaka is happy with her grass-court improvements but disappointed by her exit.Photograph: John Patrick Fletcher/Action Plus/Shutterstock“Right now I’m just really upset,” Osaka said, asked to sum up her thoughts on the short grass-court season. “I think if I look back on it, I can be happy with how I played. I started getting a lot more comfortable on grass.“It’s because I actually thought I could play well in general. Not saying I didn’t play well, but make a deep run here. I wanted to do better than I did before. Also, I felt like I was trying so hard.

The players had been in discussion with the umpire, Nacho Forcadell, earlier in the set to see if the match could be suspended because the court was becoming slippery, but the pair played on until the announcement was made at 5-4, prompting jeers from the crowd.Wimbledon 2025: Kartal beats Parry; Norrie and Fritz in action, Keys and Osaka out – liveRead moreThe All England Club said the match had been called off because of fading light, while Shelton said he had been given a “five-minute warning until the Hawk-Eye was going down”.“That was including the changeover, so [he said] there wouldn’t be enough time to complete the game. I was telling him: ‘I only need 60 seconds’. That’s kind of what my goal was today.”Shelton said the umpire had told him he did not want the line-calling system to go down in the middle of a game. “At that point I’m not as upset about that decision. It was a difficult decision that was forced because of what they did earlier.”When the match was called off, the supervisor spread his arms as Shelton shaped to approach the umpire, blocking his path to the chair. “I don’t think I ever get disrespectful on the court,” he said. “I try to get my point across.“I guess when he saw a guy my size walking quickly towards the umpire, maybe he thought I was ready to throw hands or something. I definitely wasn’t.“I guess maybe I should apologise to Nacho if he felt scared up in the chair. I was upset in the moment. I wanted to get my point across. I think he was just trying to kind of defuse [the situation] and keep me away from Nacho. I got over it pretty quickly, and then we talked in the gym after.“I just wanted to give them my thoughts about the situation. They gave me theirs on why everything happened. It didn’t really escalate. It probably looked more tense than it was, the whole holding back or staying in front of me. It was nothing.”View image in fullscreenBen Shelton speaks with officials after play was suspended on Thursday due to darkness against Rinky Hijikata.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesDespite the brevity of action on Friday, Shelton said he had been ready to play two and a half sets if necessary and denied he had wanted to send a message by finishing things off so quickly.“The only thing I was thinking about today was holding serve, how I was going to hold serve, and putting it in my mind that it was going to be tough and he was going to make every return, and I was going to have to come up with stuff from the baseline or the net,” he said.“It ended up looking that way because of how it turned out, but that was not in my head at all. I wasn’t trying to do anything. I was just competing, trying to win the match.”Shelton will play Marton Fucsovics next after the Hungarian beat Gaël Monfils in five sets, in another match held over.The defending champion, Carlos Alcaraz, took his winning streak to 21 matches with a hard-fought 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany. The big-serving Struff took a set for the fourth time in their four meetings, but Alcaraz always had something in hand, breaking in the ninth game of the fourth set and serving out to set up a last-16 contest with Andrey Rublev of Russia.“I knew this would be very difficult,” the No 2 seed said. “His game is very well-suited to grass. I’m just pleased to get the win in four sets. It was stressful.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonUS sportsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

At the end of last year, ATI employed 440 staff, but it has since launched a redundancy process.Although the institute is nominally independent, it recently secured £100m from the government in a five-year funding deal. The letter said ATI’s “longer-term funding arrangement” could be reviewed next year. The government would maintain its current level of research and development from national security and defence for the next three years, Kyle wrote, and would increase the number of defence and national security staff embedded in the institute.Dame Wendy Hall, a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton and the co-chair of a 2017 government AI review, said ATI would cease to be a national institute under the government’s proposed changes.“If the institute focuses on defence and security it ceases to be a national institute on AI,” Hall said. “It’s not broad enough. If the government wants an AI institute that does defence and security then it should just call it that.”In February, the government indicated a focus on national security with its AI strategy by renaming its AI Safety Institute, established under the premiership of Rishi Sunak, the AI Security Institute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s no way the chalk would have showed that. I guess it cannot be 100% accurate – it’s millimetres.”He said it was a shame that umpires were no longer involved, before conceding he had probably been wrong to complain about a particular call.Jack Draper knocked out of Wimbledon by inspired comeback kid Marin CilicRead moreJamie Baker, the tournament director, defended the accuracy of the system and refused to say whether he missed human line judges, who have been part of Wimbledon’s history for 147 years.Baker said: “The concept of live line calling is absolutely standard across the tour now – mandatory across the ATP tour. Two of the other grand slams have had it for four or five years.“What that has meant also actually [is] that the level of sophistication and certification around the system has become more professional and more robust as time has gone on.“The accuracy and the reliability and the robustness of the system and the process as a whole, in terms of officiating, is in as good a place as it has been for tennis.”Baker denied the electronic system had been a factor in the decision to suspend Ben Shelton’s second-round encounter as the 22-year-old American was serving for the match.Shelton, the world No 10, was furious at the umpire’s decision, which came at 9.31pm as daylight was fading. Baker said the decision was not due to the technology, which he said allowed matches to be played later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it was getting close. And so, again, that’s us managing the risk.“One thing I will say with the way that the technology has moved on, but also the number of cameras on each court, is that we’re actually able to play a lot later than we had done in the past with the challenge system.”Baker said players had been told in the past they could continue play during fading daylight but then could not make challenges.“Sometimes the players didn’t like that, sometimes they did,” he said. “But actually, we have a lot more time now that we can push matches out. But last night, it was getting close, but we hadn’t quite reached that.“It was more of a rounded decision where at some point, it’s a top-level sport, playing at very high speeds, to be playing when it was that dark, the officials just didn’t feel comfortable with it.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Artificial intelligence (AI)Jack DraperWimbledonTennisEnglandMarin CilicnewsShareReuse this content"

My daughter told me I would love it and I ignored her for too long. I’ve tackled Elden Ring, but much prefer the often gentler combat of Enshrouded. It sometimes makes me feel like an elite fighter, then other times kicks my arse in precisely the right measures.Its real joy is the flexibility to spend your time doing whatever tickles your fancy. I’ll spend a few hours growing crops to make a cake or smelting metals for better armour, then knock off a few quests to unlock new materials and weapons. But mainly my goal is to complete the ludicrously large plans I have for a castle or village perched on top of a mountain. Most of all, though, the visuals are glorious. From the deep forests, to the deserts to snow-capped mountains, just a feast for the eyes. When the sun sets and the light hits the shroud just right it’s one of the most stunning things I’ve seen in gaming.Paul, SouthendStalker 2There are no other games like the Stalker series. Stalker 2 is utterly immersive, a survival epic with a riveting backdrop loosely based on the Stalker film (another riveting experience) and the Chornobyl incident. This is a complete rebuild in a modern game engine of the first Stalker game, with updated graphics and interactivity, but the same familiar places. There’s a new story too. Not only does it have the same feel as the original Stalker, it also has many familiar bugs. I’ve been playing computer games since Labyrinth in 1978 and Stalker is the most charismatic of them all. Purchasing it also gives a small boost to the Ukrainian game studio.James, SpainView image in fullscreenUtterly immersive … Stalker 2.Photograph: GSC Game WorldStories from Sol: The Gun DogThis is my highlight from 2025 so far. I love the art style and music. But it is the three-dimensional characters who make it my favourite. They pull you into the story; I really felt an emotional connection to them, although you get to spend more time with some than others. They left me wanting to know more. I can’t wait to see what Space Colony Studios does next.Miranda, CardiffView image in fullscreenEmotional connection … Stories from Sol: The Gun Dog.Photograph: Space Colony StudiosIndiana Jones and the Great CircleStray comes a close second, and Atomfall was a lot of fun, but Indiana Jones was about as close to perfect as I could ask for. Not too long – with two kids and a busy job, I don’t have time for sprawling open-world RPGs any more, but there was enough of an open-world flavour to keep me satisfied. The missions were fun, and very Indiana Jones in terms of style and problem solving. Having the boulder scene from Raiders as the prologue was a touch of genius. And let’s be honest, with the excellent sound effects, you could never tire of punching Nazis.Rob, EdinburghFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals TimeI have been enjoying Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. It is a great mix of open-world exploration, with so much to do and often the game encourages you to explore different lives to get better equipment for exploration. Coupled with a charming art style and a great multiplayer community, I can see myself only further extending my 80 hours in the game.Jonathan, Edenbridge, KentView image in fullscreenSo much to do … Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time.Photograph: Level 5 IncThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion RemasteredI loved the remastered Oblivion,it’s rare that a less-than-beautiful game from your childhood gets re-released as a beautiful remaster. The gameplay holds up, and all of the quirks that made me love the original game remain. During these quite difficult political times it’s nice to escape into a Lord of the Rings-esque world full of dungeons and lighthearted characters. Even the sequel to Oblivion, Skyrim, feels slightly too serious for these serious times. The biggest reason it was my favourite wasn’t because of the gameplay or even the gorgeous new graphics. I got my partner Emily into gaming a few years back – watching her discover the world of Oblivion brought me back to when I first played it, and I enjoyed watching her discover the fantasy world more than I enjoyed it myself.Jack, BathAvowedI loved Avowed. It came out of nowhere for me, I hadn’t seen any of the publicity leading up to it, but it was just so brilliant to play a mid-sized RPG. Much as I love the enormous sandbox genre, it feels like so many games now want to be the next Skyrim. Avowed took the opposite route, it set you on rails and it focused on the systems it wanted to do really well rather than trying to do everything. The combat, the exploration and the writing were all top-notch.Isobel, LondonView image in fullscreenStory, story, story … Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.Photograph: Warhorse Studios/Deep SilverKingdom Come: Deliverance 2This one is easy for me. It’s all about story, story, story. I have a rule about buying games these days: I wait one month before I consider the purchase. I let everyone else play test the game then make a decision. With all its quirks, KCD2’s story overrides any small bugs or oddities you may experience. I didn’t experience any issues, I was immersed in the story of my Henry and being lost in a world where all my emotional buttons were being pushed. With all that going on, moving through the story was exciting and more so when the big quests finished or act changes occurred. It’s a game that kept revealing itself right up to the last point where you are on a hill talking to your departed parents. It is here that you now realise that you were truly playing and guiding the story of Henry. The choices you made mattered. It’s not until after playing that you can ultimately decide if it was all worth it, good or bad.

But despair is not a strategy: this is a moment to create changeFri 4 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareThe Fourth of July celebration of freedom rings hollow this year. The contradictions built into a national commemoration of our triumph over autocracy feel newly personal and perilous – especially to those who have, until now, felt relatively secure in the federal government’s commitment to democracy and the rule of law.But the contradiction is far from new. Black, brown and Indigenous communities have always seen the gap between the ideals of American democracy and the lived reality of exclusion. Frederick Douglass’s 1852 address What to the Slave is the Fourth of July? demanded that Americans confront the hypocrisy of celebrating liberty while millions were enslaved. Today, those contradictions persist in enduring racial disparities and policies that perpetuate segregation, second-class citizenship and selective protection of rights.And just as the nation seemed to be inching toward reckoning and repair, we are now witnessing a dangerous backslide. Our federal government is increasingly hostile to even the mention of race and racism, actively dismantling protections that were hard-won over decades. Each day brings new signs of an anti-democratic campaign –eroding civil rights, stoking racial division and weaponizing law to silence dissent and disempower communities. This inversion of democracy – where power flows upward, not outward – is bold and widespread.The chilling effects of federal overreach touch everyone. People of all races, backgrounds and positions have lost jobs, funding, and trust in institutions once seen as pillars of democracy. The backlash has laid bare a truth long familiar to marginalized communities: that America’s stated ideals often fail to match its realities.Still, despair is not a strategy. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It is built – and rebuilt – by people who show up in their communities, workplaces, schools and congregations, determined to make freedom real. The most powerful response we see is not top-down, but grassroots: people choosing to act, even in small ways, to defend democracy from where they stand.We write as three legal professionals – of different racial identities, vantage points, and approaches to justice – but united in our understanding of the urgency of this moment to ask a question that may feel counterintuitive to those trained in the law: What can people do to advance democracy and equity outside of the courts?First, we must not retreat. Rather, we must overcome our disillusionment, disheartenment and exhaustion and recognize our linked fate across race, class, generation and geography. Authoritarianism thrives on disengagement and disconnection.One way to remain connected and energized is recognizing that this moment of transition is also an opportunity to transform our democracy. We can envision the future we want, untethered from the limitations of the current moment. Then, from the vantage point of this future, assuming it has been achieved, we can ask ourselves what we did today to make that vision a reality. This perspective avoids asking “what should we do”, which limits us to thinking within our current circumstances,instead asking“what did we do”, which allows us to think beyond our current challenges and limitations and instead create new opportunities and possibilities.From the vantage point of the future, we can ask: where can I connect today? Where can I act today? What kind of change agent am I willing to be today to create the future I envision?Here are some ideas:We can engage those directly affected by injustice in the decisions that shape their lives. We must pay attention to who is thriving – and who isn’t – in our institutions, and do the hard work of reimagining our institutions and systems. That is democracy in action.One model comes from two Columbia Law students engaging high schoolers in Harlem and Queens to learn how local government works – a first step toward civic participation and transformation. Another comes from the artist-activist Tonika Johnson’s Folded Map project, which paired Black South Side Chicago residents with their white North Side “map twins” to explore stark neighborhood inequities. The project fostered real relationships, cross-racial learning and grassroots coalitions, while exposing the systemic racism behind dramatic disparities in infrastructure and investment.There is work happening under the radar, too. On campuses where formal DEI efforts have been banned or gutted, faculty and staff are creating informal coalitions to sustain equity-focused collaboration and resist institutional amnesia. In several states, even court systems are taking action, building partnerships between judges, lawyers and communities to address racial disparities in access to justice.Sometimes the opportunity for transformation comes in a policy window. In Indianapolis, the state’s plan to rebuild a major highway became a chance for the Rethink Coalition to shift the conversation – from road engineering to community renewal. Their vision? A process and outcome centered on repairing the harm done to historically Black neighborhoods when the highway was first built. But what made that vision powerful was not just the idea, it was the strategy. Rethink helped put tools, data and technical expertise directly into the hands of community members so they could fully engage in reshaping the project. By democratizing access to planning knowledge, they ensured that residents were not just consulted, but empowered to lead. That’s what it means to build toward the future now.This is the kind of work that keeps us grounded in radical hope – a belief in the possibility of transformation against the odds. It is the practice of democracy, not just its theory. And it’s available to all of us.As the attacks grow louder, more coordinated, more entrenched, we must be even more committed to acting where we are – with whoever we can – to not only defend the fragile, unfinished project of building a multiracial democracy, but to take the time to dream about what our more robust democracy would look like, and then to take the next best step in that direction, undeterred by the current moment.If enough of us engage – across differences and at every level – these efforts can add up to a reimagined nation. One that finally lives up to its promises. One that, someday soon, we can celebrate without contradiction.Deborah N Archer is the president of the ACLU, the Margaret B Hoppin professor of law at NYU Law School, and the author of Dividing Lines: How Transportation Infrastructure Reinforces Racial Inequality.L Song Richardson is the former dean and currently chancellor’s professor of law at the University of California Irvine School of Law.

The political system the flag and the parades and fireworks are supposed to represent is in tatters, but everybody likes a party. It was 249 years ago, when the United States separated from the British Empire. Over the past year it has separated from the world order it built over those 249 years, and from basic sanity and decency as well. For Americans, the madness gripping their country is a catastrophe. For non-Americans, it is an accidental revolution. This Independence Day, the world is declaring its independence from theUS.As the United States retreats from the world, it is reshaping the lives of its former trading partners and allies, leaving huge holes in its wake. For Canada, where I live, the sudden absence of a responsible United States has been more shocking and more terrifying than for other countries. Americans are our friends and neighbours, often our family. We have been at peace with them for 200 years, integrating with their security apparatuses and markets. Now they are explicitly planning to weaken us economically in order to annex us.The Canadian strategy, undertaken with vigor by the newly elected government of Mark Carney, has been clear in spirit at least: a polite “go fuck yourself.” After you’ve told America to fuck off, though, the real work starts. You have to figure out how to live without them.Carney has already signed major pieces of legislation to lower trade barriers inside the country, to create new trading partners, and to cement security arrangements with the European Union. But those are only the obvious beginnings. Since Donald Trump’s inauguration, I have been working onGloves Off, an audio series trying to figure out how Canada can navigate the post-American world. I’ve been shocked by how much needs to be done. Canada is like a beautiful mansion with huge chunks of the foundation missing. We don’t even have our own secret service, just an internal security apparatus. Our military would be comically unprepared for an American annexation. Large scale-changes to national life – becoming a nuclear power, undertaking a whole society defense – may be required to survive a neighbour who is backsliding into authoritarianism every week.Under protection from America, under the assumption that its economy was globally dominant, Canada has never had to ask itself hard questions. Now we’re facing a pop quiz with terrifying consequences.The decline of America leaves a psychological gap, too. America, for all its problems, was aspirational. It was easy to poke holes in its claims to exceptionalism, but it genuinely served millions of people, myself definitely included, as a beacon of freedom and openness. But I keep thinking of that line from No Country for Old Men, just before Anton Chigurh kills Carson Wells in a hotel: “If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?”Its great founders knew America’s vulnerabilities from inception. Washington predicted, almost exactly, the effects of partisanship the country is undergoing today: “The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism,” he wrote in his Farewell Address. “But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism.” Abraham Lincoln saw it all coming: “If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.” The suicide is tackier than anyone imagined, but it’s been predicted since 1776.One of the great ironies of history is that the triumph of Maga has led to the piecemeal destruction of everything that once made America great, and on every level. Its power derived from a reliable trade network, with logistical chains that were the wonders of the world, combined with a huge alliance network, and the greatest scientific and technological institutes in the world. It is systematically destroying all of those strengths far more thoroughly than any enemy could.America is turning away from itself, and the rest of the world must follow. The new independence requires frankness, even brutality. There is no such thing as a deal with America any more. Canada and Mexico made one with Trump in 2018. He broke it at the first possible opportunity. Their national word is worthless. They understand only force and money, and increasingly not even those. Their military actions are more or less random, half-considered, about as deep and significant as a social media rage post. They instantly forget who helped or hurt them. All those Afghans who saved American lives a decade ago have lived to regret it, being deported, just for the spectacle of it all, back to their torturers. There is exactly no security in being their ally. If the American government declares war on something – poverty, drugs, Islamic terrorism, anti-democratic governments – you can be quite sure that whatever they’re opposed to will be much stronger by the end of the fighting.US scholars of fascism are fleeing to Toronto, and the city has become a kind of lens through which to see the American collapse. Canada sees what America is becoming. Travel from Canada to the United States is down 45% year over year which is partly a political statement by way of boycott, but it’s also a demonstration of common sense: America has made it perfectly clear that foreigners are unwelcome and subject to violence with total impunity. But the simplest way to explain the need to step away from the United States is the most basic: no problem the world faces has an answer that can be found in America. Not politically, not economically, not socially, not culturally.It is clear that we have to start looking for answers to the world’s problems elsewhere, in ourselves and in others. There is a celebration of independence this Independence Day and it is real; it’s just for countries other than America. The lesson the Americans once taught the British, they are teaching the rest of the world: there are no necessary nations. There are no exceptional countries. There are no permanent global orders. There’s just more history, and trying to survive to stay yourself it.Stephen Marche lives in Toronto and is the author of The Next Civil War and On Writing and FailureExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But Republicans will follow their leader anywhereFri 4 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 13.07 EDTShareThe budget reconciliation bill that passed the US House of Representatives on Thursday and was promptly to be signed into law byDonald Trumprepresents the particular perversity of national politics in America: seemingly no one wants it, everyone hates it, and it is widely agreed to be devastating for staggering numbers of Americans. And yet, the bill felt inevitable: it was a foregone conclusion that this massive, malignant measure was something that everyone dreaded and no one had the capacity to stop.They didn’t really even try. In the Senate, a few conservative Republicans made noise about the bill’s dramatic costs: the congressional budget office estimates that the bill willadd $3.3 tnto the deficit over the coming decade, and the senator Rand Paul, a budget hawk from Kentucky, declined to vote for it for this reason. But other Republicans, who used to style themselves as fiscally responsible guardians against excessive government spending, engaged in a bit of freelance creative accounting in order to produce an estimate that falsely claimed the cost of the bill would be lower. Most of them quickly found themselves on board.Moderate Republicans, or what remain of them, also quickly quit the field. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina facing down an uncertain re-election bid, expressed concerns about the bill’s massive cuts to Medicaid, the federal low-income healthcare program on which many Americans – and many of his constituents – rely. When Donald Trump threatened to secure a primary challenge to Tillis in retaliation, the senator announced that he would not seek re-election after all; he voted against the bill, but also ended his political career. Susan Collins, of Maine – she of the perennial “concern” about the sadistic Republican agendas that she continues to support – made a rare departure from her usual formula and voted against the bill, a move that came close on the heels of polling showing her dismal approval rating among her constituents. That left just Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, who agreed to play ball: she would vote for the bill, which she had publicly disparaged, in exchange for some money for her state. The result was that Alaska will be exempted, at least temporarily, fromnew rules associated withthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Snap, which helps low-income Americans buy enough food to keep themselves alive. Republicans threw in a tax deduction for Alaskan whaling captains – of all things – and with that, her vote was secured.It will make us sicker, poorer, more fearful, more ignorant and more endangered. It will make the rich, meanwhile, even richerWhen the bill was sent to the House, a handful ofRepublicansthreatened to withhold their votes over budget and Medicaid concerns. But no one believed them. They were always going to cave, abandon their stated principles and follow Trump’s orders, and they did. Trump, after all, had said that he wanted the bill passed in time for the Fourth of July; it passed on the third. He says jump, and the Congress asks: How high?They do so even when the demands that Trump makes are morally grotesque. The bill will devastate Americans. Its massive cuts to Medicaid, combined with expiring Obamacare subsidies, will result in an estimated17 million Americanslosing health coverage over the next 10 years, effectively undoing the expansion of healthcare coverage that was achieved with Barack Obama’s health law.Cuts to Snapare so profound that they cannot be made up with additional state spending; some people who are eating today because they have food assistance will go hungry in the future. There are deep cuts to federal loans and grants for college students, and a near-reversal of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act’s investments in green energy, with tax breaks now going to climate-damaging sectors like coal and oil instead. Because the bill creates a dramatic budget deficit, law requires that Medicare, the healthcare program for seniors,will face cuts, too.All of this is to say nothing of the downstream effects of the legislation. The steep cuts to Medicaid, in particular, will devastate America’s already fragile and partial healthcare system. Planned Parenthood is now excluded from federal Medicaid dollars, meaning thatabout 200of its roughly 600 clinics will probably have to close, making abortion less accessible even in states where it is legal, and putting contraception and STD and cancer screenings out of reach for untold numbers of American women. Many rural hospitals will likely have to close, too, along with nursing homes. Those healthcare clinics that remain will have longer wait times and more crowding, and offer more expensive care. Ultimately, fewer people will be going to the doctor, and more of them will suffer and die needlessly of treatable and preventable conditions.But the bill does have winners. It has been called, among other things, the largest tax cut in the nation’s history, although the benefit is disproportionately to billionaires. The budget of Ice, Trump’s anti-immigrant secret police force, is also expanded exponentially: from $3.5bn to $48.5bn, making it the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, though still no more accountable.Trump is steamrolling congressional Republicans. What’s in it for them? | David KirpRead moreThe bill, in other words, steals from the sick, the elderly, the hungry and the curious, and gives that plundered loot to billionaires and jackboots. It will warp American life – already sickly and impoverished by the standards of our peer nations – in cruel and enfeebling ways. It will make us sicker, poorer, more fearful, more ignorant and more endangered. It will make the rich, meanwhile, even richer.Why are Republicans voting for a bill that will hurt their own constituents? A bill that undermines their stated values and threatens their careers and will immiserate people they care about – if only themselves?One of the more confounding aspects of the Trump era is his ability to vacate what the constitution’s authors – and indeed most reasonable adults – would have assumed would be a defining feature of the contest among the branches: self-interest. Republicans will follow him anywhere, even to unpopular votes, even to self-sabotage, and frequently to the diminishment of their own branch’s relevance. Some say that now, he is leading them to a midterm defeat. Democrats made a show of their opposition to the bill – in the minority, shows are about all they can accomplish – with the minority leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering an eight-and-a-half-hour, filibuster-style speech on the floor telling the stories of Americans who will be hurt by the legislation, laying out the bill’s cruelty and recklessness. But you could also detect a hint of pleasure in his voice as he read out the testimonies of Americans who live in what the Democrats see as particularly vulnerable districts for Republicans in 2026.The bill is unpopular now, and it is likely to become much more so as the full breadth of its cuts to social services, and its impacts on Americans seeking to get healthcare, buy food, secure an environmentally livable future or go to school, become clear. Many of the politicians who ultimately voted for it criticized it sharply just days or hours before. They will be attacked about this in the midterms: the suffering that the bill will cause will be cut into television and social media ads and played incessantly on networks in what the Democrats believe are winnable districts. But it is unclear, in the end, if hurting Americans, including their own voters, really will come back to bite the Republican party. It hasn’t for a long time.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS CongressOpinionDonald TrumpUS healthcareRepublicansUS taxationUS SenateHouse of RepresentativescommentShareReuse this content"

Now Trump is weaponizing themJules BoykoffAs the IOC ushers in new leadership, Donald Trump’s second term is already wreaking havoc on LA 28 – and turning a global celebration into a national security crackdownFri 4 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 05.50 EDTShareWhen the International Olympic Committee first handed Los Angeles the 2028 Summer Olympics back in 2017, IOC president Thomas Bachcalledit “a golden opportunity” for all involved. Fast forward to last month when Kirsty Coventrytookthe reins from Bach at the IOC. So much has changed.In January, LA was hit with deadly wildfires. That same month a different sort of natural disaster took shape as Donald Trump returned to the White House. Bach had previouslypraisedLA for its “strong foundation”, but that foundation has crumbled under the weight of the wildfires, a citywidebudget crisisand an erratic president whose marauding Immigration and Customs Enforcementlooklike they arrived straight from robbing a liquor store to instill fear across Los Angeles.The LA28 Olympics are now a slow-motion train wreck.Just ahead of his inauguration, TrumpassuredCasey Wasserman, the chair of the LA28 Olympic Organizing Committee, that “These are America’s Olympics,” adding, “These are more important than ever to LA and I’m going to be supportive in every way possible and make them the greatest Games.” Then, in March, speaking to the IOC, Wassermaninsistedthat “irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics.” He added, “LA is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.”On one hand, that may be true. Trump is not likely to squander an opportunity to engage insportswashing: using sports to self-aggrandize on the global stage while stoking nationalism, bolstering the state security apparatus and deflecting attention from domestic social problems. Trumpfrequently yammersabout how the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics and the 2026 World Cup are among the events in his second term that gets his fascist heart a-tittering the quickest. Staging the mega-events is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to appear important on the world stage. Moreover, during Trump’s first term, heassuredLA28 Olympic organizers that the federal government would supply security to protect the event.On the other hand, to say Trump is erratic is to make an Olympian understatement. Plus, he has an in-built incentive to make life hard for California governor Gavin Newsom – his perpetual nemesis and a possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidate – and LA’s left-of-center mayor Karen Bass. Last month, vice-president JD Vance parachuted into LA and immediately slid into attack-dog mode,callingthe activist pushback against Ice raids “a tragedy” of Newsom and Bass’s making. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law,” hesaid, “and you had rioters, egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job.”Angelenos are at the Trump administration’s mercy in other ways, too. Olympic organizersare banking on scoringaround $3.2bn in federal funding for transportation that’s crucial to the Games running smoothly. But Trump’s transportation secretary Sean Duffy recentlythreatenedto cut off funding for cities like LA that have experienced anti-Ice protests. A federal judgeissueda temporary order pausing the plan, but congressional Republicans hold tremendous leverage over the fiscal spigot, and this is a clear stick-it-to-the-libs moment they are unlikely to fritter away.But even more alarming is the fact that Trump and Vance have a secret weapon in their arsenal: theNational Special Security Eventdesignation, or NSSE. When an event such as the Olympics, a Super Bowl or an egotisticmilitary paradeis designated as an NSSE by a president or their Department of Homeland Security, it triggers widespread latitude for a bevy of federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement.View image in fullscreenIn 2024, Joe Biden designated the LA28 Olympics a ‘National Special Security Event’, some four full years ahead of the Games.Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for LA28Few know this but the NSSE for the Los Angeles 2028 isalready in effect. In 2024, then-president Joe Bidendesignatedthe LA28 Olympics a “National Special Security Event”, some four full years ahead of the Games – the furthest in advance of an event since Bill Clinton concocted the designation in the late 1990s.Everyday people in Los Angeles, as well as their elected officials, need to wake up to the reality that this relatively unknown acronym is about to change their life, if it is not already changing it. After all, some900,000undocumented people live in LA, according to the University of Southern California.Let’s be clear, the National Special Security Event status only emboldens impunity. The security crackdown on Ice protests, featuring the National Guard and Marines, offers Angelenos a frontal view at what that mega-event “security” might look like over the next three years.NSSEs enable also secrecy. When LA city council member Imelda Padilla recentlyaskedLos Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell whether he’d be willing to warn city officials if he got wind of upcoming federal immigration raids. McDonnell’s response raised alarm bells: “You’re asking me to warn you about an enforcement action being taken by another agency before it happens? We can’t do that.” He added, “That would be completely inappropriate and illegal.” But is this stance just standard-issue obstruction-of-justice pap? Or is it entangled with the hierarchies of the National Special Security event?McConnell may have offered us a hint when hesaid, “All of the crimes we investigate potentially could be in partnership with [federal agencies],” The police chief added, “It is a partnership, and without that partnership, we wouldn’t be able to go into the World Cup, the Olympics ... that require that we work with federal, state and local partners.” Big questions linger about how the NSSE designation is already affecting policing in LA. The closer we get to the Olympics, the more urgent this issue will become.To further complicate matters for LA28 Olympic organizers, the Trump administration hatched plans to institute a freshtravel banthat affects countries like Iran, Haiti and Libya. Then, itannouncedthat an additional 36 countries could be subjected to its travel ban. Every singlecountrylisted on Trump’s travel ban lists – all 48 of them – sent athletes to theParis 2024Games.Then the Trump administrationdenied visasto players and staff from Senegal’s women’s basketball team, forcing the squad to cancel its trip. The team had planned a training camp in the US to ready itself for LA 2028 Olympic qualifiers.What a time for Kirsty Coventry to take over at the IOC. The first woman and first African – she hails from Zimbabwe – elected to the presidency, Coventry faces a misogynist and bully in Donald Trump. The Olympic Charterstatesplainly that “the IOC’s role” in accordance with its mission, is “to act against any form of discrimination affecting the Olympic Movement”. Will Coventry stand up to Trump and defend these principles? That’s what real leadership would look like. And only then would a new era at the IOC truly begin.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastUS sportsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But voters don’t quite view it that wayFri 4 Jul 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 13.56 EDTShareHe doesn’t look like the innovative type, butKeir Starmeris staging a radical experiment. He is testing out a theory of politics a matter of months after it was seemingly – and spectacularly – disproved and, in the process, hoping to pull off a turnaround that would constitute a comeback so stunning it would be closer to a resurrection.The theory in question is that if you deliver practical improvements to the lives of voters, they will reward you at the ballot box. Its guiding principle is “show, don’t tell”, with the emphasis on results rather than talk, pragmatism rather than ideology. He’s not the first to try it: this was also the animating creed ofJoe Biden’s presidency– and we know how that worked out.So far the approach seems to be bearing similarly sour fruit in Britain. As Starmer marks one year since his landslide victory, Labour has suffered thebiggest post-election dropin public approval since the Conservatives were tanked by Black Wednesday in 1992. The prime minister’s personal numbers are the lowest ever recorded for a PM 12 months in: his net approval stands at -54 points. At the equivalent moment in October 2023, Rishi Sunak scored -37. No one has ever come back up from such depths.The PM appears unfazed by all this. It’s not that he insists he knows how to climb out of the current hole; rather, he refuses to accept he or his government are in a hole at all. He has a list of first-year achievements he is proud of and, besides, he believes he was written off once before, early in his spell as leader of the opposition – only to plough on, methodically reaching each of the milestones he had set himself and, finally, to win.By way of an anniversary gift, let’s assess Starmer as he wants to be assessed. Let’s put aside the various missteps of the past year as “noises off”, or as the mere teething pains of a new government. Let us look past both the fiasco of this week’s near-defeat on welfare, staved off only by a series of panicked concessions and U-turns, and last summer’s baffling determination to strangle at birth any feelgood factor that may have greeted the ejection of a despised Tory government, filling the air instead with gloom and the promise that things would get worse before they got better. Let’s not dwell on the one act of these past 12 months thatcut through mostto voters: the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance from millions of pensioners.Let us instead judge Labour on its own terms: delivery. On that list of Starmer’s, there’s a decent range of items, from thethree trade dealsthat had eluded the Conservatives – with the US, EU and India – to a fall in NHS waiting lists, down to their lowest level in two years; from the expansion of free school meals provision to increased wages. The trouble is, none of those achievements goes anywhere close to repairing the damage Labour itself says was done over the past decade and a half.Inside Downing Street, they still profess their shock at the state they found the country in. Whether it’sovercrowded prisonsor a dysfunctional water industry, so much is “busted”. It is a herculean task to turn all that around, and especially to do it fast – all the more so when there is so little money to spend. Starmer might be calm about the fact that a great change hasn’t happened within a year, but it requires a Panglossian optimism to believe it will come even within five, in time for the next election.In whichever direction you look, delivery is maddeningly hard. To take just one example, the government has won plaudits for its first moves on housing, including a target of an additional 1.5m homes in England by 2029. That means building 300,000 each year. But for the most recent 12-month period, the tally stood atjust over 200,000. If everything goes right, Labour’s planning reforms should eventually boost housebuilding by 25% – but that still won’t be enough to reach its goal.Still, let’s be like Starmer and hope his various plans work and the government really does deliver. The lesson of Biden is that even that won’t be enough. In fairness, Labour’s high command does get that point, acknowledging mere “lines on a graph” or stats won’t cut it. The improvement has to befeltin people’s lives.And yet, that too may not be sufficient. Voters don’t usually go in for gratitude; they are as likely to credit themselves as the government for a material advance in their circumstances. What’s needed, and Team Starmer swear they understand this too,is a story, a narrative of where the country has been and where it could go next, that the public can follow.Land on the right one, and it gives you the time and space this government has been denied. Margaret Thatcher’s self-proclaimed mission to wean Britain off a sclerotic state was compelling enough to make a virtue even of economic hardship: the bitterness of her medicine was deemed proof that it was working. With no equivalent story, every setback of Starmer’s is taken in isolation, evidence that the government doesn’t know what it’s doing. The PM offers no persuasive explanation of what is happening or why it may take a while. That wrecks a party’s relationship with the electorate, obviously, but alsowith its own MPs, as the increasingly restive and frustrated parliamentary Labour party attests.For all the errors and crises, the blight on Starmer’s first year is still the lack of vision | Martin KettleRead moreMost Labour folk admit this narrative weakness is their achilles heel, and that it stems from a deficiency in the leader himself. A lawyer, a technocrat, a manager: whatever word they use to describe the prime minister, no one ever accuses him of being a storyteller.The man who seems least worried by this narrative void is Starmer himself. The formative experience of his (short) political career was his early tenure as Labour leader, half a decade ago. Trailing far behind his then opponent, he read commentaries daily telling him that Boris Johnson was going to dominate British politics for the next 10 years and that his destiny was to replicate Neil Kinnock as a transitional figure, preparing the ground for someone else more capable of winning. Those prognosticators got him wrong then and, he believes, they have got him wrong now.Besides, in his mind, the narrative of his government is obvious. How could anyone look at all he has done so far and not see that the common thread is an earnest effort to improve the lives of ordinary working men and women? To him, it’s so clear it scarcely needs to be spelled out.Unfortunately, as the last US president discovered, everything needs to be spelled out, a hundred times a day, on every conceivable platform and very loudly. The days of quiet, patient, unflashy achievement, eventually recognised by a grateful electorate, are long gone, if they ever existed. Starmer and those around him need to adapt to that reality soon. If he fails, there is a grinning master of the new politics, who revels in the primacy of talk over action, of grievance over solution, who is currently10 points ahead– and waiting to pounce.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerStarmer: one year onLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This in the context of a letter writing campaign against her, and an imminent critical article in News Limited’s The Australian.Creative Australia, on the other hand, released a report into its 13 February decision to withdraw a commission to artist Khaled Sabsabi to represent Australia at the 2026 Venice Biennale.View image in fullscreenKhaled Sabsabi has been reinstated as Australia's representative at the 2026 Venice Biennale.Photograph: Bec Lorrimer/The GuardianThe rushed withdrawal happened on the day that questions were asked in parliament about Sabsabi’s previous work, which featured images of the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. And, again, there was to be an article in The Australian.The cancellation of Sabsabi provoked waves of outrage in the international arts community. With the release of this week’s report,Creative Australia has reversed its reversal and reinstated Sabsabi.In both cases, there was mismanagement. The ABC hired Lattouf, without having checked her social media posts on Palestine. Then, under pressure, they ended up sacking her even though she had not breached ABC editorial policies and not disobeyed any directives.The essence of the report on Creative Australia is that it failed to prepare for the possible controversy about Sabsabi. The report suggests that if Creative Australia had only muscled up in preparation, it would never have wavered.Instead, faced with the heat, both organisations panicked.How did we become so timid? It wasn’t always so.In 2013 the ABC launched its Fact Check service and appointed journalist Russell Skelton to lead it.Then managing director Mark Scott got a bollocking in Senate Estimates from Coalition senator Eric Abetz because, before he joined the ABC, Skelton had retweeted descriptions of Barnaby Joyce as “a dense, opportunistic carpetbagger” and Tony Abbott as an extremist.Abetz had taken Scott by surprise. There was a frantic review of Skelton’s social media, but Scott said that Skelton would be judged, not on his political opinions or things he had said and done before joining the ABC, but on his work from that point forward. Skelton remained in place.More recently, the ABC received 1,832 complaints – far more than were received about Lattouf – aboutStan Grant’s coverage of King Charles’s coronation, in which he said the crown represented invasion and the theft of Indigenous land.Grant later said he felt unsupported by the ABC through this controversy and betrayed by the earlier, sycophantic coverage of the queen’s funeral.But the ABC did not sack him, and its independent ombudsman said of the coronation coverage “While the program canvassed difficult topics it was at all times conducted respectfully … there were no errors of accuracy.”None of these issues are simple. Particularly not for the ABC, which has statutory obligations of impartiality. These sit in tension with the federal court’s finding.Sabsabi’s case is different. It is the job of artists to confront us, express complex ideas and even, sometimes, revolt us. What use is Creative Australia if it doesn’t defend such artistic practice?All right-minded organisations try to make their workforce more diverse. But are we going to accept people from different ethnic and political backgrounds only to the extent that they behave like middle class white people?Sometimes, encounters in brave spaces might lead to us changing our minds, or question our own assumptionsThat is, those who dominate our culture largely as a result of their luck, and who have not got a family legacy of colonisation, war, trauma and holocaust?In the Lattouf and Sabsabi cases, the apparently unmanageable sensitivity was discussion of Israel and Palestine, in the context of the alarming resurgence of that light sleeper, antisemitism.This is very hard. But not unique.There have been many uncomfortable debates in our past. But now there is a new notion abroad – the concept of “safe spaces”. Writers’ festival chairs have resigned and speakers have been barred from speaking, all in the interests of defending such “safety”.The term emerged from second wave feminism. It referred to the need for women to be able to attend, and be heard, in physical safety and without being verbally abused, disrespected or belittled. Rightly, the idea was extended to other groups who have suffered discrimination and to the workplace.People at work can no longer get away with shouting at each other. (Instead, as any participant in a university faculty meeting knows, we have rampant passive aggression.)But the notion of safe spaces was always about opening up participation. It was never meant to suggest that people had the right to feel comfortable, or to avoid hearing views with which they disagree. It was meant to create a space within which uncomfortable conversations could be had – not to close them down.I want to advocate a new concept. We should build and defend brave spaces.The ABC squandered trust with its multicultural audience when it sent Antoinette Lattouf packing | Paula KrugerRead moreAustralian laws rightly ban hate speech – meaning discrimination, vilification or injury on the basis of skin colour, national origin and race.But within those parameters, let us be brave and robust in the face of views with which we disagree, even if they horrify us or make us weep.Our national broadcaster should be a brave space. So, too, our arts organisations, universities and writers’ festivals.This cuts all ways. Too often, people broadly self-identifying as left are quick to argue for controversial views to be aired, and quick to “de-platform” (surely one of the ugliest of modern verbs) the views of those on the right.Within these brave spaces, let us be courageous enough to brush off the irritations of thedrearily predictable News Limited campaigns. And let us try to avoid self-righteousness.Sometimes, encounters in brave spaces might lead to us changing our minds, or question our own assumptions.And that, perhaps, will be the bravest thing of all.Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and author.

Many have tried and failed to create one that wins and then holds a significant number of seats in parliament.Labour, founded 125 years ago, has been the only successful example. Others have been defeated by the electoral system, the sheer number of interests ranged against the left, loyalty to Labour and the left’s tendency to over-promise and quarrel.Could Zarah Sultana’ssudden announcementlast night that she “will co-lead the founding of a new party” with Jeremy Corbyn and other “independent MP’s… and activists across the country” – a statement that he did notacknowledgeuntil lunchtime today – finally begin to change the rigid shape of British left-of-centre politics? And would that help the left – or help destroy it?The 31-year-old MP for Coventry South, who had already been suspended from Labour last yearfor opposingits retention of the two-child benefit cap, is usuallyone of the most effective political communicators in the country. She has more followers on TikTok thanany MP except Nigel Farage. Unlike him, she has an ability to talk with moral force and clarity: about Palestine, inequality, the rightward shift of Keir Starmer’s government and other issues particularly important to Britain’s large minority of leftwing voters, a neglected electoral bloc since Corbyn’s Labour leadership ended in 2020.She has been the great hope of some on the left for years. As a young woman and a Muslim, she represents parts of the population where the left remains strong. As an MP for a seat in the Midlands, one of the few Labour MPs to increase their majority at the last election, she has succeeded, so far, in the kind of place where the left needs to do better, away from its metropolitan heartlands. In 2022, after only three years in parliament, and with Starmer struggling as Labour leader, as he is now, she was already being spoken of by some on the left of the party as hispotential challenger.Who’s really to blame for Labour’s troubles – Rachel Reeves or the invisible PM? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThat won’t happen now, as she has resigned from Labour. But the prospectof her building a new party with Corbyn has considerable potential. As his comfortable victory over Labour as an independent candidate at last year’s election showed, the 76-year-old MP for Islington North remains a much better electoral politician than many of his enemies think. His decades of experience, connections right across the left and continuing moral authority for millions of Britons – especially as his criticisms of Starmer and Israel are ever more borne out by events – could dovetail well with Sultana’s more youthful and abrasive brand of politics. And with Labour in crisis, leftwing ideas such as nationalisation back in fashion, and the electorate more fragmented and fickle than it has probably ever been, conditions for a new leftwing party are unusually favourable.Yet difficulties remain. One is that the Green party is already absorbing some of the left’s talent and energy, especially with the leftwingerZack Polanskistanding for its leadership.Another is deciding exactly what form a new leftwing party should take. Should it stand in local and parliamentary elections as soon as possible – or should it build an activist movement first, establishing its credibility in communities? And should it try to mobilise across the country – or should it concentrate its almost certainly limited resources on a few winnable seats?Leftists have been debating and pondering these questions for months, which is one reason why the new party, discussed at private and public gatherings since at least last autumn, has yet to assume a definite shape. Today, Corbyn finally said that he was “delighted” that Sultana “will help us build a real alternative. The democratic foundations of a new kind of political party will soon take shape. Discussions are ongoing…”. As for who should lead it, he did not say. An unhurried politician by nature, he has spent much of the year since the election working with the other four leftwing independent MP’s to create and solidify the Independent Alliance, which has as many representatives in the Commons as Reform UK.Yet one of the lessons of our unstable politics over the past decade is that things can happen slowly and then very fast. Now that Sultana has made her move, having reportedly considered her options for months, she and Corbyn may quickly get over any tactical differences, as leftwing activists are drawn to their project and the scale of its opportunity dawns.For Labour, in the middle of its worst week in office so far, the new partycould be a serious threat. Even if it only wins a few seats, or none, it could split the left-of-centre vote across the country. Reform could be the ultimate beneficiaries of Starmer’s carelessly contemptuous treatment of the left.But there is another possibility. If the next election leaves a hung parliament, which looks increasingly likely, a new leftwing party with, say, a dozen MPs, could hold the balance of power. Coalition talks between Corbyn, Sultana and their old party would be interesting.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZarah SultanaOpinionLabourJeremy CorbynKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Like Drive to Survive, but for clown cars. Leave it to “no-drama Starmer” to come up with the only thing weirder and more awful than watching the chancellor of the exchequersob on the frontbench– wheeling her out a mere 22-and-a-half hours later for an unscheduled appearance at a wellbeing centre(!), where Rachel Reeves had to get her happy face on and pose for selfies.The whole thing gave Keir Starmer the feel of one of those remorseless boyband managers who reacts to one of their young charges having a breakdown by getting them a special injection and shoving them straight back out on stage the next night. I think you can probably do it with a member of Take That or 5ive or whoever, and only run the risk of them turning on you in adocumentary decades later. But is it a vibe you want at the heart of the team in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy?Yes, imply some allies of Reeves, who are now suggesting that because the (debunked) possibility that the chancellor was crying about losing her job clearly spooked bond traders, she has actually emerged in a stronger position from the whole business. Again: really? Having to physically hug your boss to calm the markets doesn’t feel like a textbook power move – but look, like people kept saying last July: the grownups are back in charge.Anyway, never mind last July. Watching the turbo-fiasco of this week unfold, I kept thinking instead of a speech Starmer made in the Downing Street garden near the end of last August. I want to say it was the first reset of his government … ? But who’s counting. This government’s had more reboots than Batman. And, like that particular character’s screen incarnations, it all just seems to keep getting darker and grittier every time.That August speech featured an extremely extended analogy between the country and a house that had some kind of rot, but could be fixed by being completely made over, if you really had a go at overhauling the foundations.Rereading itin the wake of Labour’s full-spectrum Commons chaos over the universal credit and personal independence payment bill reminded me of one of those movie scenes where an idealistic young newcomer is telling a guy in the town about the house they’ve just bought. It’s a real fixer-upper, they’re going to do it all themselves, it was quite the bargain, but it could be beautiful – and the guy just cuts them off as it dawns on him. “Ohright,” he says. “The murder house.”No one is saying the House of Commons wasbuilt on an Indian burial ground… but this week’s deranged farce certainly seemed to release the spirits of the Brexit years back into its cursed chamber. Much as Theresa May’s 437 Brexit votes never actually achieved a Brexit, the universal credit and personal independence payment bill now has nothing about personal independence payments in it. If that doesn’t take you back down memory lane, meanwhile, other throwbacks are available. Shortly after 9pm last night, the Coventry South MP, Zarah Sultana, announced she wasgoing to “co-lead the founding”(what?) of a new party with Jeremy Corbyn. And shortly after that, sources close to Corbyn let it be known he was furious and bewildered this plan had been launched without consultation. According to what one allytold the FT, “Zarah has really overplayed her hand”, which is believed to include the three of clubs, Mr Bun the Baker, and an expired student railcard. Out loud, Corbyn said things like “Zarah will help us” and “discussions are ongoing”. Let’s pray for peace – if not in the wider world, then certainly in this new and fractured party.Then again, which part of our politics isn’t fracturing before our very eyes? It is quite possible none of us will be able to escape the murder house’s past. In some ways, the most bizarre thing about the welfare bill fallout was the cabinet ministers attempting to clean it up with the same strange, dead language that a growing number of people feel characterises most contemporary politicians bar Nigel Farage. No sooner had the horror show unfolded than cabinet office minister Pat McFadden was explaining that though there would be a cost,Labourwould still stick to its manifesto promises on tax. Is this the gibberish about not raising taxes on “working people”? It would seem so.Yet even back at manifesto stage, this already felt like a deliberately obscure way of talking that just comes across as lying. Newsflash, Pat: you already have raised taxes on working people.People who run small businesses are working people. And the reason they haven’t employed more working people, and in some cases have let go the working people they used to employ, is because you raised taxes on them. By chance I heard McFadden’s interview right after one of my children told me they’d seen Reeves crying on loads of YouTube videos. He’s 12, so I think that’s what they call cut-through – and underscores the feeling that you just can’t control politics in the knackered old ways any more.As for what we’re feeling – all those wonderful working people out there in the dark – the answer is surely: like we’ve been here before, and that the dysfunction is more wearying for its familiarity. Starmer came to power promising his government would fix broken Britain. One year on, it would be a start if he could even fix his broken government.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsStarmer: one year onLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

The audience gasped and the markets plunged. The critics loved it. Foreigners are famously envious of British politics played as fun.I always thought it cruel to attack a person in tears. Tell that to the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch. Hersavaging of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, at prime minister’s questions (PMQs) on Wednesday might have been a scene from Les Misérables. It was great theatre, but what had it to do with governing the country?The issue at stake, the runaway cost of sickness and disability benefits, was always clear. The number of new disability benefit claimants betweenJuly 2021 and July 2022 doubled. A welfare reform bill, introduced by the new Labour government, was an emergency stopgap, curbing some payments and saving about £5bn a year.Badenoch declared that the billdid not go far enoughand should have been more radical. To the casual observer this bordered on hypocrisy, since she had sat in the cabinet that ran this system. At the very least, she could have accepted the bill as a move in the right direction and voted in its favour. The bill was a curb on public spending, which Badenoch supported in principle, and an attempt to avoid raising taxes, which she also supported. It might even go some way to meeting the £7bn a year forthe HS2 project, which Reeves still lacks the guts to cancel.Most of Europe’s democratic assemblies, such as Germany’s Bundestag or France’s National Assembly, see legislative compromise as the outcome of shifting coalitions. Britain is hopeless at forming such coalitions. They go against the grain of the petty bickering and staged insults with which theHouse of Commonswhiles away its time.The greatest tragedy in recent British politics was the failure of Jeremy Corbyn’sLabourMPs to forge an alliance with Theresa May’s anti-Brexit Tories to back her soft Brexit bill in 2019. She lost and eventually fell. Corbyn’s MPs preferred to see her squirm at the dispatch box rather than do the right thing for the country. Labour could have averted much of the Brexit disaster, but crucifying May was more fun.There was initially some talk of the Tories supporting Starmer’s original bill and voting it through against the rebel Labour backbenchers. It was better than no bill, and Badenoch could have revelled in Starmer having to rely on her. Any time you need help running the country, she could have said, just knock on my door. Always happy to oblige. Tony Blair borrowed half his policies from the Thatcher/Major era. Join the club, Starmer.Reports indicate that the shadow cabinet did indeeddiscuss this possibility. Some members were prepared to show themselves ready to act in the national interest as a responsible governing party. Others were more downmarket. For them, being in opposition meant a good scrap and Starmer writhing in pain. Badenoch decided to go with the latter view.In the event, Starmer won a stripped-down bill and was indeed humiliated, but by his own side. It is thanks to the Tories that welfare reform will nowonly save £2bnrather than £5bn a year of taxpayers’ money, and taxes may rise as a result. All the Tory leader had in return was a few seconds on television being brutal to Reeves. The tactics adopted by her parliamentary party bordered on the childish.There is no doubt that Badenoch has brought an aggressive voice to the theatre of British politics. Nowadays, virtually the only time MPs crowd the chamber or appear on television is for PMQs. The undergraduate badinage suits the 24/7 style of news and the increasingly short-term nature of policymaking. It suits Badenoch’s fondness for going on the attack.Another tragic fact about this disastrous welfare bill: it proves Labour hasn’t learned and doesn’t truly listen | Polly ToynbeeRead moreShe is less good at defence. She hasrefrained from making policydeclarations or stating any ideological beliefs, protesting that she is too far from an election to take such risks. This is understandable, but it leaves her exposed as little more than a partisan figure. She may try to upstage Reform UK’s Nigel Farage at every turn, but she makes him seem almost emollient and broad-minded amid her unreasonable barrages.Badenoch seems to crave enemies rather than friends. She is under persistent pressure to come out fighting. But leaders who become prisoners of their court circle tend to come to grief. Just now there are plenty of knives sticking into Starmer. The Tory leader need not add to their number. She should rather develop a character of her own above the fray.That is why Badenoch should have voted for Starmer’s bill. She should have taken on the role of a responsible leader ready to assist in the conduct of the nation’s affairs. Instead she chose merely to assail a weeping chancellor in distress.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionWelfareConservativesLabourBenefitsHouse of CommonsKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Cue a wave of commentary pitting “big pharma” against fitness, as if we must choose between pills and planks. It’s an appealing narrative – but it’s also misleading.We don’t need to choose between the two. In fact, the best health outcomes often come from combining medicine with a broader view of health that includes movement, diet, social connection and mental wellbeing.Let’s consider whatthe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, actually looked at. It focused on colon cancer – the third-most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Between 2009 and 2024, researchers set up a randomised trial across 55 centres – mainly in Australia and Canada – where 889 patients who had had surgery for colon cancer, and who had completed chemotherapy, were split into two groups randomly. Over a three-year period, one group received a structured exercise programme (the exercise group of 445 patients) and the other received health education materials alone (the health education group of 444 patients).One thing you may already have clocked here is that the patients all received chemotherapy after their cancer surgery. So nothing about the experiment put exercise head-to-head with cancer medicines. Instead, they asked what kind of exercise support after surgery and chemotherapy treatments might improve overall health, and potentially keep the cancer from recurring.The structured exercise group received health education materials, such as an exercise guidebook for colon cancer survivors, and support from a certified personal trainer for three years. In the first six months, they received 12 mandatory in-person behavioural-support sessions, 12 mandatory supervised exercise sessions plus 12 optional supervised exercise sessions. Over the next two and a half years, the frequency of in-person and supervised sessions slowly decreased to help patients transition to more independent exercise routines. In contrast, the health education group received only general health education materials on the benefits of physical activity and a healthy diet.At a median follow-up of almost eight years, disease-free survival was significantly longer in the structured exercise group (90.3%) than in the health education group (83.2%). Both groups increased their physical activity levels over the three years, but the structured exercise group met the goal of increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity. This roughly added to their existing activity levels about an hour of brisk walking three to four times a week or a 30-minute jog three to four times a week. The better health outcomes could also be linked to the social contact that patients in the exercise group had, given they were enrolled in a structured and supervised programme with a personal trainer to support them and not left on their own.What struck me, and the authors, from their study is that knowledge alone – even among those who have had colon cancer and have been advised to exercise – isn’t enough to shift activity levels. Structure, supervision and social contact matter. Being told to “move more” is easy. Actually changing your habits – especially after cancer treatment – is hard. That transition requires coaching, encouragement, and the support and time to build confidence.We have known for a long time that a generally physically and socially healthy life can be very effective in warding off disease, even cancer. What this study actually gives us is some direction for the best way to make that happen, and a look at how positive the effects can really be.Perhaps I’m biased as a personal trainer, but structured exercise is one of the best investments you can make for your health – whether it’s in recovery from cancer or trying to prevent getting cancer. This doesn’t have to be one-on-one gym sessions, which can be costly and out of reach for many. It could be joining affordable boot camps in the park – that cost as much as your morning latte – or free classes in discount gym chains. Plus, you might make a few new friends and improve your social life too. The real headline isn’t that exercise is better than drugs for cancer recovery. It’s that just telling people to move without offering support – ie the health education movement – isn’t enough.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsCancerOpinionBowel cancerHealthMedical researchCancer researchcommentShareReuse this content"

I have no doubt that if they were active today she would proscribe them, tooFri 4 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 09.29 EDTShareNo one can be trusted with power. Any government will oppress its people if not constantly and inventively challenged. And the task becomes ever-more urgent as new technologies of surveillance and control are developed.The UK government is run by a former human rights lawyer. Its home secretary, Yvette Cooper, hasexpressed her admirationfor the Suffragettes in parliament. Yet such credentials do nothing to defend us from attacks on our fundamental rights. With a huge majority, no formal constitutional checks and a ruthless, scarcely accountable governing machine, this administration is abusing its power to an even greater extent than its Conservative predecessors.Though there is tough competition, Cooper’sproscriptionof the protest group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act 2000 is probably the most illiberal thing any home secretary has done in 30 years. If Palestine Action’slegal challengeto the order fails, you could receive 14 years in jail as a terrorist merely for expressing support. It’s a massive threat to the right to protest and to free speech.In 2001, as the act came into force,I warnedthat it could be used to ban nonviolent protest groups and imprison those who support them. Supporters of Tony Blair’s government told me I was talking rubbish: its purpose was to keep us safe from people who wanted to kill and maim us. At the time, Cooper was a junior minister. She must have known what the act could do. Now she vindicates the warning.Like the drafting of theTory anti-protest laws, this application of the act appears to be a response to lobbyists. The junktanks ofTufton Street, in concert with the billionaire media, have called forever-more extreme measuresfor protesters demonstrating against the genocide in Gaza. The government seems to have beensharing the contact detailsof police and crown prosecutors with the Israeli embassy: there appears to be deep entanglement between domestic law enforcement and the interests of a foreign state.In response to lobbying, the UK has become arguably themost repressiveofall nominal democracies. Both in legislation and application, it looks more like a repressive autocracy. You can see this not only in theextreme sentencesfor peaceful protest but also in the extraordinary double standards deployed – a classic sign of theauthoritarian mindset: “for my friends everything, for my enemies the law”. While climate protesters are arrested for setting foot in the road, even when a group of farmers in tractorsblocked the roadwhere Keir Starmer was giving a speech, forcing him to flee, not only were no arrests made but, as far as I can discover, no minister said a word about it.Pressure grows on Yvette Cooper to abandon plans to ban Palestine ActionRead moreFar from repealing the draconian anti-protest laws imposed by the Tories, Labour is augmenting them with a clause (section 124) slipped into the currentcrime and policing bill. Scarcely noticed by either legislators or the public, it greatly increases police powers to stifle protest. The police will be able to ban demonstrations close to a place of worship that they decide could be intimidating to worshippers. As almost every urban area contains a place of worship, this empowers the police, using only their own discretion, to shut down any expression of dissent.Palestine Action is not a danger to democracy. But Cooper is. I have no doubt that, were they active today, the home secretary would proscribe as a terrorist organisation the Suffragettes she claims to honour.One of the causes of the global democratic recession is the escalating inequality of arms between governments and their people. At the time of the French Revolution, governments feared the people, as the distance between pikes and pitchforks was not so great. But as states developed ever-more sophisticated weapons, their powers could no longer be matched by those they sought to crush. In combination with facial recognition technology, now beingwidely deployed in the UKamong many other nations, autonomous weapons systems, for both military and civil use, would greatly increase the distance between state and citizen power. This is the future we appear to be rushing towards, with scarcely any democratic debate.All over the world, autonomous weapons systems are in development, largely for use in warfare. Ukraine and Russia are in the midst of arobot arms race, accelerating at shocking speed. In Gaza, Israel hasautomated its target selection, with horrifying results.Why is Palestine Action being banned and what happens next?Read moreAs security sourcesexplainedto +972 magazine in April 2024, Israel’sLavender AIprogram had marked about 37,000 Palestinians as suspected “Hamas militants”, selecting them as potential targets for assassination. A further program, with the sinister name of Where’s Daddy?, was tracking them to their homes so that they could be bombed at night, often killing not only their families but many other people in the same block. “Once you go automatic,” one of the sources told the journal, “target generation goes crazy.” Almost everyone in Gaza had been given a Lavender rating of between 1 and 100. As soon as the number in the AI system was high enough, the name wouldbe added to the kill list. That would be treated as a military order, even though the operators knew that at least 10% of the targets were misidentified.Anyone who imagines that such systems would not be embraced by governments for use against their citizens is deceiving themselves. As autonomous target selection aligns with the autonomous delivery of munitions, which could range from teargas to rubber bullets to metal bullets, governments will acquire terrifying new powers to contain dissent. Real robocops are likely to have propellers, not legs.As theStop Killer Robotscampaign points out, such machines dehumanise us: we become a set of data points, to be interpreted by an algorithm. Once an autonomous weapons system has been programmed, oppressive regimes can absolve themselves of responsibility for what it does. AIreinforces prejudiceand discrimination: the way it develops ensures that Black and brown people and other minorities targeted by the police will be disproportionately selected.Once such systems are in place, they will be very hard to dismantle. When you create a market you create a lobby, and the lobby will insist on retaining and expanding its investments. Autonomous weapons systems, for both military and civilian use, should beprohibited under international lawbefore they progress any further.Technologies of control are ramping up while democratic rights are ramping down. We drift towards extreme political repression, driven by the demands of capital and foreign states, accelerated by automation. This is why we must protest – now, while we still can.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests discussing the forces driving climate denialism, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

The party and the country are crying out for leadership, but it’s nowhere to be seenFri 4 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 4 Jul 2025 05.34 EDTShareShe isnot the first chancellorto cry in public, and may not be the last. But Rachel Reeves is the first whose tears havemoved markets. No sooner had the realisation dawned that she was silently weeping – over apersonal sorrowshe won’t be pushed into revealing, she insisted later, not a political one – as she sat beside Keir Starmer at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, than the pound was dropping and the cost of borrowing rising. The bond traders who forced out Liz Truss’s hapless chancellor still clearly rate her judgment and want her to stay, even if (perhaps especially if) some Labour MPs don’t. Yet it is an extraordinary thing to live with the knowledge that a moment’s uncontrolled emotion can drive up the cost of a nation’s mortgages, just as a misjudged stroke of the budget pen can destroy lives.The most striking thing about her tears, however, wasStarmer’s failure to notice. Intent on the Tory benches opposite, the prime minister simply ploughed on, not realising that his closest political ally was dissolving beside him. Though within hours, a clearly mortified Starmer had thrown a metaphorical arm around her, and Reeves herself was back out talking up her beloved fiscal rules as if nothing had happened. But it’s the kind of image that sticks: her distress and his oblivion, an unfortunately convenient metaphor for all the times he has seemed oddly detached from his own government.Quite aside from whatever private grief she is now carrying, Reeves has for years been shouldering an exhausting load. From the start, she and Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, did an unusual amount of the heavy lifting on behalf of their oddly apolitical leader – and in government the stakes have only risen. McSweeney, a natural fixer now jammed faintly awkwardly into a strategist’s role, was once credited with near-mythical influence over Starmer, but for months is said to have been struggling at times to get the boss’s ear.Reeves, meanwhile, has ended up by default running much of the domestic agenda, while Starmer focuses on foreign policy crises and a handful of big issues that passionately exercise him. Since even close aides and ministers complain of never really knowing what he wants, the result is a Treasury-brained government that tends to start with the numbers and work back to what’s possible, rather than setting a political goal and figuring out how to reach it.One year in, Labour is at a low ebb. From now on, let its priority be honesty, honesty, honesty | Polly ToynbeeRead morePerhaps that makes sense to the City, but not toLabourMPs frogmarched through a series of politically toxic decisions with no obvious rationale except that the money’s got to come from somewhere. To many of them, Starmer appears at best like a kind of political weekend dad: largely absent from everyday life and reluctant to get involved in political battles, but swooping in at the last minute to issue orders. Complaints of Downing Street dysfunction have been a staple under at least the last four prime ministers, but there’s a weakness at the core of this No 10 that is putting the rest of government under undue strain, like a runner trying to push on through an injury who ends up pulling every other muscle in the process.On the left, there is growing talk of trying to force a “reset” in spring, if next year’s Scottish and Welsh elections go as badly as they assume: force Reeves out, let radicalism in, fight Reform’s emotive rightwing fire with a form of leftwing populism perhaps loosely resembling what the Democrats’ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the New York mayoral candidateZohran Mamdaniare doing in the US. It’s exactly what the markets fear, judging by their reaction to Reeves’ temporary wobble.But even Labour MPs who’d never go that far are growing restless for change.Just raise taxes, cries this week’s New Statesman magazine, echoing a widespread view that the fiscal straitjacket imposed by Reeves is killing the government. I argued for the same thingin the Guardian back in March, and haven’t changed my mind. But the political cost of doing so is arguably higher now than it would have been then, when tax rises could plausibly still have been framed as an emergency response to Donald Trump pulling the plug on Europe’s defence and forcing Britain to rearm, rather than as an admission that the government can no longer get its spending plans past its own backbenchers.In their understandable frustration, however, some fail to ask why Reeves holds the iron grip she does; why Treasury thinking isn’t more often challenged by No 10.If this government’s mistakes often have her fingerprints somewhere on them, then so do many of its successes. Last week, I was at a housing conference, surrounded by people still euphoric at getting everything they asked for in last month’s spending review: unprecedented billions poured intogenuinely affordable and social housing– with emphasis thankfully for once on the social – with a 10-year settlement from the Treasury, creating the long-term certainty they need to make it happen.Angela Rayner fought like a tiger for it, but Reeves made the money happen, and the result will change lives. Children who would have grown up in grim, frightening temporary accommodation will have safe, permanent homes. Vulnerable people will escape the clutches of unscrupulous landlords and first-time buyers will climb ladders otherwise out of reach. It’s everything a Labour government exists to do, but as with so many unseen good things happening – on green energy, say, or transport – the money didn’t fall from the sky and won’t be there in future if an ageing and chronically unfit population carries on consuming welfare spending or health spending (the next big battleground, judging by the detail of Wes Streeting’s 10-year plan) at current rates.To a frustrated Treasury, this week’s rebellion was evidence that Labour MPs don’t live in the real world, where hard choices must be faced for good things to happen. But, to the rebels, it’s evidence that the Treasury doesn’t live intheirreal world, where vulnerable people struggle with deep-rooted health problems only aggravated by being pushed into poverty, and the Greens as much as Reform are threatening to eat them for breakfast over it. There is some truth in both arguments. But that’s precisely why it is ultimately a prime minister’s job, and nobody else’s, to draw all the threads of the government together: to balance political yin against economic yang, such that neither dominates or bends the project out of shape.Chancellors come and, eventually, even the best go. But sometimes it’s only then that you can really tell whether the problem was ever really the chancellor.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRachel ReevesOpinionKeir StarmerLabourTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

You might have expected a loud response. This is, after all, a crowd so partisan that, in between the support acts, they cheer the promotional videos – the tour’s accompanying brand deals seem to involve not just the obviously Oasis-adjacent sportswear brand Adidas, but the more imponderable Land Rover Defender.Even so, the noise the fans make as the reconstituted Oasis launch into Hello takes you aback slightly, and not just because Hello is a fairly bold choice of opener: this is, after all, a song that borrows heavily from Hello, Hello, I’m Back Again by Gary Glitter. But no one in Cardiff’s Principality Stadium seems to care about the song’s genesis: the noise is such that you struggle to think of another artist that’s received such a vociferous reception.So, the success of the show seems more or less like a foregone conclusion. Anyone who saw them in the 00s will tell you that the old Oasis were a hugely variable proposition live: you never knew what moodLiam Gallagherwould show up in, or how the current state of familial relations might affect their performance. But evidently as little as possible has been left to chance at these reunion gigs. No one – including, to their immense credit, Liam and Noel Gallagher – seems interested in pretending this tour is anything other than a hugely lucrative cash-grab, and clearly, you only grab the maximum possible cash if the tour doesn’t descend into the kind of bedlam to which Oasis tours were once prone.Liam is on his best behaviour – “thanks for putting up with us,” he offers at one juncture, “I know we’re hard work”, a noticeable shift from the days when he was wont to rain abuse on the audience – and Liam and Noel have rhythm guitarist Paul “Bonehead” Arthurs stood squarely between them on stage, creating distance. You could say that removes combustibility, the hint of potential chaos that was at least part of Oasis’s appeal, but you might as well save your breath: no one would be able to hear you over the sound of people singing along en masse to a set that plays to the strengths of Oasis’s back catalogue.View image in fullscreenAbundant songwriting talent … Noel Gallagher at the Principality Stadium.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersFew bands’ reputations have been better served by the rise of streaming, both in its favouring of curated playlists over albums – all the highlights and none of the rubbish, of which there was a great deal in Oasis’s later years – and in the way it decontextualises music, denuding it of its accompanying story or contemporary critical responses. The much-vaunted Oasis fans too young to remember the band first-hand definitely exist – you can see them in the audience – but you do wonder how many of them believe Oasis split up in 1998, rather than grimly trudging on for another decade, to declining artistic returns.The show seeks to maintain this myth. It’s very much playlist Oasis, big on the first two albums and B-sides from the years when Noel Gallagher’s songwriting talent seemed so abundant he could afford to blithely confine stuff as good as Acquiesce or The Masterplan to an extra track on a CD single, and low on anything at all from their later years. Only the presence of 2002’s Little By Little indicates that Oasis existed into the 21st century.You can still sense inspiration declining – 1997’s D’You Know What I Mean? sounds like a trudge regardless of how many people are singing along – but far more often, the show serves as a reminder of how fantastic purple patch Oasis were. Against a ferocious wall of distorted guitars, there’s a weird disconnect between the tone of Noel’s songs – wistful, noticeably melancholy – and the way Liam sings them like a man seething with frustration, on the verge of offering someone a fight. Even discounting half their career, they have classics in abundance: Cigarettes & Alcohol, Slide Away, Rock ’n’ Roll Star, Morning Glory. Enough, in fact, that a section where Liam cedes the stage and Noel takes over vocals doesn’t occasion a dip in the audience’s enthusiasm: during Half the World Away, the audience’s vocals threaten to drown the song’s author out entirely.It ends with precisely the encore you might have expected – Don’t Look Back in Anger, Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova – which understandably occasions precisely the response you might have expected. A very perfunctory clap on the back – the only time the Gallaghers interact beyond playing the same songs – and Liam vanishes: a car is waiting by the side of the stage to whisk him away before the final notes die away, a triumph in the bag.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockNoel GallagherLiam GallagherreviewsShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t believe it. I don’t know what to say – I was 18 again.”Oasis kick off reunion tour in Cardiff with triumphant, nostalgic gigRead moreHe had attended with his 22-year-old daughter and her boyfriend. “They didn’t know Oasis and came for the experience. It was the best night. They’ve been to concerts before but never like this – it was a new level.” During Stand By Me, the trio had a cuddle – or acwtch, in Welsh – “two generations together. I’ve convinced her throughout the years that they’re the best band, and she was ecstatic to get to this point on her journey.”The show had been “100%” worth the money, he said. “I could’ve gone away with the family for two weeks, all-inclusive, in the sun, but I wouldn’t swap it.”Jack from Stockport, described the concert as “biblical: the presence, everything,” he said. “There was no silence during the set at all, everyone was singing as one.”It wasn’t until the very end of the set that Liam and Noel Gallagher acknowledged each other: Liam walked towards his brother, clapped him on the back twice, and then immediately escaped in a Range Rover waiting on the side of stage to drive him to sanctuary; presumably a similar car awaited Noel on the other side. “The one time they interacted, they looked like actual brothers,” said Jack. “Though Liam didn’t look as if he was giving Noel a lift home.”View image in fullscreenOasis fans singing along inside.Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersHis partner, Beth, appeared out of the women’s loos, heavily pregnant with the pair’s twins – their first in utero gig. Beth was born a month after the band’s famous performance at Knebworth in August 1996. Had they considered Noel and Liam as potential names? “They’re girl twins,” she said. “But we did think about Lyla” – a song from 2005’s Don’t Believe the Truth – “as a name for a little bit.”Couple Jarvis and Valentina had travelled from north London for the show. “It was absolutely incredible,” he said. “Liam’s voice hasn’t sounded that good since the mid-90s. At the end of the 00s his voice was shot. That’s incredible.”Brothers in arms: Noel and Liam reunite on the Oasis reunion tour – in picturesRead moreThe pair knew what they were talking about: Valentina said they saw them about 40 times during their initial incarnation. She had moved from Italy to the UK in the year 2000 because of her love for the band. “We used to follow them everywhere,” she said of herself and her teenage girl friends. Once in Florence, she said, they snuck into the band’s hotel “and spent the afternoon drinking with them.”She clarified: “There was no malice. We were good Italian girls. But Liam was drinking from 2pm until 7pm, and by the end I was seeing double. We talked about the Beatles. We would follow them everywhere and if we didn’t have a ticket, they would say, ‘Girls, do you have a ticket?’ and get us in.”Tonight’s show, she said, brought back “so many memories of happy, better times, lots of us cried. They’re a working-class band and they attract that audience: no band has touched a generation like that.”“If I’d dreamed it,” said Jarvis, “they couldn’t have been better.”Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

But frontman Murray Matravers’s trip to Japan has prompted a bold new outlook – and an upbeat new albumFri 4 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen writing songs, “95% of the time” Murray Matravers starts with the title. It’s a tactic he picked up from Gary Barlow: a producer once told him the Take That man tends to arrive at sessions touting a load of prospective song titles “cut out on little pieces of paper, and he’d put them on the table and you could just choose one. I was like: that’s fucking brilliant. Ever since I’ve always had loads of titles in my Notes app. It actually changed the way I wrote music,” he says with genuine enthusiasm. “Shout out to Gary Barlow!”Names are clearly very important to the 29-year-old – but in recent years they have also caused him untold stress. By 2023, Matravers’ band Easy Life was thriving, having scored two No 2 albums on the trot by fusing upbeat, synthy bedroom pop with wry emo-rap. But that same year, his career came to a screeching halt when easyGroup – owners of the easyJet brand name with a long history of taking legal action against businesses with the word “easy” in their branding – decided to sue the Leicester band for trademark infringement.Their first reaction was to laugh at such extreme litigiousness. “We thought it was hilarious,” recalls Matravers. They spent the next few weeks “umming and ahhing about fighting” the legal action, buoyed by the support they received from the public: “We thought, we’re gonna start a GoFundMe and fight the system – that was the energy people were giving us.” But ultimately the risk felt too gargantuan. Easy Life wasn’t a limited company, so “if we did lose, any assets that we have would be liable for repossession – and the court case would have been into the millions”. Then there were the years of their lives they would need to sacrifice. “Our court date would have been in July 2025, so we would only now be going to court.”Instead of spending years in legal limbo, the group swiftly rebranded to Hard Life (although the financial impact was still huge; they didn’t gig for 18 months, and the complex task of scrubbing references to their former moniker from online artwork and streaming services was a full-time job in itself for a while). Last June, they released a ludicrously catchy comeback single called Tears, which paired Matravers’ Midlands-accented sprechgesang with a chipmunk-soul sample and lyrics that prodded at the controversy by calling out easyGroup’s founder. Unsurprisingly, this attracted further legal pushback, with the company’s lawyers calling it “disparaging and defamatory”. It has subsequently been bleeped out of the song.Matravers doesn’t regret it … well, maybe just a teensy bit. The musician is deeply committed to candour: in conversation, he is garrulous and funny, but makes no attempt to hide how beleaguered he clearly still feels; when it comes to his lyrics, he says anything is fair game (“other than a few deeply buried secrets of mine that will never come out”). The lawsuit “was my life for such a long time, of course I’m going to write about it. Fair enough, I could have been smarter and not name-dropped the owner of the company on the first song back after they had sued. But I was fucking angry as well.”It’s a Hard Life for band changing their name after objection from easyGroupRead moreTears opens the band’s forthcoming third album, Onion, which features one other reference to the company (“I’m sure they’re gonna listen to the album on the day that it drops and I’m sure I’ll hear from [their lawyers],” he says wearily). Yet the rest of this infectiously upbeat record betrays little trace of the strife that preceded it. That may be because it was largely written after Matravers decided to make a fresh start in Japan. Today he is Zooming from the island of Kyushu (“Studio Ghibli vibes”), where he is staying with the grandparents of a friend he met in Tokyo. Following a break-up and craving some respite from expensive London (“so many of my friends are leaving: we don’t party or eat out as much as we used to because we can’t afford to”), he “ran away” to the city last year, and now spends more time in Japan than the UK.Tokyo was where Matravers met the Australian-Japanese producer Taka Perry, his main collaborator on Onion. The pair quickly became inseparable – “He’s actually next door on a futon, asleep” – and began making music together. (Hard Life is in many senses a solo project; Matravers’ touring bandmates have never written with him and “there’s only a few [recorded] songs they’ve actually played on”.) They worked at a studio called Onion; Matravers liked the fact the name chimed with the already-released Tears – onions make you cry – and ideas started percolating. But he still didn’t envisage these sessions becoming the new Hard Life album: “I never thought that I would go back to England with the album, present it to Island Records, this big major label, and they’d be like: yeah, let’s put that out. And yeah, put a big fucking picture of an onion on the front if you want.”View image in fullscreenWhat a life … Hard Life on stage in Brixton, south London, in 2021.Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/RedfernsAs per Matravers’ song-title fixation, the Onion references kept coming. Philosophical break-up ballad Ogre nods to the famous Shrek line (“Ogres are like onions, they have layers”); they also had a song called Rings, which was cut from the final tracklist. At the moment, the musician loves going on Reddit “because all the fans are coming up with these theories about onions”.That said, Matravers is not fastidious about the allium allusions: tracks such as the surprisingly moving Tele9raph Hill have nothing to do with them. An ode to the south-east London neighbourhood with panoramic views, it sees Matravers visualise his own future from the vantage point while grappling with his mental health history – an evergreen subject for the artist. He was “incredibly anxious as a younger man” – triggers included flying, buses and trains – but things have improved recently. “I’m not teetering on the edge of a panic attack right now, which is a nice feeling.”Nowadays, Matravers is surrounded by “lots of delicate, fragile men like myself, so we all can cry as much as we want”, but in retrospect he thinks he began writing songs at 15 to “make sense of the world because I didn’t know who to talk to”. Growing up on an organic cattle farm near Loughborough, he spent much of his time making music with his older brother. Unlike most of his friends, he didn’t go to university, which he links to the fact “my parents existed outside of mainstream society. My dad had come over from South Africa and never fully assimilated to being here and lived on this farm. They never leave the farm; they’re self-sufficient.” Actually, he may be giving himself a bit too much credit. “To be honest, I couldn’t be bothered to go to uni – it was that sort of energy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Soon after, he formed Easy Life, plugging away with no luck for years and supporting himself by working on a market. Then, in 2017, he released Pockets, a song about failing to make it in the music industry. Ironically, it got him noticed: the band’s lineup was overhauled and they were signed to Island. At 21, Matravers was “receiving more money than I ever thought I would make”.Despite achieving longed-for commercial success, band life was not always healthy. In early interviews, the group claimed to eschew rock star hedonism for tea, lasagne and novels in bed. Now, Matravers says he was “fairly wild” and that the money led him “down a certain path. I’m beating around the bush here – you can read between the lines”. On new song Proximityeffect, he mentions being “black-out drunk on stage” – something he says was happening a lot. The intra-band dynamics were also deteriorating. After the threatened lawsuit, they seriously considered packing it in entirely. “It wasn’t like: oh no, this perfect thing has been destroyed. Being in a band is like being in a dysfunctional family.”That family lost a member last year when bassist Sam Hewitt – a school friend of Matravers and the only remaining member of the original lineup – decided to quit. The lawsuit “gave us all a chance to take a long look at ourselves and ask: is this what I want to do? For Sam, maybe the answer to that was no.” Proximityeffect is mainly about the pair’s fractured friendship, as Matravers hops between antsy confrontation (“What’s up with the unfollow?”) and misty-eyed childhood nostalgia. Has he played the song to Hewitt? “No, I’ve not spoken to Sam for a very long time, sadly. Life sucks without him, he was my best friend.”But Matravers is also not the person he once was. On Tears, he considers how distant he feels from his roots: old pals tell him his accent’s changed; he drinks oat milk now (“I’m from a farm!”). There is a wistfulness, but also a sense of excitement. A lawsuit, a lost friend and brand new beginning: in recent years, Matravers’ life has actually been quite hard, but also thrillingly unpredictable. “I’m so far away from where I started. I would never have guessed a year ago that I’d be here now,” he muses from his bucolic Japanese getaway. “I can’t imagine what next year is going to look like, either.”Onion is released on 18 July.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As well as the glory of victory, they might earn an enviable cash prize, a lucrative record deal or a life-changing career boost. But what about those who finish last? Are they philosophical in defeat or throwing tantrums behind the scenes? We tracked down five TV losers to relive their failure in front of millions, reveal how they recovered from humiliation and share what they learned.‘I should have been more vulnerable, maybe cried’Communication scientist Yin Lü was “murdered” in the opening episode ofthe third series ofThe TraitorsUK.I applied forThe Traitorsbecause it’s a show about communication and social dynamics. That’s my obsession, so it was like the perfect experiment. I took 51kg of luggage. One of my strategies was to utilise my wardrobe. I had jumpers with hearts on, tops with big bows and cute hair accessories for a softer look. I wanted to come across as whimsical to make myself less threatening. I decided not to mention my job and said I worked in marketing.I’d chatted to the sisters, Armani and Maia, on the steam train. With hindsight, I was too high-energy and articulate, which marked my card as a potential threat. When Armani was selected as a Traitor, she became the driving force behind my murder. Summoned to the yellow sofa room, I delayed picking up the murder note for as long as possible and read it slowly. As the words percolated, my heart fell out of my chest. It was very visceral. We were all warned we could be first out and to be prepared. But after you’ve met people and bonded, it’s different.View image in fullscreenMurder capital … Yin Lü (far left) and the 2025 cast of The Traitors.Photograph: Cody Burridge/PAI’m sad I didn’t get to experience a breakfast or a Round Table. It felt as if I’d only had a tiny taster of an extravagant 12-course meal. It was gut-wrenching to watch the series after I was booted off. The missions were brilliant. I would’ve loved to topple that giant Traitor statue. I should’ve been less confident, maybe shown some vulnerability by crying. I also wish I’d volunteered to get off the train. I would’ve loved to descend in a cage and talk my way back into the castle! Rhetoric is my speciality.Millions watched my murder on New Year’s Day. My friends and family thought I was robbed. I went into hibernation mode because the online reaction was too much. It’s astounding how people judge you on a few minutes’ screen time. It felt exposing and knocked my confidence quite substantially. January was hellish. What helped was finding my own voice. I starting posting on social media, evensome silly songsI’d written during my time there.The Traitors fandom pointed out that mine was the earliest exit in all the global editions. So embarrassing. With time, I’ve learned to laugh at it. You can’t take life too seriously, and discover so much more about yourself by losing. I’m still getting recognised and people are always positive. It was a privilege to be part of the show – even if it was for just a flap of a lunar moth’s wing.‘I didn’t leave my hotel room for 24 hours’Journalist, presenter and Loose Women panellist Kaye Adams was thefirst celebrity to be eliminated fromStrictly Come Dancing2022.View image in fullscreenSheer desperation … Kaye Adams on Strictly Come Dancing, series 20.Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBCI was about to turn 60, soStrictlyseemed like a sign from the universe. I secretly wanted a journey of self-discovery. I hoped there was something hidden inside me to bring out – but it turned out there was nothing! My professional partner Kai Widdrington was endlessly patient and encouraging. We invented an alter ego for my flamboyant side named Fifi LaTouche, like some kind of superannuated can-can girl. Sadly she didn’t exist.Our first dance was a tango to Abba. Draped on this bordello-type bar, all I could think was that it looked like grab-a-granny night. It was the most petrifying thing I’d ever done. I genuinely considered hypnotism to overcome my nerves. By week two, I was running on empty. We did a Charleston and I utterly blanked. I had a terrible dress rehearsal, so I was cacking myself. One of the makeup girls had some awful Greek liquor she’d bought back from holiday and I took a shot out of sheer desperation. I thought it might do something to me and it did. It made me worse!I read an article that morning which mullered me. The idea started to eat away that people were laughing at me. As a woman of a certain age, you fear being a laughing stock. There are so many old tropes, like mutton dressed as lamb. I’m not usually seeking that kind of approval but on Strictly, you’re seeking approval on a huge scale in a public vote, like it or not. My mood was very low. By the dance-off against Matt Goss, I was done.Shirley Ballas, the head judge, voted for me to stay. I was grateful because it gave me a tiny bit to walk away with. I was as gutted as I’ve been about anything. I didn’t leave my hotel room for 24 hours. I was embarrassed to go out. It was a much bigger deal, emotionally and psychologically, than I anticipated.When I went back for the group dance in the final, they could easily have hidden me at the back but I opened the routine. I’m still thankful for that, because it gave me some self-respect. The female pros could see how nervous I was they were so sweet and supportive, giving me last-minute tips. It went well, which truly helped me get over it.I was in awe of the whole production but personally, it was quite a sore experience. I’m not a terrible dancer but razzle-dazzle takes such confidence. If you allow negative thoughts to creep in, you’re sunk. You go into these shows hoping for growth but Strictly just confirmed my self-doubts. It was difficult for a long time. I didn’t watch the show for two years out of self-preservation. Abba still trigger me! But you’ve got to be able to fail or you’d never try anything. Now I’m grabbing my 60s by the short and curlies.Kaye Adams’ podcast, How to Be 60, is released bi-weekly and will be live at Edinburgh fringe, 10-12 August‘We went for a stiff drink and laughed about it’Sophie Walker captained Reading University to the final of Christmas University Challenge in 2017, only to lose by a record240-0.View image in fullscreenStarter for 10 … Sophie Walker.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWhen I was asked to go onUniversity Challenge, my immediate thought was ‘Absolutely not. Next!’ But at the time, I was leading the Women’s Equality party and we got very little media coverage. This was a chance to raise awareness of our work, so eventually I said OK. I assumed I’d be there for one round and out.My teammates – anthropologist Anna Machin, naturalist Martin Hughes-Games and gardener Pippa Greenwood – were lovely people who were equally bemused by how they got into this. Other teams were taking it Very Seriously – capital V, capital S – so we agreed to have fun. I was stunned when we got through. We won the next round too and were suddenly in the final. Our opponents were Keble College, Oxford but we were mainly up against Frank Cottrell-Boyce. He knew vast amounts of stuff and was fast on the buzzer. At one point, he answered 10 in a row. I was like, ‘Alright Frank, enough!’ One reason I don’t feel any despair is that he’s a prince among men with an extraordinary brain. I’d invite anybody to go up against Frank and do better.As questions flew past, I remember thinking: ‘I went to a secondary comp in Glasgow – this wasn’t on the syllabus!’ But we still enjoyed ourselves. At one point, Jeremy Paxman told us to stop giggling. The crosser he got with us, the funnier it seemed. When the gong went, we weren’t cowed by our failure. I gathered everybody up, took them for a stiff drink and laughed about it. Pippa and I were invited on Woman’s Hour to discuss being the first team to get no points. There was lots of mickey-taking, not least from my university chums. They were like, ‘Thanks a lot for that!’Leading a start-up political party, looking like an idiot is an everyday risk. I can think of 10 more embarrassing things I did before breakfast the next day. We set a rather unfortunate record, but not everybody can say they’ve got through to the University Challenge final. I’ll take that.‘At least I beat Dustin the Turkey’Andy Abraham was the UK’s entry in the 2008Eurovisionsong contest and came last with only 14 points.View image in fullscreenEuro star … Andy Abraham at the 2008 Eurovision song contest.Photograph: Sari Gustafsson/ShutterstockIt felt great to win Eurovision: Your Decision – although I thought the public were off their heads. My song was soulful, not a Euro-type tune! Michelle Gayle had been bookies’ favourite and was very upset. As soon as the result was announced, she was off. I thought: ‘Wow, be a bit more gracious.’ Representing your country is a big deal. My only worry was being beaten by Dustin the Turkey. Ireland didn’t want the expense of hosting again, so they sent a puppet. Luckily, he was knocked out in the semi-final. At least I did better than the turkey!Serbia was strange. We were escorted everywhere by machine gun-wielding security but my song, Even If, went down a storm in Belgrade nightclubs. They dug it in the arena, too. The crowd danced and sang along, but it didn’t translate to viewers at home. Jean Paul Gaultier came over from the French delegation and said he loved it. I did myself proud. The rest was in the lap of the gods. We had an inkling that political voting might happen. As the results came in, I wasn’t embarrassed. I might’ve been if I’d forgotten the lyrics, stumbled or been off-key but I was over the moon with my performance. No way we deserved to finish that low down.I went to the BBC booth to see Terry Wogan. He was crestfallen and said ‘I’m so sorry.’ I told him: ‘It’s all good.’ We had a few drinks and the UK delegation – Caroline Flack, god rest her soul, Paddy O’Connell and co – had a brilliant time. They didn’t feel let down by me, only by how severe the anti-UK voting was. That year, Terry quit. He said it had gone too far and was no fun any more.Back home, people sympathised because I was hard done by. I’m a working-class boy – before The X Factor, I was a binman – which keeps things in perspective. If music came to an end, I’d just go back to grafting. The only thing I’d do differently is go out there earlier to promote the song. There wasn’t enough momentum behind it. I was also second on the bill, the dreaded slot of death. Maybe if I’d performed last, who knows?Eurovisionwas a career highlight and wonderful experience. I wouldn’t trade it for anything. In fact, I’d do it again. Whenever I perform Even If live, I joke about it and say ‘Thanks for the 14 points, guys!’ The whole room always starts clapping and cheering.”Everything That You Do, the new single by Benjamin Race feat Andy Abraham, is out on 18 July.‘The showstopper stopped my show’Amos Lilley was the first baker to be sent home from The Great British Bake Off 2023.View image in fullscreenReady, steady, go … Amos Lilley (centre back) in series 14 of The Great British Bake Off.Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4It was surreal walking into the famous tent. I’m 6ft 5in, so they made a little plinth to raise my workbench. The opening round was a vertical layer cake. I was nervous, got into my own head and overdid it. By the technical challenge, I felt calm. We made the iconicBake Offcake from the title sequence and mine came second. I felt elated. Maybe it gave me false hope!It was the showstopper that stopped my show. For my animal cake, I made an orca. Why choose a whale? I should’ve done Colin the Caterpillar! I was disappointed with how it turned out and said it ‘looked like a piece of poo’. Even worse, Paul Hollywood called my sponge ‘tough as old boots’. It was horribly tense, awaiting the result. I knew I was in danger but a few of us were. No way I thought I’d be going home.When Noel [Fielding] called my name, I felt myself leave my body. It was my second time applying, so I’d been building up to this for two years. In an instant, the journey was over. Viewers were outraged. I was inundated with messages, which softened the blow. Thanks, Bake Off fans! I’d planned out all 10 weeks – my outfits, my bakes. I’d bought special equipment and stands. When I went back home, I chucked it all away like a diva. Don’t need this! Don’t need that! But the show changed my life. I quit my job. Now I’m setting up my own bakery, Lilley’s Luxurious Cakes. My early exit knocked my confidence but with time, I realised I’d done well to get that far. It’s two people’s opinion and only a TV show. And I got recognised at Abba Voyage last night, so I must’ve made an impression. It was also a landmark episode – Alison Hammond’s first as co-host and it featured Prue Leith’s beaver innuendo. That clip will be replayed for a long time – and I’m one of the people in hysterics.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsStrictly Come DancingEntertainment TVReality TVEurovisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Combining the Beatles’ irreverent cheek, Sex Pistols’ raucous hedonism and Morrissey’s dour Mancunian wit, the Gallagher brothers arrived in 1994 with their comedy act – built around acerbic sibling banter and knowingly ludicrous levels of braggadocio – down pat. For the music press, they really were God’s gift: inone their earliest interviews, Liam informed Melody Maker that he pitied “anyone who doesn’t buy our records,” while Noel insisted they were planning to win the Eurovision song contest with a new number called All Around the World. “It’ll sail it by at least, ooh, 30 points. This is the track to end all tracks.”Oasis split in 2009, but the bon mots that buoyed Britpop and Cool Britannia kept flowing – three decades on from their debut, the brothers’ rivalry, egotism and brutal putdowns still power a significant subsection of our news cycle. You couldn’t claim it overshadowed their music – the majesty of Oasis’s biggest hits drowns out any petty squabbling – but since the band’s heyday ended the Gallaghers have been dealing primarily in persona. When the 1975’s Matty Healy claimed that “the difference between me and Noel is that I do a series of interviews to promote an album, whereas he does an album to promote a series of interviews”, he wasn’t far off.In some ways, the Gallaghers’ lasting legacy is this archetype: the mercilessly funny, unapologetically arrogant yet resolutely down-to-earth British rock star. But as they return to the stage on Friday, does that pisstaking and swagger feel outdated? Or has British music got wretchedly dull and safe without it?In the 1990s, they embodied new laddism – football, pints, loutish demeanour, but make it self-aware – and while their Britpop peers were more sensitive (Damon Albarn later likened them to school bullies), their mouthiness was mirrored in the era’s pop giants including the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams. By the 2000s, it certainly seemed like everybody was reading from the same hymn sheet. An indie scene’s young stars were reared on Oasis (a proto Arctic Monkeys mimed to Morning Glory in primary school assembly; an adorable 18-year-old Pete Doherty informed a news crew that he subscribed “to the Umberto Eco view” of the band in the release day queue for Be Here Now) and were cultivated by a music press scrambling to anoint new headline-generating stars in the Gallagher vein. “Oasis have gone, WE are the biggest band in Britain now,” declared Kasabian on the front of the NME, while Lily Allen’s cover came accompanied by the strapline: “I can’t stop slagging people off!”View image in fullscreenThe great pretenders … Kasabian in 2015.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianFor Allen and a new generation of female singers – Amy Winehouse, Kate Nash, Adele – loudmouthery was practically a prerequisite to success. As Sylvia Patterson put it in this newspaper: “In 2008, it’s still all about the gobby young girls.” Blur v Oasis may have been long dormant at this point, but copycat feuds were being ignited at a rate of knots: Kasabian v Keane; Allen v Cheryl Cole; Winehouse v Dido. Still, nobody had one-liners as perfect as the Gallaghers, from Liam’s assertion that Chris Martin looked like a geography teacher to Noel’s claim that the Libertines resembled “lads with no teeth and their grandad’s hats”.Other artists still don’t match up, but that’s mainly because slagging off other musicians has been largely erased from the rock star playbook. Telling it like it is with an exquisitely comic turn of phrase may seem like harmless fun; in reality, it is usually synonymous with body shaming (or worse). Nowadays, nobody wants to be offensive, nobody wants to traumatise – it’s not cool to be casually cruel, and the combination of virulent online fanbases and cancel culture mean it’s too risky anyway.Oasis’s brand of cocksure self-confidence, though, is in rude health. At last weekend’s Glastonbury, fellow Mancunian Healy (a “slack-jawed fuckwit,” according to Noel) declared himself the “best songwriter of [his] generation,” as graphics mocking his lyrics flashed up on the screens around him. Charli xcx brought the party-starting egomania, while CMAT declared she had “an amazing ass and the best Irish country rock’n’roll band in the world.” A group of working-class, betracksuited lads who like drugs, pubs and incendiary jokes performed one of the festival’s most popular sets.View image in fullscreenSelf-confidence … CMAT performing at Glastonbury.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockAnd yetKneecapare in many ways the inverse of Oasis. While Noel has been busy lambasting Glastonbury as “woke”, “preachy” and “virtue-signalling”, the Belfast band doubled-down on their protest against the genocide in Gaza, while maintaining their original MO of promoting Irish language and culture. In fact, this year’s festival proved that the no-fucks-given gobbiness of Oasis has been redirected to earnestly expressed humanitarianism. The outspoken, straight-talking indie musician Nadine Shah read out an open letter in support of Palestine Action, while Kate Nash generated column inches with her expletive-laden tirade against JK Rowling and transphobia (which “is not fucking feminist”), something CMAT has also spoken passionately against.Now, you might argue, is not the time for rock stars in the Oasis mould: empty bluster and nasty (if amusing) zingers directed at peers isn’t exactly fun escapism in the Trumpian age. Yet the Gallaghers did stand for something. One accusation directed towards Oasis is that they made guitar music blander, and you could say they did the same for the rock star persona, too. They were never boring, but beyond the banter there was nothing particularly wild or weird about them; they were missing the Beatles’s zaniness, Sex Pistols’ radical sneer, Morrissey’s intellectual snobbery.However, in the wake of the upwardly mobile 1980s, they exemplified and glorified run-of-the-mill life and run-of-the-mill people: like much of the best British culture, they made normality seem valuable and worthwhile. Oasis always aimed to be accessible – in that Melody Maker interview, Noel said he made music for “the guy who walks down the street to get his copy of the fucking Daily Mirror and his 20 Bensons every day, and who’s got fuck all going for him”. He and Liam grew up on a council estate. In a rock and pop scene currently dominated by the middle classes and graduates of the Brit school, it is hard to find an equivalent trajectory.What would British culture be like if Oasis had never existed? | Dorian LynskeyRead moreThis is just one reason the search for the new Oasis – once the chief preoccupation of a now severely diminished music press – has ground to a halt, for better (no more bullying jibes) or worse (no more jokes). One consolation: despite their wealth and fame, Liam and Noel have stayed as consistent and normal as you might reasonably hope; they didn’t move to LA, they didn’t find enlightenment, they didn’t become right-wing edgelords (for all that Noel occasionally grumbles about the left) and they haven’t got entirely lost in their own legend (just before Oasis split, Noel described his guitar playing as “average at best”). We may not have any worthy successors to what many consider the platonic ideal of British rock stardom, but for this summer at least, we do still have Oasis.Explore more on these topicsOasisPop and rockKneecapcommentShareReuse this content"

There wasn’t much to read – the prose is what’s now called “spare” – but I vividly remember the pleasure of poking a finger through the holes punched in the page. And that final twist!My favourite book growing upI was a fanatical member of the Puffin Club at school, and so many of those books embedded themselves in me; E Nesbit’s Dragons, Narnia, of course, the Molesworth books, which I barely understood and found hysterical. But my favourite were Tove Jansson’s Moomins, particularly the chilly later books, with their very particular melancholy. Other books seemed to be reaching for laughter or excitement, but there was a pleasure in all that sadness and solitude.The book that changed me as a teenagerGreat Expectationswas my first “proper classic” and I was tremendously pleased with myself for getting through it, and startled, too, by how familiar the characters felt. The foolishness, the passionate friendships, the empty aspiration and unrequited love, it all made perfect sense to me, even across 120 years.The book that made me want to be a writerI’m not sure if I ever dared voice that ambition, even to myself, but I remember laughing hysterically at Sue Townsend’sThe Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4,and thinking what an achievement that would be, to make a reader laugh with marks on a page. In many ways, the early 80s was a golden age of comic writing but so much of it had a rather rather self-satisfied Oxbridge tone. Suddenly, here was an authentic working-class voice, writing with an almost supernatural such precision and insight into the teenage boy’s mindset. I loved it and, as with Great Expectations, turned the pages thinking “How does the author know?The book or author I came back toI’m a little nervous to admit this but I used to struggle with Jane Austen, recognising her subtlety and brilliance but finding that ironic tone a little relentless and, despite many attempts, never making it to the end. But in lockdown I picked upPersuasionand finally, after 40 years of trying, something fell into place.The book I rereadIf I ever find myself stuck or jaded, I pick up Marilynne Robinson’sHousekeeping. The prose is just perfect, that atmosphere of a water-logged small town so vivid. There’s a warmth and generosity of spirit, particularly in the character of Aunt Sylvie, I find incredibly moving. I feel sure that it’s one of the very best American novels.The book I could never read againI’ve been lucky enough to adapt several of my favourite novels for the screen, but the process is prolonged, intricate and exhausting. The patient never survives the operation and I struggle to imagine the circumstances in which I would ever pick upFar from the Madding Crowdagain.The book I discovered later in lifeI’m so pleased that Helen Garner is getting the praise and attention she deserves. I love her wonderfully frank and spiky diaries and nonfiction but there are two very different novels of hers that I think about all the time.The Spare Roomis a tough, unsentimental book about the demands and limits of friendship.The Children’s Bachis wildly different, a spare, moving portrait of a loving family falling apart. Those final pages!The book I am currently readingI tend to read two books at a time, one fiction and one nonfiction. Yiyun Li’s memoir,Things in Nature Merely Grow, is extraordinarily wise, thoughtful and affecting, and the best case I can think of for the power of the written word. Alongside that, I’m reading the wonderfulThe Country Girls, my first Edna O’Brien but not my last.My comfort readAnita Brookner. There are no big narrative surprises – someone will inevitably be disappointed in a west London mansion block – but she’s a great prose stylist, often very funny and sharp and undoubtedly underrated.You Are Here by David Nicholls is published in paperback by Sceptre.

Isherwood’s point of departure is the profound sense of dissociation induced by grief, and in casting a dancer, former Royal Ballet principalEd Watson, as George’s body, and singer-songwriterJohn Grantas his mind, Watkins at a stroke shows us his riven, dislocated self: Watson on the ground, Grant raised on a platform, motion and music operating on different planes.If Grant’s voice is always fluent, even mellifluous, moving from low growl through easy baritone and even up to eerie countertenor, Watson’s body begins blocked – all angle and effort, no flow. On one level, the piece is the story of its unblocking, through the reawakening of desire: there’s a tennis match that morphs into homoerotic fantasy; there are passionate memories of his dead lover Jim (Jonathan Goddard); a drunken evening with old friend Charley (Kristen McNally), who has desires of her own; and finally a baptismal night-swimming escapade with a student, Kenny (James Hay), that plunges George back into the waters of life.On another level, it is an enactment of Isherwood’s main plot points as he recounts a day in the life of a university teacher – though here, you might do well to read a synopsis in advance, to be able to place the settings and the secondary characters, or to follow their interweaving of action, recollection and imagination.There’s a varied and talented creative team. Holly Waddington and Eleanor Bull’s costumes flip from 60s Americana to abstract-expressionist leotards as the dance ensemble transform between portraying specific characters and generic human beings, gathered into choruses of yearning, desire or defiance. Chiara Stephenson has created a superb set, able to indicate kitchen, bathroom, bar or classroom, and semi-concealing Jasmin Kent Rodgman’s instrumental ensemble, who set the mood-music between Grant’s songs.Does it gel, though? Intermittently. Rodgman and Grant’s music often feel at odds with each other, and the choreography, though finely danced, seems more to pursue Isherwood’s text than to find its own rhythms. The end, which I won’t give away, does veer from the text but opts for comfort and closure where Isherwood had left us before a more open, unflinching vision, not of grief but of mortality.At Aviva Studios, Manchester, until 6 July;Linbury theatre, London, 8-20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceEdward WatsonChristopher IsherwoodBalletreviewsShareReuse this content"

A former arts adviser to the federal government also told Guardian Australia that the CEO should step down.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailCallum Morton, professor of fine art at Monash University who chaired the selection panel for the 2017 biennale, said he did not believe the current selection process – where the chief executive, informed by a panel of experts, makes the final decision – was flawed.It was a process that delivered last year’s Archie Moore exhibition at Venice, which won the Golden Lion, he pointed out.But Morton added that a series of “kneejerk reactions that caved into baseless scaremongering” on the part of the executive and board ultimately betrayed the artist.“It speaks to a CEO and board who frankly didn’t seem to understand or at least trust the power and complexity of the visual arts,” Morton said.“I think the conversation should be less about the process and more about how we choose board members, so that the right industry experts are given proper place and a voice to advise on these matters.“This will help boards avoid these self-inflicted crises that hurt artists and arts workers and embarrass our reputation nationally and internationally.”The Blackhall & Pearl report also expressed surprise that Creative Australia management had not requested a contentious issue report into the selected artist, given this appeared to be standard practice in the organisation’s other grant and investment decisions.Another senior arts figure told Guardian Australia that although a panel of experts acting in an advisory capacity recommended Sabsabi for Venice, “either way, it was Adrian Collette, the CEO of Creative Australia, who made the final decision”.“Firstly, he’s got no visual arts expertise. Secondly, the board doesn’t seem to have been involved in the deliberations at all,” they said.“This is the most important thing Creative Australia does – it’s the biggest decision they make. You would expect the CEO to have appropriate expertise, and the board to be fully engaged. That simply didn’t happen.”Creative Australia apologises to Khaled Sabsabi for ‘hurt and pain’ after Venice Biennale reinstatementRead moreProf Jo Caust, a principal fellow at the University of Melbourne’s school of culture and communication, said the Blackhall & Pearl report highlighted serious problems with governance at Creative Australia.“If you look at the current board, some are arts people, but some clearly are not,” Caust said. “You need people who understand the sector, who can stand up and be counted.”The Blackhall & Pearl report did not identify a failure of process, governance or decision on the part of the Creative Australia board, but said that “with the benefit of hindsight there are things the Board might have done differently”.Whether the board erred in its decision to decommission Sabsabi was an assessment outside the scope of its terms of reference, the report said, but added that it believed “the board and Creative Australia are able to learn from this exercise and be better prepared should a similar situation arise in future”.Guardian Australia has requested comment from Collette and the acting chair of the Creative Australia board, Wesley Enoch.Explore more on these topicsCreative AustraliaAustralian artVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, in details revealed today, visitors will be able to order up items to look at closely, while V&A archivists and star curators will make selections to go on display in a series of rotating showcases. Tickets will be free.Nile Rodgers, the Chic bandleader and guitarist who worked with Bowie on the hit album Let’s Dance, has curated one of these areas, with items including correspondence between the two, studio images taken by Peter Gabriel during the making of Bowie’s Rodgers-assisted 1993 album Black Tie White Noise, and a bespoke suit designed by Peter Hall for the Serious Moonlight tour.“My creative life with David Bowie provided the greatest success of his incredible career, but our friendship was just as rewarding,” Rodgers said, announcing the partnership. “Our bond was built on a love of the music that had both made and saved our lives.”View image in fullscreenGuest curators the Last Dinner Party marvel at items in the Bowie archive.Photograph: Timothy Eliot Spurr/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonAlso playing guest curators are the members of chart-topping alt-pop band the Last Dinner Party, whose selections include handwritten lyrics for the Young Americans album, studio photos by Mick Rock and – rather nerdishly – the manual for Bowie’s EMS synth, heard on the so-called Berlin trilogy of albums.“David Bowie continues to inspire generations of artists like us to stand up for ourselves,” the band said in a joint statement. “When we first started developing ideas for TLDP, we took a similar approach to Bowie developing his Station to Station album – we had a notebook and would write words we wanted to associate with the band. It was such a thrill to explore Bowie’s archive, and see first-hand the process that went into his world-building and how he created a sense of community and belonging for those that felt like outcasts or alienated – something that’s really important to us in our work too.”Rodgers and the band’s choices will be included in an area featuring items that are rotated every six months or so, with fresh guest curators each time.There will also be eight other sections showcasing around 200 Bowie items curated by the V&A team in collaboration with young people from the neighbouring London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest, with each area refreshed every few years.These will include a look at Bowie’s unrealised projects, such as film tie-ins with the Diamond Dogs and Young Americans albums, and even a mooted adaptation of George Orwell’s 1984. Other areas will spotlight iconic moments such as his 1987 Glass Spider tour, his collaborations with bassist Gail Ann Dorsey and the creation of the Ziggy Stardust persona.View image in fullscreenSketch for a film version of Diamond Dogs, which was never made.Photograph: © The David Bowie ArchiveTM/Victoria and Albert Museum, LondonThere will also be an interactive installation tracing Bowie’s impact on pop cultural figures from Issey Miyake to Lady Gaga, and a film compiling live performances across his career.What will really provoke Bowie fans’ fascination, though, is seeing objects up close, “including costumes, musical instruments, models, props and scenery” according to the V&A. Visitors will be able to book to see five items each visit, with two weeks’ notice, using the V&A’s “order an object” service. Bookings will begin in September.More than 70,000 of the archive items are photographic prints, negatives and transparencies, and these, along with other paper-based items – “notebooks, diaries, lyrics, scripts, correspondence, project files, writings, unrealised projects, cover artwork, designs, concept drawings, fanmail and art” – will also be available to view by special appointment.The V&A first acquired Bowie’s archive in 2023, with director Tristram Hunt promising the David Bowie Centre would be a “new sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow”.Fancy a masterpiece? Just pop one in your basket! V&A’s new open-access outpost will thrill art-loversRead moreHe and his team will hope the centre will be a major tourist draw to its new V&A East Storehouse, which opened in May in the Olympic Park, Stratford. Like the David Bowie Centre within it, the building showcases items from the V&A’s collection, and allows visitors to book to see other items close up.“We wanted it to feel like an immersive cabinet of curiosities,” the building’s architect Liz Diller told the Guardian. “So you land right in the middle, at the very heart of the building, flipping the usual progression from public to private.”The Guardian’s architecture criticOliver Wainwright saidthe buildings gives “a thrilling window into the sprawling stacks of our national museum of everything”, while art criticJonathan Jones saidin a five star review: “This is what the museum of the future looks like – an old idea that’s now been turned inside out, upside down, disgorging its secrets, good and bad, in an avalanche of beautiful questions, created with curiosity, generous imagination and love.”Another V&A outpost in the Olympic Park, the more traditional gallery space of V&A East Museum, will open in spring 2026.Explore more on these topicsMusicDavid BowieV&AMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

When installed in the early 1900s, however, many Parisiens were scandalised.One critic declared the green paint “un-French” and another said the ornate signs were “confusing to children trying to learn their letters … and stupefying to foreigners”.Art nouveau went out of fashion, and by 1913 the transport authorities had dropped Guimard’s designs. By 1942, when Guimard died aged 75 in New York, where he and his American Jewish wife had sought refuge from the Nazis, he had already been forgotten and much of his work consigned to the scrap heap.“It may be surprising to foreign visitors but the French have never really liked art nouveau,” said Fabien Choné, a Guimard collector and head ofHector Guimard Diffusion, a company involved in establishing the new museum. “There was great opposition to Guimard’s Métro entrances. While visitors saw them as marvellous symbols of the belle époque Métro, Parisians criticised it as what they called spaghetti style and couldn’t understand why tourists liked them.”View image in fullscreenA Métro station entrance on the boulevard Pasteur by Hector Guimard, circa 1900.Photograph: Roger Viollet/Getty ImagesOn returning to Paris in 1948, his widow, Adeline, an artist whose work had been displayed at the 1899 Beaux-Arts salon, worked tirelessly to preserve and promote her husband’s legacy, which included about 50 residential buildings.She donated his drawings and smaller creations, including furniture, to museums, many of them in the US, and offered to bequeath the couple’s art nouveau home, the Hôtel Guimard, and its contents to the state and then to the city. Both turned down the offer and the building was converted into flats with the furnishings scattered.In the wave of modernism that swept post-warEuropethe style was sober and many Guimard creations were declared without historic or artistic value and destroyed. Of the 167 Métro entrances that he designed – described by Salvador Dalí, who painted Tribute to Guimard in 1970, as divine – only 88 remain.Choné said: “After the war, each time the city did any work on the streets, they got rid of Guimard’s designs. Even up until the 1960s to 70s the logic was one of destruction rather than preservation.”View image in fullscreenAbbesses station in Montmartre, Paris.Photograph: UlyssePixel/AlamyThe museum will be established at the Hôtel Mezzara, a four-storey building in Paris’s 16th arrondissement designed by Guimard in 1910 and which features much of his signature ironwork, including a spectacular glass skylight and chandeliers.The building, originally commissioned by Guimard’s friend Paul Mezzara, a rich textile manufacturer from Venice and later acquired by the education ministry and used as student accommodation until a decade ago, will undergo a €6m (£5.2m), two-year renovation before opening around the end of 2027.Once open it will display known Guimard creations including art nouveau furniture and decorations as well as an archive of his designs and documents.“It is absurd that there is recognition of Guimard at museums around the world, especially in the US, and nothing in Paris when he created some of the most important symbols of the city,” Choné said.Nicolas Horiot, an architect and the president ofLe Cercle Guimard, an association created 23 years ago to save Guimard’s designs and documents, said it had been a decade-long battle to get the state and Paris authorities to recognise the designer’s work. He said the museum would right a historic wrong.“After the second world war, Guimard was completely forgotten. Art nouveau no longer interested people in the urban design of the 1960s and many of his pieces were destroyed,” he said. “The revival started in 1970 with an exhibition in New York, but it was a step-by-step process. We see this museum as repairing an injustice done to Guimard.”Explore more on these topicsFranceParisArchitectureMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Initially, it’s more like Nil By Mouth, as she encounters unpleasantly opinionated cabbies and neighbours in the throes of a violent, abusive marriage. Romantic salvation seems to arrive in the shape of Will Sharpe’s winsome indie rocker Felix. But is he really all he seems? Written byLena Dunhamand Luis Felber, this comedy is delightfully unafraid to shred both the stuck-up Britons and the gormless American interlopers. And Stalter, who is equal parts bratty and brittle, carries the show superbly.Netflix, from Thursday 10 JulyJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside StoryView image in fullscreenOpen wide! … Jaws being filmed at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts.Photograph: Universal Studios Licensing LLCOne working title for Peter Benchley’s novel was, apparently, What’s That Noshing on My Leg?. Thankfully, the snappier eventual title, Jaws, caught the eye of director Steven Spielberg and nothing was quite the same again.This documentaryis a deep dive into one of the most commercially and creatively successful films of all time. It never holds back on detail – there’s even a marine biologist on hand – but it’s also full of entertaining anecdotes and strong on the emotional dynamics of the film and how its suspense-building techniques created a whole new cinematic language.Disney+, from Friday 11 JulyThe Facebook Honeytrap: Catching a KillerView image in fullscreenA remarkable story … The Facebook Honeytrap: Catching a Killer.Photograph: Amazon Amazon Amazon undefinedThis film explores the circumstances surrounding the death of British woman Christine Robinson, who was raped and murdered at a safari lodge in South Africa in 2014. Robinson’s niece Lehanne took it upon herself to hunt her aunt’s killer remotely. She located the suspect online, created a fake profile and began a long-distance relationship with Andrea Imbayarwo, who had, by this time, fled the country.

A hefty 152 years have passed since the events of 2023’s second season but the show remains both visually striking and conceptually ambitious.

However, when his deception is discovered, he learns that instead he’s dooming his family to a half-life in the terrifying, lawless Outer World.

The stakes for language here – who is allowed to bear witness, and who is not – are high. The book’s opening section also includes scenes of near drowning, parental bullying, breakages, loss and childish torturing of animals. Only gradually do we realise we’re being prepared for the second section, Palace, in which Antigone mourns the death of her brother; as the poet mourns the brother who is her book’s dedicatee. This vivid collection forces us to witness the violence inherent in grief. Mourning may be socially inconvenient; Mouth opens up some of the space it needs. But by the end of the book, set at Cley nature reserve, bereavement has been neither resolved nor made tenable.View image in fullscreenThe Anchorageby Bernard O’Donoghue (Faber, £12.99)These masterly portraits of rural Irish farming life, and of community life in Oxford, explore place, time and belonging; they are full of human feeling, yet never sentimental. Walking the Land tells how the family farm was sold off, “that cold March of 1962”, and lovingly lists old field names that mean nothing to the “shrewd and thoughtful men” lining up to buy it. In the title poem’s study in neighbourliness, “all the farmers in the parish” rally round to replace a year’s hay harvest lost in a barn fire. Such interconnected kindness matters, O’Donoghue shows us, yet cannot “repair the loss” of the chained dog burned along with the barn. A collection valedictory in tone and full of dedications, homages and memories reminds us that, after the craic is over, we will all be “free to pack up and make for home”.GuaracarabyFawzia Muradali Kane(Carcanet, £12.99)Kane is also an architect, so it’s no surprise that place and its meanings are central to her new collection. Guaracara is named for the river in south Trinidad where her title sequence of prose poems is set. These compelling snapshots from a rural childhood spent between that “iridescent, slow moving” polluted river, a railway, and a shanty town known as The Line, show us the strangeness of living under quarantine in a different epidemic: the polio that “closed the islands down in 1971 and ’72”. A dreamlike sense of normality suspended, as well as of childhood’s intrinsic strangeness, pervades the collection. A feeling of nightmare is used to fierce political effect in the book’s central sequence, Let Us Mourn the Death of King Sugar, which addresses plantation history in the author’s native Trini Creole.Bunting’s Honeyby Moya Cannon (Carcanet, £11.99)Cannon is an artist of delicacy and detail. Her seventh collection returns to Galway, where she’s spent much of her adult life. It’s a landscape of intimate knowledge: a “July meadow … the blurry, summery sway of it” in Monet in Árann, or hail showers “striding” across the horizon of a January dawn. But this isn’t sentimental nostalgia. Alongside glimpses of France, Italy and China, Cannon shows how the figures in her home landscape are shaped by violence, poverty and suffering; and grieves for her own family history. Illegitimacy and hiring fairs, starvation and emigration, workhouses and “the three girls in my year / who didn’t return to school”: she reminds us that, even among the “silver-rimmed” lochs and holy mountains, human suffering is the real story.Old WorldbyRobert Crawford (Jonathan Cape, £13)Crawford’s first collection in seven years is a gallimaufry of literary games and allusions; it is also ecological poetry of great intelligence and sensitivity. Both are projects to wrench open our thinking about the climate crisis. Old World Emblems plays with font, turning classical archetypes – Sisyphus, Prometheus – literally inside out. Eliot’s The Waste Land structures The West Land, a lament for climate change. The medieval proverb that “measure is treasure” introduces an extinction reckoning; the title sequence’s 66 haiku count down the planet’s path to ecological destruction along with the 66 years of the poet’s life. Conspicuous among fresh and airy haiku, a prose hybrid Essaythalamium, addressed to a young couple, concludes that “life’s one lasting meaning” is love. Conventional religion may be an “Obsolete Broken Angel”, but the crucifix in the Anglo-Saxon Dream of the Rood can be reread as a living tree. Life, and poetry, do go on.View image in fullscreenJoy Is My Middle Nameby Sasha Debevec-McKenney (Fitzcarraldo, £12.99)Among the first collections to be published by Fitzcarraldo, this debut fits the publisher’s often modernist and experimental house style in ways that feel refreshing for UK poetry. Titles such as THE STARS OF THE FAST & FURIOUS FRANCHISE HAVE A CLAUSE IN THEIR CONTRACTS THAT SAYS THEY CAN NEVER LOSE A FIGHT introduce poems that are themselves fast and furious. These are smash-and-grab raids on a North American life of creative writing programmes and “people … at the farmers’ market being very specific / about their mushroom selection”; of cold chicken wings for breakfast and statues to racist presidents. Sexy and exciting, they read like riffs and mug like rants: but, as this brainy poet grapples middle-class mores to the ground, they can also be extremely funny.Fiona Sampson’s Becoming George: The Self-Invention of a Novelist will be published by Doubleday in February 2026.Explore more on these topicsBooksPoetry roundupPoetryreviewsShareReuse this content"

That novel was told through a young child’s limited perspective, so daily life was described vividly – almond trees and coloured kaftans – while bigger issues, such as why she didn’t see her father, remained vague and mysterious.Some 30 years later, Freud has returned to the same narrator, Lucy. But in this accomplished new novel, she explores how Lucy grows up and starts to question the impact of her unconventional upbringing. My Sister and Other Lovers opens with teenage Lucy, her mother and sister once again on the move. It’s the 1970s, her mother has a new son from another failed relationship, and they are on a ferry to Ireland, as they have no money and nowhere else to go.Bohemian rootlessness in Morocco at least meant sunshine, but this is an altogether murkier existence. The family wait for buses in the rain, hitch lifts, share rooms in communal houses. Walls are cracked, carpets moth-eaten. Even a stay in a Scottish manor seems feral and dangerous: the girls eat tinned ravioli off the floor, play lethal games on frozen lakes, and roam in packs with other unsupervised teens.The book occupies an interesting grey area between novel and memoir, creating something all of its ownSensing opportunity, men sniff about the sisters: they are girls without boundaries, grateful for any attention. This is a pre-#MeToo, pre-internet, pre-smartphone world. Messages are left on answering machines. Letters are left with pub barmen. Children are left with strangers. “I love your mother,” says one of Lucy’s friends later. “Remember how she never minded what we did?”Once, the family stay at a farm where they are woken by screaming because the farm dog has killed its own puppies. The mother briskly tells her daughters that the dog did it “for their own good”. This is the book’s main concern: the damage that can be done to children by their parents.Both Lucy and her author seek to understand rather than condemn. We learn that Lucy’s mother had kept her daughters secret from her Irish parents, preferring the hardship of a rackety life to the risk of ending up in an institution for unmarried mothers. Her defiance is admirable, but her refusal to conform has consequences, especially for elder sister Bea, who is preyed upon by one of her mother’s boyfriends. One of the darkest elements of the novel is the mother’s refusal to believe Bea. “How could she remember? She was only six years old!”In the absence of a stable family, the relationship between the sisters becomes vital – and is beautifully drawn. Furious Bea is determined to make her escape, while Lucy is desperate to keep them together. Lucy is an appealing narrator, both as a sensitive teenager and later as a young mother, aware of her own failings: “I’d searched for a family with every job I’d done. How often I’d adopted one, only to find it more precarious than my own. I’d chosen men – I was starting to discover this – loved them in direct relation to how likely they were to leave.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It has three parts, each showing Lucy and Bea at different points in their lives, but doesn’t provide dates. Some characters appear in all three sections, but others simply vanish; unusual in a novel, yet close to the way life really is. Similarly, the decision not to name either parent in the book – they are always “mother” or “father” – seems both a refusal to identify them and a refusal to fictionalise.Intriguingly, Freud also explores the impact of sharing your family story. Bea ends up making a film about their childhood (as Hideous Kinky was made into a film starring Kate Winslet) and, in an interview, tells a journalist she “never felt safe”. This public exposure infuriates their mother. “Write and tell them it’s not true,” she demands.It’s especially interesting as Lucy, our narrator, who we may have assumed is a stand-in for Freud, is here left to wonder why Bea’s version of events is the one accepted as truth, while her memories remain private. There are, the novel suggests, multiple versions of every family story – even the one we are reading. It’s a fascinating tangle of fact and fiction that refuses easy answers, and a subtle, clever, evocative book.My Sister and Other Lovers by Esther Freud is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

Like the first film, it is based on the original BBC drama (the second series, in fact) and Brian Donleavy is back as Quatermass himself: the brusque, unsmiling American rocket scientist working closely with the British government and permanently exasperated with them.Once again, Quatermass finds himself at the centre of a deadly alien attempt to take over Planet Earth. While debating whether or not to fire a nuclear powered rocket up into space, Quatermass comes into contact with a woman whose boyfriend has been injured by what appear to be football-sized meteorites, which his white-coated assistants have been already tracking on their radar scopes. It appears that these sinister rocks are marking the skin of those humans unlucky enough to come into contact with them, the victims becoming brainwashed by the aliens.These aliens have already infiltrated humanity so extensively that there is a top-secret conspiracy at the heart of the government to develop a vast secure facility in the remote English countryside, supposedly to develop synthetic food but really to nurture the invaders. The Shell Haven oil refinery in the Thames estuary doubles as this eerily vast domed complex – some audacious action sequences result – while director Val Guest has at his disposal some classic British character acting talent, with William Franklyn and Bryan Forbes as Quatermass’s assistants.The extended shootout at the end accounts for this sequel’s bigger budget, although overall it drags a bit. It’s good to see Sidney James as the chucklingly inebriated journalist who Quatermass thinks might come in useful to print the truth; sadly, we never find out if his paper ever actually published the sensational story he was dictating down the phone.Quatermass 2 is in UK cinemas from 6 July, and is on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 14 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsBBCTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I am trying to write a lot of stuff’Read moreHare feared his temperament too sensitive for the very-public and judged medium of theatre. Grace Pervades, his 32nd full-length play, at the age of 78, is an amused and bemused meditation on why he – and his characters – put themselves through it to the extent that Irving died of an actual coronary very soon after acting one. In what also feels like an autobiographical grace note to Hare’s many state of the nation plays, someone bemoans “the stupid English sense of humour that stops them doing anything.”The 25 scenes spanning 1878-1966 allow Hare a wry anthology of theatrical attitudes. He can rarely have won a bigger laugh than when Terry delicately suggests Sir Henry might tweak his technique to look at other actors rather than the audience when speaking. Ellen’s son, Edward Gordon Craig, the theatrical equivalent of architects who would rather sketch buildings than erect them, confides, after three years of Moscow rehearsals: “Ideally, we would never open.” Irving’s life is theatre; Terry prefers living. An in-joke has Sir Henry refusing to stage the “ridiculous” As You Like It; Fiennes, in a season as an Irvingesque actor-manager, directs it on this Bath stage next month.View image in fullscreenSmoothly moves between locations … Grace Pervades at Theatre Royal Bath.Photograph: Marc BrennerGrace Pervades’ director Jeremy Herrin and designer Bob Crowley smoothly move between multiple locations from Russia via the Cafe Royal to Wolverhampton. There is sometimes the bio-drama fault that everyone is historical: a ballet interlude introduces Isadora Duncan, who’s sleeping with one character, while another laments she has just been “frigged” and dumped by Vita Sackville-West. Such, though, were these circles.Much as aristocrats in modern period dramas are made to sound less posh than they were to avoid alienating the audience, the actors, in the performance extracts, play down the more histrionic acting style of those times. Although Terry, in a dressing room teasing scene, mimics what Victorians really heard – Irving’s Shylock booming “cut-throat dog” as “cut-thrut dug” – Fiennes finds a vegan alternative to his honeyed ham. This sensibly avoids satirising the hero but also allows Fiennes, a poetic but naturalistic speaker of exceptional clarity, to treat us to flashes of Malvolio, Cardinal Wolsey and Hamlet. Raison’s vignettes as Beatrice and Portia showcase both Terry’s talent and her own.Irving disapproved of new plays – Fiennes speaks the name of George Bernard Shaw as if it were the period expletive, “Pshaw!” – and so would never have staged Grace Pervades, but it is a work of considerable intelligence and elegance in which he and Terry could have given great pleasure, as does Hare.At Theatre Royal Bath until 19 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, their last label joked that their tracks were “perfect for Balearic DJs”. But the project actually has its roots far away from the flurry of the white isle: many of the songs were made from a kitchen table in a Greater London suburb where the duo are based.Made up of wife and husband Naomi Pieris and Ronan MT (ddwy means “two” in Welsh), the project was born in 2020 from Covid-era home experiments. Their tracks conserve that intimacy: layered around guitars, percussion and washes of synths, Pieris’s vocals are soft and half-murmured, while field recordings are drawn from visits to her native Sri Lanka and voicemails from relatives.Some of their material has an almost ambient quality – spacious, drumless – but other parts adopt more of a club sensibility, drawing on progressive and deep house. In the years since those early lockdown jams, the pair have gone on to release a small handful of records which they perform live at clubs and beachside festivals across Europe, as well as dimly lit DIY venues closer to home.On their new EP Beaming Backwards, ddwy continue to explore these (interlocking, rather than clashing) sides. Alongside the pulsing late-night rollers (Beaming Backwards, Peak Smile), there’s a blissed-out downtempo moment (Stars, Stars), and a gorgeous take on a Sri Lankan lullaby, complete with piano and strings (Heuldro’r Haf – Welsh for “summer solstice”). It’s the perfect soundtrack for this time of year, when the days are still long and the nights are still warm: sweet, but a bit melancholy too.Safi BugelThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenUniverse-sharpening … Mammo.Photograph: Publicity imageMammo – TractionOne of six universe-sharpening tracks on the Dutch producer’s stunning new album, this has the ethereal throb of dub techno’s greats, but with counter-rhythms inveigling themselves from the edges.​George Riley – SlowAfter recent appearances on tracks from Logic1000, HiTech andSherelle, one of UK dance’s best vocalists keeps the werk rate high with this exquisite house track, Riley holding back from a too-intoxicating romance.Oasis – Acquiesce (Unplugged)As the band play their first reunion tour date tonight in Cardiff – follow the Guardian’s live blog later! – Noel Gallagher has brilliantly remixed a version of their classic B-side, making it more insistent and grooving.Ethel Cain – Fuck Me EyesNot what a Yorkshire person says when it’s a bit bright out, but rather pulp fiction done as a synthpop power ballad, about a wayward young woman who “goes to church straight from the clubs”.View image in fullscreenJohn Glacier performing at Glastonbury festival.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images​John Glacier– Fly With MeComing after an excellent Glastonbury set, and rolling over a distorted head-nodding beat, the British rapper casts herself as a supernaturally powerful figure transcending earthly bonds thanks to her own skill.Perfect 100 – SundayThe debut single from this solo​ grunge-pop project by Brooklyn’s Andrew Madore is a ripper, with distorted guitar ​reminiscent of Yo La Tengo or Dinosaur Jr, and​ harmonised vocals adding a dash of vanilla sweetness.Naemi – Hutchison​Closing out their gorgeous new dream-pop album Breathless, Shorn, this track features acoustic guitar and bass motifs repeating around bird-chirrups and reverb: one for post-picnic snoozing this summer.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistElectronic musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are footpaths and bridle paths across the Leas, so it attracts cyclists, dog walkers and runners all year round. The local parkrun uses the paths and it must be one of the most scenic in the country. The rock stacks along the coast are a great place for spotting cormorants, fulmars and kittiwakes among others. No matter the weather I love to walks these paths and feel the fresh sea breeze through my hair.

The area from Crail to St Andrews is of particular beauty, with several gorgeous places to stop for lunch, such asCambo Gardens cafenear Kingsbarns and the Cheesy Toast Shack at East Sands in St Andrews. There are loads of places to stay and use as a base to explore the region. The larch-clad cabins atKinkell Byreoffer the opportunity to rest in style.

The stunning Trwyn Du lighthouse looks out to Puffin Island, and if you’re lucky, one might fly right past you. But we have seen even more magic there when it gets dark. If conditions are just right, the waves light up electric blue with bioluminescent plankton as they crash over the pebbles.

This extraordinary place of sea-sucked mudflats, salt marsh and vast skies is cut off daily at high tide. I cross the causeway in May when the sea pinks (sea thrift) are flowering and the air is bright with the cries of birds – oystercatchers, curlew and redshanks. It feels remote, but in the 18th century Sunderland Point was a bustling port for Lancaster’s transatlantic trade, which brought prosperity but also inhumanity. A walk round the peninsula leads to the grave of an unknown child slaveabandoned here in 1736, now adorned by visitors with painted stones. Its bleak beauty will break your heart.Morag Reavleyskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Culmore Point is where Derry’s River Foyle meets the North Atlantic. Some days you can see a line in the water where the silt-filled Foyle meets the sea. Beautiful old-money houses look out across the water to a power station and chemical plant. Farther downstream the weird treeless landscape of the reclaimed land of Eglinton Embankment catches the eye. Spare a thought too for the young men who trained on these river beaches in May 1944 for the Normandy assaults a month later.KeiranFossils, tidal flats and birds in MerseysideView image in fullscreenHilbre Island at the mouth of the Dee estuary.Photograph: Jason Wells/AlamyFrom West Kirby on Wirral, you can walk across the tidal flats of the Dee estuary to the red sandstone formations of Little Eye, Middle Eye, and Hilbre Island, a string of uninhabited islands offering naught but spectacular nature. In summer you can spot grey seals hauling themselves on to sandbanks, and three types of terns (common, little and sandwich) darting past. Listen out for skylarks and meadow pipits too. For an extra challenge, search for the Triassic-era Chirotherium footprint. Always check tide times carefully, and for extra awe, time your return to the sun setting low, framed by the distant Welsh hills.SarahA cycle by the sea in AberdeenshireView image in fullscreenThe art deco tea pavilion at Tarlair.Photograph: John Bracegirdle/AlamyCycling along theNorth East Coastal Trailfrom Portsoy to Macduff in Aberdeenshire is my idea of heaven. In stunning coastal countryside you cycle through charming fishing villages with historic harbours. I’ve spotted dolphins, porpoises and seals on the route. On a rocky coastline just beyond Macduff, there’san old tidal pool at Tarlair. Though no longer used for swimming, its beautifully restored art deco tea pavilion is the perfect spot to refuel before your journey back. While there, take a short wander to the secluded Salmon Howie beach tucked behind the cliffs – it’s such a beautiful spot.Peter DienderWinning tip: fin-du-monde vibes in East YorkshireView image in fullscreenBarmston Beach, near Bridlington.Photograph: Imagebroker/AlamyWhen, as a child, I readZ For Zachariah, I imagined a landscape with the exact fin-du-monde energy of the East Yorkshire beach from Ulrome to Bridlington. On this stretch of Holderness, you’ll find neither the Norfolk chalk boards of iced latte and shakshuka nor the monastic ghosts of farther north. But if six miles of uninterrupted beach walk – in the company of nothing more glamorous than pure air, weather and proper decay (not the genteel sort) – is your thing, this is a place you should visit.

Serve with a ta-daaa!Helen GohFri 4 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareThere’s a certain charm to jelly in summer: its playful wobble, its glassy sheen, its ability to delight adults and children alike. This dessert leans into that charm and the unbeatable pairing of a softly set strawberry jelly with a silky vanilla panna cotta. It’s light and cool, and ideal for long, warm evenings when no one wants anything too heavy: simple but balanced, the berries bright and tangy, the cream smooth and gently sweet. Best of all, everything can be made ahead, so all that’s left to do is unmould and enjoy the wobble.Strawberry jelly panna cottaPrep10 minChill6 hr+Cook1 hr20 minMakes6For the strawberry layer500g strawberries, washed and hulled, plus extra for serving200g caster sugar40ml lemon juice1 vanilla bean pod2 tsp almond oil, or sunflower oil3 leavesplatinum-strength gelatineFor the panna cotta layer300ml double cream100ml milk50g caster sugar2 leaves platinum-strength gelatinePut the strawberries in a food processor and pulse a few times until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add 50ml water, the sugar and the lemon juice. Split the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds (save these for the panna cotta) and put the empty pod in with the strawberries. Put the pan on a low heat and cook, stirring gently, for about two minutes, until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a bowl, allowing it to drip naturally – avoid pressing the pulp, because that can cloud the jelly (if your sieve is small, work in batches). You should end up with about 400ml strawberry juice (save the strained pulp to stir into yoghurt for breakfast).Meanwhile, lightly oil six dariole moulds or small glasses (150-200ml) with a paper towel dabbed in almond or sunflower oil, and put on a tray.Soak the gelatine leaves in very cold water for five minutes. Warm the strained strawberry juice (do not let it boil), squeeze the excess water out of the gelatine, then stir the leaves into the warm juice until dissolved. Divide the jelly between the moulds (about 60ml each) and refrigerate for about three hours, or until just set.Once the jelly has set, make the panna cotta layer. Combine the cream, milk, sugar and reserved vanilla seeds in a small saucepan. Heat gently, stirring, until steaming (do not boil), then take off the heat. Soak two gelatine leaves in cold water for five minutes, then squeeze out the excess water and stir into the warm cream until fully dissolved. Cool for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.Carefully pour about 60ml of the panna cotta mixture over the set strawberry jelly. Refrigerate for at least three hours, or overnight, until set.When ready to serve, run a small knife around the edge of each mould just enough to break the seal. As air slips in, a soft bubble should form between the panna cotta and the mould. Invert on to serving plates, wait patiently and the panna cotta should release in one smooth, satisfying sigh. Serve immediately, garnished with the extra strawberries.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodFruitSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
