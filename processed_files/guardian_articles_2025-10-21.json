Former PM smirks and sighs through Covid inquiryJohn CraceGrilled over policies regarding children and young people, Johnson remains the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong timeTue 21 Oct 2025 12.43 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 18.41 EDTShareBliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven. Just not if you happened to be a schoolkid during the pandemic. Then you were being asked to make the biggest sacrifices to protect elderly people, even though you were the least at risk. Still, I suppose there was a lesson in there somewhere. Almost everyone who comes into contact – however indirectly – withBoris Johnsongenerally finds they have been done over at some point. So you might as well get your disappointment in early. Things can only improve after that.TheCovid inquiryhas now moved on to its children and young people module and on Tuesday Johnson was back to give evidence. And, as ever, he looked as if he really did not give a shit. The hair was its trademark mess. His face unshaven. The smirk. Always the smirk. At times he looked almost bored. At others, irritated that people were asking him so many questions.Why now? Hell, it was all a long time ago. How was he supposed to remember all the details? Yes, he could admit that it must have been difficult for kids. Terrible, even. He should know:he’s father to at least nine of them. But they should also just stop to think about how much more difficult it had been for him. Would no one stop to think about poor Boris? He had never really wanted to have to make these difficult decisions. It had been his bad luck to be prime minister during the pandemic. The Feel Good man for The Feel Bad years.Covid inquiry as it happened: children paid ‘huge price’ to protect rest of society in pandemic, says JohnsonRead moreClair Dobbin, counsel for the inquiry, began by referring to the earlier evidence ofGavin Williamson, the then education secretary, and various school trust CEOs and officials, that the Department for Education had made no preparations for school closures. Primarily because Johnson had been adamant they were going to stay open. Boris disagreed. There had been plenty of discussions. Maybe Gav had misremembered things.Here we were faced with a difficult choice. Who to believe – Boris or Gav? Both with a long record of being – ahem – unreliable narrators. Choices, choices. And what if both of them were lying? The possibilities were dizzying. Dobbin attempted to pin Johnson down. Clearly the government had made no contingency plans for a pandemic. That had already been established. But had there been anything more than a three-page memo knocked up two days before the schools were closed?For the first time, Johnson looked almost animated. Now look here. A three-page memo was not to be sniffed at. He had once thought about closing schools in February 2020. Albeit fleetingly. But he wanted it on record that it had been considered. Though obviously he hadn’t said anything to Gav, because … Because why would he?It was like this. If Gav had been doing his job properly, then Gav would have telepathically understood that school closures were a possibility even if Boris had been saying in public that they would remain open. The fact was that Gav was a substandard education secretary. On this there was no disagreement. One day it might occur to Boris that he was to blame for appointing Gav to his cabinet. But today was not that day. It was enough to make you weep for the schoolkids. To have been landed with three mediocrities like Boris, Gav and Matt Hancock. The wrong men in the wrong place at the wrong time.We moved on to the summer of 2020. Still, Johnson struggled to think of anything he could have done differently. It was all very well talking with hindsight but he had had to make decisions in real time. And it wasn’t his fault if the ones that he made were invariably the wrong ones. It was like tossing a coin and calling heads each time, only to find it landed on tails 35 times in a row.Dobbin begged to differ. There was the assessment algorithm that lowered everyone’s exam grades. Boris shrugged. Algorithms were fiendishly complicated and no one had thought to examine the consequences. Easily done. As was funding an ‘eat out to help out’ scheme that increased the rate of infection. Money that could have gone to protecting vulnerable children. Boris had never been too bothered about them. Nor that his school re-opening plans might contravene social distancing rules.After a 20-minute break, Johnson reappeared looking even more bored. Or was it bewilderment? He sighed loudly. Lost his place from time to time. Got confused over dates. Queried whether the evidence in front of him was correct. His answers became more vague. Dobbin concentrated on the second schools closure in January 2021. Boris nodded. He had been so desperate to keep them open that he had sent children back only to close the schools later the same day. And no, he hadn’t really thought to keep Gav in the loop, because who would?“This was one of my really low moments,” Johnson confided. He was a man who still couldn’t quite understand why he had been so unlucky. Life had always come so easily to him. A narcissist who had always been able to control his destiny. Up until Covid.Boris Johnson says DfE failed to plan for school closures during Covid crisisRead moreThen he had confronted a reality he couldn’t bend to his will. That had been something that required diligence. Attention to detail. Not quick, glib soundbites. Everywhere you looked you could see self-destruction. Dobbin quoted a memo that talked of “mass and flagrant breaches of the rules”. None more so than in Downing St, where Boris encouraged a party vibe. That, though, was another time. A distant universe. Best forgotten.We ended with the appointment of the education recovery tsar. And his resignation a few months later, when he realised Johnson wasn’t that committed to children’s wellbeing. It had all been tokenistic. Boris had thought it could be done on the cheap and had only let Kevan Collins compile his wishlist because he liked him and didn’t want to let him down. Until he did. Because Boris lets everyone down. He’s just not that serious about anything.There was just time for a final note of triumph. Yes, although he didn’t rate Gav, even so Gav had been nothing short of heroic. But I’m not sure that’s the way the rest of us will remember Gav.

They’ve sprinkled from my mouth like enamel confetti before dates, important business meetings and major public speaking engagements. Each time, it’s troubling, stressful and deeply inconvenient. Fortunately, it’s only ever happened in my dreams.“A lot of people have that dream,” says Dr Dylan Selterman, associate teaching professor in the department of psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University. People often tell Selterman they think it’s weird that they have this kind of dream, or assume it says something about their personality. “I don’t think that’s the case,” he says.Dreams of teeth falling out occur “across cultures”, says Melinda Powell, co-founder of the Dream Research Institute in London, and author of The Hidden Lives of Dreams. Research suggests that 40% of the adult population will have had one such dream over the course of their lives, she says.Fly around or make out with your crush: how to start lucid dreamingRead moreWhy do so many of us dream about our teeth falling out? And what could it mean? We asked experts.What are dreams and why do we have them?“Dreams are any kind of mental activity that we are aware of while we’re sleeping,” says Selterman.These could present as a series of fleeting images, or full mental movies with plot and characters.But nobody’s entirely sure why we dream.“There are good ideas, but nothing conclusive,” says Selterman. “Dreams are still an unsolved mystery of science.”On one extreme, he says, is the idea that dreams are a kind of wish fulfilment – a way for our unconscious desires to express themselves. (Selterman’s view of this theory: “That’s crazy.”) On the other extreme, he says, is the idea that dreams are “nonsensical junk”, the result of random neurons firing while we sleep.Selterman says he tends to subscribe to the “continuity theory” of dreams, which suggests they help us prepare for future situations and consolidate information based on what we have already experienced.Dr Kelly Bulkeley, director of theSleepand Dream Database, sees dreams similarly. He describes dreaming as a sort of imaginative play. “When we go to sleep, we detach from the external world, and our minds and imaginations are free and liberated to process the experiences we’ve had during the day, connect them with past experiences, and get ready for what’s coming,” he says.Powell, who worked for 12 years as a psychotherapist, says that from a therapeutic perspective, “dreams help us process our emotions by mirroring back to us our inner state.”But what does any of that have to do with teeth?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of the studies have been based on surveys, which can be inaccurate, Selterman says. People tend to overestimate or underestimate the prevalence of their dreams, and many don’t remember their dreams with great accuracy. “You’re asking people to reflect on something they’re not really paying attention to in their day-to-day lives,” he says. This makes accurate data difficult to gather.Still, theories abound.“It could reflect some kind of underlying apprehensiveness, or it could reflect something about the way in which we think about our appearance,” he says.(Indeed, when I was in high school and asked a friend what they thought teeth falling out dreams meant, she said: “I heard they mean you think you’re ugly.” I didn’t mention having them again after that.)Another theory is that teeth symbolize change, says Bulkeley. There are generally two times in a person’s life when their teeth fall out, he explains: when we lose our baby teeth, and when we are very old and our adult teeth fall out. This makes teeth “a very vivid marker of ageing and growing”, he says; as a result, dreaming about teeth falling out could point to an “experience of growth, maturation, or decline”.A person’s teeth might also fall out when they’re not receiving adequate nutrition, notes Powell. “It’s important for us to pay attention to this type of dream, as we are being urged to consider what is out of balance in our lives,” she says.People might have dreams about their teeth falling out when they are overwhelmed or depleted, Powell says. Sure enough, I have had these dreams most frequently when I was studying for exams or applying to jobs.Dreams of dental distress might then be considered a signal that one needs rest and nourishment. Powell recalls one instance, during a time of “extreme burnout”, when she dreamed she was haemorrhaging from her gum, and telling those around her that she needed a blood transfusion. When she woke, she was shaken, but realized that the “infusion” she really needed “was one of rest and renewal”.I haven’t dreamed of my teeth falling out recently, and for that I’m grateful. But next time I do, I’ll know that I’m burned out, or experiencing change, apprehensiveness, maturation, decline, or anxiety about my appearance.

The 30-room house caught up in the Prince Andrew scandalCountry mansion boasts 40 hectares of grounds yet discredited prince pays only ‘a peppercorn’ in rent each yearCaroline DaviesTue 21 Oct 2025 12.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 16.20 EDTShareWith its 30 rooms nestling in 40 hectares (98 acres) of secluded grounds in Windsor Great Park, Royal Lodge has been the home of Prince Andrew and his ex-wifeSarah Fergusonfor two decades and been likened to a very grand country house.Now it too is in the crosshairs of public outrageas pressure mounts to justify the discredited prince’s right to live in such grandeurin a crown estate property on “a peppercorn” rent.The Grade II-listed Georgian mansion is laid out across three storeys with two-storey wings, and features a “formal room” and a spacious drawing room with intricate mouldings and millwork, high ceilings and large, arched windows opening out on to the rear terrace.There is a conservatory and a saloon, reportedly measuring about 15 metres by 9 metres (48ft by 30ft), and seven bedrooms. In fact, the residence is so large that both Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie were able to host their wedding receptions at home.One person, who has seen inside, has described its style as classic elegance with antique furniture and rugs, walls hung with art from the royal collection and fresh flowers in all the main rooms. Visitors can expect to be greeted by a butler on arrival, and there is a cook and housekeeper, according to reports.There are rare glimpses of its interior in the background of Ferguson’s YouTube show Storytime with Fergie and Friends, showing windowsills lined with trinkets, vintage style vases and potted plants.Its extensive grounds include a chapel lodge, six cottages as well as a gardener’s cottage and police security accommodation. Beatrice and Eugenie grew up there, and the garden boasts their initialled, personalised wooden swings. There is room for a swimming pool, a driving range for the golf-obsessed prince and tennis courts, according to reports.There is also a mini-sized thatched cottage in its grounds, Y Bwthyn Bach (The Little Cottage), which was originally given to the then Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret by the people of Wales.But for all its grandeur, the signs are that Royal Lodge is in need of repair. Recent photographs of the exterior stucco show evidence of peeling and black mould. The Sun reported last year it required an estimated £2m in repairs, with Andrew reportedly paying £200,000 for roof repairs.Andrew is said to have promised the king he will undertake the repairs, though how he will finance this is not known. Charles reportedly cut Andrew off financially last year when he removed his £1m annual allowance, leaving his only declared income as a £20,000 naval pension. Questions remain about how he funds his estimated £3m-a-year security bill.View image in fullscreenPrince Andrew near his home in Windsor.Photograph: ShutterstockAndrew took over Royal Lodge after the 2002 death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, a previous Duchess of York.When she died, aged 101, there was speculation Prince Edward, now Duke of Edinburgh, who lives at Bagshot Park, 11 miles south of Windsor, had his eye on it, according to historianAndrew Lownie’s new book, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.Instead, Andrew became the new tenant, despite already having Sunninghill, the modern mansion gifted to him on his wedding by his mother and dubbed “South York” by the tabloids after the US soap Dallas.Royal Lodge is owned by the crown estate, the independent body which runs crown properties on behalf of the nation and whose revenues go to the Treasury.According to documents, no other bidders for the 75-year lease were sought. A 2005 National Audit Office report stated: “The crown estate could have offered up the lease option to the wider market but did not because of the sensitive location and security concerns.”This is a familiar reason given by palace officials when explaining the use of various properties in or near security cordons protecting senior royals.Andrew paid £1m and agreed a peppercorn rent in return for restoring the lodge, on which he has spent a reported £7.5m, requiring him to take out a mortgage against Sunninghill according to Lownie, who wrote: “With the property valued at around £20m, the estimated market rent would be £260,000 a year.” Under the terms of the lease, he and his family are entitled to live in the property until 2078.Sunninghill Park was sold byPrince Andrewin 2007 to Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan, for £15m.Since moving into Royal Lodge, Andrew has had to pay just one peppercorn of rent “if demanded” per year. This has raised concerns that the public could be being deprived of potential funds from the property.The building was in need of work, having been largely left as it was during the queen mother’s time, and the exterior was painted white instead of pink before Andrew finally moved in in March 2005, with Ferguson following later.There has been a house on the Royal Lodge site since the 17th century. Initially constructed as a modest farmhouse in 1662, by the mid-18th century it was the home of military topographer and artist Thomas Sandby, the deputy ranger of Windsor Great Park, and later to Joseph Frost, the park bailiff.Its first links to royalty were established by George, Prince of Wales, later George IV, who used it has a hunting lodge from 1812. King William IV had it almost completely demolished and rebuilt in 1830, sparing only the conservatory. By 1840 it was used as grace-and-favour accommodation for senior members of the royal household.In 1931, the future George VI and Queen Elizabeth – later the queen mother – lived there as the Duke and Duchess of York, retaining the house as a country retreat after the 1936 abdication crisis, with Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret spending much time there in childhood.After George VI’s death in 1952, the queen mother spent most weekends there and continued to use it until her death on 30 March 2002.In echoes of a previous royal scandal, on 11 December 1936, the Duke of Windsor took leave of his family at Royal Lodge after his abdication speech before leaving for overseas and exile.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewMonarchyHeritageReal estateSarah FergusonRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Actually, on second thought, maybe there is something bold about the way audiences have rejected, in quick succession, new movies collectively starring Margot Robbie,Colin Farrell,Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Channing Tatum, Kristen Dunst, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, Keanu Reeves,Seth Rogenand none other thanDaniel Day-Lewis. This group of actors that would constitute an especially star-studded Oscars broadcast couldn’t muster a single hit among them. EvenLeonardo DiCapriomust accept his status as the exception that proves the rule: his movieOne Battle After Anotheris heading toward a respectable $200m worldwide – and all it took was one of the biggest stars in the world with support from familiar faces Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, a multiple-time Oscar nomineedirectingwith an Imax-sized budget, and almost universallyrapturous reviews. Put all that together in an adult-driven drama and maybe you can outgross, and lose somewhat less money than, Disney’sSnow White remake. (One Battle is unlikely to turn a profit on its theatrical release.)Apparently most male film stars don’t wear underpants. Have they never heard of #MeToo? Or accidents?Read moreMeanwhile, movies such asA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,The Smashing Machine,Roofman,After the Hunt,Good Fortune,Kiss of the Spider WomanandAnemonehad no such constellation of exciting elements forming in their orbit alongside their stars. Some of them couldn’t even manage particularly great reviews. But that used to be what movie stars were there to provide: some kind of baseline level of interest in a movie, even if it wasn’t getting best-of-year reviews or boasting cutting-edge spectacle. None of the aforementioned stars are expected to perform with the superhuman consistency of Tom Cruise between 1986 and 2006 or Will Smith between 1996 and 2016. But there used to be a certain number of dramas and comedies that would make $50m or more in the US every year as a matter of course, the ones with stars tending to have an advantage in that respect.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie and Colin Farrell in A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.Photograph: Matt Kennedy/Sony Pictures EntertainmentIt’s not breaking news that franchise brand names have largelyreplaced starsin terms of ticket sales. But it is notable that in 2025, Warner Bros in particular has shown that not every smash has to be a presoldsequel or a reboot, with original, non-IP successes includingSinners,Weapons,F1and the aforementioned (if less wildly profitable) One Battle After Another. Between that and theincreasingly fallibleDisney empire, studios would be forgiven for assuming audiences might be willing to sample some more non-genre movies, and that stars might nudge them in that direction, just as DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Michael B Jordan presumably helped those Warner titles.So far, that assumption would be completely wrong. It’s not so much that any of this autumn’s star-laden bombs are One Battle-level world-beaters that audiences have painfully shunned. (Many of the year’s best movies will have platform releases, giving audiences more time to eventually shun them.) It’s more that not a single one has connected in a meaningful or even minor way; nothing even close to the modest but successful fall-season financial runs of past non-classic titles such asTicket to Paradise(Roberts, George Clooney),Hustlers(Lopez), orNight School(Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish). For that matter, any of these fall 2025 bombs probably would have been happy to match 2022’s disappointingDon’t Worry Darling, which nonetheless eked out close to $100m worldwide, presumably based in part on itsgossipy star power.View image in fullscreenKirsten Dunst and Channing Tatum in Roofman.Photograph: Photo Credit: Davi Russo/Paramount PicturesInstead, it seems increasingly like everything has to go right (great reviews, great trailers, online buzz, low competition) for even a modest audience to turn up for old-fashioned non-genre movies. This in turn creates a strange deflation effect where even those films that are able to become non-franchise events to certain segments of the population – One Battle After Another,Challengers,Poor Things, even something sillier likeThe Fall Guy– are not reaching the heights of genuine phenoms past. Some consider this a sign of audiences too savvy to run out and fork over hard-earned money just for a glimpse of their supposed betters, and there may be truth to that. Again, it is hard to make a case that anyone who skipped A Big Bold Beautiful Journey was doing a disservice to the art of cinema. (After Yang, a much better movie from the same director also starring Farrell, is available at home!)Yet it is also not as if celebrity culture is dying a deserved death in the face of increased sophistication. Kidsyearn forhard-to-attain careers as influencers or YouTubers rather than movie stars or singers, and plenty of podcasters trade in a cult of personality far scarier than the waning desire to watch Robbie for two hours because she has a nice smile. At their best, movie stars can guide viewers into stories or worlds that might not otherwise interest them; DiCaprio has been doing this for decades at this point. And if stars were truly no longer of any interest, streamers wouldn’t keep paying them to defect to various miniseries andimitations of their old movies.View image in fullscreenDwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockSome stars, granted, tend to provide something more akin to advertised services, with clockwork consistency. A lot of those figures have had great luck on Netflix and the like, where, say, theAdam Sandlerbrand can be preserved (even, based onthesurprisinglyvariedworkhe has done for the streamer, perfected). But some of the best aspects of these current flops involve getting a look at what a longtime performer finds interesting at this point in their career: Julia Roberts playing especially prickly as an imperious yet dissatisfied college professor inAfter the Hunt, or Reeves refining the comedy of his Bill & Ted days as a well-meaning but fumbling angel getting a taste of genuine humanity in Good Fortune. There are smaller, less starry movies that explore similarly rich characters, to be sure, but they are not playing on several thousand screens. These movies aren’t being rejected in favor of anything in particular, except maybe staying home.Spinal Tap II, Julia Roberts and Paul Thomas Anderson: the best films of autumn 2025Read moreRecentlymusingon social media about why these types of movies no longer seem to draw an audience, I received hundreds of responses, including many variations on the greater cost-effectiveness of waiting for streaming and plenty of irritable insistence that these particular movies all looked bad or uninspired, as if they were just an anomalous blip as everyone waited for better movies. (To that I say: some better movies calledSplitsville,TwinlessandBlack Bagcame out earlier this year. You probably skipped those, too.) Potential moviegoers like to imagine themselves as egalitarian, smart, immune to the familiar and in search of novelty – and some of them are. But the truth is, it now requires an onslaught of inescapable hype to get people out to theaters in any kind of decent numbers, and being susceptible to hype is not necessarily the same thing as being a discerning viewer who only sees the good stuff. (There are also, of course, plenty of people who can’t afford constant nights out. This is not directed at them.) Liking a movie star enough to see them play a criminalhiding out in a Toys “R” Us storeor an earlyMMA fighter in the 90sisn’t necessarily a badge of honor. It is, however, one more form of engagement with your personal tastes, like having an interest in horror movies or romantic comedies. No one is obligated to follow a big name wherever they go. Just be aware of what companies are happy to swap in for old-fashioned irrational devotion: an algorithm designed to keep you on the couch.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryMargot RobbieDwayne JohnsonColin FarrellJulia RobertsChanning TatumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, the two are connected: humidity lets mould and dust mites flourish – and they, in turn, can trigger asthma and allergies.Dehumidifiers can make your indoor environment more comfortable by reducing the amount of moisture in the air. Because of this, they’re also a great laundry-drying hack. I use mine to dry clothes fast, and for a fraction of the cost of tumble drying.Not sure if you need one? You can buy a hygrometer cheaply –the one I used for testing cost less than £10– to check your home’s relative humidity and make an informed decision. Should you opt to buy one, do your research at reputable sources (like, hint, the Filter). Researching this piece, I was shocked to learn thatcustomers had been dupedinto buying very basic dehumidifiers for well over the odds.At a glanceBest dehumidifier overall:Ebac 4650e£329 at EbacBest budget dehumidifier:VonHaus smart dehumidifier with laundry mode£139.99 at AmazonBest combined dehumidifier and air purifier:Devola Platinum Hybrid DVHA20L£199.99 at DevolaBest dehumidifier for drying laundry:Duux Bora Smart£299 at AmazonBest quiet dehumidifier:MeacoDry Arete Two£299 at John LewisBest compact dehumidifier:Devola DVH12L£128.99 at DevolaWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer technology journalist with decades of experience testing electrical appliances; I’ve been reviewing gadgets for almost 30 years. I live in a terrace house with a lovely number of children and far too many pets, so there’s lots of laundry: I use a dehumidifier to dry clothes. I’ve also been known to use one for speedy DIY, drying plaster and paint faster.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach dehumidifier’s performance, energy consumption and noise levels were recorded.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI selected 14 dehumidifiers from leading brands to test, then set them up and used them, each for several days. I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) they use. Using the Sound Meter app, I measured the noise from 1m away in decibels (dB) on multiple occasions – the figures featured here are all the ones that I measured at home, in consistent conditions, so they often differ from manufacturers’ official figures, which are measured in lab conditions but in inconsistent ways. More subjectively, I paid attention to the quality of the sound – was it annoying, gurgly, hard to ignore, easy to fall asleep to? And I measured each dehumidifier’s size.To measure the room’s humidity while testing, I used a digital hygrometer held 1m away (though humidity would be roughly the same elsewhere in the room), and a thermometer to check the temperature. Dehumidifiers fill a tank with water they have extracted from the air, so one measure of how good a job they’ve done is to measure how much water is in there – which I did, using a jug.Because conditions vary from moment to moment and room to room, it was impossible to test each one in precisely the same conditions. As such, I’ve only mentioned the results of these not-so-scientific tests when they stood out.After testing, any dehumidifiers that weren’t collected by manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that fully furnishes the empty social housing in which women and children are placed after surviving domestic abuse.The best dehumidifiers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBestdehumidifier overall:Ebac 4650eView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£329 at Ebac£329 at ArgosThis is the priciest dehumidifier on test, but it’s worth the money. It’s large but luggable, with a single deep handle on the rear that makes it easy to carry and an integrated cable tidy on the back that’s great when you want to store it.Why we love itI like the design. For example, a flap at the front opens to reveal a black water tank that’s easy to empty, with water coming out of just one hole (most water tanks are messier).The small display is colourful, and there’s a good range of modes, including laundry. A smart control feature remembers your home’s humidity levels and kicks in only when the levels start to rise: in a home that doesn’t have major damp problems, this will save a lot of electricity. It can be controlled via an app, and it also comes with an activated carbon filter for removing unwanted smells.Performance was good, bringing relative humidity down by 4% in a short time, and its capacity and smart controls make it a great all-rounder. You can simply leave it switched on and trust it to manage your home’s humidity levels without wasting electricity. The Ebac’s sound was inoffensive, too: I could definitely sleep with it on. It’s pretty energy efficient and it’s made in north-east England, so its carbon footprint is lower than some other models. It also comes with a four-year warranty if bought directly from the brand.It’s a shame that …there’s no window to inspect the fill level.Dimensions:34 x 27 x 54cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:18lTank capacity:3.5lPeak power use on test:180WAverage noise level on top setting:10dBTarget humidity range:35-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:5p/hourBestbudget dehumidifier:VonHaus smart dehumidifier with laundry modeView image in fullscreen£169.99 at VonHaus£139.99 at AmazonAt the time of writing, a discount code brings this dehumidifier’s price down to less than £150. Even at full price, though, it’s a bargain.Why we love itAlongside a laundry mode, there’s a sleep mode, which brought down volume levels from an already quiet 15dB to 10dB by slowing the fan speed, and turns off the screen so the lights won’t disturb you.Other modes include auto, which turns the machine off when it reaches the target relative humidity, and continuous, which means it won’t turn off until the tank is full. An app lets you control it from your phone or with Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Simple coloured lights on the front give a visual indicator of what mode it’s in.It’s a great all-rounder for the price. On test, it started cutting humidity levels within minutes, and over a couple of hours, it brought relative humidity down by at least 5%, pulling 450ml of water out of the air. It’s good for drying laundry and tackling damp – the only corner cut, when compared with pricier models, is Hepa air filtration.If you’re not sure whether or not to invest in a dehumidifier, this is a good buy for the price.It’s a shame that …it only has a washable dust filter, not Hepa air purification, even though there looks to be enough room for a larger filter.Dimensions:31 x 24 x 49cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4.5lPeak power use on test:290WAverage noise level on top setting:15dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:8p/hourBest combined dehumidifierand air purifier:Devola Platinum Hybrid DVHA20LView image in fullscreen£199.99 at Devola£199.99 at Aircon CentreKill two birds with one stone with this new hybrid model that promises cleaner as well as drier air. It comes with a Hepa filter (for filtering the air), an ioniser (for pulling dust out of the air) and an ultraviolet lamp (for killing germs).Why we love itSeveral models on test come with Hepa filters, but what sets this model apart is that it measures air quality too: simply press a button to get a traffic light measure of PM2.5 particles (green, blue or red light, depending on your air quality). Air pollution is a silent killer, andindoor air quality can be worse than outdoor, so filtering these fine particles is a brilliant idea if you don’t already have an air purifier.Dehumidifier modes include laundry and night (quieter at 20dB), and the flap on the top is motorised, so it opens automatically and can be set to “swing” to circulate air.It was great being able to see the air quality improve, as well as the humidity. The Devola is well designed, too: the water tank is accessed from the side and its handle doubles as a visual level indicator. And I found the tank easy to empty without making a mess.It’s a shame that …it’s not quieter.Hepa filterswill need replacing periodically, too (Devola suggests every six months, so budget about £15 a year).Dimensions:36 x 27 x 57cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:2.9lPeak power use on test:330WAverage noise level on top setting:30dBTarget humidity range:40-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:9p/hourBest dehumidifier for drying laundry:Duux Bora SmartView image in fullscreen£299.99 at Duux£299 at AmazonThis is a good-looking dehumidifier, with clean lines. The water drawer at the front has a useful visual indicator, so you can see at a glance how full it is.It features wifi and app control so that you can set schedules, and an activated carbon filter works to remove odours, gases and smoke.Why we love itI loved the four-hour laundry mode: it reduced relative humidity by 5% in the first five minutes, swiftly drying clothes. And you’ll be able to sleep nearby, since the Duux is Quiet Mark certified for its ultra-quiet operation. The night mode turns off the lights, although I had to turn down the fan speed myself – and in my tests it then reached an impressively low average of below 10dB, much quieter than the manufacturer’s claims. It sounds like a fan with a little bit of fridge sound thrown in, but quieter.I also like that it uses the environmentally friendlyR290 refrigerant, which has a lowglobal warming potential (GWP). In fact, its GWP is only triple that of carbon dioxide, while some refrigerants have a GWP that’s hundreds of times that of CO2 (andsome refrigerants now banned from salehave GWPs of thousands).It’s a shame that …it doesn’t offer Hepa air purification at this price.Dimensions:32 x 24 x 51cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4lPeak power use on test:270WAverage noise level on top setting:20dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:7p/hourBest quiet dehumidifier:MeacoDry Arete TwoView image in fullscreen£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at MeacoYou’d expect the successor to the popularArete Oneto be impressive, and this doesn’t disappoint. It’s not just a dehumidifier – it also purifies the air, thanks to the included dust and medical-grade H13 Hepa filters.Why we love itThe Arete Two can be controlled via a smartphone app or voice control via Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Modes include continuous, smart (which aims for a middle-of-the-road 55% humidity) and laundry. The louvre on top opens manually and can be directed at your washing.Its display is slightly unusual: rather than a number, it shows a sliding scale of humidity levels, giving you a clear visual indication of the current humidity and your target. The interface is intuitive, however, and there aren’t too many buttons.The five-year warranty is the longest I’ve seen for a dehumidifier. But most of all, I was impressed by the quiet. The average noise was just 5dB, and this went down to 4dB (considerably quieter than the manufacturer’s claimed noise level) in night mode. You can honestly forget that it’s on.It also has some thoughtful features. For example, if you leave it plugged in but not switched on, it will say “wet” on screen to alert you when it detects a relative humidity of 70% plus.You can also choose your type of air filtration when you buy refills (£39.99 for a pack of three). Replace the Hepa filter if you have allergies or pets; swap for an activatedcharcoal filterif you’d prefer to remove cooking smells, smoke and VOCs (chemicals that come off new furniture, paint, carpets and so on).It’s a shame that …the louvre isn’t motorised, considering the price.Dimensions:37 x 27 x 62cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4.8lPeak power use on test:230WAverage noise level on top setting:5dBTarget humidity range:40-70%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:6p/hourBest compact dehumidifier:Devola DVH12LView image in fullscreen£128.99 at Devola£128.99 at Aircon CentreWhen compared with the other smaller (12-litre capacity) models on test, this extracted the most water from the air. It removed 200ml, reducing relative humidity by 5% in a short time. It also looks good.Why we love itPerformance is impressive for a small dehumidifier. And it’s especially impressive considering it comes with a Hepa filter for air purification, which is bound to slow airflow for dehumidification.It was pretty quiet and sounded like a fan. I could definitely sleep through its 5dB on low fan mode.Got enough space for a larger model? For only a little more, you can buy the larger Devola DVHA20L above, which features a built-in PM2.5 air quality monitor, so you can see the impact it’s having on air quality.It’s a shame that …the rear tank doesn’t have a visual indicator, so you can’t tell how full it is without pulling it out.Dimensions:30 x 23 x 47cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:12lTank capacity:2.7lPeak power use on test:180WAverage noise level on top setting:10dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:5p/hourThe best of the restView image in fullscreenExtracted moisture powerfully during testing: the ProBreeze dehumidifier.Swan low-energy dehumidifierView image in fullscreen£149 at Currys£149.99 at SwanBest for:looksThe Swan’s design is as elegant as its feathery namesake. It’s also a contender for best bargain when reduced.It didn’t make the final cut because …the powerful upwards fan and motorised flap make it great for drying laundry, but there’s no laundry mode, and the minimum target for relative humidity is 40% (many models go down to 30% and laundry mode is invariably 35% with a timer).You can still dry laundry by choosing 40% and setting a timer, but it seems like an oversight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

As such, it uses more electricity but can be used in colder spaces, operating as low as 1C: perfect for a garage or shed. This one features an ioniser that helps cut airborne dust, and it’s compact, light and easy to carry. On test, it performed well, cutting relative humidity by 10% but raising the temperature slightly.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s good for garages, but since it uses twice as much electricity as condenser dehumidifiers, I wouldn’t use it in the home. It doesn’t display the humidity level, either.Dimensions:36 x 20 x 55cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:8l;tank capacity:2l;peak power use on test:690W;average noise level on top setting:40dB;target humidity range:40-60%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:18p/hourProBreeze Dehumidifier with Max Extraction and Laundry ModeView image in fullscreen£189.99 at ProBreeze£189.99 at AmazonBest for:powerful dryingAt the time of writing, the ProBreeze website had a discount code that brought this dehumidifier’s price down by £30, making it a bargain for such a workhorse. In my tests, it extracted moisture powerfully, bringing relative humidity down by more than 10% in a couple of hours.For £10 extra, you can get a version with smart app control.It didn’t make the final cut because …it uses quite a lot of electricity, even on low power mode. And although it was fairly quiet (15dB on low fan mode), there was an annoying low hum as well as the fan noise.Dimensions:32 x 20 x 58cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:20l;tank capacity:5.5l;peak power use on test:360W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:9p/hourDevola DV12LView image in fullscreen£119.99 at Aircon Centre£119.99 at DevolaBest for:clever designI liked the way this affordable dehumidifier looked, and loved the little notch at the top of the rear water tank. It means that, when dry, you can stow the power cable in there, making this an easy machine to store.A light-up ring on the front indicates relative humidity at a glance: green for good, red for too humid, blue for too dry.It didn’t make the final cut because …I preferred the newer Devola DVH12L, which also has a Hepa filter for air purification.Dimensions:26 x 22 x 47cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2l;peak power use on test:180W;average noise level on top setting:25dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourHoneywell TP FitView image in fullscreen£139.99 at Aircon Centre£139.99 at AmazonBest for:the smallest dehumidifierThis was the smallest on test, so it could be worth considering if you only want to use it occasionally and need to stow it away most of the time. The dust filter is washable, and while there’s no true sleep mode (there’s one that dims the lights, but it doesn’t reduce noise), most of the lights turn off after a minute, and it’s not too loud.The comfort mode targets a relative humidity based on the temperature, and its front water drawer gives a visual indication. I also like that it uses the environmentally friendly R290 refrigerant, which has a low GWP.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t reduce humidity as much as some, collecting just 150ml overnight. Also, unusually, I spilled some water when carrying it after testing.Dimensions:28 x 24 x 39cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2.5l;peak power use on test:180W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-90%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourMeaco 12 LEView image in fullscreen£166.93 at Aircon Centre£189.99 at MeacoBest for:compact air purificationThis has excellent features, including top-notch air filtration and a three-year warranty from some retailers. Like its big sibling, the MeacoDry Arete Two (above), it purifies the air thanks to an included medical-grade H13 Hepa filter and dust filter. TheHepa filter is optional, and it will need replacing (about every three months) if you want to use it. Budget £40 a year for refills.It didn’t make the final cut because …you can’t see whether the air purification is working. For only a little more, you can buy the larger Devola DVHA20L, which features a built-in PM2.5 air quality monitor. I also didn’t like the looks, finding the green and white a bit clinical.Dimensions:32 x 24 x 49cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2.5l;peak power use on test:200W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourBlyss Madden WDH-316DBView image in fullscreen£190 at B&Q£190 at TradePointBest for:easy carryingThis has a daily extraction rate of 16 litres, which isn’t the weediest but is one of the smaller models on test. It has a simple handle across the full width that’s well balanced. If you find it difficult to carry heavy items up and down stairs, choose a smaller model like this.I liked the display, with relative humidity and temperature shown inside a cartoon house. And there’s a fan swing function that helps with drying laundry.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s no sleep function, although it’s fairly quiet.Dimensions:30 x 19 x 47cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:16l;tank capacity:2.4l;peak power use on test:230W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:50-70%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:6p/hourBlack+Decker BXEH60014GBView image in fullscreen£179 at Currys£159 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsI liked the Black+Decker’s design, from the coloured light at the top that indicates humidity (red for high, green for good, blue for low) to the large, white digits on its front that tell you the precise relative humidity.These quick-glance displays work well when it’s paired with the app, so you can control it from afar. You can even add Google Home and Amazon Alexa voice controls. I could use my phone as a remote control from anywhere in the home to check on progress – rare for a dehumidifier at this price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …the machine was loud at times (although the sleep setting averaged 17dB).Dimensions:34 x 24 x 57cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:20l;tank capacity:6.5l;peak power use on test:395W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:10p/hourWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour home’s ideal relative humidity is 40-60% in summer and 30-50% in winter.What is relative humidity?Relative humidity is the percentage of water vapour in the air compared with the maximum that the air can hold.Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold air. So if the amount of water in the air stays the same but the temperature drops, relative humidity increases.When relative humidity hits 100%, the air is fully saturated, and water condenses on surfaces, like how dew condenses on cool morning grass.What humidity should I aim for?All the dehumidifiers tested here measure the relative humidity (a percentage) and let you set a target.If the air is too humid, it feels muggy, and it’s hard for sweat to cool you on a hot day. If the air is too dry, it can lead to problems such as dry eyes and throats.For your health and your home, the ideal relative humidity is 40-60% in summer and 30-50% in winter.Do I need a dehumidifier?You might benefit from a dehumidifier if you have damp and mould problems. Humidity helps mould and dust mites flourish – and they, in turn, can trigger asthma and allergies.Another benefit is to dry laundry fast. Use a dehumidifier to pull moisture out of the air, then clothes in the room dry much faster and without causing damp problems such as condensation on windows or walls.Dehumidifiers are also good for specific uses, such as drying paint or plaster faster, or helping a room dry out after flooding.If in doubt, usea cheap hygrometerto check your home’s relative humidity and make an informed decision.What are the different types of dehumidifier?Most of the dehumidifiers tested here arecompressor dehumidifiers, so they work a bit like a fridge, compressing and then expanding a refrigerant to cool a metal coil. Water from the air then condenses on the coil and drains off into a water tank. These are usually the best style of dehumidifier for the home.Don’t throw away the plastic tube if you find one in the box. Some models come with a drain hose – so you can constantly dry rather than stopping when the tank is full. Other models let you add a hose if you need it (but most people don’t use them, which is why they’re not always included).I tested onedesiccant dehumidifier. These excel in cold environments, such as garages, cellars and outbuildings. This is because they work by using moisture-absorbing materials that don’t rely on temperature to remove humidity. However, they use more electricity to do so. They don’t require refills (none of the units featured here need refills for dehumidification – the only ongoing cost apart from electricity is that some have Hepa air filters that need replacing every three to six months).Peltier dehumidifiersare small and quiet, but they’re not very effective and they use more energy, so we haven’t featured any in this roundup.What size dehumidifier do I need?The larger (20l a day) models tested here are good for larger homes and open-plan spaces. You can put them somewhere central to tackle humidity in the whole home.The smaller (12l a day) models are very popular and better for smaller homes or single tasks, such as drying laundry. However, if you have persistent damp problems, then it could be worth sizing up.You can add a hose to most dehumidifiers if you want to keep them in constant use without having to empty the tank.How much does a dehumidifier cost to run?I measured each dehumidifier’s power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). For example, if you’re running a 200W dehumidifier for four hours, it would use 800Wh or 0.8kWh.The energy price cap for 1 October to 31 December 2025 is 26.35p a kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it costs 21p to run the dehumidifier for four hours.This compares favourably with a tumble dryer.One load in a traditional model uses about 4.5kWh (£1.19), although an energy-saving heat pump model uses half that. Either way, it’s much cheaper to run a dehumidifier than either type of tumble dryer.What’s a laundry mode?Many dehumidifiers have a laundry mode that aims for a low relative humidity of 35%, with a timer that turns off automatically, typically after six hours.To dry laundry effectively, hang it in a room, turn on the dehumidifier and close the doors. That way, it’s drying the air (and speeding the laundry drying) without having to dry moister air that comes in from the outside world.For more, read the Filter’s guides:The best heated airers, testedThe best electric heatersThe best electric blankets to keep you toasty for lessCaramel Quin is a journalist specialising in consumer technology.

To voters they are very useful idiotsTue 21 Oct 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 13.54 EDTShare“I’m meant to be on bloody holiday this week, Paul! I don’t want to be having this meeting!” There is much to enjoy about the patriotic revolution in government promised by theleaked footageobtained by the Guardian of the Reform UK group of councillors running Kent county council. Take council leader Linden Kemkaran speaking for all free speech absolutists when she declares: “Paul! Paul! I’m going to mute you in a minute!” Or consider her repeatedly stated vision of the imperfections of representative democracy: “You’re just going to have to fucking suck it up, OK?”Even so I think the standout bit is when Kemkaran, who acknowledged Kent’s “flagship” status for the party and its leaderNigel Farage, says: “If we can avoid putting up council tax by the full 5%, that is going to be the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can run something as big as Kent council.”As big as Kent council? The thing about Reform is that it could fairly soon be running something as big as the United Kingdom, with the most recent MRP poll suggesting that if a general election were run right now, with tactical voting, Reform would win amajority with 367 seats. Without tactical voting, they could be on for 445 – the largest majority since the franchise was extended in 1918. (Not to refuse to get swept up in the moment, but I do think we might have to allow for a bit of tactical voting.)Either way, there are currently two broad schools of thought around Reform. The first one is summed up by Dominic Cummings, who this week emerged to give a full interview explaining that he had absolutely no desire to return to politics, while observing thatFarage will be prime ministerif he builds the right team around him. The second school of thought is that displays such as Kent Reform’s Teams meltdown will be the thing that eventually implodes Farage’s march towards Downing Street, with people ultimately thinking the party is a too-risky crew of not-gifted amateurs.For my money, a third way is currently most likely. Namely, that Reform will win, and that beyond a few golden blazers at the top, the Kent councillors – think of them as the loony lightweight tendency –arebroadly representative of the team that will run Britain. But enough people will have had enough – have already had enough – that they just won’t care about that bit enough not to vote them in.When David Cameron blithely called the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, the then-Conservative prime minister may have thought he was offering a sensible we-know-best choice which could be swayed by the remain campaign’s hilarious strategy ofcoordinating lettersto the Times from 100 big business leaders, or coordinating letters to the Times from 100 medium business leaders.But what Cameron was actually doing was giving the British public a fuck-you button, and asking: “Do you want to press it?” Personally, I didn’t at the time, but it has since become abundantly clear why a lot of people did. Pressing it has not, it must be conceded, made anything any better, although many espouse the view that it is only not betteryet.In any case, things have developed significantly since then. Fuck-you has become the fastest growing and currently biggest tribe in British politics. And instead of being simply adjacent to the fuck-you button, Farage has now fused himself with it.

It’s just possible this method isn’t psephologically scientific, but I’ve long spent a lot of time reading comments beneath MailOnline articles. A few years ago now, I was struck by just how many upvoted comments, beneath a huge range of different stories, would simply be one word: “Reform”. This was back when Reform was polling at 2%, Farage wasn’t even the party leader, and the popular perception still held that you could never really break the two-party stranglehold on British politics under first past the post. The story could be about potholes or small boats or the BBC or phone theft or whatever, but the comment was as frequent as it was monolithically stark. “Reform”.Flash forward to today, and in Reform’s dry run for running the world’s sixth largest economy, the party’s councils are finding it a lot harder than they made out. In Nottingham, the Reform council leaderbanned party engagementwith the Nottingham Post after completely wetting his pants over an article in the paper about … local government reorganisation. Elsewhere, Reform have frequently shown themselves to be the free-speech warriors who love the mute button, the anti-snowflake crew who somehow constantly make complaints about bullying – and do so top to bottom. There have reportedly been eight official complaints of bullying to Reform’s south-east regional director in the past three months, while Reform’s top brass actuallycalled the policeabout the mean words of Rupert Lowe (previously one of their five MPs but now suspended and independent). Meanwhile, having honked endlessly about their Doge knock-off and all the millions in savings they would find just lying on the table when they took control, multiple Reform councilshave found there aren’t anyand they’re all probably going to have to raise the council tax by the maximum amount allowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Could they be worse than what people have weathered for the past decade or more? “Yes” has been the lesson of almost every single successive prime minister in what’s felt like a very long time indeed – but again, so what? Once people have gone fuck-you, it’s quite hard to get them back, and it certainly feels far beyond the limited political gifts of either Keir Starmer or Kemi Badenoch.There is a surprisingly common affective disorder known as the “high places phenomenon”, which is the irrational impulse to jump when on top of a tall building or precipice or suchlike, despite having absolutely no urge to die. A lot of people get it, and there is, by most accounts, a certain mad thrill to it. The phenomenon arises, apparently, when the brain misinterprets a survival signal, and the instinctive fear of the height is somehow mangled into the momentary possibility of “What if I jumped?” It is sometimes known as the “call of the void”. Typically, the call of the void only lasts a split second – but it’s hard not to feel the UK is going to be experiencing it constantly for the next few years.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistA year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionLocal governmentNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I have to take comfort from that,” Throssell said.Dame Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner, described the announcement as “a pivotal moment” that will “ensure children are properly heard, protected and supported”, and allow courts to “make safer decisions”.“Every day I hear from survivors who have been failed by the family justice system – where many have been forced to watch as their children are silenced and decisions are taken that directly put them in harm’s way,” she said.“This announcement – which stems from the tireless campaigning by Claire Throssell and the wider domestic abuse sector – will ensure that the courts place the safety and wellbeing of children above all else.”Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie, chief executive of My CWA, said: “Many of us have been lobbying for this for years and years, the families that I work with are going to be thrilled.“Absolutely it makes sense that all parents should have to prove that they’re good enough parents and safe enough parents to have contact with the children, and moving the presumption out of that formula is going to mean that that’s what we’re looking for.“So, instead of only excluding absolutely the worst parents, we can be looking at what it means to be a good and a safe parent, and that’s going to make thousands of children safer. I’m thrilled to bits with it.”Proudman said: “I’ve represented rape victims who have been forced by family courts to take their child to spend regular time with their rapist, and if they refuse, they are at risk of going to prison or their child being handed over to their rapist.“This is abuse. I have been campaigning for more than five years for this groundbreaking legal change – no longer will abusive parents have an automatic presumption to see their child. This will keep children safe, and I honestly believe it will save lives.”Professor Shazia Choudhry, from the University of Oxford,whose research has focused on the experiences of female survivors of domestic abuse of the family court system, described the change as “an unequivocally positive step”.Domestic violence screening tool should be replaced, Jess Phillips saysRead more“A large body of research and survivor experience has demonstrated that this presumption has too often operated as a barrier for victims of domestic abuse, in proving that contact is not in the best interests of children who are themselves at risk,” she said.“Removing it will put safety, welfare and the child’s voice back at the centre of decisions, so contact is earned by behaviour, not assumed by law.”However, experts have cautioned that the change is not a panacea, and that it must be accompanied by proper training for judges in order to facilitate a cultural shift in the family courts.“I think it is really, really important that judges have mandatory training, because if judges don’t have mandatory training, we know that they don’t recognise domestic abuse,” Nazeer said.“Historically, the judiciary haven’t been open to being trained by specialist domestic abuse organisations. It’s not a transparent system, and it’s not particularly accountable, so I think there is a real need to ensure mandatory training happens.”Olive Craig, a senior legal officer at Rights of Women, said: “We think it’s a really positive step towards a prioritisation of the protection of survivors and children’s voices in the court. It’s a really important and significant message about what its priorities should be.She added: “While this is a really, really important step forward, it is just one step towards managing the very real problems of the cultural environment in the family justice system. And while we’re really pleased to see this really positive step, it is just that, it’s a step.“It’s not going to solve everything, so it’s really important that the court takes note of the message that’s being sent.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsFamily lawDomestic violencenewsShareReuse this content"

But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.”Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he believed his country was on “the same page” as its western allies – but cautioned that Russia had become “less interested” in serious negotiations when Trump delayed a decision on whether he would supply Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Trump met Zelenskyy in Washington on Friday, a day after the US president’s call with Putin, in a tense meeting where the idea of Ukraine making territorial concessions was floated by the White House. This was rejected by Ukraine, butKyiv’s efforts to persuade the US to sell it Tomahawk missiles also stalled.1:10Trump hopes Russia-Ukraine war can end without supplying Tomahawks – videoKyiv believes it can put Russia under greater military pressure if it is allowed to use the missiles, which have a range of about 1,000 miles. It wants to be able to strike Russian military industrial sites and oil refineries deep inside the country, a move that Kremlin has warned would be considered escalatory.Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskyy and the leaders of the UK, France, Germany and five other European countries endorsed Trump’s call for a ceasefire along the current frontlines. They emphasised “the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations” in a joint statement.Signatories included Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, Georgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister, and Donald Tusk, the Polish premier.Political leaders of Finland, Norway and Denmark also endorsed the statement, as did the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Antonia Costa, the president of European Council.The Guardian view on Ukraine peace talks: Europe must ensure Zelenskyy can resist Trump’s bullying | EditorialRead moreWhile Kyiv has said it is not prepared to recognise Russian annexation of any territory the invading forces hold, it has also indicated that it is willing to accept a ceasefire on the existing frontlines. That would amount to an acceptance of Moscow’s de facto occupation of about a fifth of the country, because Ukraine has proved unable to push out the invaders militarily.Late on Tuesday, reports circulated that Ukraine and its European allies were working on a 12-point ceasefire proposal, an apparent echo of the 20-point US proposal designed to bring an end to the war in Gaza. A peace board chaired by Trump would oversee implementation, Bloomberg reported.In the past Ukraine has also called for the return ofchildren taken into Russia, and the handing over of prisoners of war, as part of the first phase of any ceasefire. Thirty western countries, led by the UK and France, have also agreed to provide a multi-national stabilisation force to prevent a future conflict by policing Ukraine’s airspace and sea lanes as well as training the country’s ground forces.The European leaders also said that they must “ramp up the pressure on Russia’s economy and its defence industry” until Russia was ready to make peace – and indicated that EU and G7 discussions over the effective handing over of €140bn of Russian central bank assets to Ukraine were moving forward.“We are developing measures to use the full value of Russia’s immobilised sovereign assets so that Ukraine has the resources it needs. Under a plan developed by the EU with the support of G7 members, Ukraine would be given the €140bn of frozen Russian central bank assets to help fund its national defence from 2026,” they said.The money, mostly held at Euroclear in Belgium, would be structured in the form of a loan set against future Russian reparations for the war damage done to Ukraine. G7 members participating would club together to underwrite the debts to assure Belgium in case there were complications in the future.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

This was a mob intent on violence against gardai.”The disturbances flared a day after a man was charged in connection with an alleged sexual assault. Local media reported that he was a 26-year-old asylum seeker and that the alleged victim was a 10-year-old who was attacked at or near the Citywest facility, which is in the Saggart area of south-west Dublin.A small protest outside the facility passed peacefully on Monday but on Tuesday night a far larger crowd threw rocks and traffic cones. A police van was also torched.Police, some with riot shields, helmets and horses, pushed the crowd back.The justice and migration minister, Jim O’Callaghan, condemned the disturbances. “Unfortunately, the weaponising of a crime by people who wish to sow dissent in our society is not unexpected,” O’Callaghan said in a statement.“This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the gardaí. Those involved will be brought to justice. Attacks on gardaí will not be tolerated. Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy. Violence is not.”The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, condemned the “violent disorder” and “vile abuse” against police in a statement.Demonstrations against immigrants and refugees have become common in recent years, with protesters accusing the arrivals of worsening a housing shortage and driving violent crime. Far-right agitators have used social media and rallies to spread a message that“Ireland is full”.Rioting erupted in central Dublin inNovember 2023after a man stabbed three children outside a primary school. In June crowdstargeted foreigners in Ballymena, inNorthern Ireland, after an alleged sexual assault. Protests outside asylum seeker hotels and centres alsospread across Englandthis summer.Earlier on Tuesday,Ireland’s child and family agency Tusla said the alleged victim of this week’s incident had been in state care at the time and that she had “absconded” during a trip to the city centre.Speaking in parliament, Martin acknowledged “the concern, anger and worry of many people” over the alleged assault. “Clearly, there has been failure here in terms of the state’s obligation to protect this child.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandRefugeesImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Economists polled by Reuters were predicting the annual inflation rate would rise to 4% in September from 3.8% in August. That would be double the government’s 2% target.The chancellor is keen to announce measures at the budget to bear down on prices, where these can be influenced by policy.She is expected to chair a meeting of cabinet colleagues on Thursday to ask what each department can do to tame inflation. A Treasury source said: “The chancellor’s view is that tackling the cost of living is urgent, and everything is on the table – including measures to bring down energy bills. She’s getting the whole of government to play its part, it’s her No 1 focus.”Reeves is widely expected to announce a package of tax increases and cuts to spending at the budget on 26 November in response to a shortfall in the government finances that could reach up to £40bn.The OBR is understood to have handed sharply downgraded forecasts to the chancellor, fuelled by a stark reassessment of Britain’s productivity growth, soaring borrowing costs and the financial hit from the government’s high-stakes welfare U-turns. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showedgovernment borrowingover the first six months of this financial year was £99.8bn, £7.2bn more than forecast by the watchdog in March.At the heart of the OBR’s downgraded forecasts is expected to be a sharp cut in its assessment of Britain’s productivity performance, based on flatlining progress in the past decade since Brexit.The forecaster has previously admitted it has been too optimistic about the British economy’s prospects for growth. A downgrade in productivity forecasts of just 0.2 percentage points would be enough to leave a £14bn hole in the government finances by the end of the decade.Last week the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned Brexit would have a negative impact on the UK economy for the “foreseeable future”. Previously the OBR has said leaving the EU would reduce Britain’s long-term level of productivity by about 4%.It comes as erecting tougher trading barriers and adding reams of red tape for business dealings with the country’s single-largest trading partner has weighed heavily on the productivity growth of the British economy.Speaking to an audience of 350 business leaders, regional mayors and investors on Tuesday, including HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Legal & General and KPMG, Reeves warned that any shortfall in the public finances would require immediate action.Hinting that any measures in next month’s budget would at least rebuild her headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules, she said: “I will ensure that the sums add up; that we have that buffer against future shocks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The chancellor also said cutting business regulations and planning rules was a priority to spur economic growth.“The reason we’ve got low growth today is they cut capital spending in the past, and we’re paying the price for that today,” she said.Reeves told the Guardian that her budget would rule out any cuts to long-term infrastructure spending, saying that spending on transport infrastructure, energy and other productivity-enhancing measures was vital for drawing in private sector investment.She said the decision to rule out cuts to capital investment was only possible because of the changes she made to her fiscal rules last autumn, which included separating requirements for the day-to-day budget to allow the government to borrow to invest.“I know I get a lot of criticism for [the fiscal rules], but without those changes, I wouldn’t be able to sit here and say the capital budget is protected. And it absolutely is.”Reeves is also planning a £2bn tax raid on lawyers, doctors and accountants as she looks to increase taxes on wealthier workers to fix her budget hole.The chancellor is planning to raise national insurance on people who are employed through limited liability partnerships (LLPs), which are most commonly used in the legal profession.Such workers currently pay no employer national insurance and a lower rate of employee national insurance.Reeves is planning to set a new rate at just below the 15% rate of employers’ national insurance, according to government insiders, confirming a story first revealed by the Times.The policy has been supported by the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesBudget 2025BrexitEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsEuropean UnionShareReuse this content"

He said the UK would play an “anchor role”. Ten days ago the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,said the UK had “no plans” to send soldiers to Gaza.The commander will work as a deputy in the American-led civil military coordination centre in Israel. It is also expected to include troops from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.Healey told business leaders: “We can contribute to monitoring the ceasefire, but that’s likely to be led by others.“We’ve also, in response to the American request, we put a first-rate, two-star officer into the civilian and military command as a deputy commander. So, Britain will play an anchor role.”He said the UK would “contribute the specialist experience and skills where we can” without playing a leading role, adding: “We will play our part.”The Times reports that the force is not expected to enter Gaza and is understood to be separate to a plannedinternational stabilisation force, who will be given robust powers to control security inside Gaza if a European and US-backed UN security council motion passes.Gaza’s media office said Israel had violated the ceasefire 80 times and killed at least 80 Palestinian people since the agreement took effect. On Tuesday, the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani,condemnedIsrael’s “continued violation” of the ceasefire.On Sunday, Israel launched lethal airstrikes intoGazathat killed 26 Palestinians after two Israeli soldiers were killed in an attack the army blamed on Hamas. Hamas said it was not responsible because it had not had contact with fighters in the area since communications were cut off in March. The Israeli military later said it had resumed enforcing the ceasefire and both Israel and Hamas have said they are committed to the agreement.In an attempt to show faith in the agreement, the US vice-president, JD Vance,visited Israel on Tuesday, where he expressed “great optimism” for the truce, calling it “durable” and “going better than expected”.AMinistry of Defencespokesperson said: “A small number of UK planning officers have embedded in the US-led CMCC, civil military coordination centre, including a two-star deputy commander to ensure that the UK remains integrated into the US-led planning efforts for Gaza post-conflict stability.“The UK continues to work with international partners to support the Gaza ceasefire to see where the UK can best contribute to the peace process.”Explore more on these topicsMilitaryGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineMinistry of DefenceIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The intelligence and risk assessments that led to that conclusion and ban have not been made public.But sources with knowledge of the details of the intelligence and risk assessments have told the Guardian that the Maccabi fans were considered likely to be the perpetrators of trouble.According to sources, police intelligence said:Scores of extreme Maccabi fans with a past history of violence and shouting “racist taunts” were expected to travel to the Birmingham game.Dutch police told their British counterparts that the Maccabi fans had instigated trouble in Amsterdam at a game last year.They had randomly picked Muslims in Amsterdam to attack. That led to reprisal violence with some Dutch Jews attacked.A huge Dutch police effort, involving 5,000 officers across three days, was needed to quell the trouble.A community impact assessment byWest Midlandspolice recorded that some Jewish people wanted the Maccabi fans banned because of the trouble that might ensue if they attended.Any trouble started by Maccabi fans attending the Birmingham game could lead to reprisals from local people and further trouble.The process did not consider whether the ban on fans of the Israeli club could be criticised as antisemitic itself or surrendering to antisemitism.The ban on Maccabi fans was made by Birmingham’s Safety Advisory Group. It was decided after an intelligence assessment was conducted by West Midlands police, shared with the national UK football policing unit.The UK football policing unit is understood to have backed the conclusions reached by local police.4:39How the unrest unfolded in Amsterdam – video timelineLast week, the prime minister, Keir Starmer,said: “This is the wrong decision. We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation.”A source with knowledge of the assessments said: “The biggest risk was always the extreme Maccabi fans who want to fight.”The source accepted those making the assessments and decisions did not consider how the ban on Israeli fans could be seen when made public, with some claiming it was a surrender to antisemitism: “If you don’t know the detail and have not read the intelligence, you could conclude it was because the traveling fans were Jewish. That is just not the case.”As there are no direct flights from Israel to Birmingham, Maccabi fans would probably have travelled first to London. Trouble was feared across the estimated three days Maccabi fans would be in the UK for the game: arriving in the UK, then on to Birmingham and attending the game itself before their return journey.After the row erupted, the government said it would offer police extra resources to minimise the risk. But so severe was the risk that it is estimated specialist riot police would have had to be drafted in from around the country if the ban was reversed.At least 1,500 to 2,000 riot officers would be needed with many brought in through mutual aid from the across the UK, at an estimated cost of £6m, though likely to be higher.View image in fullscreenMaccabi’s game on Sunday against their Tel Aviv rivals Hapoel was cancelled by local police after rioting took place.Photograph: Nir Keidar/APOn Monday evening, Maccabi Tel Aviv announced they would not sell tickets for the Europa League match in Birmingham next month. Their allocation of tickets was expected to be about 2,400.Critics of the ban point out that Maccabi Tel Aviv played in Greece last month without major incident.Maccabi’s game on Sunday against their Tel Aviv rivals Hapoelwas cancelled before kick-off after an outbreak of violence. Israeli police said their officers were injured with “smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices” thrown on to the pitch. Maccabi blamed their rivals.Standing with Maccabi’s football hooligans against local police – is that what patriotism looks like now? | Jonathan LiewRead moreOn Monday, in the Commons, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “This decision was not made in a vacuum. It is set against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and an attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed.“It has a real-world impact on a community who already feel excluded and afraid. It is therefore completely legitimate to support the independence of the police to conduct that risk assessment and to question the conclusion that follows when it excludes the people at the heart of that risk.”LiveWrong to exclude Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from Aston Villa match, says Lisa Nandy – videoOn Tuesday, the Israeli embassy in the UK said: “It is regrettable that extremists have turned football, a sport meant to unite, into a platform for intimidation, driving Jewish and Israeli fans away from UK stadiums.“Equally troubling is the inflammatory and, at times, racist rhetoric voiced by some members of parliament and local councils. The rise in antisemitism, fuelled by hateful chants and the ostracising of Jews for displaying the Star of David, is deeply concerning.“The embassy condemns all attempts to exclude Israeli teams or Jewish fans and expects UK authorities to ensure their safety and full participation in public life.”West Midlands police were unable to comment before publication.Explore more on these topicsWest MidlandsPoliceAston VillaMaccabi Tel AvivIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

On average, banks score on only 18% of the 77 sub-indicators and the best-performing bank scores on about one-third of the sub-indicators.The report said banks have “weakened their disclosures in areas such as net zero commitments, financing conditions for high-emission sectors and fossil fuel policies”. Some banks either fully withdrew or weakened their net zero commitments, substituting firm language such as “commitment” or “target” with less precise wording such as “ambition” or “aspiration”.Algirdas Brochard, banking project lead at TPI, said: “Given banks’ central role in the economy and their far-reaching influence on climate, their slow progress on the climate transition coupled with the recent dissolution of the Net ZeroBankingAlliance suggest that the objectives of the Paris agreement are slipping further out of reach.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The cases against Tate for crimes including human trafficking and rape in both Romania and the UK, allegations Tate denies, have also been widely reported.The conversation about Tate, however, often misses the full spectrum of his messaging.

But when we used a GenAI LLM to analyse transcripts of 640 videos from his channel on video site Rumble, we found that though Tate talks about women a lot, they’re not his biggest topic.We found that women came up a significant amount in about a fifth (21%) of his videos (highlighted in blue below).This is an example of a phrase that we identified as being about women:Women do not hydratevideo credit:Rumble | tatespeech% of sentences referencing women05102050You are on slide 8 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.But the topic Tate returns to much more frequently? Being rich.In twice as many videos (43%), he talks a significant amount about being rich, getting rich and other words related to success and money.This is a sentence we classed as being about success:I don't buy Ferraris to drive fast. I do sometimes, but if I'm in\n          London traffic, it's not to go quick.

And getting rich, they claim, will solve your problems.Thousands of influencers have a similar message:Iman Gadzhi offers7 Principles for Teenagers to Become Millionaires.Jordan Welch explains how to turn $100 into a million dollars.Hamza offersNo BS advice on how to become a top 1% man.Sometimes this advice is presented as empowering.You are on slide 2 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:Youtube | Hamza97, ImanGadzhi; Rumble | tatespeechVideo progressYou are on slide 3 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.When you ask young people why they like influencers like Tate, the empowerment message is what comes up, says Deo of Hope not Hate:The answer often comes down to self-improvement – 'being a better version of myself'.\"It’s the belief that you actually do have agency and you can shape your world and you can change yourself. That’s appealing to them.\"Talking about Tate but missing this point caused young men to switch off, she said:The portrayal of Tate jars with them and doesn't fit with their perception, which then drives them away.\"One young man described what he saw in Tate, when his videos started turning up in his feed.You are on slide 4 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.That is echoed in the research of journalist Matt Shea, who has met a lot of Tate fans in the process of making several documentaries and writing a bookClown Worldabout Tate.So many of his followers will say, ‘I used to smoke weed and play video games all day, and Andrew Tate got me out of that.’“And that really does speak to young men – they are playing a lot of video games – but a lot of them feel guilt about that because they want to be succeeding and making money and moving forward in life.“There are definitely men who benefit from that tough love message, which maybe is lacking in our society of like, ‘get to work, you know, stop wasting your life’.”You are on slide 6 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Another thing Tate has helped popularise is an important manosphere business model: selling courses.Tate and many other influencers are not only offering advice, but selling it through online courses.The strapline of Tate’s $49 a month Real World course is: ‘I grew up broke and now I am a billionaire. I teach the deserving the secrets to modern wealth creation.’Iman Gadzhi sells business courses such as Six Figure Sales Rep and Pathway to Profits on his own e-learning platform educate.io for £30 a month.eLearning site skool.com offers courses ranging from ‘wisdom on life, business and leadership’ from a self-described former mafia boss, to an AI Cash Skool – To Unlock Multiple Income Streams Using AI at $20 and $5 a month respectively.These promises may sound suspiciously like ‘get rich quick’ schemes, but one young man described why he got pulled in by Tate's course.You are on slide 7 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 8 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Tate was still making £4.4m a month from the Real World platform in 2024, Sky News reported.Participants seem to have a harder time making money.

When he finally got a signup, the member boasted that this first ‘big win’ earned him $11.Joshua Thorburn, who researches online misogyny at Monash University believes that many of these courses take advantage of men’s insecurities:A generally untold story about the manosphere is that it is in large part financed by men and boys who have fallen victim to grandiose promises or outright lies, suggesting that certain courses or products would make them rich, or socially and sexually successful.”Why are young men falling for it?You are on slide 9 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Why does the promise of Lamborghinis in Dubai resonate so strongly with young men today?You are on slide 2 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 3 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.But while the expectation that a man should be able to pay for a house, car, wedding and kids has persisted from previous generations, the economic situation today makes it much harder to fulfil.Ben Rich, a senior lecturer in International Relations at Curtin University specialising in extremism and radicalisation, puts it this way:There is a growing number of men who feel very disempowered in their own lives. The traditional social contract that a lot of men were brought up with, is broken”For many young people of all genders the long path to a university degree paid for by debt, with an uncertain job market at the end, doesn’t seem like a good deal, or even an option.You are on slide 4 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Even in the last few years, that message has become more appealing.The pandemic and global wars have pushed up prices, from energy to eggs, on top of longer-running issues like the rising cost of housing and higher education that hit younger people hardest.In England, the average home in 2024 cost £290,000,7.7 timesthe average salary of £37,600.In 1997 it cost £58,750,3.5 timesthe average salary of £16,958, according tothe ONS.A degree used to be free and a secure route to a job, but it’s neither of those things now.

Traditional ideas of masculinity have been tied up with the money-making ‘provider’ role, and taking this out of most young men’s reach can make them feel a sense of failure. And also anger – they are being asked to live up to an unattainable standard.And that plays out in areas like dating.Regardless of the realities of the modern job market and advances in gender equality, one of our interviewees held the belief that women prefer to date wealthy men.He described a viral TikTok song last year - ‘I’m looking for a man in finance’.I'm looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6'5\", blue eyes.\n          Finance, trust find, 6'5\", blue eyes.video credit:TikTok | girl_on_the_couchYou are on slide 7 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 8 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.It’s easy to confirm a perception like this online – someone somewhere will have expressed an extreme opinion. Dating apps make this worse, says Jilly Boyce-Kay, a senior lecturer at Loughborough University researching feminism and popular culture:On dating apps your popularity – or lack of it – is painfully apparent and becomes so reduced to metrics: how many times you get swiped on, those kinds of things. Self-worth has become tied to these metricised, quantified ways in which people are ranked.”This means dating becomes another arena where some men feel they are doomed to fail, says Thorburn:Unless economic conditions improve or cultural attitudes shift to recognise that a man's wealth doesn't define him, this will continue to be an issue.”The young men we spoke to had positive things to say about traditional male roles. But, in this social media age, there was also a sense of confusion.You are on slide 9 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 10 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.GrievanceFor some men, disappointments can become grievances. One of the manosphere's most harmful aspects is how it channels these grievances at particular targets, for example feminism, as Ben Rich of Curtin University wrote in a 2023 article:The major problem [of the manosphere] lies in its diagnosis of the cause of male disenfranchisement, which fixates on the impacts of feminism.”He describes manosphere logic as zero-sum: if women make gains, it's at the cost of men.This zero-sum claim posits that female empowerment must necessarily equate to male disempowerment.”You can see what appears to be this misogynist fear in the message of a range of different influencers, the following clips are just a few examples.You are on slide 11 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:X | sneako; Youtube | JordanBPeterson, Hamza97Video progressYou are on slide 12 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This messaging has an impact.Some men – particularly younger men – are moving backward in their support of gender equality. Across the political spectrum, large percentages of men said feminism had ‘gone too far’, with men who reported the highest level of economic stress being most likely to oppose women’s rights, according to2024 report into the manosphereby the non-profit gender equality group Equimundo, which draws a direct link from manosphere content to these changing attitudes. In a 2023 survey, 53% of American men agreed that men in America have it harder than women.But people watching this kind of content usually start in a more innocent place.According to the same report, key searches that take young men into the manosphere are simple questions about fitness, gaming, career and finance, or sex and dating.One young man explained the relatable reasons he goes to the internet for help.You are on slide 13 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 14 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.However, what starts with a simple search can end up somewhere very different, particularly as social platforms are designed to keep users consuming more and more.You are on slide 15 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 16 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.If you’re spending 14 hours a day on TikTok, that’s not just a lot of exposure to influencers – it’s also 14 hours you are not connecting with people in real life. Not surprisingly, the rise in time spent online has caused a big fall in real-world interaction.That’s true for everyone but it has been particularly striking for young men.Gary Barker, president of Equimundo, says young men are suffering from a lack of friendship:We're seeing in lots of places, Europe, US, Australia, young men reporting a lot of friendship recession. When we compare young men and young women, there's a lot of guys telling us they have fewer people they can count on to tell personal stuff.“We have that as a trend that's been happening for 10, 15 years. Then Covid came along. Young men seem to have been slower to rebound”You are on slide 17 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.As technology has accelerated, and policies like austerity have taken hold, spaces that allowed for real-world interaction have declined too.For example, approximatelyhalf of all youth clubsin England closed between between 2012 and 2019 due to government cuts. And Covid has changed habits. Astark 2023 studyinto men aged 18-45 in the US found:30%of 18 to 23 year-old men didn’t see anyone socially outside their household in the average week65%of men aged 18 to 23 said that ‘no one really knows me well’ - suggesting a lack of close relationships: friends, romantic partners or familynearly half of men (48%) in the study said their online lives were more engaging and rewarding than their offline lives‘Some of what pulls men towards the manosphere, is a search for connection and a sense of belonging and meaning,’ says David Bartlett of Equimundo.

But really all those things are part of their self-love, their sense of purpose and their happiness. They're not happy. That's it.\"Whether that's a young boy who's 13 and feels like he's not the cool one in school. Or maybe it's an older man who's divorced his wife, or his wife has cheated on him or something like that.\"Or maybe he's lost his job.\"Or maybe he has a great job, but having a job and doing a 9-5, is not being James Bond, which is what he thinks being a man should be.\"You are on slide 6 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Age of anxietyIn another era the message that everyone should stop having fun, work constantly and remain in a state of anxiety might not have been so popular.But something about this celebration of stress resonates. Young people suffer anxiety at a higher rate than everyone else, according to data from the US, UK and Australia.Inthe UK, a 2021 study estimated that28% of 16-29 year olds had anxietyin the last two weeks, compared with 16% of all adultsSimilarlyin the US, a 2024 studyfound27% of 18-29 year olds had anxiety symptomsin the past two weeks compared with 18% of US adultsInAustralia a 2020-22 studyfound that39% of 16–24 year olds had a mental health disorderin the last year, compared with 17% of all adultsYou are on slide 7 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Influencers like Tate validate men's experiences of fear and anxiety in a way that few other areas of society do.Tate often describes his own appeal this way, arguing that he says something that the rest of society doesn't: that life is difficult for men.You are on slide 8 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:Rumble | tatespeechVideo progressYou are on slide 9 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Society can make it hard for men to express that they are struggling.You are on slide 10 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 11 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.The manosphere claims to empower men, but it can damage them too.Getting rich is one of the solutions the manosphere offers for men’s unhappiness. But not everyone taking a digital marketing course will make a million pounds.In the meantime handing over cash for online courses and spending more and more time on a computer grinding to achieve unrealistic goals may exacerbate people's other problems.It can leave young men more confused and worse off than they were to start with.And once you’re in that world, it’s hard to get out.

Joshua Thorburn has looked at the experiences of people in these forums attempting to follow some of these strategies:If you're following their advice and nothing changes, the onus often falls back on you, not the strategies themselves.\"If you still believe that women are only attracted to alpha males, that means you'll probably blame yourself for not being an alpha male”Joshua Thorburn, Monash UniversityOne of our interviewees explained why he thinks everyone keeps going back for more.You are on slide 4 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.When the conversation around the manosphere doesn’t helpSome approaches to the manosphere can be simplistic: telling young men that the content is bad and that they are bad if they watch it.An example that one of our interviewees pointed out emerged with the media and political reaction to the Netflix show Adolescence. UK PM Keir Starmer backed a campaign to show the TV series – a drama about a young boy who murders a girl – in schools as a primer against toxic masculinity.You are on slide 6 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 7 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Experts in this space agree that it is challenging to have conversations with young people about this. Deo from Hope not Hate gave an example from her experience running focus groups in schools.There can be a point of tension – young men see themselves as trying to bring nuance into the conversation, whereas the young women are kind of refusing to engage and shutting it down.“So I think that's part of a wider conversation around identity politics and progressive politics. And that feeds conspiratorial thinking because it's like, well, why aren't we allowed to think about it? The polarisation gets reinforced from both sides.”There’s also disillusionment and a kind of hopelessness on the other side of the political spectrum, the Hope not Hate research found. ‘It was sad,’ Deo said, ‘seeing some young people with progressive and inclusive views [who] don't feel like their voice matters’.You are on slide 8 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 9 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.What is the actual thing that's causing the ideology to take hold? Are you trying to treat the cause, or the symptom?\"Manosphere views may be extreme, but they are the symptom not the underlying problem, argues Ben Rich.He says that manosphere views such as Tate frequently expresses – that romantic relationships are a financial transaction between men and women, individuals are entirely responsible for their own success or failure and everyone else is a competitor – simply articulate the underpinnings of our neoliberal society:There's been a real acceleration in people feeling they can't rely on the state. They can't.\"Neoliberalism has led to an extremely alienated, atomised society. The emphasis is on you as the individual and your self-actualisation, you identifying your brand, your value-add.

Digital spaces are part of the problem, she says. Her research into groups like tradwives and ‘femcels’ traces how online spaces have also brought out reactionary politics and gender attitudes in women.I think there is something in the very architecture of digital culture: it's like a mirror world where the femcels mirror incels and these sort of ideas, that kind of bleakness and fatalistic view just gets reflected back and forth. There's something which tends towards this kind of inward hopelessness.\"A serious intervention in online platforms whose business models incentivise both extreme content and addictive behaviour is another avenue for change, she suggests.But though the big picture may be bleak, there are some hopeful stories.You are on slide 9 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Leaving the manosphereOn an individual level, people move out of the manosphere in many ways. For those who have been pulled into the more misogynist dating-focused side, there seemed to be one clear path out:The most common theme in people who break out of the manosphere – they get a girlfriend\"Matt Shea, journalistSometimes even just talking to women made a difference. Thorburn studied the stories of people who had left the manosphere in a Reddit forum called ‘ex-red-pill’:A couple of people in the ex-red-pill forum basically said that for them, friendly relationships with women who they interacted, simply at work, were enough for them to start questioning those sexist, manosphere beliefs and realise that they weren't actually correct.\"Joshua Thorburn, Monash UniversityYou are on slide 10 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.For men drawn into the success and money side of the manosphere, the exit point could be simply doing the maths on the business proposals on offer:You are on slide 11 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 12 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.For David Bartlett from Equimundo, just the fact that young men are talking about the problems they face is an opportunity:That the sense of vulnerability that young men are feeling is itself a cause for optimism – because I think they're open to a conversation about the things in their lives that don't feel right.\"So I think there's an opportunity there to say, I want to hear: I want to be in dialogue with you.

Here is how:Topic analysisWe used two GenAI large language models (LLMs). Videos were transcribed usingstable_whisper, an augmented version ofOpenAI’s Whisper. Transcripts were divided into passages of up to 80 words, grouped by time proximity. Each passage was classified using theMoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2.0-cmodel into one or more of three topics: “wealth,” “success,” and “women.” A topic is considered significant in a video if it appears in over 10% of passages.Image analysisScreenshots were taken from each video every four seconds, or more frequently for short videos. For each, the AI modelgoogle/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemblewas used to detect cigars, topless figures, and sports cars. Any video with more than 3 detections of an object is said to feature that object.You are on slide 2 of chapter 7.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Image creditsIntroductionYoutube | elliotthulse1, Hamza97Instagram | adinrossX | GadzhiImanRumble | tatespeechElon Musk - ReutersJordan Peterson - Toronto Star/Getty ImagesJoe Rogan - Getty ImagesAmrou Fudl (Myron Gaines) and Walter Weekes - Fresh & FitSection 2.0Youtube | hstikkytokkyYTYoutube | JordanWelchRumble | tatespeechSection 3.0Rumble | tatespeechYoutube | Hamza97X | WhopIOSection 4.0Youtube | ImanGadzhiYoutube | Hamza97Instagram | cultleaderhamzaSection 5.0Youtube | ImanGadzhiInstagram | diegodayySection 5.6NetflixSky newsBBC NewsNZ HeraldDazed DigitalTimes of IndiaThe New York TimesThe GuardianYou are on slide 3 of chapter 7.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Further reading from the Guardian“My psychologist had never seen a black man with self-harm scars” - video, and the rest of theModern masculinity video seriesDisillusionomics: the US economy isn’t serving gen ZAdolescence: what teen boys really think of girls, influencers and porn – podcast‘I know what it is to go down the rabbit hole’: the male coaches pulling young men back from the edgeNow comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and RepublicanYou are on slide 4 of chapter 7.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation."

Starmer wasequally effusive, gushing: “This deal shows that our plan for change is working –bringing in investment, driving growth, and putting more money in people’s pockets.”Four months later, and the tech company was left scrambling to fix a devastating global outage on Monday that left thousands of businesses in limbo – and shed light on the UK government’s reliance on its cloud computing business,AmazonWeb Services (AWS).Figures compiled for the Guardian hint at the British state’s increasing reliance on the services of the giant US internet group, which has also drawn criticism from unions and politicians about working conditions within its logistics and internet retailing business.AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016 – during which time it has invoiced about £1.4bn, according to the figures compiled by Tussell, a public procurement intelligence firm.The research group added that “35 public sector authorities currently use [AWS] services across 41 contracts worth a combined £1.1bn. Key ministerial departments have contracts with the company such as the Home Office, DWP,HMRC, [the Ministry of Justice], the Cabinet Office and Defra.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab of the HMRC website during the outage on Monday 20 October.Photograph: HMRC.gov.uk/PATim Wright, a technology partner at the law firm Fladgate, said: “That’s a very significant exposure and its pretty ironic considering how the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] and the PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority] have repeatedly highlighted the dangers of concentration risk in cloud service provision for regulated entities for a number of years.“Recent moves by HM Treasury, the PRA and FCA to establish direct oversight of ‘critical third parties’ aim to address precisely the risk of outages like that suffered by AWS, yet until significant diversification or sovereign cloud adoption occurs, the UK government’s own stance shows an uncomfortable contradiction with the very resilience principles regulators have advocated.”The House of Commons’ treasurycommittee has written to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Lucy Rigby, to ask why the government had not yet designated Amazon a “critical third party” to the UK’s financial services sector – which would expose the tech firm to financial regulatory oversight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said that customers were“having problems accessing our online services”, and urged them to call back later as its phone lines were busy.Many of the sites were restored after a few hours, but some experienced persistent problems throughout the day. By Monday evening, Amazonsaidall of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”.Meanwhile, unions have long questioned if Amazon’s track record of working conditions in its huge warehouses should rule it out of government contracts.Andy Prendergast, the national secretary of the GMB union, said: “Amazon has a truly terrible track record on treating workers fairly.“Shocking conditions in warehouses lead to mass ambulance callouts, staff complain they are treated like robots and worked until they drop and – despite being one of the richest companies on the planet – paid poverty pay until workers went on strike for six months.“In this context, for it to trouser almost £2bn of public money is a disgrace.”AWS did not provide a comment. A spokesperson for Amazon’s fulfilment centres said that the “vast majority” of ambulance callouts at its sites were not “work-related”.Explore more on these topicsAmazonCloud computingInternetTechnology sectorComputingHMRCe-GovernmentanalysisShareReuse this content"

Despite the uncertainty of his prognosis, his mom, Jessica, is by his side 24/7The hidden victims of the opioid crisis: the ones who livedByMeridth Kohut with introduction by Erika FryTue 21 Oct 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 15.43 EDTShareA couple of years ago, I began investigating non-fatal overdoses.Coverage of the US’s opioid crisis has largely focused on lives lost. But through my cousin Mason, I saw another toll of the epidemic: the people who survive overdoses but are left with devastating disabilities.Watching his and his parents’ struggles – and knowing he was not the only young overdose survivor in a nursing home – I wondered: how many people like Mason were out there? What happens to them, and how do their families cope?I quickly learned that no one is tracking these cases. There is no official count of people living with overdose-related brain injuries. But through Facebook groups and GoFundMe pages, I began to connect with families going through similar ordeals.Despite the pain and relentless demands of their situations, many were open and generous with their time. That was especially true of Jessica Pizzitola Jarrett and her son, John-Bryan, who goes by JB and suffered an anoxic brain injury and other complications after overdosing on fentanyl in September 2020. Between managing JB’s 24-hour care, her own workload, and helping other families navigate similar crises, Jessica still made time to speak with me.Last December, she and JB welcomed me into their home in Sugar Land, Texas, where they live with Jessica’s brother. Nothing about their lives struck me as easy – from operating the Hoyer lift to get JB out of bed, to loading up the van for medical appointments and family outings. But being with them in person only deepened my admiration for their strength, five years into their new chapter.I already knew of Jessica’s fierce faith and commitment to JB’s recovery, but what stood out most was the spirit she brings to caring for her son: organizing a tattoo fundraiser in his honor, tracking down a wheelchair in his favorite color (hot pink), finding small ways to inject joy into the daily grind. Love, as much as endurance, sustains them.View image in fullscreenNurse Kenneth Emakpose, uses a Hoyer lift to help JB out of bed in the morning. Luckily, JB did not get added to the US’s tally of overdose deaths – an estimated 81,000 in 2023 – and more than 1m over the past 20 years. The tragedy of his overdose is that having survived, the 29-year-old now lives with profoundly debilitating, life-changing injuries. Nearly five years on, JB cannot walk or talk. After some recent medical setbacks, he also struggles to move, to swallow or to communicate in any way.View image in fullscreenEmakpose brushes JB’s teeth during his morning hygiene routine.View image in fullscreenFamily photographs hang on the wall of JB, before he sustained an anoxic brain injury in 2020, during a fentanyl overdose.View image in fullscreenJessica drives her son to a medical appointment in the family’s handicap-accessible van.View image in fullscreenJessica wipes sweat from JB’s face, trying to keep him comfortable as she and medical staff at the Texas Institute of Rehabilitation and Recovery, better known as TIRR-Memorial Hermann, troubleshoot a non-functioning wheelchair ramp on her van.View image in fullscreenJessica celebrates finding a physical therapist with a portable wheelchair ramp, to help get her son out of her handicap-accessible van – after their electric ramp stopped working outside a medical appointment.View image in fullscreenJessica wheels her son to attend a medical appointment at TIRR-Memorial Hermann, one of the nation’s premier brain rehabilitation centers.

Have they never heard of #MeToo? Or accidents?The Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan has let slip that an alarming number of actors go commando to fittings. The profession has rarely felt more alienStuart HeritageTue 21 Oct 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTShareJenny Beavan is a living legend in the world of film. A three-time Oscar-winning costume designer, she gave Merchant Ivory films their distinctive look but was equally responsible for the visual onslaught of Mad Max: Fury Road.In 2016, her decision to attend various awards shows wearing unconventional fashion captured the zeitgeist twice; first when Stephen Frycalled her a “bag lady”and was forced off Twitter, and second whena clip of Alejandro González Iñárritu gloweringas she passed him went viral. In other words, Jenny Beavan can do whatever the hell she likes.What’s everyone’s beef with Jenny Beavan? Ten unfounded Oscars conspiracy theoriesRead moreAnd she has. In aninterview with the Telegraph, Beavan has decided to offer us a peek into her working world, by revealing that actors don’t wear pants very often. “It’s astonishing the number of male actors who don’t wear underwear,” she said. “I’ve had to go out and buy them pants – not Calvin Klein or anything like that; I usually get them from Marks – otherwise they try to hide themselves behind a chair looking marginally awkward. I think, ‘For God’s sake, if I was going to a fitting and trying on second-hand clothes I’d wear some pants’”.She has a point. Being fitted for costumes is an integral part of an actor’s job. Indeed, it is only during this process that many of them begin to understand the role that they have agreed to play. So with that in mind – if you knew that a vital aspect of your professional life will involve taking off your trousers in front of a respected head of department – wouldn’t you try to remember to put on some underpants before you left the house?Especially in this day and age. The #MeToo movement has done wonders in the last eight years, illuminating the sorts of abuses of power that the industry used to tolerate. And while dropping your trousers to reveal that you’re not wearing anything underneath may rank fairly low on the spectrum of showbiz impropriety, the culprits are still putting costume designers in a position of potential embarrassment. You’d think that in today’s culture, in which an exposed penis can end a career in a heartbeat, they’d all frankly be too scared to go pantless.And, moral outrage aside, why? Why forgo underwear in any circumstance? Underwear is really useful. It offers support and protection in equal measure. Have none of these actors ever had to break into an unexpected sprint? Testicular torsion is a real thing, and can in extreme cases lead to injuries so severe that removal is the only option. Are these actors so cavalier in their attitudes to free-swinging genitalia that they’re willing to risk testicular amputation in the pursuit of their favoured lifestyle?View image in fullscreenIt’s not worth speculating … Daniel Day Lewis in A Room With a View (1986).Photograph: Goldcrest/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHave none of them ever had to rush away from the toilet before they’ve been able to satisfactorily conclude their post-urination shake? Has a DPD driver never knocked on their front door while they were mid-stream? Has a smoke alarm never gone off? Have they never heard their toddler squeal “Look daddy, a knife!” from another room? You’d have to assume not, because if any of these things had happened, they would understand that a major benefit of underwear is to act as a drip blotter. Underwear is often the only reason men don’t walk around with little wet patches on their trousers. And actors are willing to relinquish this? Crazy.‘I couldn’t be less interested in fashion’: the designer who dressed Mad Max and Cruella – and changed the worldRead moreObviously, the worst thing to do would be to systematically parse every project on which Jenny Beavan has worked and try to figure out which actors she is referring to. This is a woman who has been in gainful employment for close to half a century, and the list of actors she has worked with is practically endless. She worked with Daniel Day-Lewis on A Room With a View, with Anthony Hopkins on The Remains of the Day, with Robert Downey Jr on Sherlock Holmes, with Frankie Howerd on HMS Pinafore. She could have been referring to any one of them – or none of them at all – but the identities don’t really matter. We are clearly in the midst of a pantless actor epidemic.

But many people are determined to protect them – including 274 dedicated patrol groupsLucy KnightTue 21 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 06.50 EDTShareIt’s 7.30 on a Friday evening, but I’m not heading to the pub or putting on a film. Instead, I’ve caught the train to a market town in Wiltshire, where I’m meeting up with members ofWarminster toad patrol. These are volunteers who – like similar groups up and down the country – give up their evenings to protect their local toad population.For the common toad (scientific name Bufo bufo) is becoming increasinglyuncommon. A recent study led by amphibian and reptile charityFroglifeshowed that theUK toad population has almost halvedsince 1985. To see a creature that has been a stalwart of the British countryside – not to mention a prominent feature of literature and folklore – in decline is “worrying”, says Dr Silviu Petrovan, senior researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. Toads “don’t require very specific conditions” and “should be able to live quite well in most of the habitats in Britain,” he says – so if even they are not managing to survive, “it kind of suggests that things are not as they should be”.View image in fullscreenA common toadlet in a foxglove flower.Photograph: Stephen Dalton/Nature Picture LibraryThough the study didn’t cover the reasons for the decline, traffic certainly plays a part: Froglife estimates that20 tonnes of toads are killed on UK roads every year–in other words, several hundred thousand. Unlike frogs, which would probably be happy to mate “if you left out a bucket of water”, according to one of Warminster toad patrol’s founding members, Iain Perkins, toads like large ponds. Their ability to stay out of water for longer than frogs, means they can travel further to reach them – sometimes hundreds of metres, Petrovan says. They tend to stick to their ancestral migration routes – it’s common for adult toads to return to their birth pond to mate.Appropriately enough, the first toads begin their quest for a mate around Valentine’s day in February, but some move as late as April, waiting until it gets dark and travelling through the night. During that time, toads start moving from wherever they have been hibernating (often woodland) “all pretty much at the same time,” says Perkins.Now 60, he grew up in Warminster and has been trying to protect its toad population since he was a boy. “They’ve got just one focus: to go and have an orgy,” he says with a laugh. If their route happens to cross a road, they could all get run over, and that mating period would never happen – preventing a new generation of toads from being born.Seeing hundreds of toad carcasses on their local roads “inherently strikes a chord with people”, Petrovan says, and has led to the formation of toad patrols across the UK – 274 groups are currently registered with Froglife’sToads on Roadsinitiative. These groups pick up toads and carry them across roads in buckets, as well as counting the number of toads they find (both dead and alive) and lobbying for other protection measures, such as road closures and underground wildlife tunnels.Patrols tend to operate during the migration season, when toad crossings are more regular. However, this means they can miss groups of toadlets, which, having existed as spawn and then tadpoles, leave their ponds over an unpredictable schedule in late summer. Because of their size – just one or two centimetres wide – “they can get obliterated by car traffic”, Petrovan says. And as being run over “basically turns them into mush”, it’s harder to get data on them. At least when adult toads are killed, their carcasses can be counted.View image in fullscreen‘Toads should be able to live quite well in most of the habitats in Britain’ … a common toad in Devon.Photograph: Mike Hill/Getty ImagesUnlike most patrols, the Warminster volunteers, who are in their eighth year of operating, go out year-round – not every night, but whenever conditions are warm and wet, or if someone has posted about a toad sighting in their WhatsApp group. When I ask to join them on patrol, they admit it is “not a toady night” – toad hibernation season has begun and it’s been a dry day – but several of the volunteers gamely agree to walk up and down their route with me and see what we can find. “If anyone can find any toads tonight, that pair will find one,” says patrol manager Ria Painter-Coates , pointing to her 14-year-old son, Dexter, and Iain Perkins. We’ve been out for two hours without a single toad sighting, and now they have climbed over a barbed wire fence to check under some logs.View image in fullscreenIain Perkins, Warminster toad patrol.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianRia and Dexter joined the patrol a year and a half ago. Dexter loves all things nature-related and has an ambition to become a conservationist, so his mother started to look for things they could do together to protect local wildlife. Now she loves it as much as he does, the 41-year-old small business owner tells me – so when the group was looking for a new manager recently, she decided to step up.Dexter, too, has played an important role in the group. A video he made, imploring the local council to close a road through a nature reserve during migration season, swung the decision the group’s way, Perkins says. After a year of lobbying, the council agreed to an “access-only” restriction between 5pm and 5am from February through to April. Most drivers duly avoided the road.View image in fullscreenDexter of Warminster toad patrol, with an earlier find.Photograph: Supplied imageSeveral cars go past when I’m out on patrol (outside the restriction period) and we find some casualties as a result – no toads, but three squashed newts. We spot one living newt as well, and Dexter is particularly pleased to see aharvestman, which dances in his hands. Yet despite the group’s best efforts to show me a toad, the local population has clearly settled down for the colder months. It seems that I wouldn’t have had any more luck anywhere else in the country – all the patrol groups I contact explain that it’s near-impossible at this time of year.The group expects to help approximately 10,000 adult toads across the roadOne email I receive from a Henley toad patrol volunteer, who has kindly taken the trouble to check for toads in Oaken Grove in the Chilterns, thought to be the largest accurately monitored toad population in the UK, arrives in my inbox with the subject line: “No toads”. However, in February and March, he tells me, the group expects to help approximately 10,000 adult toads across the road.How much of a difference can these groups actually make? “The fact that people are doing this consistently on cold, damp and unpleasant late nights is quite extraordinary,” Petrovan says. “That’s something that very much should be celebrated.” However, while toad patrols are able to slow the decline, they cannot prevent it entirely – not least because traffic is not the only threat.View image in fullscreenOut on patrol …Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe climate crisis has meant longer periods of dry weather, which create the wrong conditions for some of the creatures that toads eat, such as worms and slugs, while higher water temperatures have led to an increase of blue-green algae, which can be toxic to toads. Milder winters also cause toads to wake up from their hibernation more frequently, disrupting the energy conservation vital to their life cycle. Habitat destruction – particularly the loss of large ponds – is another menace.View image in fullscreenRia Painter-Coates, Warminster toad patrol.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianPetrovan is “always a bit worried about putting too much of a utilitarian spin on biodiversity”, he says. “There is a big value in just having these animals around.” But toads do have an important role to play in the food chain, eating pretty much any invertebrates or small animals they can fit in their mouths and in turn feeding a number of birds and mammals, such as hedgehogs and otters (which have a grisly method of skinning them with their teeth to avoid their poison glands, leaving behind an inside-out toad skin, “a bit like a sock”, as Petrovan puts it). He also points out that by improving things for toads – ie, creating more ponds, conserving woodland and installing toad tunnels – “we’ll improve them for a whole bunch of other species”.Another reason to try to keep toads around is their “important cultural value”, Petrovan adds. Myths and folklore around toads go back centuries – they have long been associated with witchcraft, as witches’ familiars or ingredients in folk remedies or black magic. Even the symbol of a toad was at one point thought to possess healing powers: women in central Europe would clench a toad-shaped effigy made of wax or iron between their knees during labour, which was believed to reduce childbirth pain.Another folk tradition involved “toadstones” – a stone that was thought to be extracted from inside a toad’s head (Shakespeare, in As You Like It, writes of “the toad, ugly and venomous” wearing “yet a precious jewel in his head”) and have healing powers. In fact, so-called toadstones usually had nothing to do with toads, and the ones set in rings in the Middle Ages, includingone currently on display at the V&A, were made from the fossilised teeth of a fish of the Jurassic and Cretaceous period called Lepidotes.View image in fullscreenA female common toad carries her male partner.Photograph: Supplied imageToads have long had demonic associations: a devil’s coat-of-arms created in the Middle Ages was emblazoned with three toads, and in John Milton’s Paradise Lost, Satan appears as a toad to pour poison into Eve’s ear. But happier literary depictions are also abundant, such as George Orwell’s essay Some Thoughts on the Common Toad, which describes the spawning of toads as “one of the phenomena of Spring which most deeply appeal” to him, or the much-loved children’s series about a pair of adorable amphibians, Frog and Toad by Arnold Lobel. The most famous literary toad, of course, is Kenneth Grahame’s Mr Toad from The Wind in the Willows, who, ironically, given the amount of toad deaths they cause today, is known for his love of cars.But unless we want these characters to be the only form in which toads exist, drastic change is needed. Tunnels built under roads could be one way to provide a permanent solution to crossing deaths, Petrovan says – but he warns that they need to be implemented with care. Results in Switzerland, where tunnels have been built on many of the country’s key toad crossing sites, have been “somewhat mixed”, and toadsfailed to use tunnels built in Powysin 2010.View image in fullscreenToads captured to be helped across the road.Photograph: Allan Staley“There was a pretty horrible example from the Netherlands where they installed some toad tunnels, but the distance between them was too big,” Petrovan adds. Because fencing was put up between the tunnels, toads in those areas couldn’t get through, “which meant that in effect you were kind of killing them softly.”We “need more science”, he says, which he admits “sounds a bit self-serving” coming from a scientist. “But I do think that there is something to be said about trying to better understand the kind of very specific reasons for their declines.”When I chat to Dexter out on toad patrol in Warminster, he tells me most of his friends his own age aren’t interested in toad conservation. He tries to soak up as much knowledge from the older wildlife enthusiasts he meets as he can, but worries “it’s going to be quite hard unless we actually get people actively into it”. There are “so many other things to distract people” and most teenagers associate protecting nature with older people. “I think the whole idea of nature and conservation and everything will sort of die,” he says. “And that’s why we really need young people to go out and do it.”Explore more on these topicsConservationWildlifeAmphibiansAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What happened to them shows why deep sea fishing is one of the most dangerous professions in the worldByRose GeorgeTue 21 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 04.58 EDTShareThe Scandies Rose fishing boat set out to sea from Kodiak,Alaskaon 30 December 2019 with a crew of seven, into weather as bad as anything December could throw. “It was enough of a shitty forecast,” said one of the crew in later testimony, “I didn’t think we were going to leave that night.” At 8.35pm, fierce, frigid winds were blowing. Some boats stayed in harbour but the Scandies Rose still set out. “We knew the weather was going to be bad,” said deckhand Dean Gribble, “but the boat’s a battleship, we go through the weather.”The boat was carrying 7,000kg of bait and was headed north towards the Bering Sea. “She was trim, said Dean, and a good boat. Gary Cobban was a good captain.” One of the last jobs before departure was to stack the crab pots properly. There were 198 on board. That is a heavy load but not unusual. Each pot measured more than 2 metres by 2 metres. “Big, heavy fucking pots,” Gribble said.The stack was huge. Gribble had to climb all over it. It was four or five pots high and with all his checking and re-checking, his legs and arms were burning. “The pots were stacked great,” said Gribble. Every row had a chain on it, “and it was tied down a lot. There were ties everywhere. They were tight.” Crab pots stacked badly could affect stability, and lack of stability can sink a boat. When the US Coast Guard had begun doing pre-departure stability checks in Alaska ports in the 1990s, fatalities and sinkings were reduced by almost 70%. Cobban expected conditions to be “icing”, and a crab pot laden with ice can weigh more than 1,000kg. “Fuck,” said Gribble. “It seemed fine.”The crew was Gary Cobban, David, Gary’s son; the engineer, Arthur Ganacia; Brock Rainey, who had fished with Gary for 15 years or so, and Seth Rousseau-Gano. Jon Lawler was on board, and his friend Dean Gribble, who was new but only to this boat – he had been fishing since he was 11. The captain did a safety drill. This covered where the emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was located, how to make a mayday call, and where the fire extinguishers were. A crew member demonstrated how to put on an immersion suit. These survival suits are waterproof full-body garments with a hood and integral three-finger gloves and boots. They are bulky and hard to get on but far more likely to save your life in cold water than a lifejacket.The Scandies Rose departed. First north-east then north-west towards the Bering Sea. The forecast looked like this: wind 15 knots, becoming SW 25 knots in the afternoon; seas 3 feet, building to 6 feet in the afternoon; freezing spray. There are many people who listen to the BBC’s Shipping Forecast because they find it soothing. That is because they are not where the weather is. There was nothing soothing about that forecast.The first day was testing but OK. On 31 December, Gribble’s hour-long watch finished at 7.15 pm. He woke Cobban to take over and told him the boat was leaning to one side. “It wasn’t too crazy. Maybe one degree.” The wind on the forward and starboard beams was approaching 60–70 knots. On the Beaufort wind force scale, a measure of wind at sea and on land, this wind speed counts as Violent Storm and only Hurricane is stronger.Soon the freezing spray was hitting the starboard side of the boat. “We were building ice,” says Gribble, “but again it wasn’t anything crazy.” Cobban was aware of it, and when he came to take the watch Gribble asked whether they should go outside to try to chip the ice off. This would be standard practice if the weather allowed. Cobban, a cautious captain, said they would wait to get to shelter, and Gribble was relieved. “It was shitty out and I didn’t have any qualms.” He went below, had something to eat, and then headed to his “rack”, as fishers call their bunks, and began to watch a film.In the United States, if you want to die on the job, you should become a logger or a commercial fisher. These two jobs occupy the top two spots on the highest risk careers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health calculates that fishing is 40 times more dangerous than any other job. England’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) puts the rate of fatalities in the fishing industry at 100% higher than in the UK general workforce, with 85% of those involving people ending up in the water.For a country that is thought to have the best-regulated fisheries in the world, the US is an odd fish when it comes to mandatory safety requirements. It was only in 1988 that it became mandatory for US boats to carry safety equipment such as life rafts and an EPIRB, a locator beacon that should detach on sinking then float. UK fishers must complete four safety courses as a condition of their licence. US fishers do not need a licence unless their vessel is more than 200 US tons. “That’s a tiny percentage of the fishing fleet,” says Jerry Dzugan, a former fisher who provides safety courses in Alaska. “Vessels this size are built to or reconfigured to be 199 tons to avoid having licensed crew.”In the US, the only mandatory safety training is an eight-hour course instructing how to use survival gear and conduct an emergency drill, but that is only for boats that carry more than 16 crew or operate in certain latitudes. After that, they have monthly drills that can be carried out on board or ashore; they don’t have to be done by a crew member and enforcement and oversight varies widely.Above 32 degrees latitude in the Atlantic Ocean, commercial fishing vessels must carry immersion suits. Below that latitude, they must carry lifejackets, also known as personal flotation devices (PFDs). In other waters, the dividing line is 35 degrees. The PFDs have to be on the boat. Fishers do not have to wear them.View image in fullscreenCrewmen on the deck of a trawler in the Bering Sea, Alaska.Photograph: Natalie Fobes/Getty ImagesBetween 2000 and 2020, there were 805 deaths, 164 missing people and 2,122 people injured in commercial vessel accidents in the US. Of the 210 people who fell overboard and drowned, not one was wearing a lifejacket. That’s bewildering. Why would you not wear something that can save your life? “It’s a cultural thing,” says Dzugan. “I remember when I first was fishing in the 1980s, I would go on boats and I would ask if they had an immersion suit, and one guy threw me off his boat for even asking the question. Another example was somebody I asked where the life raft was, and he said we don’t talk about that on this boat. It’s like, if you talk about it, bad things will happen.”I know about fishers’ superstitions. Don’t whistle on board. Never wave a fisher off to sea because a wave will bring a wave. These superstitions are not about ignorance but hope. “Fishers work and live in an environment that they don’t have control of,” says Dzugan. “They don’t have control of the fish, where they are, or how to catch them. You don’t have control of the weather. You don’t even have control of your boat in a lot of senses in that you try to maintain your boat, but unforeseen things happen: electric fires, sinking, flooding. You don’t expect it.” Superstition spins a web around the uncontrollable. Superstition is containment.Even if you fish in waters where you carry an immersion suit, which you would never wear unless about to be immersed, why would you not wear a PFD on deck? Dzugan counts the ways. They’re bulky. You can’t work in them. They have straps and webbing, and straps are anathema on a working deck – they can snag and they can get you killed. That’s the practical stuff. There is also the machismo. “A lot of it is from, ‘I’ve been fishing for 50 years, nothing bad has ever happened to me – why should I worry?’”Yet every fisher that Dzugan knows, and every fisher elsewhere, too, knows someone who has died at sea or had a near miss. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution publishes a leaflet called “Lifejackets: useless unless worn”. Even when fishers carry the necessary safety equipment, the compliance is grudging and superficial at best.Back in Alaska, the weather was so atrocious that a Coast Guard rescue pilot drove to his station with his head out of the truck window so that he could see. On the Scandies Rose, Gary Cobban was on the phone. He phoned Jeri Lynn, a woman he had been seeing, to wish her a happy new year. She said later he sounded fine. They talked for 15 minutes.He spoke about needing to “tuck in” somewhere safe. He didn’t sound stressed or worried. “He told me the boat was icing and it had a list to it, but he didn’t sound alarmed. He didn’t sound scared. The boat ices every winter. It’s just something they deal with.”Cobban’s sister Gerry described her brother as a man who had fishing in his blood. Their dad began fishing when he was eight or nine years old. Their mum fished. Grandparents fished, parents fished, children fished. By age 20, Gary Cobban was already a captain. When Gerry and her husband went to dinner on the evening her brother left for the sea, her husband looked at the weather. “I bet your brother’s just getting his ass kicked out there.” Yes, said Gerry, because the weather was what the weather was. “But he’s a big boat and he knows what he’s doing and he’s going to be OK.”In the Scandies Rose wheelhouse, on the last night of 2019, only two windows were heated and still functional as windows. The rest were obscured by ice. Peering and straining to see, the captain would have seen the pots were iced, but he could not have seen how much. Only going out on deck would have revealed the thickness of the ice on them. Even had that been possible, the pots had not been stacked around access alleyways, as the Coast Guard advises. The crew would have had to clamber over the stack to monitor it effectively. This was unthinkable in this violent, turbulent sea.On a stable deck of a boat on a calm sea in a calm situation, it can take 60 seconds to put on a survival suit. That’s what Jerry Dzugan teaches people to do at his training courses. First hope you have the right size: too big and it could let in water. Then get you and your boots into it, then finally zip it up when your hands are already in the cumbersome gloves. In real life, on a terrifying sinking or rolling vessel, it would not take 60 seconds.In his rack aboard the Scandies Rose, Gribble was still watching a film. Then the boat leaned hard. “I looked up. Jon [Lawler, his friend] got up, ran upstairs, yelled down, ‘Dean, boat’s sinking.’” Gribble got his trousers on and ran up to the wheelhouse. He threw out the survival suits to everyone from their locker. He remembers that Cobban looked “freaked out”. “We all were. It’s blowing fucking 30, 40 miles an hour. And there’s fucking ice all over the windows, so it’s fucking cold. And now I’ve got to go swimming in this shit.”View image in fullscreenFishers preparing crab pots.Photograph: Natalie Fobes/Getty ImagesIt was hard to get the suits on because the vessel was now listing by 20 degrees. Gribble got his legs in his suit by jumping into a chair in the wheelhouse and bracing himself against the armrest. He slipped, got back up, got his suit on, zipped it up. He went outside, helped Lawler with his zip. They made a plan. They shouted it to be heard over the wind. “Fucking stay together. We fucking live. We’re not fucking dying. We stay together.” Later Gribble said: “I knew in my head we were dying.” He looked back at the wheelhouse and saw David Cobban, Gary’s boy, at the door. He had his suit on, but he wasn’t moving. Gribble screamed at him. “Get out! Get out! We need to get out! The boat’s fucking sinking!”Everyone was screaming. Gribble was screaming at them to get out; they were screaming for help. From whom? Gary Cobban had sent a Mayday call at 21:55. He repeated “mayday” several times and gave the vessel’s name and position: 56° 29’ N 157° 01’ W. On the recording he sounds calm when he says: “We’re rolling over.”Fall into cold water, and you will instantly gasp at the cold and breathe in water. Your body will immediately transfer blood away from your extremities to keep your core warm. This is called the cold shock response, and it means that the first few minutes are critical.Among the chaos and fear, Gribble was trying to get the light on his suit to work but his hands were in “these stupid gloves, these Gumby gloves”. He couldn’t manipulate the light out of the pocket it was in. He was desperately trying to find some buoys or anything they could hold on to in the water. He was trying to throw a line to the wheelhouse so that the men inside it could climb back up. By then the boat was listing by about 45 degrees. The power cut out.Gribble was still yelling at David Cobban to get out. “He was just sitting there in kind of shock. He probably didn’t want to leave his dad. I’ve fished with my dad. I don’t know what I’d do in that situation either. I don’t know if he made it out. I hope maybe he was washed out. But the last time I saw him, he was just sitting at the door and I was screaming for him.” The boat was so skewed now that Gribble and Lawler could walk on the side of the wheelhouse. Gribble was shocked at the speed of the disaster. He thought the boat would lean and list for a couple of hours. In fact, “between sleeping and swimming was about 10 minutes”.A wave washed Gribble and Lawler into the ocean. They were separated. “I’m getting tossed and turned. Fucking water all down my stupid suit. And I’m going to die. This is how I’m going to fucking die, New Year’s Day.” He had the ability still to wonder about the details. “Do I just suck in water? Do I just wait to freeze to death?”He was screaming for Lawler. He was getting tumbled by waves but in between the tumbling, he could see the Scandies Rose. He couldn’t quite believe it and in his testimony his cursing gets even more frequent. “The fucking bow fucking vertical in the sky. It just goes straight down like the fucking Titanic. I’m just sitting there in shock, like, what the fuck? And whoosh. Gone.”Gribble started to surf the waves as best he could. If he was going to die, he may as well have some fun with it. So there he was, riding the waves, pretty comfortable in his suit, when he saw “a beautiful fucking survival raft floating right toward me”. It was 15 metres away. He rode a wave that took him right to the raft and pulled himself in. He was screaming for Lawler and then he heard his friend scream back. “Now we’re in the raft. At least our bodies will get found or whatever, depending on how long.”A life raft is equipped with some food, water, and safety equipment such as flares and a flashlight. They shot off a flare and it hit the sea. They tried another one. Too soon, in hindsight; they had only been in the raft an hour or so. “But we thought we were dying so we just freaked out.” Gribble thinks there should have been more flares. “All the survival equipment in the raft, it’s fucking worthless. The raft itself? Beautiful piece of equipment. The things in it were just junk.” For a start, everything was wrapped up and tied. How can you untie anything when you are trapped in a survival suit that covers your hands? Are you supposed to take off the suit that is keeping you alive?View image in fullscreenSalmon fishers in Bristol Bay, Alaska.Photograph: Nick Hall/Getty Images/Aurora CreativeThe raft had four feet of water in it. That didn’t mean they would sink, but it meant they were cold, and then they were iced. All the supplies were rolling around in water. Gribble sounds furious in his testimony. Why don’t they make flares that float? “Bullshit.” The lights in the raft went out within 10 minutes. “Why aren’t there LED lights all over the fucking thing, just glowing? Why doesn’t the suit have a headlamp so you can see shit? It’s just very lacking.”Vessel disasters get headlines and attention and expensive multiday hearings. Actually more American fishers die from going overboard than in vessel sinkings. They are not noticed. But they are also the reasons for the safety campaigns, for the constant and valiant attempts to persuade fishers to wear lifejackets at work, to figure out how to get someone overboard back on the vessel, to carry ladders or gaffers that someone can grab on to.If you yearn to be a commercial fisher, despite the costs, the danger, the warming oceans and everything else, the United States makes it easy. You just buy a boat of up to 99 feet and off you go. No training required. Insurance companies and vessel owners may require safety training but if not, it is a free-for-all. “I find that pretty crazy,” said Father Sinclair Oubre, a former merchant seafarer who co-founded the Port Arthur Area Shrimpers Association. “As a former merchant mariner,” he says, “If I want to run a passenger vessel, I immediately need a six-pack, which is a Coast Guard licence to transport six or fewer people in a boat. A shrimp boat that is 75 feet long needs no licensing.”On a merchant ship, Father Sinclair had to do safety drills every 10 days. On a fishing vessel, it’s monthly, and there is no requirement to check the log to see if the drill has been done or done correctly. Father Sinclair has seen the merchant fleet transform its safety culture while the fishing industry hasn’t. Why not? He has a complex answer: federal regulations that aren’t fit; a Coast Guard more concentrated on “flashy activities” since 9/11; a concentration on marine pollution; and the fact that “fishermen fight like cats and dogs against any regulation”.It is standard practice for search and rescue authorities to ask other vessels in the area to assist. Usually, this is done. The weather on the night of 31 December was too atrocious, and when at 11pm the Coast Guard asked the crabber Ruff & Reddy to head to the scene, its skipper refused, as a skipper has a right to do if he believes conditions to be too treacherous. The Ruff & Reddy had chosen to seek shelter off Nakchamik Island at 5am that morning. By now the boat was icing up and it was too hazardous to leave its sheltered position.At 11:26, the Coast Guard at Juneau, on the other side of the Gulf of Alaska, took control of the search and rescue, after it was judged too complicated for the team at Kodiak. Four minutes after that, helicopter CG 6038 with a four-man crew was airborne. A plane followed. The helicopter’s pilot testified that because of the weather, “this was my most challenging flight of my career just getting out there”. There was half a mile of zero visibility and severe turbulence. Then, as they approached the last position of the Scandies Rose, the weather opened up. They could see for two nautical miles. They were wearing night-vision goggles, “which is probably the only way we spotted … What looked like a flashing light at the time”. They had already found one life raft and lowered the rescue swimmer into the freezing ocean. It was empty. They left it inflated in case survivors reached it.After four hours in the raft, Gribble and Lawler’s suits were iced, and they were freezing and wet. When they saw a light, they thought it was on a boat’s mast. There were no flares left, but one of them had the idea to wave a flashlight side to side.The pilot later testified: “As we brought the swimmer up, the pilot in the right seat who was flying happened to see under his night-vision goggles a waving light, and it was definitely not like the normal blinking light. It was a side-to-side, so we knew it was somebody trying to signal us. So we quickly got the rescue swimmer back up into the helicopter. It was so cold that the rescue swimmer, just from going out the door and coming back up, was covered in ice.” The rescue swimmer was Coast Guard third petty officer Evan Grills. He was 24 years old, he came from Florida and this was his first rescue.The pilot had to lower the swimmer safely, but the seas were so wild that the raft kept shifting from one side of the helicopter to the other. The pilot says it was the hardest hoisting he has ever had to do. Grills got ready to drop. “My nerves were OK,” he told local TV afterward. “Right up until the door opened.”By the time Grills reached the water, one of the men had jumped out of the raft into the ocean. He grabbed on to Grills and they were lifted away. Then back down for the other. By then a Coast Guard aircraft had arrived, and the helicopter pilot chose to take the survivors back rather than stay to continue the search.In total, the Coast Guard carried out six searches for the missing crew. They spent a further 10 and a half hours searching 781 square nautical miles and found nothing. Later, the Scandies Rose was located and filmed on the seabed by a remotely operated vehicle. Its images showed two immersion suits still in the wheelhouse “with human remains inside”.In its hearings and subsequent report, the National Transportation Safety Board did not distribute blame for the loss of the Scandies Rose. The pots should definitely not have been stacked so high and the icing should have been accounted for. The weather forecasting was inadequate and the stability instructions on board were wrong, making the boat more susceptible to capsizing. The report’s language is deliberately neutral. The cause was determined to be “inaccurate stability instructions for the vessel”.A Coast Guard safety booklet based on the Scandies Rose sinking was less subtle. Even though Gary Cobban saw the boat had a rapidly worsening list, it stated: “At no time during his watch did the captain of the Scandies Rose declare an emergency for the crew or ring the general alarm to alert the crew, send the crew to investigate the cause of the listing, or prepare to potentially abandon ship.” On the Scandies Rose, the VHF radios had a clearly distinguishable red “distress” button: this needed only one touch and then the boat’s information and coordinates would have been broadcast repeatedly and to everyone. But you had to configure the radios first to enable that function, and that had not been done.Ship of horrors: life and death on the lawless high seasRead moreIn 2020, the survivors and the families of the victims got a $9m payout from the boat’s owners. In 2021, Dean Gribble’s fellow survivor, Jon Lawler, died in a motorcycle accident near Anchorage. He had never been the same since the disaster, his sister wrote on a fundraising page, but was constantly “in a nightmare state”. The missing men of the Scandies Rose have not yet been found.Adapted from Every Last Fish: What Fish Do for Us, and What We Do to Them, published by Granta.

How meat is produced in China may mean the drugs you need here won’t workTue 21 Oct 2025 05.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 12.42 EDTShareWhat we’re putting into our bodies can either nourish us, or make us ill. With that in mind, I wrote recently about the role of food consumption in terms of the risk ofcolon cancer. But what about food production?Across the world, we are seeing the rise of cheap meat: largely driven by demand from a rising middle class whofinally can affordbeef, pork and chicken, which used to be out of reach, given their cost. Approximately 45% of global consumption growth is occurring in upper-middle-income countries including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines. Poultry is set to take an increasingly large share of that growth (projected to grow by 21% by 2034), because it is relatively cheap, widely acceptable and requires fewer resources per kilogram compared with beef or pork. By 2034, it is estimated that poultry will provide 45% of the protein consumed from all meat sources.But this comes with costs. With limited land and intense time pressure,the solutionin many countries has been touse antibiotics at scale. This isn’t just to treat illness, but also as a prophylactic to prevent disease in crowded conditions. And giving antibiotics causes livestock to grow faster, although scientists aren’t sure exactly why that is. All of this means that, unlike their use for humans – where antibiotics are almost always given to treat illness – their use in farming is much more widespread and indiscriminate. Studies tracking their useestimate that 73%of all antimicrobials sold globally are used in animals raised for food.This enormous overuse is leading to a rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. For example,resistance to colistin, a “last-resort antibiotic”, first developed in E coli bacteria which then infected pigs. E coli was later found in pig farmers. All it takes is aeroplanes and global travel networks for these pathogens to spread globally. And now, colistin-resistant bacteria have been identified not only in hospitals in China, butacross the world.What does this mean for someone sitting in a GP clinic or a hospital in England or Scotland? It means that infections that were once easily treatable (think of ear infections, urinary tract infections or post-operative infections) become untreatable even after a dose of antibiotics. It means that surgeries such as caesarean sections, hip replacements and cancer therapies that rely on immune suppression all become riskier. And while new antibiotics are technically possible to develop, thepipeline is slow and costly. We have to preserve the arsenal we have.View image in fullscreen‘With limited land and intense time pressure, the solutionin many countries has been to use antibiotics at scale’.Photograph: Md Saiful Islam Khan/Getty ImagesThe solutions to this problem can only come from changing global food production. To be fair, the UK has made significant progress in reducing antibiotics in farming. Sales of antibiotics for animals reared for food has droppedby 59% since 2014. The use of colistin is now effectively zero. The use of critically important antibiotics has dropped to less than 0.5% of all animal antibiotic sales. And research by several EU bodies suggested that after antibiotic use in farming wascut by nearly halfbetween 2014 and 2021, antibiotic resistance in E coli across the bloc also began to decline.But just focusing on the UK or EU is a drop in the bucket. Unless the large middle-income countries are part of the conversation on how meat is produced, we remain just as vulnerable to antibiotic resistance. The challenge is that moving towards different production practices takes more space and time: making meat even more expensive in countries with large populations can quickly trigger social unrest, political backlash and frustration. The health imperative is clear, but this needs to be balanced with concerns over food security, economics and public demand.Climate scientistshave long warnedabout the environmental costs of the current global food system, whether it’s methane emissions, biodiversity loss, or deforestation. But these effects often feel long-term and abstract, especially for people struggling with cost-of-living pressures or concerned with immediate healthcare access.Antibiotic resistance is tangible. Almost everyone has taken antibiotics at some point, and we can imagine what would happen if their infection-clearing effect was suddenly switched off.Foodproduction, health and climate are all connected. How pork is produced in China affects whether your child’s antibiotics work in Edinburgh. Whether a woman in Lagos survives a C-section is linked to how chickens are farmed in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Never has this been clearer than in the case of a sold-out modern-day merkin ...Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.55 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 12.47 EDTShareEvery writer has a “just in case” piece – the article they’ll write if their favourite artist dies, their beloved team wins, or the political moment they dreamed of arrives. I had mine all planned out. The piece: the bush is back! A 3,000-word essay about the quiet reclamation of pubic hair in all its unruly glory, replete with hair-raising puns befitting a story of such campy defiance.But I must face the fact that I may never get to write this piece. Why? BecauseKim Kardashianand her underwear brand Skims have ruined it, with the sale of a faux pubic hair thong called “the Ultimate Bush”. Launched last week with a video featuring models in a 70s-styled gameshow called “Does the carpet match the drapes?”, the £34 thong features a triangle of hair made of synthetic fibres to mimic pubic manes in 12 hair colour and texture combos. It sold out in under 24 hours, leaving the internet to wonder: who exactly is this product for? Those who regret lasering it all off? Or folks looking for some retro merkin fun?Now, I’m normally of the belief that most Kardashian news can be promptly disregarded; but the thing is, dear reader, I was convinced we were but a hair’s breadth (sorry) from a serious big bush revival. There were pubes on the catwalk (see Margiela’s 2024 haute couture celebration of the merkin), and at the beauty counter (the Kiehl’s campaign that used real pubic hair). Online, there was “full bush in a bikini” – a TikTok trend kicked off by a viral video in which a woman delights in seeing precisely that – which became the phrase du jour of women posting in praise of a full thatch, or criticising removal for its ingrown hairs, razor burns and just the whole “male gaze” of it all. And I must give a mention to one user known asPresident Bush,whose popular “bush aura” readings see her guess what pubic hairstyle a celebrity is sporting based on vibe – the cooler, happier, and more independent the woman, the more silky and abundant the fur. Think big dick energy, bush edition.Now I admit all of this was a bit of a, ahem, fringe movement (look, these puns have to go somewhere), but in my mind it was sure to grow. Sure, body positivity as a phenomenon had its problems, but as Turkey teeth, Ozempic and tweakments-on-your-lunch-hour inch towards the norm, I can’t help but lament the total abandonment of any “You’re fine as you are” sentiment. Surely, I figured, it would all just get too much – too expensive in a cost of living crisis, too much effort when free timeis at an abysmal low– and we’d see a return to something more natural. And why not start with the short and curlies? Withmore than 80% of womengrooming theirs, it’s one of the most common beauty treatments around. Challenge that and who knows what could be next?But instead we get the pubic hair thong. If you were being generous, you may say it was promoting bushes as desirable. But a look at the thong, in all its neatness, narrowness and symmetry – and the way it casts an intrinsic part of women’s bodies as an accessory – and it’s hard to see it as a win. Rather it’s just more of the same from a beauty industry that has mastered selling us back an ersatz version of our own nature for enormous profit.When will this madness end?! Why can’t bedhead hair just involve getting out of bed and not bothering to brush it? Or the wet look just be forgetting to dry it? Who will take up the cause of making minimal effort great again?Probably the one person who could move the dial is Kim Kardashian herself, a woman whose image is so powerful that, according to philosopher of beauty Heather Widdows, it has absorbed the world’s regional differences in beauty and homogenised them. Now there is one beauty standard globally: the Kardashian standard. Indeed, if Kardashian was serious about unleashing big bush energy on to the world, she could simply show us how it’s done and let ‘it’ grow free.Who knows, perhaps one day Kimmy K will lead us the other way, letting her own body return to its original state without cinchers, injectables and an army of beauticians on call.

Do  the politicians jumping on this bandwagon care what they are doingTue 21 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 09.24 EDTShareIf social media posts are anything to go by,Tommy Robinson is planning to visit Villa Parknext month as a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan. What can possibly have attracted the Luton-born political activist to the Israeli Premier League’s second-placed club? The stylish all-action midfield play of Dor Peretz? The stirring run to the group stages of the 2004-05 Champions League? Perhaps, in the fashion of the club’s former manager Robbie Keane, Robinson’s embrace is simply the fulfilment of a cherished and multifaceted boyhood dream.But of course there is a natural synergy there too, one we should probably have identified long before the Uefa computer pitted Aston Villa against the club long known in Israel as “the country’s team”, and inadvertently threw a hand grenade into British politics. Like Robinson, Maccabi attracts a fervid following of young men from the far right, who gather at weekends to chant racist and anti-Arab slogans. Like Robinson’s disciples, Maccabi’s fans have occasionally been known to indulge in a little light violence.A decade agoMaccabi fans unveiled a banner reading “refugees (not) welcome”, a refrain with which you can imagine the artist formerly known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon nodding heartily along.Then there was Maharan Radi, the Israeli international midfielder who after signing for the team was greeted withracist slursand death threats by members of the Maccabi Fanatics, the club’s ultra group. Anti-Arab graffiti began to appear in the city. Later, many years after leaving the club, Radi would testify that some of his teammates had tried to mediate with some of the more hard-line supporters. A few days later, Radi said, they reported back. “There’s nothing we can do,” they told him. “They just hate Arabs.”None of this explains on its own the decision by West Midlands police to ban travelling Maccabi fans from their Europa League game againstAston Villa. But it does offer a context so sorely lacking from the incendiary discussion and ill-informed grandstanding that have engulfed the subsequent days. Many Maccabi fans will doubtless have travelled to Birmingham with the sole intention of watching a game of football. But it takes a certain wilful blindness to ignore the likelihood that a significant number will have had other intentions in mind.Partly this stems from the fact that elite football in England is a largely depoliticised space, that most fanbases are not overtly activist in the manner of many of their foreign counterparts. In Israel, by contrast, football and politics remain deeply intertwined. Traditionally Maccabi teams were associated with the right; Hapoel with the left. And even if this distinction is no longer strictly observed, football in Israel – as with much of civic life – is often an alternative battleground upon which to enact some very familiar feuds.In 2020, a group of protesters demonstrating against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was attacked by a group of Maccabi Fanaticswielding batons and broken bottles. Anti-Arab chants and songs are commonplace at home games. A banner displayed at a recent game read “fuck Hamas, fuck St Pauli, fuck Hapoel”: the last of these a reference to their city rivals, the second a small German club famous for its progressive, anti-racist values.The point here is that to treat this as your common or garden football hooliganism threat is to miss the point. Rather, it is the prospect oftargeted, politicised footballing violencethat renders this particular case so potentially toxic. Violence of the sort seenin Amsterdam late last year, when travelling fans and local thugs fought in the streets, far from the Johan Cruyff Arena where Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv were playing. Israeli fans, an Arab taxi driver and pro-Palestinian protesters were all targeted and subjected to lawless violence.Who started it? Who was more to blame? At what precise point did tension, provocation and goading cross the boundary into criminality? Nobody can really be sure, and in any case these are questions whose answers are framed by what you already choose to believe. And in recent days, as politicians from across the spectrum have stampeded to condemn West Midlands police – from the centre to the far right – it is clear what lessons our political class chose to learn from the episode.Perhaps, given the government’s recent record on policing protest, we should assume it has some classified intelligence on theMaccabi Tel Avivfanbase that it is regrettably unable to share with us. Perhaps they’ve done a secret straw poll of the Fanatics and concluded that they’re all great lads who just want to see Villa’s Morgan Rogers in the flesh. In which case, it certainly seems to have materialised in a hurry.Aston Villa put out their statement confirming the police decisionat 5.17pmon Thursday. Kemi Badenoch put out her reactionat 8.02pm. Nigel Farage’s statement dropped at 8.58pm. Keir Starmer’sat 9pm. Ed Davey, 9.45pm (must do better). Presumably they all took the time to consult stakeholders, take security briefings and make the required calls to foreign officials before doing so. But the speed of the bandwagon-jumping should at least give us pause.There is, ironically, a broader cross-border debate to be had about the increasingly sinister securitisation of football fans at matches. After all, Maccabi are by no means the only club to see their supporters banned from European away games.Eintracht Frankfurt fanswill not be welcome in Naples this week. Ajax fans were banned from Marseille last month. Eventhe cancellation of the Tel Aviv derbyat the weekend was as much a case of police brutality as fan behaviour, part of a pattern by which Israeli security forces have increasingly been engaged in stoking violence rather than trying to suppress it.But of course none of this fits neatly into a clicky, media-friendly race-war narrative, fed by social media algorithms and all the usual provocateurs. We are spun the line that a few hundred far-right ultras with a history of violence are somehow representative of all Jews everywhere, in much the same way that the Netanyahu government appoints itself the mouthpiece for an entire religion of 16 million people based around the world, many of whom despise him and actively mobilise against him every day. We are expected to believe in the existence of a hostile antisemitic conspiracy co-hatched by the police and the residents ofBirmingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But at the same time it is a fascinating case study into the instincts of our political and media class. You want concerted international action against Israel for its crimes in Gaza and elsewhere? Good luck with that when you can’t even get a few violent far-right football fans turned away at Birmingham Airport.The quiet part, of course, is that when Maccabi fans speak out against refugees, chant “death to Arabs”, associate their enemies with Hamas and commit violence in our city centres, there is a small but significant part of our country that tacitly agrees with them, and a much larger part of our country willing to humour them out of expediency.And really Robinson is just the thin end of the wedge here, the racist canary in the mine, thereductio ad absurdumof an impulse that has long been embedded in our politics. Choosing to stand with the far-right foreign football hooligan against the local police force: this, apparently, is what British patriotism looks like in 2025.

As visitors queued to get in to the Louvre, thieves were escaping out of another wing, after a raid on the crown jewels that took just seven minutes. The story could have been lifted straight from a Hollywood movie or an episode of the French mystery thriller seriesLupin.Yet, although this outrageous theft has stunnedFrance, it was perhaps a fitting act of larceny for a country that has just been the victim of another incredible heist. From one Monday to the next the French people were swindled into thinking we were getting a new government. The political drama left many of us feeling like confused characters in Groundhog Day, but perhaps the closer symbolism is to be found in the surreal theft at the Louvre.To recap: Sébastien Lecornu, the prime minister,resigned on 6 October, less than a month into his term. Lecornu threw in the towel when it became clear he could not win the support of the national assembly for his budget. His resignation provoked the collapse of the shortest-lived government in the history of the Fifth Republic. Yet, 48 hours afterpromisingthat his “mission” as prime minister was “over”, Lecornuwas reinstatedin an audacious move by the president Emmanuel Macron, who entrusted the now ex-PM with the same mission he had just failed at.Over the next seven days, the country was rocked byunprecedented political upheaval, yet we ended up back exactly where we had been, although led to believe that we had a new government.This deception goes back to Macron’s reckless decision to call asnap election in 2024, after the far right made historic gains in European elections. The “back me or sack me” challenge produced a decisive rebuff for the president:a hung parliamentwith nobody able to command an overall majority. Macron could no longer dictate his politics to legislators. The problem is that Macron has never accepted that outcome. Not only has he repeatedly refused to appoint a prime minister from the left coalition which secured a plurality of votes, but he stubbornly keeps trying to build a government aligned with his own views, even though they have been rejected at the polls. Each attempt so far has ended in failure with prime ministers falling in quick succession.Lecornu’s reappointment (he isone of the most faithful of Macron’s inner circle), gives us two successive governments with barely any variation, with many of the “new” ministers identifying as “Macronists” and several others coming from the rightwing party Les Républicains, whichscored only 6.2%in the last legislative elections.We are now at the mercy of a single individual – a president long accustomed to dictating his policies to a compliant parliamentary majority. His party is on political life support but it has made a last, desperate raid on power thanks to the unlikely support of a leftwing party. The Socialist party, which in 2024 was part of the left coalition that fiercely opposed Macron, has now entered intoa pact with the government. It came to the table with high initial demands – including, notably, the creation of a “Zucman tax” (a proposed levy on the super-rich, inspired by the economist Gabriel Zucman), and the repeal of Macron’s pension reform. In the end, the mere promise of suspending the hugely unpopular pension change – with no real guarantee – was enough to win a commitmentnot to censurethe entire budget.The Socialists are busy applauding the suspension of thehated pension reform. But according to the economist Michaël Zemmour, thisis merely a postponementin the implementation schedule – one that keeps the retirement age at 64 and allows a few generations to benefit, without any structural reconsideration of the reform itself.It is important to note, too, that austerity-driven budget cuts have already inflicted tangible damage: in June, Louvre employeeswent on strike and blocked the museum,denouncing staff reductions and the lack of resources for security.Yet, instead of standing up for their voters, Socialist leaders are letting Macron buy more time for his doomed reform project.Last week Iappeared ona TV panel, commenting on the appointment of the new government. I said how exasperating it was to find ourselves in the exact same situation as the previous Monday, only now with the impression that politicians were gaslighting us. One of the other panellists interrupted me to say there had been “some progress” and that we needed “to explain it to the audience”.What is there to explain? People can see and understand for themselves. To me, such a reaction says a lot about the disconnect between the commentariat in France, who seem to enjoy the political game, and ordinary French people, reduced to the role of onlookers of a pathetic spectacle that only entrenches their daily problems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And now a prime minister who declared live on television that he was done with the job – is back in the job. How can French voters trust such politicians?The authoritarian nature of Macron’s politics – and the dominance of the executive inherent to France’s Fifth Republic – have long been defended in the name of political stability. That rationale has served as a pretext for an increasingly hyper-presidential regime, which today stands as a true obstacle to the popular will.No wonder French voters feel as if we have been the victims of a double heist; twice in the same month left wondering who is really in charge, and if the system is capable of protecting our most treasured assets.Rokhaya Diallo is a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The two had left Alma’s the night before following an evening of drinking and tossing around airless provocations about how offending someone became “the pre-eminent cardinal sin”, or how “the common enemy has been chosen and it’s the straight, white, cis male”. After a nightcap at her apartment, Maggie says, Hank “crossed the line”.This is the point where one would expect, based on thehandful of movies post-#MeToothat have employed ellipsis to convey the stultifying horrors of sexual assault, or the predominance of the so-calledtrauma plotin contemporary narratives, or even just the fresh memory of a similar scene of immediate aftermath inEva Victor’s superb dramedySorry, Baby, that Maggie would stumble around details of the violation, or the numbing shock, or the confusing freefall of aftermath. But Edebiri, as the critic Justin Changobserved, seems to have been directed to play Maggie as if she’s lying – wide-eyed, jittery, evasive and perhaps even, in overtly reaching for Alma’s hand, manipulative. (We have already seen her rifle through Alma’s bathroom and steal what amounts to Chekhov’s old newspaper clippings.) This scene of revelation – the first telling of what happened – plays not as a confession but a loyalty test for Alma, one which the mentor, cold and clinical and dismissive, fails miserably.It’s seemingly also a false loyalty test for the viewer: do you believe Maggie, because you feel like you should? Do you trust the story? Watching this scene, I felt the dull tug of bait, the same feeling I get when anyone mentions “cancel culture” seriously. My hackles raised slightly at the presumption of certain presumptions: that I would interpret a scene through a blind “believe all women” lens, that I would critique a film for calling such slogans into question, that I would, on some level, be offended. The point of this scene, in this campus drama of generational divides and reputational warfare, is not to illuminate a particular experience or action; it is politicized reaction. As Alma’s philosophy department head puts it, lamenting the increasingly fraught world of academia: “Against all odds, I’ve found myself in the business of optics, not substance.”Sorry, Baby is a smart film about sexual assault and it’s here at just the right time | Adrian HortonRead moreThat’s not necessarily a bad business for a film to be in, particularly one about an allegation that so often hinges on the perceived trustworthiness of the person who comes forward, how well they can make their case to the court of public opinion. A better film would have treated this scene as a grenade launched into Yale’s philosophy department, examining the strange and discomfiting complexities that emerge when inherently unverifiable testimony meets arbitrary procedures, when personal loyalties challenge ethical stances and when doubts collide with conviction – what the campus reaction to sexual assault might have been like, during that brief window between the upwelling of #MeToo and the now entrenched, predominant backlash.Instead, After the Hunt, written by first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett and glossed up by Guadagnino into a recent-history period piece (it’s primarily set in 2019, though its topical references span the 2010s), treats it like a pinball, flinging Maggie’s unspecified allegation off a series of hot-button third rails. What if, as Hank claims, Maggie plagiarized her dissertation, and he was about to expose her? What if, actually, she is the Black, queer spawn of the b-word (billionaire, and Yale mega-donors at that; given that Ivy League nepo babies are overwhelmingly white, this detail feels particularly contrived to juice the idea that marginalized identity confers unearned or undeserved privilege). What if a mob of protesters, led by her non-binary partner, swarm Alma for answers? What if she is actually a mediocre student?After the Hunt trains not on Maggie, however, but on Alma, whom Roberts imbues with a magnetic inscrutability that manages to give shape to a ludicrous spiral through a cluster of provocations – sexual assault allegation, Brett Kavanaugh-esque pleas for sympathy, “cancel culture”, administrative dogma, gen-X derision for gen-Z snow-flakiness. The film unfortunately echoes earlier movies shaped by the #MeToo movement – Emerald Fennell’sPromising Young Woman, Olivia Wilde’sDon’t Worry Darling, Zoë Kravitz’sBlink Twice– that prioritized deadening shock over character to make a point. In those, it was some variation of “misogyny is a helluva drug”. In After the Hunt, as the director and stars have reiterated in a high-profile press tour, it’s to get people talking.It’s not working – the film made a dismal $1.6m domestically on its opening weekend. That’s a confluence of factors outside the film’s control – it doesn’t help that it’s arriving as a relic of the late-Biden era at a time when universities are under full ideological assault from the Trump administration – but in part because provocation for provocation’s sake is not a winsome trick. After the Hunt, like all of Guadagnino’s films, is sleek and intoxicating and attractive, in the way that mahogany-walled, prestigious rooms can be; it’s also hollow, a cacophony of clanging signifiers like Foucault’s panopticon, Rolling Stone exposés and “this shallow cultural moment”. Spoilers ahead: it’s never made clear what actually happened between Hank and Maggie, nor what Maggie even accuses him of, as if it makes no difference; Hank is revealed to be right about Maggie’s plagiarism but also liable to not stop at “no”; weakened by illness, Alma confesses to her husband, Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg), that she had a relationship as a 15-year-old with her father’s friend, then made up rape allegations to punish him when his interest strayed. That she was a child, as Frederik argues, feels like poor consolation; the emphasis remains on the damage of improperly weaponized feelings, everyone revealed to be horribly compromised.Fallen stars: why are Hollywood A-listers flopping at the box office?Read moreView image in fullscreenAyo Edebiri and Julia Roberts in After the Hunt.Photograph: Amazon Content Services LLC/PAI don’t believe, as some haveargued, that this amounts to “reactionary centrism”, a mode of politics that prioritizes even-handedness while over-indexing leftwing overreach. To call it such would be to ascribe too much ideological logic to a film that is primarily about the feeling of agitation via micro-era buzzwords. Nor is it a crime of “muddled politics” – films reflect people, and people are always a jumble of contradictions, idiosyncrasies, patterns and histories that are never entirely coherent. It reads, instead, as an honest reflection of “cancel culture” – a misnomer of a concept that is always inflated, never honestly invoked, at once too broad and too inflexible: a largely ungrounded concept whose meaning depends on the user, often as a deflection. Like so much of the online discourse cycles that clearly inspired the film’s twists, After the Hunt has the stale taste of something reverse-engineered to push buttons, inorganic controversy manufactured to pass as juicy. (See, in the rage-bait variety, the recentSydney Sweeney jeans controversy.)To be fair, it is exceedingly difficult to translate internet frenzy to the big screen – Todd Field’s magnificentTár, also about a domineering, icy, staggeringly compromised woman, was one of the very few to seamlessly weave a strain of “cancel culture” in, by burrowing deeply into the psyche of said staggeringly compromised woman.

And made a bad situation worseTue 21 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.29 EDTShareKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have only themselves to blame for the mess they are in over tax. The key moment was not thedefenestration of their welfare billor the uprising over pensioners’ winter fuel payments. The die was cast more than a year earlier.In January 2024, the then chancellor Jeremy Huntimplemented a cutin employee national insurance contributions. Four months later he announced afurther reductionfrom 10% to 8% and even hinted that he was considering abolishing employee contributions altogether. It was the mother of all election bribes, costing the exchequer about£10bn a year. It was also entirely cynical, offered in the absolute confidence that the Tories would not be in office long enough to grapple with the consequences. Had they by any chance won the election, he would have had to recoup the tax revenue forgone by either tax increases or by further swingeing cuts to the public sector.ForLabour, this was an obvious trap. Faced with these utterly irresponsible tax cuts at a time when pressure on the public sector was approaching breaking point, Reeves was challenged by Hunt to say whether, if she became chancellor, she would reinstate them. The sensible reply would have been to say: “We will decide if and when we are elected, and discover how much of a mess you have left us.” She might also have added, “And, by the way, the next election will not be about tax cuts. It will be about the dreadful state of the public sector.”Instead, however, Reeves fell headlong into the trap Hunt had set, promising not only that she would not reinstate his cuts, but incredibly going further and promisingnot to raiseany of the main sources of revenue: income tax, VAT or national insurance. From that moment on the party was doomed.Labour in opposition is understandably nervous about making commitments on tax, given the near hysteria that can be organised by the Tories and their friends at even the slightest hint of an increase. So nervous, in fact, that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, on their way to a landslide victory, undertook in advance of the 1997 election that they would stick to Tory spending plans for their first two years in office.They did not know they were destined to win by a landslide: they expected to win by only a handful of seats. In 2024, however, the political landscape was entirely different and for one very good reason. The Tories were hoist on the Brexit petard. For the first time in living memory, they had to compete for votes with a more or less credible party to the right of them. This was a historic opportunity. It was always obvious that Labour was going to win and win big, if only because of a quirk in the first-pass-the-post electoral system. Instead of trying to out-Tory the Tories on tax, the 2024 election presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an honest conversation with the electorate about tax. A challenge that both parties conspicuously ducked.What should Starmer and Reeves have done? In a nutshell, they should have delivered a simple message to the electorate. If we want decent public services, we are going to have to pay for them. And let’s not pretend, as some do, that it can all be paid for solely by taxing the rich. To be sure, there are steps that could be taken to tap the prosperous – a couple more bands on council tax, for example – but the top 10% of earners already account for60% of income tax revenue. Extra funding on the scale necessary can only come from an increase in thebasicrate of income tax – which, by the way, was 22% until Gordon Brown cut 2p off it in return for a round of applause that had faded within 24 hours. Rishi Sunak then followed this up in 2024 with a further1p cutin the basic rate. Bang went another seven or eight billion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Reeves took the opposite tack. She adopted the Tory language, repeatedly talking of the “tax burden”. She could not bring herself to point out the obvious connection between tax and the preservation of the social fabric. She could have argued that tax fairly raised and wisely used is the subscription we pay for living in civilisation. She might have added that, far from being extortionate, theUK is well downthe north European league table and, the tax burden in the UKis higher nowthan at any time since 1950, that is because demands on the public sector are greater than they have ever been.We have been here before. It is now widely recognised that the 1964 Labour government should have devalued immediately on taking office. As today, its inheritance was dire. The pound, then a reserve currency, was under enormous pressure. The new government could easily have got away with blaming devaluation on the outgoing Tories. Instead, it kicked the can down the road, hoping against hope to avoid the inevitable with the result that in 1967 it was forced into a humiliating U-turn.“What was your biggest mistake?” I asked Harold Wilson when, as a young journalist, I interviewed him in Downing Street in March 1970. He replied, “That I underestimated the power of speculators to undermine the value of the pound.” Wilson at least had the excuse that in 1964 he had just been elected on a wafer-thin majority. Starmer and Reeves have no such alibi.Chris Mullin is a former Labour minister and the author of four volumes of widely acclaimed diariesExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionRachel ReevesLabourJeremy HuntcommentShareReuse this content"

A court of appeal will eventually give its view on the veracity of the second clause of that statement. But unfortunately for Mr Sarkozy, the drama and significance of his fall cannot simply be wished away.President of France between 2007 and 2012, Mr Sarkozy was foundguiltyof criminal conspiracy to obtain illicit campaign funds from the regime of the late Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Handed a five‑year sentence, he has become the first former leader of an EU country to go behind bars, and the first French leader since the disgraced head of Vichy France,Philippe Pétain. In a country in which the elected president enjoys a quasi-monarchical status, Tuesday’s extraordinary spectacle was a seminal moment.At a time when faith in political institutions in France has collapsed to the point where the lights are flashing red, it was also a salutary demonstration that no one is above the law. In a pollpublishedon Tuesday in Le Monde newspaper, two-thirds of respondents said that they believed a majority of politicians were corrupt, and nearly nine out of 10 said that most acted mainly out of self-interest. In sentencing Mr Sarkozy and ordering that his prison term should begin without delay, the judge, Nathalie Gavarino,saidthat she took into account both the exceptionally grave nature of the offences and the fact that they were “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.Such reflections might be considered unexceptional, especially given that Mr Sarkozy haspreviouslybeen convicted in separate corruption cases. But the Sarkozy trial and its aftermath have disturbingly laid bare the extent to which in France, as in othercountries, the rule of law is threatened by a newly fashionable contempt for the judiciary and the attempted manipulation of public opinion.In Trumpian fashion, an exhaustive and meticulous legal process has been groundlessly presented by Mr Sarkozy’s supporters as a judicial plot and leftwing vendetta. Following the ruling last month, the former president effectively denounced his sentence as unlawful and condemned the “hatred” with “no limits” that allegedly motivated it. As senior politicians and supporters from the right and far right have filled the airwaves and conservative press with the same talking points, Ms Gavarino hasreceivednumerous death threats.Hearteningly, the public does not appear to be buying it. A post-verdict poll found comfortable majoritiesbackingboth the conduct of Mr Sarkozy’s trial and his sentencing. But the drama, and the naked attempt to undermine the reputation of the legal system, was in all likelihood merely a dress rehearsal. In January, Marine Le Pen’sappealagainst a conviction for embezzlement of political funds will take place. Should she lose it, the far‑right National Rally leader will be ruled out of running in the 2027 presidential race.In a polarised and mistrustful nation, that will be a perilous moment for the French judiciary to navigate. Mr Sarkozy may yet be released before his own appeal, following a request by his lawyers. But the irresponsible and baseless attacks on the legal system before, during and after his trial have set a damaging precedent.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The government’slatest white paperis a welcome attempt to rectify this. If the plan succeeds, it would go some way towards fulfilling Labour’s pledge to break down barriers that block opportunities for too many young people.But there is no simple way to enhance the status of further education colleges while also raising the quality of job-linked training and adult education more widely. Previous attempts have not gone well. Overall, investment in non-academic training hasdroppedcalamitously since 2010. The apprenticeship levy scheme introduced by the Conservatives in 2017 was a dismalfailure, as employers spent the money on existing employees rather than entry-level opportunities. Thetake-up of new T-levels, which were meant to raise the status of technical learning to match A-levels, has been disappointing.Predictably, given what is already known about the government’s priorities, the industries singled out for special treatment include defence, artificial intelligence, green energy and construction. The last even has its own target:60,000 new jobs. By contrast, jobs in social care and the creative industries are virtually ignored – which is disappointing if unsurprising.The detail of how responsibility for the new system is to be divided between the one-year-old national body, Skills England, and regional authorities is still to be worked out. But the devolving principle is sound. If employers are to be made accountable for their role in shaping local labour markets and bridging the “skills chasm” that divides London and the south-east from other parts of England, elected politicians must be empowered. Increased flexibility around the levy scheme should be beneficial. In return for the freedom to offer shorter, non-apprenticeship courses, employers must improve their offer to new starters.Bridget Phillipson deserves credit for a recent funding increase to colleges, although the gap with school budgets – and pay – remains deeply unfair. But the recent decision to transfer responsibility for skills training away from the Department for Education to the Department for Work and Pensions makes sense overall. Ministers are right to be concerned about the 1 million people aged 16-24 who are not in education or work. They now have an opportunity to rectify past mistakes on welfare and build new pathways betweenjobcentres, training and jobs.Such rational changes risk being undermined, however, by poorly thought throughreform of the qualifications landscape. More relaxed rules around maths and English GCSE retakes are a step in the right direction. But the best thing about the new V-levels announced by Ms Phillipson is their neat name. The decision to axe existing courses, including BTecs, before these new vocational options are even ready has left colleges reeling. If ministers don’t rethink this overhasty move, they risk adding to – rather than reducing – the number of 16- to 19-year-olds who end up underqualified and out of work.Urgent though the higher education funding crisis is, universities would have been better dealt with in a separate document. Their presence in this one only adds to the impression that further education and skills are not regarded as weighty enough on their own. Ministers now need to show that they will take the college sector’s response to their proposals as seriously as it deserves.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromRachel Sharp,Dr Tim OwenandPaul McGilchristTue 21 Oct 2025 12.49 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 13.01 EDTShareRachel Reeves has said that higher taxes on the wealthy will be a part of the story at the autumn budget (Report, 15 October). The government must use this moment to ensure that the super-rich contribute their fair share rather than cutting services that impact the poorest and most marginalised.We all want the same things: thriving communities, good jobs and a future that we can look to with hope. But the rules have been rigged by the super-rich and powerful, allowing them to hoard wealth while the rest of us scrape by. This is fuelling division at a time when people desperately need meaningful change.I work with MPs from all parties, trade unions, thinktanks and millionaires to make the tax system fairer. Here’s how the chancellor can raise tens of billions to invest in the country and rebuild trust in politics and one another:1) Reforming capital gains tax by equalising rates with income tax will treat income from work and wealth the same, while removing unfair loopholes. So will applying national insurance contributions to income from investments. Why should a nurse or teacher or factory worker pay it while someone renting out five houses pays nothing?2) End tax breaks for oil and gas companies, and private equity bosses, and properly resourceHMRCto tackle tax abuse and costly loopholes. Together, these changes could raise around £30bn a year.3) Reeves could raise more, while tackling inequality, through a modest wealth tax on the super-rich. Just 2% on net assets over £10m – affecting about 20,000 people – would raise more than £20bn annually, which could make childcare affordable, revitalise high streets and improve lives.The chancellor has the solutions at her fingertips. Now she needs the political will to make them happen.Caitlin BoswellHead of advocacy and policy, Tax Justice UKI recall in the 1940s and 1950s my wealthy grandfather complaining that his top rate of income tax was 90%. I was a beneficiary of that as he set up two trusts in retaliation: one for the private education of me and my three siblings, and one for his two sisters to help with their living expenses. But the country would not have seen the huge increase in social housing after the war, or the establishment of the National Health Service, without a progressive tax system. Despite his legal income tax reductions through establishing trusts, grandad still died a wealthy man.With such obscene social inequality today, it is absurd for aLabourchancellor to reject a wealth tax and progressive income tax comparable to what my grandad paid. Why was income tax for the wealthy reduced so drastically from the 1980s? It’s not as if the need for social housing disappeared or the rising costs of the NHS evaporated.Rachel SharpLondonSo Rachel Reeves thinks that those with the broadest shoulders should pay a fair share of tax (Report, 16 October). I’m wondering if the royal family is getting nervous. Will we see them paying inheritance tax, for instance? What next? Their wills being available to the public? I’m not holding my breath.Dr Tim OwenNewcastle upon TyneIf taxation is ever going to be freed from the damaging perception that it is a “burden” rather than social good, it must first ditch the misleading metaphors designed to ease pain. IfRachel Reevesreally believes that tax is a “fair share” issue, there is no need for special pleading. Talk of “broad shoulders” unhelpfully implies an act of altruism or even heroism from those who possess them. I’m pretty sure they don’t need to feel saintly as well as wealthy.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He is wrong.Far from standing still, the theatre sector has for many years placed inclusion at its heart, with free and subsidised tickets, relaxed, captioned or signed performances, community partnerships, touring to underserved areas, and outreach in schools.These are not token gestures – they are central to how theatre now operates, and to the sense of shared belonging that live performance creates.Where we have fallen short as a nation is not in our theatres, but in valuing creativity within education. The decline of drama and the arts in schools is not an inevitability but a policy choice – and a missed opportunity we can still reverse if we choose to. Rather than bemoaning what is lost, we should champion what could be gained.We are hopeful that the upcoming curriculum review will place creativity at the heart of education for the next generation, and we urge the government to recognise the social and economic power of access to culture by backing ourTheatre For Every Childcampaign.Every child deserves the chance to experience live theatre: to see their world reflected, and to imagine the world anew.Hannah EssexCo-chief executive,Society of London TheatreDaniel Day-Lewis is quite right. I remember seeing Arnold Wesker’s Roots with Joan Plowright at London’s Royal Court theatre in the early 1960s. As a newly arrived working-class emigrant from Scotland, I couldn’t understand why the audience was laughing in what, to me, were all the wrong places. Then I realised – they were all middle class, and while the play was about working-class life, Roots seemed to have been written just for them.

Diego Simeone’s team had defended robustly. They had just hit the crossbar through Julián Alvarez. But then they were not, and it was the speed and brutality with which Arsenal moved the game away from them that took the breath.There were more set-piece goals, inevitably – for the breakthrough and No 4. It was Declan Rice to Gabriel Magalhães and then a repeat of the link‑up, the only difference being that Gabriel headed square for Viktor Gyökeres to bundle over the line rather than scoring himself. It feels as though nobody can contain Gabriel when he begins his runs and Rice delivers.Arsenal v Atlético Madrid: Champions League – liveRead moreIt was Gyökeres’s second of the evening, his first for 3-0 coming after he dug a breaking ball out of his feet to jam home with the help of a deflection off David Hancko. Gyökeres’s work-rate was tireless. This was his reward.Gabriel Martinelli scored the second after a driving run from Myles Lewis-Skelly, Simeone kicking an imaginary ball in frustration as his players failed to check the progress of theArsenalprovider. Martinelli’s first-time side‑footed finish into the bottom corner was the moment of the night.Atlético saw stars, four concessions in 13 minutes and it added up to a message from Arsenal to the rest of Europe. This was a step up for them in terms of the calibre of opponent after their opening games against Athletic Bilbao and Olympiakos. They stepped up, too. Another win, another clean sheet.Arsenal have conceded just three goals in 12 matches in all competitions this season and there is a bulldozing quality to their game, a remorselessness. Increasingly, there is an inevitability. They did not care that it did not work for them in the first half or the early part of the second period. They kept on doing what they do. The belief is total.Atlético had carried decent form to London, four wins and a draw in five matches, a run that included the 5-2 victory against Real Madrid. After they were breached, they sank without trace, looseness and errors costing them dearly.If Gabriel was the standout performer – he had a couple of important defensive interventions, too – then Gyökeres was surely the grabbiest individual story. There had been an unforgiving spotlight beforehand on his barren run – nine blanks for Arsenal and Sweden; his longest drought since 2021-22. He had just three goals for the club that he joined over the summer from Sporting.View image in fullscreenGabriel Magalhães heads Arsenal into the lead in the 57th minute.Photograph: John Walton/PAGyökeres might not be the smoothest-looking No 9; he is more of a raging bull. And the aesthetics have been a part of the debate. He will care not one jot that his goals here were scruffy, both from close-range, the second bludgeoned in with a thigh. There was a release about the celebrations, and he was given a tremendous ovation from the crowd when he was substituted towards the end.Arsenal brought the intensity, especially in the counter-press. Whenever they lost possession, there was a fury in their veins to regain it. For Atlético, it was the acid test of their composure on the ball and, until they subsided, it was possible to feel they had the technicians to cope. Pablo Barrios was easy on the eye in central midfield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Eberechi Eze made a move and shot from the edge of the area, the ball looped up off Hancko before dropping back down on to the crossbar. Rice could not convert the rebound.Atlético’s big opening of the first period was in the 25th minute when Simeone’s son, Giuliano, caught David Raya in possession after the Arsenal goalkeeper had wandered all the way over to the side of the pitch. After a quick throw-in from Simeone Jr, Alvarez measured a shot for the far corner of the empty net from an unfavourable angle with Raya chasing back. He was narrowly off target.Alvarez shimmered with menace. He had almost got away in the 29th minute after charging down a clearance and running from halfway only for Gabriel – with help from William Saliba – to snuff him out. It was an example of Arsenal’s hunger to keep the back door bolted. Early in the second half, Alvarez thought he had scored after a dart along the left‑hand edge of the area and a wonderful curled effort that beat Raya only to rattle the crossbar.Arsenal’s response was extraordinary. Gyökeres was denied by Jan Oblak but it was not long before the home crowd were saluting the Rice-Gabriel set-piece combination for the opener. Again. Atlético tried to respond. Simeone Jr went close, denied by a Gabriel block after Alvarez’s pass inside Lewis-Skelly. Arsenal had further gears to find.

Yet in lauding the terrifying pace of Howe’s wingers, not to mention his team’s aggression and organisation, Benfica’s manager was perhaps not being disingenuous after all. By the end his insistence that Newcastle’s modest Premier League position is false certainly rang true.At the final whistle no one doubted Mourinho’s sincerity as he strode up to Anthony Gordon and informed the England left-winger that he had been “absolutely brilliant”.Newcastle v Benfica, Villarreal v Manchester City and more: Champions League – liveRead moreAlthough it took a while for the home side to subdue more than decent opponents – and Benfica’s Belgium right-winger Dodi Lukébakio in particular – a fine goal from Gordon and two more from Harvey Barnes, on as a substitute, left the Portuguese visitors without a point in theChampions League.Mourinho has barely been in charge in Lisbon for a month but, after this, Benfica’s hopes of reaching the knockout out stages appear almost in tatters. His problem was that, after a compelling, delicately poised opening hour featuring some important saves from Newcastle’s impressive goalkeeper, Nick Pope, Howe’s substitutes altered the power balance. The Portuguese’s attempts to overturn a 1-0 deficit backfired.“I’m really pleased,” Howe said. “Benfica are a very good team so we had to show our quality. It wasn’t an easy game for sure. We were patient and kept at it. After our second goal you saw the real us and the threat we can be. We haven’t quite clicked into gear this season but hopefully this is the start of getting where we want to be.”Mourinho stressed that his team had played their part in an engrossing evening. “I think St James’ Park is beautiful but it was quiet tonight,” he said. “The crowd felt the game wasn’t easy and that Benfica were more likely to score. Newcastle are a team of giants but we felt very comfortable in the first half. Then the second goal killed the game and it was easy for them.”The two managers had exchanged a slightly perfunctory, rather cool, embrace before kick-off and it quickly became clear that Mourinho had instructed his side to subdue St James’ Park by slowing Newcastle down, disrupting their passing rhythm and generally lowering the temperature at every opportunity.View image in fullscreenNick Pope is beaten by a shot from Benfica’s Dodi Lukébakio hits a post.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersDespite even Gordon’s best efforts, a Newcastle side lacking the benched Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield struggled initially to create much more than half chances.Lukébakio very nearly showed his hosts how to finish when, having deposited Dan Burn on his backside, he tested Pope with a tremendous shot that was met with an equally terrific one-handed save. No wonder Howe’s goalkeeper retains hope of an England recall in time for next summer’s World Cup.Yet when Lukébakio struck another shot against a post, Newcastle began really raising their game and Anatoliy Trubin made an impressive close‑range save from Bruno Guimarães before Gordon broke the deadlock. The England winger’s scorching pace had caused Mourinho’s technical area consternation all night and now he side‑footed that opener beyond Trubin after Jacob Murphy’s ability to deliver an early ball into the box had once again paid dividends.When, for once, Newcastle’s high press was not read by Benfica, Murphy, passed low across the face of goal for Gordon to polish of and become the first Newcastle player to score in three straight Champions League games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Gordon, morale evidently buoyed by scoring his fourth goal in three Champions League appearances this season, played with the zeal of a winger determined to eclipse all rivals, Lukébakio emphasised that, while Burn is a fine central defender, he is not a natural left-back.Howe’s solution was to introduce Barnes and Joelinton as Mourinho threw on an extra striker in Franjo Ivanovic. It proved to be Benfica’s undoing.Until then the visitors, and their defender Antonio Silva especially, had done a decent job in restricting Nick Woltemade’s room for manoeuvre and forcing Newcastle’s Germany centre-forward deep. Now, though, the right-back Amar Dedic was off, the defence underpowered and the path clear for Barnes to prove that Gordon is not Howe’s only goalscoring winger.His introduction was already paying off by the time Pope dispatched a mighty, near 70-yard throw in Barnes’s direction. When Silva misread the bounce, Barnes was away accelerating into the area before maintaining commendable poise to lash a sublime shot beyond Trubin.Once Barnes rolled a shot through poor Trubin’s legs after meeting Gordon’s stellar pass, it was all over. The warning from Mourinho, by now slumped back in his seat, about Newcastle’s “very fast, very dangerous wingers” had not been empty.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedBenficaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was only one, which is not many for a man on 24 in his past 14 matches for club and country, but his early strike opened the way towards a win sufficiently dominant to suggest that a team is emerging once again. Pep Guardiola said: “We have the feeling that again we can control the games … that in many things you are coming back to what you were in the past.”If Haaland is inevitable, he is not alone. Bernardo Silva added the second towards the end of a first half of notable superiority, before there were brief moments in whichManchester Cityallowed their hosts the illusion of making a game of this when it was gone.Gyökeres double adds gloss to Arsenal’s Champions League rout of AtléticoRead moreWhen Haaland was withdrawn with five minutes left, there were whistles and relief; he had just fired two more shots at them, each saved by Luiz Júnior, but now at least he could do no more damage. He had already done enough.City had, almost from the start, Haaland, Savinho and Jérémy Doku combining to force Luiz Júnior into making his first save after just 26 seconds and the Norwegian heading just wide 143 seconds later.The Villarreal head coach, Marcelino García Toral, said: “That filled us with doubts about everything. We were like a boxer waiting to be hit. City are very good, and they have a plan. And this City is not the team from last season.”It wasn’t easy to define Guardiola’s formation; at times it was something like 3-2-4-1, with the exceptional John Stones stepping forward. City had 65% of possession and the surprise was that it was that low.Marcelino’s team certainly had difficulty deciphering that plan. Theirs was clearer and characteristic. This is a fast, athletic and tall side – 10 of the starting XI over 6ft – liable to sit deep and seek to run. That at least is the theory, but even in athleticism City looked stronger and Villarreal’s confidence was hit early, any threat seen fleetingly in the opening 45 minutes, Rúben Dias closing down Georges Mikautadze and Pape Gueye firing wide.View image in fullscreenSanti Comesaña (right) reacts with disappointment after Villarreal are denied by Manchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesBesides, if Villarreal waited, City were willing to wait too, the goal that started it all on 17 minutes a portrait of patience, then sudden incisiveness. The ball was worked to the right where Savinho, faced by a yellow wall, stopped, looked, and turned away again. He played the ball back to Stones, who played the ball back to Savinho, who played the ball back to Stones, who … well, you get the picture. Six times they exchanged short passes, none of it done at top speed but all of it at the right speed, their opponents watched, tested, and slowly drawn out.When Savinho played to Stones the last time, the Englishman went one step deeper towards Josko Gvardiol, whose pass broke a line as it was hit faster to Savinho. Suddenly, everything accelerated and, while the ball travelled, so did Rico Lewis up the inside track between two defenders. “I adore that player, he’s so intelligent,” Guardiola said.Savinho slotted that familiar little angled ball into the area and into the run, Lewis arriving ahead of everyone and turning it across the six-yard box. Thundering in to score was, of course, Haaland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, there was patience from City and passivity from Villarreal; again, it came from the right, another player slipping into the box undetected. There were nine Villarreal players in there, but when Savinho clipped in a cross Silva, who Guardiola said has “a head like a hammer”, was still alone to finish.Champions League roundup: Barcelona and PSG romp to victoriesRead moreWhen Nicolas Pépé rolled his eyes to the sky on the hour having seen City pass around him again, it had seemed to say it all, but Marcelino said he had been proud of his team’s response. In the second half he said, “we were alive”.Alberto Moleiro’s shot was blocked and Juan Foyth struck wide. Next Pépé thudded a shot against Gianluigi Donnarumma’s gloves before Gueye headed just wide. Pépé then volleyed over at the far post when Dias could only half clear a deep cross from Moleiro.The reaction, though, was brief and a little late. There wasn’t time for much more: a Tani Oluwaseyi header off a post in the last minute and, before that, a couple more demonstrations of Haaland’s qualities. First, when he superbly brought down Mateo Kovacic’s diagonal and thumped a shot. Then when he carried it to the edge of the area and guided an effort towards the fair post. This time, there was no goal, Luiz Júnior saving twice; one would have to do.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueVillarrealManchester CityEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

If you believe that, you will believe anything.Both teams havequalified for the semi-finals, so it could be argued that little will be at stake in Indore. That would be wrong. First, given the run of results in this World Cup, these sides are almost certain to finish first and second and therefore avoid a semi-final against each other – which means this game could well be a precursor to the final in Navi Mumbai on 2 November. Cricket is a game played partly in the mind: no one wants to be thumped by their opponents two weeks before they meet them in a global tournament final.Equally important, this will be the first time the teams have met sinceAustralia humiliated England16-0 on Ashes points last winter. Since then, England have fired Heather Knight as the captain, catapulted Charlotte Edwards into the role of head coach, and tried desperately to shake off their reputation as a side that drop their catches and wilt under pressure. Arguably, their rabbit-out-of-a-hatvictory against India on Sundaywent some way to achieving that. A win against Australia would be the icing on the cake. “We know they pose a huge challenge, but we’re really excited for it,” Jones said.Sri Lanka keep slim World Cup hopes alive with four wickets in Bangladesh’s final overRead moreThe big news on the eve of the match was that Australia’s captain, Alyssa Healy, was ruled out with a calf injury, sustained during a training session on Saturday. Tahlia McGrath will lead the side in her absence. It is certainly a blow: Healy has just hit back-to-back hundreds, against India and Bangladesh, the first of which enabled Australia to make a record run-chase of 331 look like a cakewalk. On the other hand, she also missed the entire T20 leg of the Ashes, which Australia (if we needed reminding) won 3-0.Australia have not been infallible in this tournament – they teetered perilously against New Zealand and Pakistan – but those wobbles simply gave them the chance to showcase their enviable batting depth, with centuries from Ash Gardner and Beth Mooney, respectively, saving the day. Phoebe Litchfield hit 84 not outagainst Bangladesh– more runs in a single innings than Sophia Dunkley and Alice Capsey have managed between them in the entire tournament. The most likely candidate to replace Healy is the 22-year-old opening batter Georgia Voll, who has spent the tournament to date sat on the bench twirling a rugby ball, but who would probably have already walked into any other nation’s starting XI.View image in fullscreenAmy Jones says England have not discussed their Ashes whitewash despite being due to face Australia on Wednesday.Photograph: Matt Roberts-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesEngland, by contrast, are likely to play an unchanged XI after their dramatic four-run win against India. Jones, who scored a face-saving half-century after a run of low scores, said her team’s morale had been boosted after silencing the sellout Indore crowd. “It definitely gives me confidence,” she said on Tuesday. “I probably felt a few extra nerves in that game. Atmosphere-wise, it was totally different to any game we’ve played so far in the World Cup. It was really cool to walk out there and open the batting in front of that big crowd.”England will again be relying on their world-class spinning trio of Sophie Ecclestone, Linsey Smith and Charlie Dean to make up for their middle-order fragility. The Indore pitch is likely to be a haven for batters, but Jones said she felt England’s spinners would still do well. “They’re very threatening, whether it’s turning or not, given the deception that they have and their changes of pace,” Jones said. “I’m sure they’ll play a big role.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The latest round of fixtures were disrupted by protests this past weekend. Players refused to move for the first 15 seconds of games, with the Spanish footballers’ association saying the decision to “symbolically protest” had been taken because of the league’s “lack of transparency, dialogue and coherence” over the Miami match.Real Madrid have filed two complaints over the move to the Spanish sports ministry, with their manager, Xabi Alonso, saying his side were against it because it “distorts the competition”. Alonso’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said: “La Liga does whatever it wants because it suits them.”The protests followed Uefa’s decision this month to“reluctantly” allow the match, along with a Serie A fixture between Milan and Como in Perth, Australia, to go ahead. The European governing body, which also has a working relationship with Relevent, said at the time that it “reiterated its clear opposition to domestic league matches being played outside their home country”, adding: “However … the Uefa executive committee has reluctantly taken the decision to approve, on an exceptional basis, the two requests referred to it.”In a separate statement, first published in the Athletic, Relevent said it had informed La Liga of the need “to postpone” the match, arguing that the uncertainty in Spain had left “insufficient time to properly execute an event of this scale”.Following Villarreal’s Champions Leaguedefeat by Manchester Cityon Tuesday night, during which the news was released, the club’s manager Marcelino blasted the timing of the announcement.After the club press officer had asked for questions on the match only, Marcelino was asked anyway. “OK, I am going to answer only one question and I am going to be clear,” he said. “I think it is an absolute lack of respect for them to release a statement at half-time about something that they knew would not be done. It is a lack of respect to the directors, the club, the professionals and the fans … the club will release an official statement tomorrow saying what they think. What I think is this.”Marcelino was asked again a few questions later. “I was clear, wasn’t I?” he said. “One question, one answer. I repeat myself: I found out at the end of the game, and the rest of what I said is my opinion.”Explore more on these topicsLa LigaVillarrealBarcelonaEuropean club footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Nottingham Forest job has been of interest to him for a long time, and not only because he lives close by. The circumstances in which the role has become available are not ideal for anincoming head coachbut his appointment is the pragmatic choice in ludicrous circumstances.Ange Postecoglou was never the right man, inheriting a squad that did not suit his style and did not adapt quickly enough, though it did not help that he told the players their previous achievements meant nothing. His tenure will go down in history forall the wrong reasons. Dyche, on the other hand, has plenty of respect for what Forest achieved under Nuno Espírito Santo and is far more aligned with that conservatism than with what was witnessed under Postecoglou.Ange Postecoglou’s reputation has taken a hit that only time and the right move can restoreRead moreForest needed someone who will not require time to assess what they are working with, and Dyche knows this squad well, having watched on from near and far. He had been thought about at the club for a while because of his record in the Premier League with Burnley and Everton. Forest were impressed by his work at Everton, where in 2024 he would have finished level with Brighton and Bournemouth, two lauded clubs, but for a points deduction. It showed he was getting the best from the squad and not being distracted by off‑field matters.Unlike when Postecoglou was brought in, full due diligence was done on Dyche before it was decided he was the best fit for the squad from the available managers. About £200m was spent on 13 summer signings to try to ensure Forest had the capabilities to compete in the Premier League and Europe. The recruitment made this the best Forest squad of the 21st century, one the club think should finish in the top 10 again, but theysit in the relegation zone with five points from eight games.Dyche has never known such riches. Burnley’s squad never experienced much turnover and rarely involved high expenditure; at Everton finances were tight. At Forest he will have a team capable of competing at the highest level.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest were impressed by Sean Dyche’s work at Everton.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAt Burnley and Everton his successes were based on a strong defensive unit, marshalled by two centre-backs. Ben Mee and James Tarkowski were the foundation at Turf Moor, and the team conceded relatively few goals for one regularly in a relegation battle. Dyche also achieved a seventh-placed finish with Burnley through meticulous planning and by creating a strong work ethic. Bringing the squad together will be imperative because some of the players found Postecoglou grating, but Dyche has worked on unity before.Forest’s Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo were, under Nuno, one of the best centre-back pairings in England and, with Dyche’s attention to detail at the back, they potentially can be again. The club wanted someone who can fix the defence and even those who question Dyche’s style could not dispute his credentials as a defensive coach. In 2023-24 his Everton team conceded 51 goals – only the top three let in fewer. Postecoglou could not organise Forest for set pieces and the team became quickly porous. Dyche will not stand for that.The appointment will also bring counterattacking back to Forest, something that was instilled by Nuno and is why the club have invested heavily in wingers in recent years. Dan Ndoye, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Omari Hutchinson and Dilane Bakwa form an impressive group if Dyche can harness their attributes. It was a priority for Forest to get a manager who will work well with a squad that shines in transitions and has the speed and athleticism to scare opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is confidence at Forest that if the defence can be rebuilt the forwards will look after themselves, considering Dyche can also call upon Chris Wood, who he worked with at Burnley, and has Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi as options, depending on how he wants to play. Dyche showed when bringing Iliman Ndiaye to Everton that he is open to working with more creative players.The Forest legends Ian Woan and Steve Stone being part of the Dyche package will be popular with most fans. Dyche was a youth player at Forest during the Brian Clough era and bringing a little bit of that period back will add a nostalgic tint.Marco Silva was the manager the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, wanted but it was too difficult to prise him away from Fulham mid-season for various reasons. Roberto Mancini was also under consideration but his personality has brought tension to previous jobs and considering the egos at the City Ground his arrival might have resulted in another combustion. Dyche likes to stay out of club politics, focusing on the running of the team, although whether it is possible to do so at Forest remains to be seen.Unity is craved by the club and gave them great strength under Nuno. Dyche is there to bring calm and camaraderie and to shut out the noise, which is often of their own making. Things are rarely quiet at the City Ground but gruff notes of contentment, rather than the smashing of TV screens and chants for a sacking, are all that is wanted.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestSean DycheanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now in New Zealand for his 35th international T20 series or tournament, he summarises that hectic, monotonous life when talking about the team-bonding mini‑break in Queenstown with which England started their winter: “Sometimes you don’t get that opportunity when you’re always on tour,” he says. “You land, you train, you play and you travel.”Yet his enthusiasm is clear, not just when he discusses the immediate future of a side that seems to be flourishing under Harry Brook and his own place in it, but also when watching Rashid train, play or bowl. But while he was able to stop New Zealand in their tracks asthey attempted to chase down England’s record‑breaking 236at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Monday night, when his four‑wicket haul included all but one of their five highest scorers, there is nothing he can do to halt time.Australia’s Scott Boland shuts out noise from former England players before AshesRead moreRashid will turn 38 in February, midway through the T20 World Cup. By the time the next one‑day international version is played towards the end of 2027 he will be nearly 40. His great friend and now podcast co‑host Moeen Ali, just a few months his senior, retired from international cricket last year. But Rashid remains integral: those four wickets took him to 19 so far this year, six more than any other Englishman. Only three English bowlers have taken so many T20 international wickets in a calendar year: Graeme Swann in 2010, Sam Curran in 2022, and Rashid in 2021, 2022, 2024 and now 2025. But there are still no thoughts of the end; his focus remains on bringing down opponents, not curtains.“One hundred per cent I’ve still got the hunger, the hunger to play for England and represent my country,” Rashid says. “As an individual, I think that’s the biggest achievement in any sport. I still have that passion there for England. I think that when the passion does die down, or whatever it is, that’s when you think: ‘OK, right, let’s have a real think about it.’ At the moment I haven’t really thought of anything else. I’ve got that passion, there’s a lot of cricket to be played.“I want to be part of this team, this squad we’ve got now, on the next journey we have, which hopefully will be nice and I want to be part of it. Hopefully we can experience some wins and win World Cups, all the good stuff. And I’m looking forward to hopefully participating in that journey.“We don’t know what’s going to happen. Around the corner things can change very quickly. It’s very unpredictable, life and cricket. I always like to stay present – a game at a time, a step at a time – and let things unfold, see where cricket and life takes me.”View image in fullscreenRashid (left) with his great friend and former teammate Moeen Ali after winning the T20 World Cup in Melbourne in 2022.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesIn many ways this is no time to be thinking of endings, but rather of beginnings: a fresh team with a new captain, a new coach and new horizons. “We’re on that journey,” Rashid says. “There are a few new faces. Some have gone out, some have come in, and that’s just part of the cycle. But we’ve got experience, we’ve got youth, we’ve got world‑class players, we’ve got Brendon McCullum, who’s a very, very good coach, and everybody’s buying in to what we’re trying to achieve. Yes, there’s going to be hiccups along the way, that’s part and parcel of the game, but we’re definitely focused and really on the ball, for whatever lies ahead.”The desire to schedule that Queenstown trip, and the recruitment of the former All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka, suggests there is a particular focus on creating something more from this group of players than just an XI, and Rashid believes this is a particular strength of McCullum’s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She had met company executives about the case two weeks prior.Asked about the intervention, made while she was a cabinet minister, Powell said she had acted in her capacity as a constituency MP and had done so “openly and transparently”. She denied she had done anything inappropriate, though MPs are under huge scrutiny after a series of lobbying scandals.This case refers to a company called Urban Splash, which was asked to pay back £49m of taxpayers’ money in March 2024 when the Conservatives were in power.The money had been spent on making seven buildings in central Manchester compliant with post-Grenfell building safety laws, according to the housing department.Ministers applied to a property tribunal for a remediation order to legally require the developer to stump up for the works.But in her letter dated 10 December 2024 and seen by the Guardian, Powell asked that “every effort is made to engage with Urban Splash outside of lengthy legal proceedings” and warned that these would “ultimately cost the taxpayer and will likely put Urban Splash out of business”.She attached a letter she had received from Bloxham on 5 December, where he said it had been good to see her at the Rose Network event, which took place the night before.In his letter he accused the housing department of “increasingly vindictively pursuing us with heavy handed lawyers” while seeking to turn Urban Splash into “a scape goat” to distract from its “continued mistakes and incompetence”.He wrote that he was “feeling betrayed by a government I helped get elected and have so much hope for”, and linked to a video celebrating the developer’s 30-year history, which he said he had shown Powell when they spoke.Bloxham gave £8,807 to the Labour party in 2020, according to Electoral Commission records, and previously donated to Tony Lloyd, Powell’s predecessor as MP for Manchester Central.A spokesperson for Powell said: “In her capacity as a constituency MP Lucy has made many, many representations to the government and to relevant agencies over many years about difficult cladding issues on behalf of leaseholders and met with many of those involved including residents, freeholders and developers.“In that capacity in mid-November, Lucy met with Urban Splash for a constituency surgery meeting in Manchester, where they raised the difficulties they were facing. She asked for further details in writing so that she could make a representation on their behalf as their constituency MP which she then did in the usual way transparently and openly. She was clear in all correspondence that developers should pay their fair share of remediation costs.”A source close to Powell said she held a meeting with Bloxham in her constituency on 15 November 2024, where she discussed his case, watched the video he referenced and asked him to put his arguments in writing. The source said they then bumped into each other at the party fundraising event on 4 December, which involved more than 500 people, and that he had written to her the following day.Powell’s office said she never received or facilitated any donations in cash or in kind from Bloxham or Urban Splash, except in one instance before 2020, when Bloxham sponsored prizes in her annual schoolchildren’s Christmas card competition to the value of up to £300.Powell’s constituency office is housed in Beehive Mill, a building regenerated and owned by Urban Splash. Her office said she paid market rent for the premises, which were found by the MPs’ expenses regulator.Powell met Bloxham and another Urban Splash executive in her constituency office on 4 April and wrote to Rayner again on 22 April and 6 August urging ministers to hold a meeting with the company, which she warned could go insolvent as a result of the action. She stated in all cases that she was writing in her capacity as a constituency MP.In his letter to Powell in December, Bloxham wrote that Michael Gove’s “historic, huge mishandling of the post-Grenfell response” alongside “the ministry’s and its advisers’ continued mistakes and incompetence” were “threatening Urban Splash’s very existence and the new government’s growth agenda”.He wrote that the “continued pursuit of the RCO [remediation order] is not fair, just or equitable for a number of reasons.”.He argued that ministers should “sit down and have an open conversation about the merits of the case and agree a deal which US [Urban Splash] can afford” rather than “spend years in pointless litigation blowing £millions of tax payers money on legal fees”.He said that Urban Splash faced a bill of up to £48m when the company was worth only £27m. He said the department had incorrectly estimated its value at £75m and that “rather than trying to mediate or negotiate” it had sought to include other companies with the same directors as Urban Splash in its legal action.A spokesperson for Urban Splash said the legal action was “an ongoing process so we cannot comment”.There is no indication that the government took any action in Urban Splash’s favour after receiving Powell’s letters.A spokesperson for the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government said: “We are taking ongoing legal action against Urban Splash to make them pay for fixing homes they are responsible for. We make no apology for taking strong action to make people’s homes safe, and are absolutely determined to hold developers to account.”Explore more on these topicsLucy PowellLabour party deputy leadershipLabourParty fundingManchesterReal estateHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, she was portrayed as a “cold-blooded killer” but evidence has since emerged that Blakely, a racing-car driver, physically and emotionally abused her.The impact on her emotional state was not considered during the trial that resulted in her hanging. The judge told the jury to disregard the fact that she had been “badly treated by her lover” as a defence.At the time of her death, she was a 28-year-old single mother of two, both of whom were left traumatised.Her grandchildren are presenting the justice secretary,David Lammy, with an application for a conditional pardon, on the grounds that a modern understanding of the impact of abusive and controlling behaviour would probably have resulted in a manslaughter conviction at most, which would not have carried a death sentence. She would also have benefited from concepts such as diminished responsibility and loss of control, which became enshrined in law in 1957.Women who conceived in abusive relationships lose legal challenge over benefits ‘rape clause’Read moreLaura Enston, Ellis’s granddaughter, said: “Ruth’s execution has had a devastating impact on our family. My mother and uncle suffered from trauma from which neither of them were able to recover, and as grandchildren we have felt these ripple effects.“The evidence shared with the justice secretary makes clear that the punishment did not fit the crime. We are determined to do what we can to right this historic injustice and honour not only Ruth but all victims of domestic abuse who have been let down by the criminal justice system.”Enston said that her family – and particularly Ruth’s children – had been dogged by mental health problems. She recalled her mother as “a very tormented woman” who lived a chaotic life, while her uncle, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, died by suicide.She said she had a complicated relationship with her grandmother’s legacy. “For many years, I never wanted any association with this story, due to the narrative around Ruth. She was really positioned as this cold-blooded killer. My mum leaned in on the story, she was almost hardwired into believing the tragedy of it all. As kids, we were bullied at school, I felt I had a target on my head.”It took watchingthe ITV drama A Cruel Love: the Ruth Ellis Story, which aired in March, to change Enston’s perspective. “[Ellis] was a modern-day woman, living in postwar Britain, going against the convention of how women should behave … She was on trial for more than just murder, she was on trial for what she represented, which was change.”View image in fullscreenLucy Boynton played Ruth Ellis and Laurie Davidson played David Blakely in the recent ITV dramatisation of her story.Photograph: Des Willie/ITVAccording to accounts from Ellis, her friends, doctors and witnesses, she was assaulted in public; pushed down the stairs; struck so hard in the ear she was briefly rendered deaf; punched in the stomach, resulting in a miscarriage; left bruised and threatened with murder.Although an appeal filed in 2003 was quashed because it was required to take into account the law at the time of the offence, the justice secretary is able to take into account legal developments since the conviction and sentence were imposed when considering granting a pardon.Grace Houghton, a solicitor at Mishcon de Reya, said it was the “perfect moment” to apply for a pardon owing to the growing body of cases coming through the courts that have raised key issues around domestic abuse and its psychological impact on survivors.Ellis’s story had echoes ofhigh-profile cases such as Virginia Giuffre’sin the way “some men, some abusers, act with impunity and do so because they think they hold all the power, and they’ve been able to manipulate because they think they’ll always get away with it and the woman would not be believed”, Houghton said. Similarly, trial documents showed “the trauma she had to go through on trial – we still see it now that women are not treated with compassion and empathy”, she added.“We’ve come a long way in terms of the justice system acknowledging those effects on women – but we haven’t gone quite far enough,” Houghton said, adding that she hoped the case would be a “stepping stone to get to where we need to be”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The justice secretary considers all applications for royal pardons, in line with the longstanding conventions which govern use of the prerogative.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

It has created a toxic environment for survivors, filled with pressures that we should not have to deal with.”All three survivors have accused officials of trying to water down the inquiry by widening the scope beyond grooming gangs into broader issues of child sexual abuse and exploitation.Reynolds said the “final turning point” in her decision to quit was a move to widen the inquiry “in ways that downplay the racial and religious motivations behind our abuse”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The whales have showna trend of slow population growthover the past four years and have gained more than 7% of their 2020 population, the consortium said.It’s a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships andentanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.Jem Cresswell’s striking whale images – in picturesRead moreThe whale’s trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. The center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) collaborate to calculate the population estimate.New management measures in Canada that attempt to keep the whales safe amid their increased presence in the Gulf of St Lawrence have been especially important, Hamilton said.“We know that a modest increase every year, if we can sustain it, will lead to population growth,” Hamilton said. “It’s just whether or not we can sustain it.”Scientists have cautioned in recent years that the whale’s slow recovery is happening at a time when the giant animals still face threats, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said.The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whales because they are not producing enough offspring to sustain their population.However, this year four mother whales had calves for the first time, Hamilton said. And some other established mother whales had shorter intervals between calves, he said.In total, 11 calves were born, which is less than researchers had hoped for, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging, Hamilton said.And any number of calves is helpful in a year of no mortalities, said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at Cabot Center and chairs the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium.“The slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,” Pettis said. ”What we’ve seen before is this population can turn on a dime.”The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food.Environmental groups warned on Tuesday that the whales were stillon the brink of extinctionand need more aggressive protection to fully recover.“Continued attacks on the Marine Mammal Protection Act and efforts to weaken Noaa’s science-based safeguards put this fragile population at even greater risk. We need Congress to uphold, not undermine, the laws, programs and experts that give North Atlantic right whales a fighting chance for continued survival,” said Gib Brogan, senior campaign director with Oceana.Explore more on these topicsWhalesCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifeConservationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Similar to dugongs and manatees, the sea cow was only discovered in 1741 by the shipwrecked German-born naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller but by 1768 it had already become thefirst marine species to be eradicated by humans.View image in fullscreenBeasts of the Sea is Iida Turpeinen’s debut novel.Photograph: MacLehose PressTranslated into 28 languages and shortlisted for the country’s most prestigious literary award, the Finlandia Prize, Beasts of the Sea was described by the Helsinki Literacy Agency as themost internationally successful Finnish debut novel ever. Turpeinen, 38, a PhD student of comparative literature, is now a resident novelist at Finland’s Natural History Museum. Her book will be published in the UK on 23 October.What inspired you to write the book?I visited the Natural History Museum in Helsinki in 2016 and saw this very strange-looking skeleton of a big, bulky animal I didn’t recognise.The placard said:“This is Steller’s sea cow, which went extinct 27 years after its discovery by science. There are only three to four skeletons that remain of this animal.”And I was like: “OK, what happened here? There must be quite an interesting story behind these sentences.”I discovered the sea cow was the first animal that brought up the scientific question: could humans have caused the extinction of this animal through hunting? At the time that the sea cow went extinct, in the 18th century, this question was laughed at.View image in fullscreenIida Turpeinen by the skeleton of a Steller’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) that inspired her on a visit to the Natural History Museum in Helsinki.Photograph: Susanna KekkonenPeople thought it was impossible – a ludicrous idea. Even a hundred years later, in the 1860s, the question was still controversial and fiercely debated. But of course, we now know that is what happened.I had, for a long time, dreamed about writing a novel about the sixth mass extinction. And I realised this was the story I was looking for: this was the animal that would allow me to write about – and understand – why we are in the situation we are in today.There is something mysterious and yet relatable about this animal, something almost human-likeIt was only recently – on the brink of the 20th century – that we gradually began to realise that we can be as much of a catastrophe to other species as a biblical flood, with all the responsibility this realisation brings about. For me, this explained a lot.By writing the book, you’ve ignited a lot of interest in the sea cow. What do you think it is about the sea cow that captivates people’s imaginations, including your own?Imagine a huge manatee, the size of a whale, living in very cold waters among the remote islands of the Bering Sea. They had flippers with nails, like an elephant, and they moved about on the sea floor and grazed very close to the surface, in the kelp forest.According to the few accounts we have, they loved to caress and touch each other, and hold their little ones. They were the perfect victim: big, gentle, lovable creatures that were very sociable and tactile. The dugong is a close relative.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s impression of a herd of sea cows. The illustration by F John, from Wilhelm Bölsche’s 1908Tiere der Urwelt(Animals of the Prehistoric World), was drawn 150 years after its extinction.Photograph: Florilegius/AlamyI wanted this book to be an act of remembering and noticing extinction, and when I started writing it, I started dreaming about sea cows very often.Now, I get a lot of feedback from readers saying they dream about sea cows as well.There is something mysterious and yet relatable about this animal, something almost human-like, and I think it’s not a coincidence that the species has invited so many mythical interpretations. Wherever in the world there are manatees or sea cows, there have always been legends about mermaids.Stories follow them – and I, too, felt that pull.Why did sea cowsbecome extinct?Sea cows were mercilessly hunted after Steller wrote about his encounter with them, and when fur traders shot all the otters on islands nearby, the sea urchins multiplied and ate all the kelp. So while the sea cows were being hunted, they were also starving.What touches me most is how peaceful and gentle they were. They could easily have capsized a boat, due to their size. Yet not once, to my knowledge, did a sea cow attack the people who were hunting it.What impact did the book, which won the Helsingin Sanomatprize for best debut,have inFinland?In researching the history of the sea cow, I never really encountered villains. More often, people acted in ways that proved harmful despite their good intentions.View image in fullscreenSkull of a Steller’s sea cow in London’s Natural History Museum.Photograph: Azoor Photo/AlamyStrangely enough, this dynamic became a side-effect of publishing the novel. After its release, people began flocking to the Natural History Museum in Helsinki to see the “main character” of the book for themselves.Visitors were so eager to get close to the skeleton that some even touched it, despite its fragility.Until then, the specimen had been on open display, but the museum eventually had to install glass walls around it to protect it from overly enthusiastic admirers.I still don’t know whether it is tragic or comic that my book ended up endangering the remains of the sea cow.What do you hope readers will learn from the story of the sea cow?To question our way of thinking about our relationship with nature, to see where we have been and where we are, and to reflect on that.It is very easy to judge historical characters and an historic event from today’s perspective, but when you look at what people like Steller knew, how they saw the world, it becomes very easy to understand their actions.View image in fullscreenAn illustration from a 1936 biography of Steller by the Norwegian-born naturalist Leonhard Stejneger.

There’s a lot of does, big bucks and even fawns. You smell the dead everywhere,” he says. “And I haven’t really went deep into the woods.”The longtime deer hunter owns several hundred acres and runs a small Airbnb business in Athens county,Ohio, where he has lived with his wife for almost two decades. This time of year, hunters from North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere usually descend on his accommodation and property to hunt. This year, with so many dead deer in the area, his business has been almost wiped out.Florida wildlife officials discover second case of ‘zombie deer disease’ in stateRead more“Half of October and all of November [bookings] has been canceled,” he says.It has put him in a financial hole of about $15,000.Eastern Ohio is a premier whitetail deer hunting spot in a state that ranks among the top destinations in the country. Hunters from around the world flock to Athens and neighboring counties every fall.But the industry and people who depend on it are facing new threats.Chronic wasting disease(CWD) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are killing wild deer in greater numbers in dozens of rural counties across the midwest that depend on the industry. The number of sick and dead deer reported by the public to Ohio’s department of natural resources grewfrom 2,093 in 2024 to 8,759 this year. That animals are being found dead in or near creeks and rivers may also present a health risk to communities dependent on local waterways for drinking and other uses.CWD is spread from animal to animal through body fluids such as saliva, urine and blood. With drought becoming more prevalent in the region in recent years, larger numbers of deer find themselves gathering at fewer watering spots to drink, fueling the spread of the disease in the early fall.In the case of EHD, warmer spring and fall temperatures allow for the spread of its carrier, culicoides variipennis, a biting midge that is typically killed off by freezing temperatures. The midge is attracted to mud and water sources, where it lays its eggs.“While it’s been around for a long time, the frequency and intensity of EDH is increasing, and studies are showing that’s happening especially in the upper midwest,” says Sonja Christensen, associate professor at the department of fisheries and wildlife at Michigan State University.“It comes and goes, which makes it a challenge to chase it down. We can’t predict it very well. We do know that in the upper midwest we are seeing more of these large-scale mortality events happening.”According tothe Ohio department of natural resources, midwestern deer populations infected with EHD are likely to die within three days after the onset of symptoms. CWD, which has a multi-year incubation period, has been detected in cervid species, mostly in deer, in 36 US states and four Canadian provinces, having been first detected in the contiguous US in wild deer in 1981.Experts say that warmer temperatures fueled by human-caused climate change can contribute to conditions that favor both diseases.“This year, the conditions were just right. We had a really wet beginning of spring, a really dry summer. The numbers of those midge carriers were up, which is why we’re seeing such a big increase in deer with EHD,” says Lindsey Krusling of the Ohio division of wildlife.In Ohio, baiting and feeding deer has been banned in disease control areas in the north-west part of the state. Hunters across the midwest are being advised to have venison tested for the presence of the diseases and to not eat from animals that appear sick.Deer hunting nationally is worth about $23bn, with much of that, hunting advocates say, going back into the conservation of forests, woods and wilderness areas that otherwise could be logged for timber, farmed or exploited for mineral and other resources.Hunters spend thousands of dollars on trips that outfitters use on food, accommodation, property taxes and the year-round maintenance of deer habitats. Ohio’s deer hunting industry is worth about $1.9bn a year, and in neighboring Pennsylvania, where nearly half a million deer are harvested annually, it’s worth about $2bn. In Michigan, where counties are recording first-time casesof CWD in wild deer as recently as last month, deer hunting contributes about $2.3bn to the state’s economy.Aside from fueling rural midwestern economies, hunting whitetail deer also plays an important role in reducing damage to agricultural crops and lowering road accidents.Neither CWD nor EHD are thought to be transmittable to humans.“The threats and impacts of chronic wasting disease and [epizootic] hemorrhagic disease are very different,” says Kip Adams, chief conservation officer at the National Deer Association.“With hemorrhagic disease, climate has a big impact. It’s all the way up through the north-east; it’s all the way across the midwest, up into Canada. This disease is far more widespread today than it was 10, 20 or certainly 30 years ago.”Still, while coming across dozens of deer carcasses in the woods may come as a shock to some, observers such as Adams believe the broader population of whitetail deer is not currently at significant risk.While EHD can devastate a local population within a short period of time, scientists say that, given good habitat conditions, they can recover within five years. Moreover, some animals that contract EHD have been known to develop an immunity to the disease that can be lifelong.“The threats to local economies is probably going to be very little. Nationally, of all the hunters that go into the field each fall, less than half shoot a single deer. Only about 20% shoot more than one deer,” says Adams.“Overall, there are still plenty of deer; folks can still go hunting.”Still, the challenges of managing the spread of these diseases are not inconsiderable. And funding to study and closely track them can be difficult to come by because they generally don’t directly affect domestic animals or people.For Barkhurst, losing a fall season of hunting is about much more than the loss of income that goes with it.“My buddies and I, we’ve been hunting for three generations; it’s fellowship and hanging out. And now, you don’t go,” he says.“They’re trying to find something else to keep the group together.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsAnimalsWildlifeOhiofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Majek responded: “That’s not me.”Majek told the jury he joined a group of men in the hotel car park later on the night of the attack. The court was shown footage of the car park, where Majek can be seen dancing.His defence barrister, Gurdeep Garcha KC, asked Majek: “When you were on the car park dancing and singing is that because you were euphoric at what you had done to Rhiannon Whyte?”Majek responded: “No. It wasn’t me who injured her. I was playing music like normal and was just dancing like normal.”Majek also denied owning a screwdriver, after prosecutors alleged he had stabbed Whyte 23 times.Earlier in the trial, the jury heard from forensic scientist who said Whyte’s blood had been found on clothes, shoes and a ring worn by Majek.Asked on Tuesday about the evidence, the Sudanese national told the court his jacket did not have blood on it.The jury also learned further details about Majek’s journey to the UK. He said he left Sudan at the age of 16 in April 2022, and claimed asylum in the UK after arriving in July 2024.Majek, who confirmed he was married and had a child, said he travelled from Sudan to Libya, Italy and Germany before arriving in the UK in July 2024. He told the jury a mistake on his identity document in Germany incorrectly classified him as being 27.He denied having any previous criminal convictions, cautions or reprimands.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Other offences were carried out by Stubberfield in a variety of locations around Plymouth.Stubberfield, from Plympton in Devon, was sentenced at Plymouth crown court on Tuesday to 26 years in prison and a further six on extended licence after being found guilty of 23 offences including rape, sexual assault, assault by penetration, making indecent images of a child, and exposure. He will have to sign the sex offender register for life.The offences covered a period between December 2013 and June 2024. Stubberfield ran the salon between 2022 and 2024.During a trial in June, a court heard Stubberfield first came to the attention of police in February 2022 when a 16-year-old girl reported that he had sexually abused her on two occasions that month.On one night he raped her in the disabled toilet during a concert at the Plymouth Pavilions venue and later in the back of his van, the court heard.On the second occasion, the victim was at a house with a friend and Stubberfield. Throughout the night he carried out multiple rapes and other sexual offences against her while telling her to be quiet, the court heard.Some of the offences were captured during a FaceTime call to her friend after Stubberfield brazenly pulled her out of view to sexually assault her and forced her to commit a sexual act upon him.Unknown to Stubberfield his actions were reflected in a nearby cooker hood and seen by the caller who shouted out to stop him, the court heard. She had also recorded the call and provided this to police.In 2024 a woman reported that she had been abused by Stubberfield at Essex Smiles, the court heard. After a third report in 2024, Stubberfield was arrested and charged with multiple offences.A media report prompted other victims to come forward. Some believed they were the only one and Stubberfield’s sexualised behaviour had often been dismissed as being “just Ricky” by those who knew him, the court heard.Between 2022 and 2024 Stubberfield abused five women, all in their 20s, at a salon. Once in the treatment chair with a mouth guard in, he took advantage and sexually assaulted them, asked for photos and made repeated forceful sexual advances.The fifth woman was accompanied by her toddler when she went to buy a product from the salon. Stubberfield asked her out on a date which she declined. He then showed her a picture of his genitals before pulling down his trousers to expose himself.In 2013 he sexually assaulted a woman he met on a dating site, forcing himself upon her before she was able to get away, the court heard.Another victim encountered Stubberfield in 2021 and was raped twice before he asked her if she “fancied a Nando’s”, the court heard.His victims were aged between 16 and 27 at the time of the offences.Sentencing Stubberfield on Tuesday, Judge Linford said: “Your behaviour was utterly remorseless predation.”He described the offending as “part of your personality”, which was “very worrying”, and said Stubberfield posed a very high risk of harm to the public.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

And it’d be amazing if it wasn’t”.The former prime minister added: “It was my impression that the work was being done. Let me put it this way, I certainly assumed that the work was being done.”Johnson also rebutted statements by Jonathan Slater, the DfE’s permanent secretary at the time, that the department’s first request for a detailed closure plan did not arrive until 17 March, the day before the official announcement that schools would close.Lack of school closure plan ‘an extraordinary dereliction of duty’, Covid inquiry toldRead more“Frankly, I would have thought that he, as head of the Department for Education, would have picked up from discussions that would be going on from February onwards,” Johnson said, adding: “I just think that it was obvious that there had to be consideration of closing schools.In testimony as part of the inquiry’s investigation into the impact on children and young people, Johnson made it clear he initially believed school closures would be necessary only at the peak of the pandemic, until scientific advice changed to say closures would help stop Covid’s rapid spread.“It felt to me as though children, who are not vulnerable to Covid, were paying a huge, huge price to protect the rest of society. It was an awful thing. I wish we had found another solution,” Johnson said.In his testimony last week, the former education secretary Gavin Williamson told the inquiry that Johnson’s government had made “many mistakes” regarding school closures. He also said that Johnson often “chose the NHS over children”.View image in fullscreenGavin Williamson appeared before the inquiry last week.Photograph: UK Covid-19 Inquiry/PAOffered an opportunity to criticise Williamson for his performance, Johnson said: “I think that on the whole, given the difficulties that we faced, I think that the department under Gavin did a pretty heroic job in trying to cope with Covid, and that was my judgment.”Asked to explain the chaos surrounding efforts to awardGCSE and A-level exam results in 2020 using an algorithm, which was abruptly scrapped after it became clear that grades were being awarded unfairly, Johnson said: “I’m afraid that it was an accident of the great difficulties we faced in improvising in exceptionally difficult circumstances.”The inquiry also heard thatPriti Patel, the home secretary during the pandemic, raised alarms over the DfE’s failures to consider the impact of school closures on children vulnerable to drugs, violence and sexual exploitation.Home Office officials reported that Patel felt Williamson “didn’t really seem to take on board” the potential dangers, according to an email from March 2020.Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office’s senior civil servant during the pandemic, said: “The Home Office continued to engage with the Department for Education at all levels to make our concerns clear. And the reason we had concerns was that we knew what happens to levels of domestic abuse, to levels of child sexual exploitation when schools are closed, because that’s what happens every holiday.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryBoris JohnsonSchoolsChildrenGavin WilliamsonPriti PatelShareReuse this content"

But whenGeorge Floyd was murdered in 2020, the museum concluded that more needed to be done.For Harrington, that meant confronting the history of the bishops ofLondonand their involvement in colonialism and slavery. The trust is independent of the Church of England, she said, and could tell those stories without approval.“At Fulham Palace, I knew that the bishop of London was called bishop of the colonies, but I didn’t really think: what does that actually mean?” said Harrington. “You can’t keep telling the stories of the bishops as abolitionists without going right back to the beginning and working out what their role was.”At Fulham Palace, Harrington said, Black History Month is now every month. In the years since Floyd’s death, the museum has hosted an exhibition called Resistance that examines the systems of physical and spiritual resistance that led to the ending of transatlantic slavery under the British empire. Harrington has made changes to their permanent exhibition to talk about research, and last year joinedBlack History 365, an initiative that wants black history to be recognised all year round, not just in October.“If we do Black History Month throughout the year then it is part of our history and it gives people a chance to come across it by accident almost, so that you’re making it more mainstream in a way by doing it every month,” she said.Beyond exhibitions and decolonising historical interpretations and stories, the museum applied to become one of the first six anti-racist museums in the country. Harrington wants to make the next exhibition – which will look at how plant collecting was used as a way to take land from people without their knowledge – part of the permanent collection and museum.“I like to think that we have continued with [anti-racism work that came with the Black Lives Matter movement], whereas I think some other museums produced statements around George Floyd’s murder and then haven’t really changed,” she said.Part of that commitment is an exhibition, which ended on Sunday, featuring a series of tapestry panels highlighting the long presence of black people in Britain. The museum gave up the venue to display the work free to mark Black History Month.“It’s great that you knew there was a moment that happened that sparked this interest,” said Paula Ogun Hector, the tapestry project’s founder, of Floyd’s death. “But this story of amnesia that’s been going on around our shared past is so entrenched, that’s why it’s so important to have people like Siân who are at the forefront of presenting these exhibitions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But many people in their 60s, 70s and beyond may struggle for a variety of reasons to maintain the step count they used to reach. Until now it has been unclear how much people need to do as they age to reap the rewards.Research led by Harvard University has some answers. The large prospective study examined not only how many steps older people took but how often they reached step targets across the week.Researchers found achieving 4,000 steps per day on one or two days a week was associated with a significantly lower risk of death and lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), compared with not reaching this level on any day. The findings were published in theBritish Journal of Sports Medicine.The study followed 13,547 American women over 62, with 72 the average age. They wore activity trackers for seven consecutive days between 2011 and 2015 and were followed for over a decade. None had heart disease or cancer at the start of the study.In the monitoring period to the end of 2024, 1,765 women died and 781 developed heart disease.Clocking up at least 4,000 steps a day on one or two days of the week was associated with a 26% lower risk of death from all causes and a 27% lower risk of dying from heart disease, compared with not reaching this threshold on any day of the week.For those achieving this step count on at least three days of the week, the lower risk of death from any cause increased to 40%, but remained at 27% for the risk of cardiovascular death.The researchers said the important takeaway was that it is the amount people walk, rather than the number of days on which they achieve a certain number of steps, that is most important for reducing the risk of premature death.There is no “best” way to take your steps, they added. The key thing is just to get your steps in. They concluded that a “greater number of steps, regardless of daily patterns, is associated with better health outcomes”.On average, the women took 5,615 steps a day. This was an observational study, and as such no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. There were also several limitations to the research, notably that physical activity was assessed for only one week, and only in women.Nevertheless, the researchers wrote: “The present study … suggests that frequency of meeting daily step thresholds is not critical (even 1to 2 days a week of [more than] 4,000 steps a day was related to lower mortality and CVD), and that step volume is more important than the frequency of meeting daily step thresholds in the older population.”They added: “An important translational implication of these findings is that since step volume is the important driver of the inverse associations, there is no ‘better’ or ‘best’ pattern to take steps; individuals can undertake [physical activity] in any preferred pattern (eg ‘slow and steady’ v ‘bunched patterns’) for lower mortality and CVD risk, at least among older women.”They concluded: “These findings provide additional evidence for considering including step metrics in the next [physical activity] guidelines, and that ‘bunching’ steps is a viable option for health.”Explore more on these topicsHealthFitnessMedical researchOlder peopleWomenShareReuse this content"

Contrary to some reports, it said, the display cases protecting the stolen Napoleonic jewellery had been installed in 2019 and “represented a considerable improvement in terms of security”.Paris prosecutors have charged a specialised unit known as the BRB with investigating the crime. The 100-strong force deals with high-profile robberies such as the armed holdup of the reality TV star Kim Kardashian in a Paris hotel in 2016.Investigators from the Central Office for the Fight against Trafficking in Cultural Property are also expected to be involved.It is not known how, where or whether the jewels will resurface. Beccuau told RTL: “The wrongdoers who took these gems won’t earn €88m if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels. We can perhaps hope that they’ll think about this and won’t destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.″skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As well as a yellow hi-vis vest with DNA traces, the robbers left behind a piece of jewellery – a crown that once belonged to Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugénie – and police were able to secure motorcycles, a licence plate and the basket case used to access the first-floor gallery.How the Louvre museum robbery happened in video, photographs and mapsRead moreThe French government will not be compensated for the stolen works of art. Those at private museums in Paris, such as the Louis Vuitton Foundation or Pinault Collection, are usually covered by private insurance, a government spokesperson said on Tuesday that in the case of the Louvre “the state acts as its own insurer”.This took into account the immensely high cost of insurance “when the claims rate is low”, the spokesperson said in comments first reported by the newspaper Le Parisien.At least four French museums have been robbed in the last two months, according to French media reports, including theAdrien Dubouché National Museumin Limoges, where two Chinese trays and a vase classified as “historical treasures” were stolen overnight in September.In separate case, a prosecutor announced on Tuesday that a Chinese woman had been arrested and charged over the theft of gold worth more than $1m (£750,000) from Paris’ Natural History Museum on 16 September.The 24-year-old was arrested in Barcelona on 30 September and handed over to French authorities on 13 October, Beccuau said.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The posts intensified a long-running feud between Duffy, who is also the acting head of Nasa, and Musk, whose company SpaceX is central to the US space program.Musk’s tirade against Duffy followeda statement from the transportation secretaryon Tuesday that Nasa would reopen contracts for the agency’s Artemis mission to land humans on the moon, which SpaceX had previously secured. Duffy said that SpaceX had fallen behind on its timelines. Duffy suggested the contract might go to another billionaire’s rocket company, Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin.Duffy’s remarks and Musk’s backlash are part of a broader fight over the direction of US space travel and a months-long battle over who will take over leadership of Nasa. The clash was a central part of Musk’s dramatic exit from the White House earlier this year, after theTrump administrationrejected his preferred Nasa pick, Jared Isaacman, and selected Duffy as the space agency’s acting chief.The debate over who should lead Nasa has been revived in recent weeks, according tothe Wall Street Journal, with Isaacman and Duffy both vying for the job. Trump denied Isaacman the position earlier this year, citing his donations to the Democratic party,calling hima “blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before”. Duffy has lobbied for Nasa to be placed under the authority of the transportation department, the Journal reported.Musk, who is no longer part of the administration, but is in the process of a detente with Trump following their public blowup, has used his platform to criticize Duffy and his reported proposals to foldNasainto the transportation department.“The person responsible for America’s space program can’t have a 2 digit IQ,” Musk posted on Tuesday on X, the social media platform which he owns.“Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Musk said in another post.TheSpaceXCEO also posted a poll referencing Duffy’s past as a champion lumberjack speed-climber, asking: “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?”Musk has long favored Isaacman, his ally and a billionaire investor in SpaceX, to lead the US space agency. Musk’s company is Nasa’s largest private contractor, and the agency has been critical to its growth, providing SpaceX with billions of dollars in funding. SpaceX won a$2.9bn contract in 2021to provide the lunar lander for the Artemis 3 mission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said the man used his vehicle to ram the federal agents’ vehicles in an attempt to flee. Officers then fired “defensive shots”.The man was shot in the elbow. The deputy marshal was struck in the hand by a ricochet bullet, the DHS said. Both were taken to the hospital.Bill Essayli, acting US attorney, in asocial media postidentified the man as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, and said Parias has been charged with assault on a federal officer. Parias could face up to eight years in federal prison if convicted.McLaughlin said the injuries were “the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest”.The homeland security department has said that violence against officers is on the rise, and has blamed activists for the increase. Donald Trump said in an executive memo last month that there has been “a more than 1,000% increase in attacks on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers since January 21 2025, compared to the same period last year”. But the agency has not released data to verify those claims, or explained how it catalogues incidents.Immigration activists say federal immigration enforcement agents are deploying increasinglyviolent tactics.News of the shooting comes amid growing concern about the sometimesviolent tacticsof Ice raids and arrests.

The company did post a profit, though less than expected.The Los Gatos, California, company cited an unexpected $619m expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the third-quarter earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.Netflix’s earnings came after Warner Bros Discovery announced it may sell all or part of its holdings on Tuesday, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN. Analysts speculated that Netflix may join the bidders looking to grab a piece of the storied production house.But Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s co-CEO, said in a call with investors on Tuesday afternoon that the company “will be choosy” when it comes to acquisitions and that “we’ve been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks, so there is no change there”. He did not mention Warner Bros specifically.“It’s true that historically, we’ve been more builders than buyers, and we think we have plenty of runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook,” Sarandos said.Investors, though, were not placated by the explanation as Netflix’s shares still fell by about 5% in extended trading after the numbers came out.Netflix earned $2.5bn, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5bn. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5bn.Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix’s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains may evaporate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m your host and editor, Blake Montgomery. What I’m watching this week: South Park’scaricature of Peter Thiel and his obsession with the antichrist. Read our reporting on the show’s inspiration: Thiel’sbizarre off-the-record lectureson the subject. And now, let’s get into things.Marc Benioff catches Trump’s attentionThe co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, said last week that Donald Trump should make good on his threats to send the US national guard into San Francisco, despite resistance from local leaders. Even Marc Benioff’s own public relations manager was aghast at his remarks, according tothe New York Times.Benioff is a local power player in the City by the Bay. His company is the city’s largest private employer. His statement published just as his company’s marquee conference, Dreamforce, was beginning, taking over the city’s streets in its own way. With a net worth of about $9bn, perForbes– far less than Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk – he punches above his weight politically, especially in Democratic circles.His comments were at odds with his liberal image and past statements, though not with how Salesforce conducts business. They divided tech leaders. One of Salesforce’s board members resigned in response, but Musk loved them. My colleague Dani Anguiano wrote: “David Sacks, a major Trump donor who the president appointed to serve as his AI and crypto czar, argued a ‘targeted operation’ could quickly clean upSan Franciscowhile Benioff suggested troops could help with policing duties.”Benioff apologized on Friday, saying he had “listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials … I do not believe the national guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco.” He said Dreamforce’s security had been the main motivator for his statement.Perhaps Benioff got what he wanted from the remark without expending too much political capital, all told. He seems to have found sympathetic ears in Trump’s administration. On Monday, the president seemed to address him, claiming “unquestioned power” to send federal troops to San Francisco.“We’re gonna go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump said in an interview.Read more:Trump claims ‘unquestioned power’ in vow to send troops to San FranciscoAmazon Web Services outage highlights danger of centralizationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Anushree Fadnavis/ReutersMy colleagues Dan Milmo and Graeme Wearden report on yesterday’swidespread outage at Amazon’s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services:A glitch at Amazon’s cloud computing service brought down apps and websites around the world on Monday.The affected platforms included Snapchat, Roblox, Signal and Duolingo as well as a host of Amazon-owned operations including its main retail site and the Ring doorbell company.More than 1,000 companies worldwide were affected, according to Downdetector, a site that monitors internet outages, with 6.5m reports of problems from users including more than 1m reports in the US, 400,000 in the UK and 200,000 in Australia.Experts have warned of the perils of relying on a small number of companies for operating the global internet. The outage underlined the dangers of the internet’s reliance on a small number of tech companies, with Amazon, Microsoft and Google playing a key role in the cloud market.Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, the head of digital at human rights organisation Article 19, said: “We urgently need diversification in cloud computing. The infrastructure underpinning democratic discourse, independent journalism and secure communications cannot be dependent on a handful of companies.”OpenAI’s Sora makes puppets of historical figuresView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Algi Febri Sugita/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockOpenAI’s Sora, an AI-powered video generation app, has enjoyed runaway success in the weeks since its launch. That’s thanks in large part to the capability to generate videos of your own face and those of your friends.

Of particular note and consequence in that realm: Martin Luther King Jr, who appeared in hundreds of AI-generated videos from Sora’s launch until Friday, when the company announced it would halt the use of his face after complaints from his estate.As Niamh Rowe reports: “One video high on my feed shows King making monkey sounds during his I Have a Dream speech. Others depict Bryant re-enacting the helicopter crash that killed him and his daughter.”The daughter’s of other notable figures have made similar complaints. Malcolm X’s daughtersaidvideos of her father were “deeply disrespectful and hurtful”. Clips using the likeness of the late comedian George Carlin were “overwhelming, and depressing”, his daughter said in a BlueSky post. Robin Williams’s daughter said via Instagram that AI-made videos of her father were “NOT what he’d want”.Zelda Williams wrote: “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to … horrible, TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening.”We’ve seen this dynamic play out repeatedly with OpenAI – the company is less sensitive to reputational risk than incumbents like Meta, which released an AI-powered video generation app without the feature of deepfaking your friends at the same time as Sora. And Google withheld its version of ChatGPT for similar reasons, and OpenAI, an insurgent AI David, beat the Goliath of Google to the punch. It was enough for Google to temporarily shutter its image-generation app when people used it tocreate impossibly ethnically diverse Vikings. One shudders to imagine the blowback it would have received if it had allowed its users to run buckwild with the face of MLK Jr.Read more:‘Legacies condensed to AI slop’: OpenAI Sora videos of the dead raise alarm with legal expertsThe wider TechScape‘The city that draws the line’: one Arizona community’s fight against a huge datacenter‘I lost 25 pounds in 20 days’: what it’s like to be on the frontline of a global cyber-attackInside San Francisco’s new AI school: is this the future of US education?Parents will be able to block Meta bots from talking to their children under new safeguardsThe teamwork behind Bletchley Park’s Colossus computer‘Have we done ourselves out of a job?’: concerns in film and TV industry over on-set body scanning‘I have to do it’: why one of the world’s most brilliant AI scientists left the US for China – podcastExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterOpenAIDonald TrumpSan FranciscoAmazonTrump administrationArtificial intelligence (AI)newslettersShareReuse this content"

Clinical studies have shown that Mounjaro is more effective in causing weight loss than Wegovy.Lund said the board had been unable to reach agreement with the drugmaker’s largest shareholder, Novo Nordisk Foundation, which wanted “a more extensive reconfiguration” of the board.This is Lund’s second corporate departure this year – in April,he agreed to step down as the chair of UK energy company BPamid shareholder opposition to its green energy plans.Novo Nordisk’s share price fell by 1.57% in Copenhagen on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This thrilling show, boasting 270 works, reveals the German in all his contradictory brillianceAdrian SearleTue 21 Oct 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 16.24 EDTShareGerhard Richter recalls, as a child, drawing with his finger on his empty, slightly greasy dinner plate, tracing and retracing fanciful curves and spatial structures in endless alterations on the china. Decades later, he would place blobs of different colours on a canvas then intermingle them using slithery curving brushstrokes, lubricated by the oil and paint, until the entire surface was covered. More or less pure colour slid among the passages of impure, much-mixed pigment. Other paintings were made using large squeegees and spatulas, pushing and dragging paint over the surface, and just as often scraping it off again. The squeegee would often pick up previously applied, sometimes half-dried paint, excavating previous layers even as it applied new ones. Smearing paint on, dragging it off again, Richter would keep working until he could no longer think of anything else to do to a painting. One day in 2017, he stopped painting entirely. Since then, he has devoted himself mostly to drawing.View image in fullscreenNod to Duchamp … his wife Ema on the stairs.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025Richter’s art is filled with beginnings and endings, revelling in chance as often as he has used craftsmanship and exactitude to paint people and places and things, from flowers wilting in a vase to street corners, elegiac landscapes and the dead. Standing amid his retrospective at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, it strikes me that however one chooses to describe or compartmentalise the different strands of his work, his art remains irreducible. It’s contrarian, fickle, controlled yet intemperate, the contradictions make a mockery of fixed readings. His art is filled with fugues, with self-absorption and an objective stare.Having had an academic art school training as a mural painter in Dresden, Richter and his wife Ema escaped to West Germany in 1961. After a few false starts, he soon began painting black and white images derived from photographs in newspapers and magazines, and from family snapshots. Here’s his Aunt Marianne, 14, with the infant Gerhard. A schizophrenic, Marianne was later institutionalised and then killed in the Nazi’s euthanasia programme in 1945. Here’s Uncle Rudi, buttoned up in his Wehrmacht greatcoat, smiling for his picture. He looks a kind of innocent, and died early in the war. Here’s Richter’s father, a not-long released prisoner of war, his hair comically awry and mugging for the camera. Family portraits and newspaper shots, airplanes and bombs, histories and holidays jostle on the wall.From early on, Richter has been both fascinated by and mistrustful of photographs, which he has often taken himself and returned to as a basis for paintings. He has also returned, time and again, to subjects taken from his own life, to the events and things that surround him. These have included subjects as laden as the Holocaust and the deaths in prison of four members of the Baader-Meinhof Group. He has painted a dangling toilet roll, a kitchen chair, a wine bottle and an apple on a table, a candle and a skull, and the moment when the second plane hit the tower on 9/11.Sometimes Richter has played with banality and even kitsch mawkishness and sentimentality. Shuttling between choices, he has painted Isa Genzken’s naked back, with a kind of tender objectivity, and his daughter Ella looking down as she reads a book. Light striking the corner of a gothic wall, unkempt wintry branches in the snow, a squatter’s house. Everything leads somewhere else, even when we can’t see it.View image in fullscreenButtoned up … Uncle Rudi, 1965.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)This is the most comprehensive retrospective I have seen of the now 93-year-old artist’s work. Organised chronologically and thematically and including around 270 works, the exhibition is filled with shifts and telling juxtapositions, across its multiple rooms. But where’s that vast and jumbled painting of the Alps, or the porn paintings, or the ones he painted of a tourist being attacked by a lion in a safari park, or the portrait of his daughter Betty, her head leant on its side? Having everything here, of course, would be impossible.A lover of lists, of categorising and archiving his works by subject, including all the photographs he has collected in his monumental Atlas of images, Richter has fittingly been the subject of numerous retrospectives and appraisals – including, in 2020, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a show that closed within days of its opening, due to Covid. Each exhibition tells his story differently.The point is to be able to linger as well as to follow Richter’s development over the decades. As much as we progress, we digress, like Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, and like Richter himself, through this electrifying exhibition. Ema, Richter’s first wife, comes down the stairs naked (a nod to Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 Nude Descending a Staircase). She takes her place among the first of his photographically derived cloudscapes and landscapes. The tide breaks on a muddy foreshore. A causeway crosses a tilted horizon, and there’s a green field under a sullen sky. Now an aerial view of a city. Have the streets and buildings been bombed or just strafed by Richter’s brushstrokes?View image in fullscreenWater therapy … a view of Venice, 1985.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)Sometimes, he works from photos and postcards, at other times from nothing at all. There are paintings that offer almost too much and others that give you nothing but a grey surface to wallow in. One is built up in fast glossy marks that catch the light. Another has a puckered, orange-peel texture, and another seems matt and blotted, faint light grinning through the murk.I swerve up close, pace between flip-flopping clear glass panels that are angled this way and that on a structure in the middle of the room, trying to look between them and through them, where Richter’s paintings are refracted and reflected and interrupted by bursts of gallery lights bouncing off the glass, complicating the view. Then there are the mirrors and the strip paintings whose multiple horizontal stripes zoom past like a train hurtling by, lifting my hair as it goes.View image in fullscreenSelf portrait, 1996.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)There are moments of quiet, in the thick white abstractions and in the brick side of a house that reminds me of Vermeer, with the blurred tree beside it thrashing in the wind; and the surging and the roaring and the unutterable silence and the muteness of the black and white abstractions named for the winter months; and the abstractions that had John Cage in mind when Richter painted them; and the 4,900 squares of lacquered colour made when Richter was working on the stained glass window for Cologne Cathedral. The exhibition leads you back and forth, from one thing to another, to drawings that are barely discernible, some like circuits of unknowable terrain quartered and mapped by a private cartography.Constantly re-complicating things even when he empties them out, Richter reworked a postcard of Titian’s 1530s Annunciation – which resides in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice – over a series of five paintings in 1973. The image becomes successively more jumbled and amorphous, the sacred light diffusing over the scene it illuminates, which swims and surges and becomes progressively less graspable. It dissolves, like the icebergs in the Greenland mist he later went on to paint, or the film still he used as the source of the panoramic Funeral, which concludes his 1988 cycle of 15 Baader-Meinhof paintings (titled October 18, 1977). The crowd and the coffins have become a barely discernible, a milling grey shimmer. As much as anything, these paintings seem to me to describe a kind of impossibility.View image in fullscreenPostcard origins … a 1973 Titian reworking.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025In 2014, Richter tried to work with the photographs taken, at great risk, by a prisoner at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, even sketching the terrible, surreptitious images recording the cremation of gassed victims on to his bare canvases, but found that the impossibility of painting them led the artist to expunge the images entirely. But the images are not so much erased as buried. The masses of dark and light, the layered judderings of black, grey and red make any reference impossible to trace back to their original source. You can’t squint your eyes and find them.Except, of course, that is exactly where Richter’s calculated mise en scène, contained in the exhibition’s final room, leads us, with its juxtaposition of photographs, abstract paintings and greyed mirrors hung opposite. They leave us wanting to see deeper. Turning away from the paintings to the grey mirror, you find yourself dimly reflected, implicated among the things in the room.AtFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, until 2 MarchExplore more on these topicsGerhard RichterEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Last week on The Celebrity Traitors, the gothic drama of the creepy cabin mission was interrupted by an audible parp. “What just happened?” asked host Claudia Winkleman, struggling to keep her composure. “I just farted,” said actorCelia Imriesweetly. “I’m so sorry. It’s nerves – but I always own up.”All around her, fellow famous types dissolved into fits of laughter. It was immediately hailed as a contender for TV moment of the year. Take note, Bafta, if you’re not too busy holding your nose. Deadline magazinereportedthat the viral scene “put some wind in the sails of the show’s ratings”.At a time when doom merchants are sounding the death knell for traditional channels, talking point programmes such as The Celebrity Traitors might help save terrestrial TV. Powered by Imrie’s gas, viewing figures have risen to nearly 7m live and 11.7m in total, making the current contest an even bigger hit than the three “civilian” series. Half of all Britons watching TV at 9pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays are glued to the goings-on at Ardross Castle. And it’s two residents in particular about whom everyone is talking.Traitor Alan and Faithful Celia are locked in a battle to be the reality game’s undisputed MVP. Sure, there are deadlier Traitors (see quiet assassin Cat Burns) and more effective Faithful (see the two Joes), but it’s Carr and Imrie who are truly box office.View image in fullscreenHilarious value … Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryComedian Carr came out of the gate first, hogging the spotlight in early episodes. When he felt the shoulder-tap from Winkleman to anoint him as a Traitor, our bespectacled cult hero flew into a panic. “I have a sweating problem and can’t keep a secret,” he wailed, immediately dubbing himself “the new Linda”. Tasked with murdering in plain sight, he came over all a-fluster.“It’s such a stretch for my acting skills,” he said. “I don’t know how Meryl Streep does it.” As he gabbled nervously, glugged rosé and gave unsubtle winks, it was highly relatable. Carr was behaving exactly how many of us would if asked to commit televised subterfuge. Asone social media wag noted, it’s like your favourite wine o’clock auntie was suddenly moonlighting for MI5.Since coldly betraying his real-life pal Paloma Faith, Carr has grown into his treacherous role. He slyly covered his tracks with a heartfelt eulogy at Faith’s graveside and a string of pot-stirring fibs. He’s now writing death order scrolls with relish, chuckling: “I’ve got a taste for it now.” When the Faithful bemoaned the “murder” of Tom Daley, he shrugged: “Deal with it.” “Alan has become a killing machine,” said co-conspirator Jonathan Ross approvingly.That green velvet cloak becomes him. As Richard Osmansaid last weekon The Rest Is Entertainment: “Alan’s like an accountant who’s accidentally been made head of a mafia family. Everyone goes, ‘He’s not going to be able to handle the violence’, and within a year, he’s killed everyone.”Even in the midst of his murder spree, quick-witted Carr is hilarious value. When Daley threw shade at Kate Garraway for using the word “flabbergasted”, Carr told him: “You can’t call someone a Traitor just because they have a better vocabulary than you.” When Ross wore a leopard-print cardigan, Carr asked if he’d come dressed as the Flintstones and muttered:“Yabba-dabba-don’t.”He said of scatty Garraway: “If Kate doesn’t come down for breakfast, people will just assume she’s gone into a broom cupboard by mistake.” During the forest wailing mission, he said of one throaty banshee: “She needs to suck on a Fisherman’s Friend.”This one-man meme machine has alreadyspawned his own merch. After a “Carr crash” start to his stint in the Traitors’ conclave, the wild card comedian has miraculously dodged suspicion, using his impish humour and main character charisma to turn the tide in his favour. Giggly, gossipy Alan simply couldn’t be guilty … Could he? Carr has seen his odds to win slashed. He’s now among the bookies’ favourite to triumph.View image in fullscreenGloriously unfiltered … Celia Imrie confesses her flatulence.Photograph: BBCMeanwhile, Imrie is winning hearts and minds as the castle’s eccentric elder stateswoman. The faultless comic timing of her flatulence aside, she’s a total hoot. When her team had to wail down a woodland well for the latest mission, Imrie’s deranged shrieks went on for longer than was comfortable, reducing her castmates to hysterics.She dropped an arcane reference to “putting the pussy in”, to be met with blank looks all round. Imrie somehow kept a straight face while explaining that she was quoting nursery rhyme Ding Dong Bell. Back at the castle, she decided to conduct some amateur investigations, proudly announcing: “I’m going to snoop and listen in to other people’s conversations.” “You know you’re not meant to tell people when you’re snooping?” pointed out Carr.The pairhave already become soulmatesand sparring partners. While playing badminton in the castle grounds, Carr called out: “Celia, we need a bit of wind to get the shuttlecock over the net.” “Oh shut up,” she retorted, faux-crossly. At the normally po-faced Round Table showdowns, they keep giving each other the giggles, which pricks the tension perfectly.Gloriously unfiltered and mischievous, the 73-year-old makes for mesmeric viewing. If Carr is ascending towards national treasure status, stage and screen veteran Imrie is already there. On the same episode of The Rest Is Entertainment, Marina Hyde told Osman that Thursday Murder Club star Imrie was an object lesson in not underestimating older people. “She’s a walking marketing campaign for the world you’ve created,” said Hyde.Other players have had their moments – Nick Mohammed with his puzzle mastery, Daley with his graveside side eye, Ruth Codd with her anti-Ross rants (“Don’t piss in my ear and tell me it’s raining”) – but Carr and Imrie have been the most consistently fun.The unlikely sleuthing duo of rugby player Joe Marler and comedian Joe Wilkinson recently hatched their “big dog theory”, speculating that Ross and Stephen Fry are the two alpha stars. They posited that one will be de facto leader of the Faithfuls and the other of the Traitors, pitted against each other in a VIP death match. Combined with the growing suspicion around Ross, it means that Carr could soon become top dog in the turret. At which point all bets would be off.Against all odds, the Spexy Beast and the Pooper Snooper are the comedy double act the nation didn’t know it needed. If Carr chose to recruit Imrie to the dark side, it would be pure TV gold. A total gas, you might say.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsAlan CarrCelia ImriefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its overreliance on TikTok clips of rubbernecking strangers is in very poor tasteHannah J DaviesTue 21 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareIn July 2023, 17-year-old Charlie Cosser attended a party in Warnham, West Sussex. Like many parents of teenagers, Martin and Tara Cosser were happy that their son was going to a gathering at a private house, rather than on a potentially rowdy night out in Guildford, Surrey, as he had originally planned.Tragically, the Cossers were wrong. A fight broke out on the party’s dancefloor, and Charlie was stabbed three times in the chest by Yura Varybrus, who was 16 at the time. Charlie’s catastrophic injuries included a cut to his aorta, which led to internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. The many harrowing moments recalled here include Charlie’s sister, Eloise – now 18 – listening to her brother’s heart beat for the final time, before his life support was turned off two and a half days after the attack. He was, says Martin, “a beautiful son in every way”.The murder of Charlie Cosser is one of three cases featured in the second series of ITV’s TikTok: Murder Gone Viral, a series centred on crimes with apparent (some are more clear than others) links to social media, be it in their causes or the publicity generated after the fact. It is a strange show that veers unevenly from lurid true crime to excruciating family testimony (Eloise describes the family’s life today as “a lonely bubble”). Even when it is at its least sensationalist, its overreliance on clips of strangers taken from the titular social media app cheapens the whole thing dramatically.That is most clearly the case in episode two, about the death of a 13-year-old girl, Tristyn Bailey, in Florida. Here, the TikTok connection is largely confined to the wild speculation that erupted online in the wake of Bailey’s death. Heartfelt contributions from her family are interspersed with vapid proclamations from people who didn’t know her (Annie Elise, a crime vlogger, says she “knew something was wrong instantly” when she heard the teenager was missing). One uncredited TikTok clip describes Aiden Fucci – the classmate who would later go on to be sentenced to life in prison for Bailey’s murder – as “a piece of garbage”.While contempt of court is less of an issue in the US than the UK, the idea that people were discussing and hypothesising around the case so openly online is presented as something more worthy than the rubbernecking it so obviously was. Some of the TikTok clips still have their usernames intact; while it feels unfair to pick out any one of these social media sleuths by name here, a quick Google shows some of them posting short clickbait videos with titles such as “what are the most brutal true crime cases?” and “the unsolved mystery of human remains in a skip”.‘I felt doomed’: social media guessed I was pregnant – and my feed soon grew horrifyingRead moreThe episode about Cosser has, at least initially, a much less icky connection with social media; it was, in fact, his father, Martin, who was posting on TikTok about his son’s death, and who continues to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime online and in the wider world through the charityCharlie’s Promise. Even so, I can’t help but feel as though the family deserved better than to be lumped into a series that picks and chooses how it feels about the internet from minute to minute. Later, we are told that there was a deluge of racist material on the app about Varybrus, claiming he was a Ukrainian refugee, but we are given no further information. TikTok: Murder Gone Viral prefers a more facile approach, flashing up comments such as “I’m so sorry. [Varybrus] will pay in hell”.The final episode in the series revisits the deeply sad yet already heavily publicised death of Brianna Ghey, adding little to what the public already knows. However, given that Ghey – a transgender teen trying to find her place in the world – had a following on the app, it perhaps feels the least shoehorned of the three. Brianna “blossomed” on TikTok, says her dad, Peter, while we also hear from her friend Viv, another trans girl she met through the app. It’s a shame, then, that the programme once again relies on the generic waffling of strangers to fill the gaps.As standalone films, The Killing of Charlie Cosser and The Killing of Brianna Ghey could have worked, but they also could have been so much better.

Cultural giants such as Friends and Sex and the City might have concluded a year earlier but glossy upstarts (The Office and How I Met Your Mother, heard of them?)were ready to fill their monolithic shoes. Into their midst came a scrappy new series: It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.The success of It’s Always Sunny was never guaranteed. It was born only a few months after YouTube, shot on a handheld camera, had a budget of practically nothing and featured a motley crew of out-of-work actors. The show was built on a simple premise; to highlight the exploits of an idiotic, narcissistic group of friends running an Irish dive bar in South Philly who scheme, betray and trick each other – or unfortunate strangers – at every turn.View image in fullscreenDanny DeVito elevates the show ‘from an underground classic into a bona fide hit’.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockDescribed as “Seinfeld on crack” during its early years, the series was created by and stars Rob McElhenney (AKA Rob Mac) as delusional “badass” Mac, alongside Charlie Day as the illiterate and substance-abusing Charlie, Glenn Howerton as the sociopathic Dennis and Kaitlin Olson as his sister – “Sweet Dee” – who, despite starting as the sole voice of reason, later devolves into an equally manipulative member of the gang.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDanny DeVito also joins in season two as Dennis and Dee’s multimillionaire and inexplicably feral father, whose eccentric presence would help elevate the show from an underground classic into a bona fide hit. You need only watch the timeless clip of a naked, oiled-up DeVito crawling out of a leather couch to understand how.On paper, It’s Always Sunny’s lasting appeal doesn’t make sense. An edgy show about awful people feels as though it should be confined to the 2000s alongside bygone hits such as Jackass or Entourage – not to mention the politically incorrect content of its earlier seasons, shocking even for its time. The title of the series’ first episode – The Gang Gets Racist – is a particularly hard sell for newcomers; other episodes have beenremoved from streaming.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s Always Sunny works because it allows the audience to laugh at each character’s unique depravity and relish in their inevitable comeuppance by each episode’s end. Living in a world where it feels as though the real-life bad guys are continually winning, it’s cathartic to watch this group of degenerates get what’s coming to them, time and time again.In many ways, It’s Always Sunny is the definitive anti-sitcom sitcom. A sexist comment from Dennis, for example, could easily belong in the universe of something like How I Met Your Mother – but here it’s not the smug misogyny that gets a laugh; it’s the blatant sociopathy and narcissistic delusion in thinking that this is an acceptable way to behave. The season-nine episode The Gang Tries Desperately to Win an Award addresses their underdog placement within the polished pantheon of network television, concluding with a song sung by an unhinged Charlie: “I don’t need your trophies or your gold, I just want to tell you all, go fuck yourselves.”Twenty years since the show premiered, It’s Always Sunny has become thelongest-running live-action sitcomwithout ever sacrificing its signature blend of stupid and absurd.There’s no guarantee the show will continue for 20 more years – DeVito is almost 80, after all. But as his character says: “I don’t know how many years I got left on this Earth. I’m gonna get real weird with it.”It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is available to stream on Disney+ in Australia, Netflix in the UK and Hulu in the US.

The return of horror as a main player at the UK box office. As a genre, it has impressively outperformed previous years (a 22% year-on-year increase for the UK and Irish box office: £83,766,086 in 2025, compared with £68,612,395 in 2024).“Last year, no horror film reached £10m at the UK or Irish box office. This year, five films have,” says Charles Gant, box office editor of Screen International. The big hits of the year –Weapons(£11.4m),Sinners(£16.2m), The Conjuring Last Rites (£14.98m) and28 Years Later(£15.54m) – have all hung about the multiplexes and in the public consciousness. Although much of the industry commentary focuses on the singular brilliance of Zac Cregger’s Weapons and Ryan Coogler’s postmodern epic Sinners, their successes indicate something is shifting between audiences and the genre.“I’ve heard people say, ‘Even if you don’t like horror this is a film you need to see,’” says Laura Wilson, head of acquisition at distributor Altitude. “Films like Weapons andSinnersplay with genre and structure to create something completely different, and that speaks to an audience in a different way.”But beyond artistic merit, the consistent popularity of spooky films this year suggests they are giving cinemagoers something that’s much needed: catharsis. “Right now, there’s a lot of anger, fear and division that’s being reflected in cinema,” says Mike Muncer, host ofThe Evolution of Horrorpodcast.View image in fullscreenAaron Taylor-Johnson and Alfie Williams in 28 Years Later, one of the big horror hits of 2025.Photograph: Miya Mizuno“Horror films are great at playing into people’s anxieties, while at the same time exaggerating them. So you forget about your day-to-day anxieties and focus on the monster on the screen,” says Christopher Frayling, author of Vampire Cinema and Frankenstein: The First 200 Years. Against a real-world news cycle of Gaza, Ice raids, the rise of the far right and climate catastrophe, witches, zombies and vengeful spirits resonate a bit differently with filmgoers. “I read somewhere that the success of vampire movies is linked to economically depressed times,” says Lola Kirke, one of the stars of Sinners. “It’s the idea that capitalism sucks the life out of people.”Since the early days of cinema, social unrest has influenced the genre. Frayling points to the boom of German expressionism after the first world war and the chaotic atmosphere of the early Weimar Republic, with films such as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, followed by the 1930s depression and Universal Studios’ Frankenstein and The Wolfman. “The classic example is Dracula: you get this invasion of Britain by someone from eastern Europe who then causes this infection that gets spread in all sorts of ways and threatens the Anglo-Saxon heroes,” says Frayling. “So it reflects a lot of anxieties around immigration.”View image in fullscreenThe Cabinet of Dr Caligari from 1920 reflected social unrest following the first world war.Photograph: History Archive/REX/ShutterstockThe boogeyman of immigration influenced the recently released folk horrorThe Severed Sun. Its writer-director Dean Puckett explains: “I wanted to explore ideas around the rise of populism. Firstly, slogans like ‘Let’s Make Britain Great Again’, that harken back to some fantasy time when things were ‘better’, but only if you were a rich white man. Secondly, the idea that you could be with someone you know and then suddenly they blurt out something round the dinner table or in a Facebook post and you’re like, ‘Where didthatcome from?’”Arguably, the current era of acclaimed, socially switched-on horror began with Jordan Peele’s brilliant satireGet Out(2017), released a year after Trump’s first term. It ushered in a new wave of horror auteurs, including the likes of Ari Aster, Osgood Perkins and the Philippou brothers. “It was a hugely exciting time,” says Alice Lowe, whose filmPrevenge(2016), about a murderous foetus, was one of the era’s tentpole movies. “I think it was the beginning of an era when people were opening up to doing a really bonkers horror film which had arthouse aspirations.” Lowe, who is writing a new horror original adds: “Over 10 years, audiences’ minds have been opening up to much more of that.”View image in fullscreenJordan Peele’s 2017 satire Get Out paved the way for a new era of socially aware horror.Photograph: Justin Lubin/PAAt the same time, there has been a reconsideration of the genre’s less celebrated output. Earlier this year, the Nickel Cinema opened in Clerkenwell, London, showing underground films such as The Greasy Strangler, The Fall of the House of Usher and the 1989 remake of Dr Caligari. The re-appreciation of this “rough and rowdy” genre is, according to Nickel Cinema founder Dominic Hicks, a direct reaction to the algorithmic content pumped out at the box office. “It’s a reaction to the sanitised product that’s coming out of Hollywood. You have a film scene that’s more tepid and more predictable. A lot of the Marvel and Netflix films are very similar,” he says. “In contrast [the films shown at the Nickel Cinema] are a bit broken. It’s like they’ve erupted out of someone’s subconscious and been planted out there without corporate interference.”Horror films continue to upset the establishment. “They have this strange ability to seem old fashioned and up to the minute, both at the same time,” Frayling says. Alongside the re-emergence of the mad scientist trope (two adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus are imminent), he predicts we will see horror films in 2026 and 2027 reacting to our current anxieties: about AI’s dominance in the near future and “vampires living in the Trump tower”.Meanwhile, “Jesus horror” The Carpenter’s Son – which tells the story of Mary and Joseph’s struggles after Jesus’s birth, and stars Nicolas Cage and FKA twigs as the holy parents – is set for release later this year, and will certainly send a ripple through the Christian right in the US. Puckett is already hard at work on his next film. “It’s a short horror film based on the time a Reform MP came to our door and chatted to us,” he says. Its title? “It’s called Fuck Face.”Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsSinners28 Years LaterJordan PeelefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s about a 10-year-old girl named Amber (Bianca Belle) whose drawings of monsters magically come to life and wreak all kinds of havoc. Since they are the product of a 10-year-old brain, and drawn with felt-tip pens, the monsters are mostly a cute bunch of fuzzballs with googly eyes, burping up glitter. Though be warned, one or two near the end could spook even adult audiences.Things start to go wrong for Amber after she is caught drawing a picture of herself stabbing a classmate – loudmouth, obnoxious Bowman (Kalon Cox). Amber lives with her big brother Jack (Kue Lawrence) and their lovely dad (Tony Hale); her mum has recently died, and there’s a funny scene around the dinner table as her brother Jack looks up on his phone if they are orphans, resulting in Amber coining the phrase “morphan” (as in maternal orphan).Close to their house, the kids discover a bright blue lake that can miraculously fix anything. When Amber drops her notebook in the lake, the monsters on the pages come to life. The lake’s power is never properly defined in the story, but the action is good fun, and there is a valuable message about difficult emotions. Amber’s pictures are graphic but they express how she is feeling, while her brother and dad are bottling up grief. Another lesson, possibly learned from 80s kids’ movies, is that adults generally, parents in particular, are well-meaning but essentially ineffectual.This is a family film with an IQ higher than the average – though before you book your half-term tickets, ask yourself if your little one is ready to watch a kid take a DIY flamethrower to the face of a scary monster.Sketch is in UK and Irish cinemas from 24 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmFamily filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

His voice was entwined with Erykah Badu’s on Your Precious Love, a duet that felt like an offering being passed between sweethearts. I was 14, the edge of adolescence, opening to my own life. Their voices sounded delicate, blooming – almost shy. A cover of a classic Motown record written by Ashford & Simpson and sung, most memorably, by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, D’Angelo and Erykah’s churchy call-and-response nodded to the past while low-pitchedboom-bapsreflected contemporary trends on the FM dial. It was a crossroads sound, working two ways at once, and the blend, the hybridity of it all, heralded the future.Before long, D’Angelo’s 1995 debut Brown Sugar got shared and traded and analyzed among my girlfriends. Though we were deep in hip-hop’s high-flossing, shiny suit era, we noticed how he insisted on tenderness. It was the ’90s; crack and the crime bill had ravaged our neighborhoods and hurt our pride. His visuals seemed to seek to restore it. His music videos had a relaxed, smoky cool; clips such as Lady and Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine showed women in every hue of brown whirling beneath warm lights and D’Angelo’s own devoted gaze. I had a dozen first loves, just as many fears, and a bouquet of dreams for the future – D’Angelo’s songs seemed to catch my currents.The pathbreaking soul vocalist and multi-instrumentalist born Michael Eugene Archer in 1974 in Richmond, Virginia,died last weekin New York City at just 51. His passing has prompted a global outpouring of grief and remembrance for an artist who fused the sacred and the sensual and remade soul music for a new generation. Female listeners, especially, had long been attuned to his art. We could sense, perhaps, the women inside his sound. Even when he sang alone, his music carried the influence of female collaborators, muses, ministers, and church mothers who shaped his voice, his arrangements, and his emotional acuity.His duet on Lauryn Hill’s song Nothing Even Matters was yet another hymn about devotion. Syncopated finger snaps hit like heartbeats, and the lyrics crooned “You’re part of my identity.” What truer thing could be said about the concentrated learning of girlhood days dawning into womanhood? The first high heels, the first heartbreak, the first time I knew I wanted to write. “Oh to be a pear tree –anytree in bloom!” Zora Neale Hurston writes of her protagonist Janie’s awakening to herself and her world in Their Eyes Were Watching God. I was in bloom, and the music helped me know it.“Neo-soul,” a term coined by the music executive Kedar Massenburg to market young singers who revered the records of their parents, is something like a discredited term now: D’Angelo himselfsaidhe’d never claimed to play it. But there was a moment when something new quaked in commercial rhythm and blues. Jill Scott scatted her own tunes of devotion, self-love, separation, and incense. Angie Stone’s afro halo sparkled, and her velvet voice held our hearts in lovesick ballads like No More Rain (In This Cloud). She was a key collaborator of D’Angelo’s, a co-architect of his debut and co-writer of many of his most evocative tunes. And it worked both ways: Everyday, from her 1999 debut Black Diamond,was a rhythmic, deeply funky feminine reckoning that D’Angelo helped her pen.Around the same time, high-tech R&B songs like TLC’s No Scrubs skewered no-account men. Its response from the male rap group Sporty Thieves, No Pigeons, gave it right back to the women. D’Angelo’s, Angie’s, and Jill’s stream of soul offered a more harmonious vision of the sexes coexisting. Even if it wasn’t always rosy.D’Angelo’s vision of love felt effortless. And his frictionless fusion of the sacred and the sensual recalled another church-raised prodigy, Aretha Franklin, whom he echoes in the verses of the Latin jazz breakup cut, Spanish Joint. Franklin moaned about all the ways Dr Feelgood loved her well while insisting that she“never left”the church.The currency of soul music is sweat. The trickle of wet above Whitney Houston’s top lip. James Brown laboring until he drenched his clothing, groaning “it’s a man’s, man’s world” like both a promise and a threat. I was in a college dorm when I first saw D’Angelo’s video for Untitled (How Does It Feel), a single from his sophomore album Voodoo.The clip famously showed close-ups of the artist’s face and torso. Droplets of sweat, frame after frame of gleaming brown skin. It is an ecstatic performance, full of wails and shouts, but also a subtle dance of retreat, tension, release, call and response. He sang about spiritual ecstasy and sensual pleasure simultaneously; he reveled in his body before us. He did not separate the divine from the flesh, or tarry over the two realms as if they were in conflict.Now, after his death, we know his labors toward a holistic theology and a unified sound were anything but easy.By the time Voodoo arrived in 2000, critics were calling D’Angelo “R&B Jesus”, who’d come to save us from the vapid. They placed him in the lineage of soul men like Marvin, Donny, and Al Green – men who shouted and hummed with intense virtuosity but sometimes buckled under their own contradictions. D’Angelo was the son of a preacher, and he’d first displayed his talents at the Pentecostal church his parents ran, the Refuge Assembly of Yahweh. His father led the congregation, but his mother, Marian Cox, also ministered. “She spoke with fervor and fire,” according to her 2023 obituary. She was known for powerful prayers and for tending the less fortunate – especially women – in her community. Most critics took for granted that women had helped raise D’Angelo and failed to consider that they’d had any influence on his sound.Directing choirs, playing the organ and keyboards during service, the young artist noticed that covering contemporary gospel from groups like the Hawkins family offended some of his church’s elders. The sound was too funky, too close to the secular sounds found on the radio.Marian Cox wasn’t the only minister in D’Angelo’s maternal line. His grandparents ran a congregation thirty miles west of Richmond. It was deeper in the red-clay Piedmont, along the James River – a major artery of the domestic slave trade. After emancipation, Black families settled along its banks and built autonomous farming communities and a constellation of churches where they could worship as they chose. In this church, dancing was allowed. And the drum.It was Pastor Alberta Cox, D’Angelo’s beloved grandmother, who told him that he could sing what he wanted without fear of damnation. “I spent a lot of time with her,” the artist says in the 2019 Dutch documentary Devil’s Pie.She assured him that holiness could move, sweat, and groove. When she died in 2002, shortly after D’Angelo finished the Voodoo tour, the artist descended into a deep depression that led to his withdrawal from public life for over a decade.In the 2025 documentary Sly Lives! (The Burden of Black Genius), about the legacy of multi-talented funk and rock musician Sly Stone, D’Angelo spoke of the pressure to endure. “It can be unbearable, man,” he said. I wonder if he also meant the burden of genius. The film imagines genius as solitary – and male: D’Angelo is shown among peers like Q-Tip and André 3000, with only Chaka Khan as a counterpoint. But Stone’s most celebrated band had women on trumpet and keys, and many of D’Angelo’s most piercing compositions were co-written, arranged, or conjured with women. The solitary male genius is both a myth and a lie.In 2015, D’Angelo told the talk show host Tavis Smiley that he’d borrowed some of his fervor from the female gospelquartetMaggie Ingram and the Ingrammettes. His guitar, spare and unhurried, recalled the Piedmont blues of Etta Baker, all restraint and quiet intricacy. D’Angelo was a synthesizer of centuries, a musician who made one sound out of many histories – pressure and release, sensual and sacred, Holy Ghost and bawdy house. And women were there all along, moving him toward something whole.Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He did 19 jobs – shop assistant, hotel waiter, petrol attendant and security guard, among other things – in six cities. Although all these jobs were atrociously paid, they still earned him more than the one he tried for two years in the middle of this period: writer. (An 8,000-word story earned him less than 300 yuan – about £30.) Then, during Covid, he wrote a blog about his night shifts in a logistics warehouse, and it went viral. The blog expanded and became I Deliver Parcels in Beijing, which has sold nearly 2m copies inChinasince being published in 2023, and now appears in Jack Hargreaves’s English translation.The low-paid Chinese worker is at the mercy of an entirely unrestrained market. The jobs Hu does demand unpaid trial periods and have no base pay, and he works mainly for commission or a handling fee, which his employers can reduce on a whim. Disgruntled employees pick on each other, because “going after the powerful will only cost us in the end”. Experienced hands refuse to help newbies, on the grounds that “teaching the disciple might starve the master”. The only power Hu has is to walk away. When his bosses learn that he has no children, that his parents have pensions and medical insurance and don’t need his support, they worry that he will leave at a moment’s notice (and are sometimes right).To his customers, Hu is just a blurred head on their video intercomThe book’s longest and most compelling section narrates Hu’s time as a courier in Beijing, delivering parcels ordered online to workplaces or gated residential developments. On the busiest days, even with an unreliable battery-operated trike to get around, he walks 30,000 steps. He works out that he must earn 0.5 yuan a minute (about 5p) so as not to run his life at a loss, which means completing a delivery every four minutes. The 20 minutes he takes for lunch costs 10 yuan. Urination costs 1 yuan – provided the toilet is free and he only takes two minutes – so he avoids drinking too much water on his shifts. Some neighbourhoods have especially troublesome and time-devouring customers: Hu spends on them the time he saves in the better neighbourhoods, like a subsidy.To his customers, Hu is just a blurred head on their video intercom staring awkwardly into the camera. Even the online shopping addicts among them have no clue about a courier’s life, and neither know nor care that each failed delivery costs Hu at least 0.5 yuan. One frequent shopper, a tower crane driver, is always busy midair when Hu tries to deliver. Another tells him that “the customer is king” and Hu replies, with rare defiance, that “there should only be one king. I have to serve hundreds every day.” In China, though, the customer really is king. They can try on the clothes Hu has just delivered and then cancel the order on the spot, in which case he receives no commission and even has to repackage it all himself, eating up yet more time. He must pay compensation to dissatisfied customers. One fellow courier, after a customer complains about his attitude, is ordered to spend three days visiting neighbouring depots, reading aloud his own letter of self-abnegation.We learn little about Hu himself, other than that he is frugal – he doesn’t smoke or drink, cycles everywhere, and gets his hair cut at five-yuan stalls by the roadside – and that his natural shyness sometimes spirals into social anxiety and paranoia. One paranoid episode comes during a two-year stretch working in a windowless mall in Nanning, when the only time he spends outdoors is on the walk to and from work, usually in the dark. The 2008 Beijing Olympics pass him by; only the Wenchuan earthquake of that year, the tremors from which reach the mall from more than 900 miles away, briefly registers.Although this book is full of illuminating and often startling detail, it is written in flat, one-note prose that I found uninviting. Its deadpan, faux-naif quality has echoes of Haruki Murakami, but without Murakami’s surreal switchbacks or storytelling power. Hu manages transitions with phrases like “But I digress” and “Another thing that happened”, and his chapters and subheadings have austere titles like “My first job to my eighth” and “Other jobs I’ve had”. An avid reader of Chekhov, Salinger and Carver, he says little about how their work connects with his own life, other than that they are “powerfully resonant”. There are few concessions to the non-Chinese reader. We learn about the big online shopping peaks created by “Singles Day” and “Double Twelve” (12 December) that are the bane of a courier’s life, but I had to look up what these festivals involved.For all this book’s fascinating anthropological insights, I was left wondering if its bestselling success in China was the result of an authorial tone, and a cultural context, that has been lost in transit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But these juvenile stories and essays shed fascinating light on the repression of Lee’s early lifeSandra NewmanTue 21 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen a new book is published by a writer dead for a decade, there is always some suspicion that the bottom of the barrel is being scraped. When the writer is Harper Lee, there is also the unpleasant aftertaste of the release of her second novel, 2015’sGo Set a Watchman, which was promoted as a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, when in fact it was a formless early draft. The publication was also surrounded by controversy over whether the aged Lee, by then seriously disabled, had really consented to its publication.This new book, The Land of Sweet Forever, is a much more conventional enterprise: a collection of Lee’s unpublished short stories and previously uncollected essays. No deception is being practised here, and if people want to read the lesser scribblings of a favourite author, it is surely a victimless crime. However, like most such books, it has little to offer to those who aren’t diehard fans.The short stories, written in Lee’s youth, are all badly underdeveloped. Most fail to work even as vignettes. One centres on trying to find a place to unload a truck in Manhattan; another on a temporary change to the way the doxology is sung in a Methodist church. A slender piece about the quirks of New York movie audiences is categorised as a story, but feels more like a newspaper sketch.The young Lee seems to have little sense of what a story is.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe conventionally cheery tone is almost a hostile presence, drowning out and censoring Lee’s real thoughtsOn the positive side, there is already wit and charisma in the voice. One narrator, returning to her southern home town, recognises “a tall young man whose face belonged to the Wade family, but whose body showed extensive Talbert influence. He was Talbert Wade, of course.” This may be slight, but it’s elegantly done. There are also hints of iconoclastic anger struggling to get out, especially in The Water Tower, where a 12-year-old Mississippi girl erroneously thinks she is pregnant. Understanding that being an unwed mother would wreck the lives of her whole family, she decides the only way to save them is to destroy her shameful body. With another draft or two, this story could have been truly haunting. But the version we’ve been given is meandering and clumsy, and peters out inconsequentially. Perhaps the strongest story in the collection, The Cat’s Meow, deals with the Jim Crow-era mass incarceration of Black men. Here, the dialogue of the clueless white people is painfully convincing, but the narration keeps jarringly falling into the conventional chirpiness of mid-century women’s magazines.Up in smoke: should an author’s dying wishes be obeyed?Read moreIf the stories are juvenilia, the essays are rote outings on subjects such as “Love is the most important thing”, “Reading matters” and “My happiest Christmas”. The essay on love includes such insights as “Man is on his way to Venus, but he still hasn’t learned to live with his wife … Man now has the power to destroy himself and his planet: depend upon it, he will – should he cease to love.” The overwhelming feeling with these is that Lee was nagged by a publicist or friend into writing something, and struggled to achieve the minimum word count. It’s initially exciting to notice an essay on Truman Capote, Lee’s close childhood friend. But this turns out to be a puff piece written for the Book of the Month Club newsletter, and consists of stuff like: “Kansans will spend the rest of their days at the tantalising game of discovering Truman; what Truman found in Kansans will make people everywhere discover themselves.”If we regard this book as literature, it is an unqualified failure. But it’s more properly seen – and will surely be read – for the light it sheds on Lee’s life. As such, it’s obliquely fascinating, largely because it radiates repression. Often there’s a sense that we’re seeing the side ofHarper Leethat wasn’t exceptional, but representative of a generation of women who were mostly muzzled.Again and again, the narration is choked off just when things begin to get challenging. The gender nonconformity of the protagonists – all thinly disguised versions of Lee – is often obvious but never explicitly mentioned. The conventionally cheery tone is almost a hostile presence, drowning out and censoring Lee’s real thoughts. Beneath the surface, we often feel the stubborn surging of the excluded. Lee writes in The Cat’s Meow: “I suppose a lot of people like me have mastered the first lesson of living at home these days: if you don’t agree with what you hear, place your tongue between your teeth and bite hard.” We feel those painfully gritted teeth on every page of this book. In a time of rising censorship, it’s salutary to be reminded that an author as important as Harper Lee came so close to being entirely silenced.The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£22).

The first thing you do is feed on the cop who finds you, before smacking his partner into a wall so hard that his blood spatters the brick. A violent fanged rampage ensues, where you beat up and tear apart rival undead and their ghouls while currying the favour of the local court of vampires, and trying to keep your existence hidden from the mortal populace of this sultry city.But this is also a detective story: there’s a younger night-stalker sharing your brain, a voice in your head named Fabian, who talks like a 1920s gumshoe (presumably because he once was one). Fabian isn’t violent at all; he evidently works with the human police and the vampire underworld, snacking on consenting volunteers’ blood and using his mind-delving powers to solve murders. These two stories are two entirely different games in the same setting, but then everything about Bloodlines 2 feels stitched awkwardly together. It is unfortunate that I happen to be playing this right after bingeingAMC’s Interview with the Vampire TV series, because the contrast is stark. One is a masterful, frightening, sexually charged and deftly comic reimagining of vampire mythology. The other isOK.View image in fullscreen‘My interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveAppropriately, the development of this vampiric saga appears to have been cursed. The first Bloodlines game was a cult classic PC role-playing game released in 2004, and it took more than a decade for a sequel to get off the ground. Bloodlines 2’s development began in 2015 at Seattle-based Hardsuit Labs, led by the first game’s writer. But the development was fraught with difficulties, and in 2021 the whole project got passed on to a new developer, The Chinese Room. What has resulted is an interesting cut-and-shut job with elements of Hardsuit’s version of the game woven together by The Chinese Room into a 25-hour story that just about makes sense. It’s not a total bust, but there are a lot of evident loose ends.For example, there is a giant screenful of vampire abilities that you can learn, evidently intended to give you some choices about how you approach the game – seduction, brute strength, manipulation. But you start off already super powerful, and you get the most fun mind-control and neck-snapping dark powers in the first couple of hours, giving you little reason to learn more. When I tried to do something interesting with these abilities – such as possessing mortal prey on the street, or interrogating someone by breaking into their head – the game often refused to comply.And though my interactions with my vampiric brethren have been interesting, my interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling. Walking down the streets you’ll hear sex workers shout “Just gotta pay off these college fees!” to nobody. A businessman sitting on a bench opened with the line “Want to get into business together? Sexy business?”, then got up and followed me around the streets saying “I can’t wait to fuck you!” until I got so annoyed that I ate him. I know that vampires see mortals as inconsequential puppets, but not like this.View image in fullscreen‘Some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveBizarre, out of place non-player character behaviour is not the only thing about Bloodlines 2 that feels extremely late 00s. It reminds me of the spate of awkward-but-interesting first-person games that followed 2000’s Deus Ex, and not just because of the outdated animation. Gliding with unnatural speed across the rooftops of Seattle is fun, which is just as well, as most of the game’s missions have you pootling back and forth across the city talking to people. But when you encounter ghouls – and there areso manyof them – you get drawn into some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades. It is so unfun that I knocked the difficulty down to easy after the first few hours so that these annoying skirmishes would be over faster.There is an OK vamp story hiding in here; careful, dicey conversations with dangerous fellow vampires are by far the most interesting thing that Bloodlines 2 has going for it. And I enjoyed some parts of Seattle, particularly the dive bars packed with people gyrating to (of course) goth music. The Chinese Room has managed to make something playable and vaguely interesting out of a game development disaster. But after the first few hours, I kept going more out of morbid curiosity than enjoyment.Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is out 21 October; £49.99/$59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesAction gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can it work on stage in Bradford?Catherine LoveTue 21 Oct 2025 10.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 12.26 EDTShareNovelist Fiona Mozley and theatre-maker Javaad Alipoor are not an obvious match.Elmet, Mozley’s Booker prize-shortlisted 2017 novel, is a lyrical and violent tale of land, family and revenge in semi-rural Yorkshire. Alipoor is best known for complex multimedia performances exploring digital technology, internet culture and geopolitics. But the contrast is what energises them about working on a stage adaptation for Bradford’s year as City of Culture. “I couldn’t see how it was going to come together,” says Mozley. “But that excited me.”Alipoor read Elmet during the pandemic and was struck by its “gut-punch story”. As fans of his company’s work might expect, this is not what he calls a “route one” adaptation. Instead of focusing on plot and dialogue, he is maintaining the novel’s evocative narrative mode and underlining the show’s theatricality, with actors stepping in and out of character. Everything is refracted through the perspective of teenage Danny, who lives in the woods with his quietly seething sister Cathy and the hulking, almost superhuman Daddy, whose sense of right and hunger for violence sets them on a collision course with the avaricious local landowner.In this version, memory is a central theme. In rehearsals, I watch the company build a scene in which LJ Parkinson’s Danny remembers a loaded exchange with Cathy. While Parkinson speaks, Jennifer Jackson as Cathy emerges from behind like a figure in a dream. The company starts to layer subtle movement with a delicate folk song by the Unthanks, who will be performing music on stage throughout the show. The effect is haunting, even in this early draft.View image in fullscreenShifting the narrative around his home town … Javaad Alipoor at rehearsals for Elmet.Photograph: Lee BaxterAlipoor and his collaborators have seized on the idea of Elmet as a tragedy. Mozley hadn’t thought of the novel that way but agrees that “it does hit all those beats” with its escalation towards seemingly inevitable devastation. For Alipoor, it was important to think about “what it means to set a tragedy somewhere like this” – asBradfordhas often been defined by its poverty in the mainstream media. “There’s something about making tragedy out of that,” he says. “Getting people to look at this with fresh eyes and not tell ourselves a story that’s just about the drudgery of a place.”One of the most striking things about Mozley’s prose is the way it conjures the family’s woodland home. This is a place where “the soil was alive with ruptured stories” and “the ghosts of the ancient forest could be marked when the wind blew”. Mozley and Alipoor grew up in York and Bradford respectively and, in one of their first meetings, Mozley recalls that they talked about “being very much from Yorkshire and steeped in Yorkshire, but maybe not in a typical sense, and having that immersion in the place but also the ability to step outside and look in”.Mozley has since left York for Edinburgh, where she is working on her third novel, and Alipoor and his company are now based in Manchester. In different ways, place has been central to their work. Mozley’s second novelHot Stewdepicts a vivid Soho under threat from luxury development, while in shows such asRich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in TehranandThings Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, Alipoor has explored the Iranian side of his heritage.There’s a sense in which nature is breaking throughThe name Elmet refers to the Celtic kingdom that stretched across what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire. Alipoor suggests that this region retains a distinctive, mythical quality today: “The boundary between the urban and the rural is not what it is in other places, and our sense of rurality isn’t the polite sense of what it means in Cheshire or the home counties.”He says there is in Mozley’s book “a sense in which nature is breaking through”, something this production will convey through language, movement and music. Alipoor describes the original songs written by the Unthanks as another character in the drama. The band’s sound draws on the traditional music of the north-east of England, reflecting the folkloric elements of the story and its connection to the land.Bradford’s year as City of Culture has so far includedRise, an outdoor, multi-artform spectacle that attracted more than 20,000 people, andMemories of the Future, Akram Khan Company’s dance performance featuring more than 70 local participants. Alipoor sees Elmet as another opportunity toshift the narrativearound his home town.“What we’re trying to do,” he says, “for audiences who for a variety of reasons don’t usually come and see contemporary theatre, is put on a show that takes some elements of their lives, fictionalises them, makes them capital T tragic and capital E epic – and also makes a case for why theatre, as a storytelling form, can do something nothing else can do.”Elmetis atLoading Bay, Bradford, as part of Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture, from 22 October to 2 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreBradfordThe UnthanksUK city of cultureFestivalsJavaad AlipoorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was here he started out, on the young writers’ programme. Now a starry alumnus, he completes a career full circle by premiering a play on its main stage for the first time. Is it a triumphant return? Not exactly, although he has gathered a garlanded company around him, including directorMarianne Elliott, another Royal Court returnee.Nicola Walker plays Miriam, a mother grappling with the disappearance of her son, Oscar, who vanished when he was not yet 16. The play’s indirect inquiries into loss (When does disappearance turn into permanent loss? Is moving on the same as giving up?) feel very much in keeping with Payne’s oeuvre on stage and screen. So does its cut-up structure that shuttles non-chronologically through time, not unlike his 2012 playConstellations. Scenes flip from the hopeful beginnings of a police investigation to false leads followed ever more desperately by Miriam, to seven years later when her ex-husband David (Paul Higgins) suggests a memorial as some form of closure.Among the flashbacks are a blended family’s fractiousness and mother-child bust-ups between Miriam and Nancy (Alby Baldwin), who is so haunted by their brother’s death that they dabble in spiritualism, and Miriam and Margaret (Ella Lily Hyland), who has moved on with her older boyfriend, Benjamin (Harry Kershaw).View image in fullscreenThe actors seem stranded … The Unbelievers by Nick Payne.Photograph: Brinkhoff-MoegenburgThere are strong stand-alone moments but something feels off, with a flatness of tone and an injection of ridiculous comedy that chips away at the family tragedy, shrivelling its effect. Scenes that dramatise the endless, unknowing wretchedness of Oscar’s disappearance are followed up by humour that contains an edge of hysteria, and drives the play from tautness to bagginess, from depth of feeling into wacky territory.When David’s new partner, Lorraine (Lucy Thackeray, fantastic), makes an appearance at a family get-together, the drama seems transformed into social satire with shades of Abigail’s Party. Lorraine’s social uncouthness is softly parodied; so is Benjamin’s loftiness as he gives an extended lecture on the life of puffins. It is amusing in itself, but what is it doing in this play, exactly?Actors seem stranded too, trying to hold up characters that do not always feel real; Miriam’s first husband, Karl (Martin Marquez), now a vicar, seems to exist purely to answer questions around faith, as well as delivering a few strangely comic lines about sex for men of the cloth.Dramatically, it is static, both downstage and at the back of Bunny Christie’s set, which is separated by glass and turned into an existential waiting room for off-stage characters who sit with their head in their hands or in melancholy reflection. It’s a good idea, but the symbolism outweighs its effect.You learn next to nothing about who these people are, from where they live to what Miriam and David do for a living. There are few spoken memories of Oscar. Walker projects desperation that threatens to tip over into full-scale meltdown. Higgins has a lesser role but gives a sure performance of nervous inadequacy and anger, both directed at Miriam. Yet, as a whole, the emotional range of performances seems limited, maybe hemmed in by the jumping structure.This is unquestionably dramatic subject matter with resonances to so many news stories on disappeared children, but it just does not cut deeply enough.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 29 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreNicola WalkerMarianne ElliottRoyal Court theatreNick PayneBunny ChristiereviewsShareReuse this content"

She’s also a dead-eyed host who might leave Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Kevin McCloud fearing for their futureStuart HeritageTue 21 Oct 2025 07.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.31 EDTShareLast night’s Dispatches was called Will AI Take My Job? Usually when something like this employs a question mark in the title, it’s because the answer is no. Not this time, though, because the sheer overwhelming inevitability of AI taking our jobs is genuinely painful to think about.According to the film, 8m jobs in the UK alone are at risk of being outsourced by AI. Call centre workers, translators, graphic designers – anyone who isn’t a masseur or a scaffolder, basically – will soon be made redundant by a technology that, despite its catastrophic effect on the environment, is growing more sophisticated by the hour. My days are almost certainly numbered; it stands to reason that I will soon be replaced by the ChatGPT prompt “Be performatively exasperated about whatever was just on the telly”. Grok could even whip up a byline photo of an unpleasantly smug egg to go with it. Nobody would be any the wiser.But if we know AI is going to render us all useless, why would anyone watch Dispatches? Unless they get a perverse kick out of reinforcing all their darkest beliefs about the future of humanity, surely there was very little to be excited by. But the film anticipated this, and reacted with a cute little rug-pull of its own. The episode was presented by a journalist called Aisha Gaban. But, get this, she was AI all along.That’s right, Channel 4 justTilly Norwooded itself. There was not a single human thing about Gaban. She was an entirely computer generated presence. But despite being a bundle of pixels and code, she was a fairly convincing host. Sure, she was dead behind the eyes, and her mouth couldn’t animate sibilance very well, but she looked more or less human and nailed the stilted cadence of the television documentarian. What a lark. That person you trusted as a figure of authority? Not even a person! Joke’s on you, fleshbag.The meat of the show itself was diverting enough, taking four professionals – a doctor, a lawyer, a musician and a photographer – and pitting them against the best that AI can offer. The thrust of the results seemed to be that while humans are better, AI is quicker and cheaper. And, given that avarice is the motivating factor for every industry, this means that we are all royally screwed.Admittedly, some of the technology made sense. A tool that can diagnose patients in half the time of a traditional GP, for example, has the potential to support human medics who are already buckling under the strain of a broken system. But who the hell needs an AI photographer? Surely the point of AI is to remove drudgery from our lives, not automate creativity. The existence of AI photographers points to a horrifying future where we’re all doomed to work in full service of machines that puke out crap art for ever.But anyway, this was all a sideshow to Aisha Gaban, apparently Britain’s first AI television host. And honestly, it was hard to see her as anything but Channel 4’s attempt to have its cake and eat it. Not only did it get to show off its swanky new toy, but it also got to tut-tut at the technology that created her. What an ingenious trick.It was even harder to see the film as anything other than a stark warning to all the other Channel 4 presenters. Hey Krishnan Guru-Murthy, you’d better not complain about office snacks in the future, or you’ll be sacked in favour of a blinking mannequin we’ve programmed to read an Autocue. And no contract disputes from you, Kevin McCloud, because we can replace you with a virtual avatar that can frown at terrazzo worktops without ever needing a loo break.And that’s without mentioning the environmental cost of it all. It would have been nice if Dispatches had Gaban end the show by detailing exactly how much water was used to run the datacentre that created her, especially given Channel 4’s longstanding commitment to achieving net zero.All in all, it made for a dizzyingly grim watch on multiple levels. And given the speed with which AI is improving, this will only get worse. Three years from now you’ll be getting ChatGPT to give you a bullet-pointed precis of an AI-generated criticism of a show that was presented by AI-generated hosts, while you dig in the dirt for worms to feed your family. Still, it was nice while it lasted, wasn’t it?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In The Collector (1965), she was Miranda, an art-school student abducted by the shy but sinister lepidopterist Freddie (Terence Stamp), who imprisons her in the cellar of his country house in the hope that she will come around to loving him.Eggar received an Oscar nomination for the film, and both she and Stamp won acting prizes at Cannes. Her role demanded that she ricochet between extreme states of distress, some feigned to gain the upper hand over her captor, others paralysingly real, and interludes of calm and even tenderness, during which Miranda tries to convince Freddie to release her. “If you let me go now, I shall begin to admire you,” she says softly. “I’ll think, ‘Well, he had me at his mercy but he was chivalrous. He behaved like a real gentleman.’”She is extraordinary in one heart-stopping moment near the end of the film, when it finally dawns on Miranda that all her pleading and compassion has had no effect. She looks at Freddie, her face tear-stained, and says simply: “I’m never getting out of here alive. Am I?”The actor’s discomfort was not restricted to what happened on screen. “All during the rehearsals I felt as if certain people were trying to stab me in the back,” Eggar told the Daily Record in 1965. There were rumours of frostiness between her and Stamp. Chief among her antagonists, though, was the director William Wyler, with whom she clashed from the start.View image in fullscreenSamantha Eggar in the 1960s.Photograph: Everett/Shutterstock“Knowing I was not getting along with Wyler, I was scared stiff all the time,” she said in 1966. “Terrified. During the whole four months that I was slogging away at the film, Wyler never even let me have lunch. He made me rehearse right through the lunch period. And I never knew how I was doing. Wyler never said, ‘Well done’ or anything like that. It was a grim time of my life.” She lost 14 pounds during the shoot. “Sheer hell” was her verdict. Wyler said directing her was “like carving soap”.The other high point of her career was The Brood (1979). She plays Nora, a woman denied access to her daughter as her marriage falls apart. Undergoing rage therapy, she gives birth to her grievances and traumas in the form of smudge-faced mutant offspring. These hideous creatures then scamper off to do her murderous bidding.David Cronenbergwas inspired to make The Brood after his divorce. “I can’t remember how we fixed on Samantha,” he said, “but she looked a little like my ex-wife.”Eggar’s scenes, which were shot in just four days, were static face-offs withOliver Reed, who played her therapist. She had known Reed from childhood, when, as he put it in his autobiography Reed All About Me, they played “mothers and fathers”. “He wrote that [I was] his first girlfriend,” she said. “I made him a cake out of plasticine. I must have been all of three.”Cronenberg recalled that Eggar “really understood the movie; she said that it reminded her of her own childhood. To me that meant she was seeing past the horror-fantasy elements to the psychological elements, which were really the basic underpinning of the movie.” In a 2014 interview, Eggar sang the film’s praises, calling her role “Shakespearean”.The Collector and The Brood proved Eggar’s fearlessness in handling intense material, but she was also adept at lighter fare. She sparked amusingly withCary Grantin his final film, Walk, Don’t Run (1966), an updated version of the 1943 comedy The More the Merrier, set in Tokyo during the 1964 Olympics. Grant’s character elbows his way into Eggar’s tiny apartment after she advertises for a flatmate, then plays Cupid between her and the athlete to whom he sublets half his space.View image in fullscreenSamanthat Eggar in Doctor Dolittle, 1967, the year-long production of which was plagued with problems. Eggar was stoical about it: ‘I got 13 costume changes and a free trip to the Caribbean. Who’s complaining?’Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/ShutterstockShe went straight from that into the disastrous year-long production of Doctor Dolittle (1967), starring Rex Harrison as the 19th-century veterinarian who can converse with his patients. Eggar played Emma Fairfax, who accompanies the title character on his voyage to find the Great Pink Sea Snail.“I loved being around the animals,” she said. “But then the trainers got hepatitis [from bites] three times. So we were always being jabbed with these big long injection needles.” She also complained of a “ghastly headache” from all the singing, though she was replaced by a voice double for some songs. The film became one of the biggest box-office flops in cinema history. Then again, Eggar got “13 costume changes and a free trip to the Caribbean. Who’s complaining?”She was born in London to Ralph, a brigadier, and Muriel (nee Palacha-Bouma), who drove ambulances during the second world war. She was raised in Bledlow,Buckinghamshire, and educated at St Mary’s Providence Convent in Woking, Surrey, before studying fashion design at the Thanet School of Art in Margate, Kent. She then enrolled at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where Stamp was one of her classmates.View image in fullscreenSamantha Eggar and Dirk Bogarde in Doctor in Distress, 1963.Photograph: ShutterstockBefore she could graduate, she landed a part in Cecil Beaton’s play Landscape With Figures (initially titled The Gainsborough Girls), starring Donald Wolfit as Gainsborough, in Brighton in 1959.It was in the Royal Court’s 1962 production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which she played Titania in a cast which also includedDavid Warner,Lynn RedgraveandRonnie Barker, that she was spotted by the producerBetty Boxand cast in the campus drama The Wild and the Willing (1962).John HurtandIan McShanealso made their screen debuts in the film. “We were like puppies, really,” said Eggar.In the same year, she was the killer’s lover in Dr Crippen, opposite Donald Pleasence in the title role. She co-starred withDirk Bogardein the comedy Doctor in Distress (1963) and the following year played the damaged younger sister of the blind protagonist (Patricia Neal) in the thriller Psyche 59.Following the horror of Return from the Ashes (1965), in which she is drowned before she can execute her plan to kill her stepmother, who is a concentration camp survivor, Eggar announced: “It’s time I stopped being murdered in baths.” (The Collector also included an instance of peril in the tub.)Walk, Don’t Run might have been the tonic she needed had she not given birth to her first child a fortnight earlier. A request for more time off led the studio to threaten a lawsuit. Stuck in Tokyo without her baby, she was “deeply, deeply sad”.She and Richard Burton were scheduled to headline a musical version of Goodbye, Mr Chips, which eventually emerged in 1969 starringPeter O’Tooleand Petula Clark. Eggar said in 2012 thatElizabeth Taylorwas “nervous of Richard and I making the movie together. The next thing, we were both out of the film. But we did get paid.”Her Hollywood career peaked with the 19th-century mining drama The Molly Maguires (1970), starringSean ConneryandRichard Harris. In the same year, she played women caught up in criminal schemes: pressured into being an accomplice to a robbery in The Walking Stick, and almost framed for murder in The Lady in the Car With Glasses and a Gun.Eggar then veered off into horror movies, including The Dead Are Alive (1972), The Uncanny (1977), Demonoid (1981) and Curtains (1983). She also played the wife of Dr Watson (Robert Duvall) in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976), which starredNicol Williamsonas Sherlock Holmes.View image in fullscreenA poster for The Walking Stick, 1970, starring Samantha Eggar and David Hemmings.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIt was television, though, that dominated her career. From the early 1970s, when she was one of the leads on Anna and the King (1972), a non-musical TV spin-off of The King and I with that film’s star Yul Brynner, there was scarcely a US show on which she did not appear, from Columbo, Starsky & Hutch and Hawaii Five-O to The Love Boat, Murder, She Wrote and Star Trek: The Next Generation.Her last film roles included the voice of Hera in Disney’s Hercules (1997) and a doctor in the thriller The Astronaut’s Wife (1999) with Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron.In 1966, she claimed to “hate” Hollywood: “All anyone there talks about is themselves or what movie is grossing what.” Nevertheless,Los Angeleswas her home. “I’ve had a private life,” she said. “Nobody knew what I was doing. Hopefully.”She is survived by her children, Nicolas, a film producer, and Jenna, an actor, from her 1964 marriage to the actor Tom Stern, which ended in divorce in 1971.Victoria Louise Samantha Marie Elizabeth Therese Eggar, actor, born 5 March 1939; died 15 October 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmUS televisionLos AngelesDavid CronenbergLondonTerence StampBuckinghamshireobituariesShareReuse this content"

We speak to some to find out whyElla GloverTue 21 Oct 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.31 EDTShareFromsolo traveltodining alone, people have increasingly been embracing social activities by themselves in the years since the pandemic – even in the ultra-social contexts of live music and club culture.A recent survey by Ticketmaster found that the number of people who have attended either a weekend or day festival by themselves has risen from8% in 2019 to 29% this year. Reading and Leeds festival introduced a campsite area for solo attendees this year, joining Download’s longstanding “lone wolf” area, and there are a growing number of social media pages such as London Solo Ravers, and WhatsApp groups such as Untitled Rave Community Project, for people venturing to nightclubs alone.“If I go to an event with someone else, I can very much spend the night doing their night, as they would want it,” says Anaïs Espinosa, a 26-year-old from London. “When I’m alone, I get to do whatever I want in the moment, whether that’s going to get a drink or being right at the front where the DJ is. You just act on pure instinct. I feel like a little video game character in a funny story.”Dr Karenza Moore, a researcher of club culture and recreational drug use at Newcastle University, says people’s top reason for going it alone is “a particular interest in a genre of music”: maybe you love happy hardcore but struggle to find anyone else who shares your enthusiasm for 180bpm insanity. This is reflected in Ticketmaster’s findings, too, which showed that interest in the music was the main draw for solo punters at festivals. And amid the cost of living crisis, people may struggle to find enthused friends who can also afford to go out. “If you don’t know anybody, and you want to go to that kind of thing, you just have to be OK with going on your own,” says Imi Jagger, who is 26 and based in Manchester, and has gone solo to a number of electronic music nights and queer parties.View image in fullscreenSome gig attendees say they go solo because their friends aren’t interested in the same kind of music.Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty ImagesSince the pandemic, there has been a rise in meetups such assingles nights, group events for strangers,offline hangoutsandwalking groups, lessening the stigma around being “a loner”. Two other reasons cited in Ticketmaster’s research were a sense of freedom and the opportunity to meet like-minded people, and Moore adds that many of us have become fatigued with meeting and interacting with people online: “People are really appreciating doing things in real life,” she says.Cat Rossi, a professor at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey, who has a research interest in club culture, suggests that the rise in solo partying may be another facet of how “people are more interested in consuming experiences than things” today. And perhaps there’s a more cynical impetus at work: “What you want is the experience – and also you want to sharethat experience on social media.”But anyone in it for the Instagram likes will be in a minority, and Moore says that many solo ravers end up finding a sense of togetherness: “Invariably you go on your own, and then you’re not on your own.”Thirty-year-old Ben Walton from north Wales has been going out alone since he was 23, and does so two or three times a month. “I can meet new people from a variety of different backgrounds, and people I may never see again,” he says. “There’s a beauty in that.” Jagger agrees. During her time at Awakenings, a Netherlands techno festival, she tacked on to a group of Dutch friends she’d never met before, which she says she never would have done if she’d been with people she already knew. “Getting to know them for a weekend was so interesting. It’s fascinating, especially if you’re in a different country, because you get to experience a different culture.”This trend is partly facilitated by social media. Rossi says people have gotten used to “a hybrid digital and in-person community, and there’s lots of research about how the internet can connect you with communities that are not on your doorstep, but that are yours in the sense that you have shared interests”.View image in fullscreenSolo clubbers and ravers say they talk to people they would never have met if they’d been out with friends.Photograph: Slavica/Getty ImagesHaving enjoyed similar events with friends for around a decade, Espinosa only started going out alone this year, and chalks it up to age and confidence. Some research suggests that the averageage of festivalgoers is increasing, andolder people are still going out frequently, which may account for the increased number of people attending solo, something Moore also points to as a potential driver.‘I’ve made friends for life’: Rising number of travellers find going solo is the ticket to happinessRead moreBeyond that, there has been a focus on welfare and harm reduction at live music events, meaning that they are “perceived as safe: people know that if something happens, they can go and speak to the staff,” says Moore. For Espinosa, it depends on the crowd: “In general, it feels safer for me to be alone at a rave than a club, where people are usually just trying to pull and drinking loads of alcohol, whereas at raves, people are usually just there for the music and to dance.” Jagger is a little more sceptical. “I don’t feel physically safer at raves because spiking, harassment and assault are still so common,” she says. “But I do often feel more accepted.”But while it can be difficult at first to “let go”, as Espinosa puts it, going solo can also increase self-esteem. “It’s quite validating,” says Jagger. “To know I’m not dependent on other people and I can create great experiences on my own, too.”Explore more on these topicsMusicClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behold: Dekoda, Kohler’s new toilet cam. No, not that type of toilet cam: this one only shoots picturesdownat what is inside the bowl, sending the snaps to an app that analyzes stool samples and rates your gut health. The Dekoda can be yours for $599, plus an annual subscription fee.Kohler’s new product joins Throne, a $319 offering from an Austin-based startup. “Throne captures stool and hydration patterns, hands-free and automatically,” the camera’s description reads. “Notice shifts sooner, fine-tune daily choices, and feel more confident, every day.”You might wonder: Who is this for? Slovenian philosopherSlavoj Žižekonce noted that traditional German toilets have “poo shelves”, where “shit is first laid out for us to sniff and inspect for traces of illness,” while French toilettes have a hole in a back, to make feces “disappear as quickly as possible”. Somewhere in the middle are American toilets, “a basin full of water, so that the shit floats in it, visible, but not to be inspected”.ClearlyŽižekhas not spent enough time on TikTok; in an optimization-obsessed world,stool-gazinghas become nearly as popular as sleep-tracking or counting steps. People share their “poop logs” on the app, recording every time they number two each month. “I have pooped 329 days this year,” one woman said in a 2024 TikTok. “A poop weighs about ¼[lb] to 1lb. So if you take it at ¼, that’s about 131 pounds that I pooped this year.”People think waste is something you flush away, but it really contains a lot of insights about usKash Kapadia, Kohler Health CEOTheBristol stool scale, a clinical assessment tool developed by doctors to classify samples into seven different categories – with types three (“like a sausage but with cracks on it”) and four (“like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft”) being the gold standard – frequently makes appearances on gut health influencers’ social media pages.The chart helps doctors diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which was once a diagnosis one might keep to oneself. Not any more: in 2022, the magazine Allureproclaimed“We Are Entering an Age of IBS Empowerment,” with more doctors studying the syndrome, and women rallying around the theory that “hot girls have stomach issues”.“People think waste is something you flush away, but it really contains a lot of insights about us,” says Kash Kapadia, the CEO of KohlerHealth. “It literally comes from us, and now we can study it in a way that doesn’t require you to handle it.”The device starts working as soon as a user decides to “start the session”, with the tap of their fingerprint. “Right at the time when your urine hits the water level of the toilet, the camera will start flashing its LED light,” Kapadia says. The pictures then get uploaded to Kohler’s cloud and are analyzed through “proprietary algorithms” which take about three to five minutes to process before the results are visible on the user’s app.View image in fullscreenDekoda from Kohler Health.Photograph: Kohler HealthThough Kohler says the camera boasts “privacy-first features” such as fingerprint authentication and end-to-end encryption, it’s understandable that many would not trust a toilet-tracking cam.Joana Gaia, a clinical professor of management science at the University at Buffalo who studies health data systems, says that the idea of a poop camera is “less invasive” than a Fitbit or Apple Watch, which collects more data. “Kohler is not a medical organization, so they are not covered by Hipaa [the US law on medical privacy],” she adds. “This is something that comes up a lot with apps that are healthcare-related.”(When 23andMe, the at-home genetic testing company filed for bankruptcy, many feared it would sell data from more than 14 million customers to a third party. In the end the data went to a non-profit founded by the company’s former CEO Anne Wojcicki, who intends to use it for medical research.)I could see how these devices could make people obsessed with chasing the ‘ideal gut’Amanda Sauceda“The concern for me comes from what data [the Dekoda] collects,” Gaia adds. “Who owns all this data, and what could they potentially do with it?”“We recognize that this is a very personal space, and we’ve taken that very seriously in how we designed for privacy and security,” Kapadia says. Though the Dekoda shares anonymized poop data with unspecified business “partners”, it will not share the data with a physician or family members. As of now, the Dekoda does not share its data with Apple Health or Google, but Kapadia says that could change “if people want that”.Amanda Sauceda, a registered dietitian based in Long Beach, California, is not exactly surprised that poop cameras exist. “I think especially with the rise in colon cancer among young people, there are more conversations about actually looking at what is inside the toilet bowl,” she says, referencing thesharp increaseof the disease in people under 50, which many experts attribute to ultra-processed foods. “It’s another way [for companies] to capitalize on that.”Butt seriously: why you might be pooping wrong – and what to do about itRead moreShe worries that too much attention placed on a poop’s appearance could be detrimental. “There’s this idea in gut health that you’re striving for this big, beautiful, smooth, snake-like poop all the time, when that’s really just not realistic,” she says. “I could see how these devices could make people obsessed with chasing the ‘ideal gut’.”Ashley Oswald, a Minneapolis-based registered dietitian, adds that the bacteria in stool changes within two days of a new diet, which could lessen the importance of timely poop data. “Is it even that useful to know about the bacteria in your stool when it could all change within two days?” she asked. “We’re losing sight of the basics when we chase trends. It’s interesting and fun to track your poop, but how many people are doing things that significantly influence the gut, such as eating enough fiber or being active?”Sauceda tracks her own movements using the Bristol chart. “I always say that looking at your poop is like a report card: it’s a good way for us to know what is going on inside our gut,” she says. “You don’t always feel differently when you take a probiotic, but I definitely feel different if I don’t poop every day.” Sauceda’s method of tracking is entirely free. “You don’t need a fancy camera to look at your poop.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One Australian video hasracked up 2.7m views, and the appliance has sold out online. But withKmart supply chains under scrutinyand the knowledge thatculinary trendsand the veryspecific appliancesneeded to make them are passing fads, not everyone wants to – or has to – buy a machine to make slushies this summer.Here are some tips for how you can create the icy treats at home with appliances you likely already have.The ingredientsEasy freezy: eight fruity recipes for frozen summer treats – no ice-cream maker requiredRead morePick your flavours. (Almost) anything can be a slushieIf it can be juiced or blended, it can be a slushie.Berries? Slushie.Watermelon? Slushie.Cucumber? Slushie. In fact, if it exists in liquid form, it can be slushied:coffee,cola,matcha,gazpacho. One Singapore restaurant chain servescelery slushies, while Quebec convenience store Couche-Tard has a longhistoryof slushie marketing ploys, releasing “wonton” and “pizza” flavours that were actually just iced-tea and strawberry flavoured.Cara Devine, the Melbourne-based bartender and author, says stone fruit and herbs such as sage or basil are “really good friends”, while Sydney bartender Michael Chiem says a piña colada, with its pineapple and coconut elements, is “the ultimate classic slushie … Nothing like a piña colada transports you to a holiday.” He uses cold-pressed pineapple juice to retain the fruit’s freshness and flavour.A good slushie needs a sour element too. Lime juice is a common acidic ingredient, though lemon, orange, grapefruit and green apple also work well.And then there’s sloshed slushies. In1971 a Dallas restaurateurmodified a soft-serve machine to produce frozen margaritas at scale, and since then many alcoholic beverages have had their turn as the slushie du jour:Frose,Friesling,Pinot Freezio. At his bars PS40 and Silver’s Motel, Chiem serves salted piña colada and Midori Splice slushies; one time, Devine mixed a whisky and cola version.But a note on spiked slushies. “Alcohol can be a friend and an enemy,” says Chiem. Add too much alcohol and the mixture won’t freeze, leaving you sipping slurry rather than slushie.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningYou need a lot of sugar: be brave“Cold numbs your flavour receptors, so you tend to lean a bit sweeter in your [slushie] recipe,” says Devine.Generally, cocktails tend to be made on the sour side, says Chiem. Margarita and daiquiris, for example, tend to have more lime juice than sugar syrup, but for slushies: “You’ve got to be brave enough to go the opposite way. You need to add more sugar than you think you need, otherwise it won’t carry the flavour.”Rather than free-pouring CSR’s finest, it’s best to make a simple sugar syrup first, so it integrates properly into the drink. In a saucepan, simmer equal parts caster sugar and water and stir until the crystals dissolve, then cool. Many recipes use a 1:1 ratio of sugar and water, butAustralian Bartendersays a 2:1 sugar to water ratio will dilute your drink less.The methodYou (might) need iceIf you want a slushie tomorrow, freeze your ice cubes today. The fastest way to make a slushie is essentially to make an iced smoothie – pop all your liquid ingredients (juices, syrup and alcohol, if using) plus ice in a blender, then whiz. While ice is important for a smooth, homogenous texture and frosty temperature, it can also dilute the drink. Both Devine and Chiem suggest instead using frozen cubes of juice to amplify the flavour; Nagi Maehashi AKA RecipeTin Eats uses frozen strawberries (readily available in supermarkets) in addition to fresh berries in herfrozen strawberry daiquiri.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Make sure your ingredients are as cold as possible, don’t keep the blender running too long or the machine will warm the ingredients, and prechill your glasses.View image in fullscreenIt takes effort, but if you have no ice and no blender, you can still make a slushie.Photograph: Annabelle Breakey/Getty ImagesNo ice? No blender? There’s a waySome recipes instruct cooks to partially freeze the combined liquid in a shallow tray or bowl, then use a fork to scrape the mixture into ice crystals – similar tosome techniques for making granita.Because alcohol doesn’t freeze, it can also be used to bring a slushie texture to frozen fruits. Crushed frozen watermelon cubes quickly take on slushie consistency when shaken with a squeeze of lime juice, a shot of syrup and a shot of vodka.A note: these methods are slower, more physically demanding, and let’s be honest, less impressive than the whiz and wizardry of a blender, but show a slushie machine needn’t be bought off the shelf. The ultimate slushie machine is you.Cara Devine’s frozen strawberry daiquiri – recipeView image in fullscreenIce is nice: Cara Devine’s frozen strawberry daiquiri.Photograph: Gareth Sobey/Hardie GrantThe frozen strawberry daiquiri has a rather venerable history as far as modern frozen cocktails go. Crushed ice was being added to daiquiris at El Floridita in Cuba as far back as the 1930s, and when the blender was popularised by Fred Waring in 1938, he took it to famed home economist Mabel Stegner, who included a strawberry daiquiri in her 1952 book Electric Blender Recipes.Ingredients60ml light rum, chilled30ml sugar syrup, chilled30ml fresh lime juice, chilled4-5 frozen strawberries1 cup iceTo garnish: strawberry fan (using a sharp knife, make slits in a strawberry from just below the stem to the other side, so the strawberry is held together at the stem end, then fan out the slices.)Working as quickly as possible, add all the liquor ingredients to the blender. Add ice and blend, starting slowly then going to full speed. Don’t whiz for too long as you don’t want the drink starting to heat up from the friction. Pour into a glass and garnish with a strawberry fan.This recipe is an edited extract fromStrong, Sweet and Bitterby Cara Devine (Hardie Grant, RRP A$36.99).

Where should I start?Ben, by email“Maybe with some carrots, onions, cucumber or beetroot – anything Ben has an excess of,” saysConnor Wilson, head chef atThe Kirkstyle Innin Slaggyford, Northumberland. “Fermentation is a great way of preserving produce, but it won’t give new life to things that are past their best.”That said, tired-looking carrots would be perfect forOlia Hercules’ go-to for newbie fermenters: “If they look dehydrated but without any rotting, they’re amazing to ferment,” says the author ofStrong Roots. “The sugars concentrate and you get this bright carrot flavour.” Start by slicing carrots (“the thinner or smaller the pieces, the quicker they’ll ferment”), then make a brine by mixing 35g rock or sea salt (“don’t use table salt”) with a litre of water (“tap is fine, filtered is better”), and making sure the salt dissolves. You can then go as fancy or simple as you like: “Drop in some peppercorns, allspice berries, coriander seeds, fennel seeds or anything else you think might go, bring the brine mix up to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to infuse and cool to room temperature.” Pop the sliced carrots in a sterilised jar, then fill with the brine, making sure the veg are fully submerged: “You don’t want any sticking out and meeting the air, because that’s when bad bacteria can attach.” Hercules then leaves the sealed jar(s) for a few days until signs of fermentation emerge – “The brine will turn opaque, and you’ll see some bubbles” – then taste, taste, taste: “Once the carrots are nice and sour, stick the jar in the fridge.”Yoko Nakazawa, author ofThe Japanese Art of Pickling and Fermenting, agrees that Ben should keep things simple. “Cabbage or turnips would be a great choice,” she says. “In Japan, there’s a type of pickle calledasazuke, which means ‘lightly pickled’, and they’re made by rubbing cut veg with 2-3% of their weight in salt.” Their taste will evolve over time: “With this one simple method, you can enjoy different flavours – crisp and salty at first, then slightly tangy and finally distinctly sour – and serve at different stages, either as a side dish, palate cleanser or even a simple garnish.”Of course, half the fun of fermenting is having a play around, so feel free to add spices, herbs or citrus peel as you see fit. Just be sure to follow a few simple rules. “First, it’s essential to keep everything clean to prevent unwanted bacteria and let only the beneficial microbes do their work,” says Nakazawa, who sterilises her containers, jars and utensils with boiling water. Then, she says, it’s just a case of trusting your senses and asking yourself: “Does it look appealing, smell inviting and taste lively?” That’s to say, look for “vegetables becoming bright, remaining crisp and bubbles appearing in the liquid; a pleasant, tangy aroma; a gentle fizzing or small pop when you open the lid; and the flavour evolving from salty to a refreshing acidity and great complexity.”Finally, just like the rest of us, ferments respond best when they’re treated well: “I speak kindly to them and avoid making them when I’m stressed or rushed,” Nakazawa says. “It’s a mindfulness activity.”Got a culinary dilemma?

When a walker or cyclist delivers the damning judgment “there’s no decent caff” to a group of friends, the ghastly silence is followed by everyone crossing the accursed region off their map. The sheer importance of this staple dietary ingredient is obvious from our island geography: Dundee, Eccles, Bakewell, Chelsea …So it was with some trepidation that I set out to walk around the Llŷn peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales, on part of what is called theSeafood Trail. I mean, I love a lobster, but what about the fruit scones? Bangor University’s school of ocean sciences has produceda map of seafood producersand outlets to encourage hikers as they stride along the coastal path. Fine, but it’s the late afternoon sugar lull that I worry about.Llŷn peninsula map, north WalesWe start on the north coast in Nefyn, a place that boasts anexcellent breweryand a good beach with one of the most Instagrammed pubs in Wales, theTŷ Coch Inn. Me and my friend Andy are both nervously scanning the weather apps as the forecast is stormy. The plan is to walk and camp, but only after a gentle start in theNanhoron Arms hotel. This proves doubly beneficial as the dinner includes a delicious Anglesey sea bass and, next morning, we can stay dry while watching a barrage of lashing rain come down. We have each brought a tent, but neither item has been tested at this level of downpour.The translation of Cwt Tatws is roughly the Potato Shed, but the name belies the true magnificence of this cafe close to a sandy beach in TowynI am already a convert to theWales Coast Path, one of the finest walks in the world, but I have never done this particular section. Immediately, we are off to a great start: the rain stops and we cross Nefyn golf course and settle into a rhythm of cliff and cove. In one sheltered spot, a few Atlantic grey seals play in the shallows while the older ones snooze on the beach. A kestrel hovers overhead and butterflies skip around a few late flowers. In May this would be a floral bonanza, but now we have blackberries to keep us going.View image in fullscreenLooking down onto the Tŷ Coch Inn, Nefyn under stormy skies.Photograph: Loop Images/AlamyThen, with lunchtime approaching, we start scanning ahead and almost immediately we seeCwt Tatws. The translation is roughly the Potato Shed but the name belies the true magnificence of this cafe, all the more splendid for its ideal location close to a beautiful stretch of sandy beach in Towyn. A rich selection of sandwiches, salads, pies and, of course, cakes, is augmented by cosy seating, a vintage clothing section and a range of Welsh products. Neither of us, unfortunately, has space in our rucksacks for a sack of sea salt or a bottle of Welsh whisky. However, we do manage an extra slice of coffee and walnut sponge before heading off.After 3 miles (5km), we drop down on to a sandy beach at low tide and weave through a set of sentinel rocks. This long lovely stretch, Traeth Penllech, is a real gem, leading us up to the first campsite atMoel-y-Berth. Run by Mike and Joanna Smith, this is the kind of place people return to every year. There is a shop and a handy cafe for breakfast where, the next morning, we sit and watch another rampaging storm come blasting through. When we emerge, however, the sun is out again.View image in fullscreenLobster lunch at Top Cat Caffi.Photograph: Kevin RushbyOur luck holds all day, but by midafternoon a crisis is looming. Without tea and cake, I reckon, I’ve only got a few miles left in my legs. But then at Porthor’sWhistling Sands beach,Caffi Porthorpops up, another gem, serving a vast range of delicious homemade cakes, including a Welsh stalwart,Bara brith. If you’re not familiar with this heavenly manna, it’s a fruit cake made with tea and spices. And Caffi Porthor makes the best I’ve ever tasted. Andy, foolishly, turns it down and the result, three miles later, is that he runs out of steam, taking a short cut across the headland toDwyros, our second campsite. Meanwhile, powered by tea and cake, I stride on for a further seven miles around what is the best section so far: the actual tip of the Llŷn peninsula. The spectacular cliffs offer a fine view of the tidal race between the headland and Bardsey Island. On a day like this one, when the wind is gusting powerfully and the current is running at about four metres per second, it’s a fearsome sight.If you’re not familiar with this heavenly manna, Bara brith is a fruit cake made with tea and spicesAberdaron, just around the corner, is a lovely village with an excellent fish and chip shop,Sblash, and a fine pub,The Ship, a good spot to try out a few words of Welsh as that’s the main language here, as on most of the Llŷn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Rhiw I meet Brett and Nia who harvest crab and lobster for theirTop Cat Caffiwhere we eat a lobster salad lunch. However, the weather is deteriorating fast so we can’t get out to help with the day’s catch, something Brett encourages visitors to do. That evening, camped atRhydolion farm, we stagger an extra mile to the pretty inland village of Llanengan and eat bowls of delicious mussels at theSun Inn.The final day is a bracing stomp across surfers’ beach, Hell’s Mouth, a notorious shipwreck spot in the past, then aroundMynydd Cilanheadland to Abersoch where there’s plenty of cafes to hide from the storm.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Fenix 8 Pro takes thealready fantastic Fenix 8and adds in the new cellular tech, plus the option of a cutting-edge microLED screen in a special edition of the watch. It is Garmin’s top model and designed to be the only tool you need to more-or-less go anywhere and track anything.That makes it an extremely pricey proposition starting at £1,030 (€1,200, $1,200, A$2,300) for the 47mm OLED version and stretching to a colossal £1,730 (€2,000/$2,000/A$3,399) for the 51mm version with microLED display – almost twice the price of the regular Fenix 8.You do get a lot of watch for your money with best-in-class workout, activity and adventure tracking. The full offline maps of the globe can automatically guide you back on to the trail if you get lost without a phone, and look great on the large, sharp and super-bright touchscreen.View image in fullscreenThe Fenix 8 Pro is thicker and heavier than the standard Fenix 8 by 2.2mm and 4g respectively, and pretty chunky on the wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fenix 8 Pro only comes in 47mm or 51mm case sizes, not the smaller 43mm version Garmin offers in other models, so it is a big watch for big wrists. But the 47mm OLED version as tested does have an extra day of smartwatch-use battery life even with the screen on all the time, lasting a solid eight to nine days between charges.Phone-free messaging, calls and live trackingGarmin has itsown inReach LTE (4G) and satellite subscription serviceinstead of relying on a watch plan linked to your phone provider, like other smartwatches. But unlike Apple or Google’s satellite-capable devices, emergency SOS messaging is not included for free.Instead, plansstart at £7.99 or equivalent a month, which provides unlimited LTE text and voice messaging, calls andLiveTracklocation sharing – so your friends or loved ones can keep an eye on you while out running, cycling or similar – plus emergency satellite SOS messaging.View image in fullscreenThe setup and activation of the inReach subscription is a fairly long-winded affair, but only needs to be done once.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCheck-ins and texts over satellite are then charged on top, with more expensive plans including various allowances of satellite use, climbing to a £50 a month unlimited plan. The watch comes with a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service.Once you have got it set up, you simply head out the door without your phone and the watch will connect to LTE. You can not use it for streaming music or similar, but you can make and take calls, send texts and generally keep in touch with your family and friends.View image in fullscreenHere are what messages look like on the watch and the recipient’s Garmin Messenger app, including texts, reactions, voice messages and transcriptions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWhen you text someone, Garmin sends them an SMS from a random phone number, which they can reply to back to your watch. If they install theGarmin Messenger app, you can then message back and forth via text or voice messages, and make voice calls. Your recipient does not need a Garmin account to use the Messenger app, just a phone number is sufficient to register for texts.Messaging on the watch works fine but typing out texts on the tiny on-screen keyboard is slow. It has a set of customisable canned responses you can send to speed things up. Voice messages and calls work OK, though as with most smartwatches, you’re not going to want to use it for extended conversations as the quality is not fantastic.LiveTrack is the most useful feature. You can configure it to automatically send a link to chosen contacts every time you start an activity, so they can follow your real time location on a map. It’s great for following race progress, but it mostly serves as a tool for someone you trust to know your whereabouts in case something happens. It has generally worked well, though the real location has sometimes lagged when moving in and out of good LTE signal.View image in fullscreenSending satellite messages requires that you point your watch in the right direction and face it to an unobstructed view of the sky.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll of these features are available on other Garmin watches if you carry your phone with you, but in the places where LTE does not reach, the satellite kicks in on the Fenix 8 Pro to send texts, location check-ins and emergency SOS.A guide shows you how to find the line of sight to the satellite, which then sends and receives messages within about 10 to 30 seconds. It was surprisingly easy to use and could be a crucial lifeline, though it is important to note thatsatellite coverage is restrictedto the US mainland, most of Canada, and most of Europe except for parts of Scandinavia above 65 degrees north.SustainabilityThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via the support site. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Fenix 8 Pro costs from£1,029.99(€1,199.99/$1,199.99/A$2,299). The optional Garmin inReach subscription plans cost begins from£7.99(€9.99/$7.99/A$13.50).VerdictThe Fenix 8 Pro takes a fantastic adventure watch in the regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE for messaging, calls and LiveTrack – plus satellite messaging, check-in and emergency SOS for when you’re out of signal.The result is an even more impressive adventure tool for those that want to be phone-free. If you want to have someone keep an eye on you remotely while running out at night or in the middle of nowhere, the Garmin does so without needing anything else.It is quite freeing to be outside without a phone, but that capability comes at quite a cost, both in terms of the colossal price of the watch and the monthly subscription of the inReach plan to provide the service. At least it isn’t dependent on your phone provider so works with any brand of smartphone and network.The Fenix 8 Pro is a killer device for someone who hates being weighed down by their phone when running, cycling or hiking, but still wants to be trackable and contactable. For everyone else, it is a lot of money when the excellent Fenix 8 already exists.Pros:LTE and satellite messaging, super-bright OLED screen, tracks everything with best-in-class GPS, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, 8+ day battery life, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping and routes, offline Spotify, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre diving, buttons and touch.Cons:extremely expensive, LTE and satellite features need monthly subscription, limited Garmin Pay bank support, voice features are slow, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches.Explore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

There was no choice but to get home ...Emine SanerTue 21 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 04.52 EDTShareAs Jean Muenchrath stood at the summit of Mount Whitney, a storm thundered in. It was May 1982, and here, at the highest point of the contiguous US, she and her boyfriend Ken were coming to the end of a month-long ski and hike, 223 miles along the John Muir Trail, through the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.The trip had been gruelling at times – equipment had broken and they had been threatened by bears and avalanches. But it had also been exhilarating. At 22, Muenchrath was fit, strong and an experienced hiker. She had skied since she was a child and worked as a ranger for the US national park service in Montana; she and Ken, who she had met at university, had been on many smaller adventures while preparing for this one.To avoid the worst of the storm, they swapped their planned route for a different one down the mountain. It was steep, and in order to descend they had to hang on to their ice axes, blades dug deep into the snow. Ken soon lost control and tumbled 800ft. But Muenchrath didn’t have the luxury of reacting. She had to focus on her own descent, trying to ignore her terror that she would find Ken’s broken body below.View image in fullscreenJean Muenchrath and Ken preparing for the trip in 1982.Photograph: Courtesy of Jean MuenchrathMiraculously, when she reached him, he had survived virtually uninjured. His backpack had come off when he fell, and he climbed down a rocky section to the ledge where it was resting, to retrieve their rope. Muenchrath remembers standing there, exhausted, the light waning, wondering whether she really needed to wait for the rope before continuing her descent. Ken had reached the ledge easily enough and she thought she could do the same. The skis tied to the sides of her backpack were a hazard, so she threw them down the mountain, then took off her mittens so she could grip the rock more easily.It wasn’t long before she realised how difficult it was going to be. Ken had climbed down unhindered. Muenchrath was wearing a backpack weighing nearly 15kg and large leather ski boots that made it difficult to hang on to the minuscule holds. She was cold and hungry, and traumatised from seeing Ken fall; she hadn’t taken into account how much shorter than him she was. She couldn’t reach the holds he had used. Unable to go back up the way she came, or continue down, she was stuck. Her limbs shook from the effort, until she couldn’t hang on any longer.“I was feeling really desperate,” she says. “I remember that last thought in my head was, God, don’t let me fall.”Before she lost consciousness she heard her head pounding against the rocks. Ken watched her tumble down the rock face, her ice axe scraping on granite, sending sparks firing into the fading light.“My world went dark the minute I fell,” she says. “I didn’t feel any pain, I didn’t feel my body hitting the rocks, I just heard the sound. There was no life flashing, it was just this blank.”When she awoke, Ken was dragging her through the snow. She knew she had to get up and walk, but kept collapsing – she thinks they covered around half a mile before Ken could find a suitable place to camp.View image in fullscreenMuenchrath on a Sierra Nevada mountain pass shortly before she fell.Photograph: Courtesy of Jean Muenchrath“I knew I was really injured,” she says, as we speak over Zoom, from her home in Colorado. At 65, she is warm, fresh-faced, and quick to laugh, even while talking about this extreme experience. After the fall, blood poured from wounds on her head and buttock, and, among her many injuries, she had fractured her spine in several places and broken her pelvis. She also had internal bleeding. “I was bleeding on my head, and I was weak. I hurt, but there was no focus on that. It was this disorienting period of trying to keep myself upright as best I could.”The sun was going down as they set up camp. “It had been really stormy. I looked out and this shaft of golden light, the last light of the day, came through the clouds and lit up Mount Russell. I remember thinking, ‘This is the last thing I might see before I die.’”That night in the tent, Muenchrath suddenly felt awake. “I had what I call my visit from death, almost like an entity.” She sensed a heavy shadow hovering above her body, not menacing but peaceful. “Now, with the passage of time, I kind of perceive that I was experiencing the life force of my body starting to leave, and that’s when I made a vow that if I lived until morning, I would live my greatest dreams.” For her, this meant visiting the Himalayas. “For some reason, I thought, ‘Make it to morning, and everything will be OK,’ but clearly I needed to make it for another week.”Muenchrath had nicknamed their tent “the coffin” – because of its shape and size, they had to crawl to get in to it. The name now took on a grim irony. “It was very confining, and also very dark, because it was snowing so hard. The tent was getting weighed down with snow.” Muenchrath was in intense pain, but there was no space to move or change positions. She repeated to herself over and over: “I’m going to live.”They remained in the tent for two full days and three nights, while the storm raged outside and they decided what to do. It was too risky for Ken to leave Muenchrath on the mountain alone to seek help. They had to make it down together, carrying their equipment, because they wouldn’t be able to reach safety in a single day.It seemed impossible, but Muenchrath was desperate to leave. “When we packed up to start our journey out, I didn’t look back at the camp. I did not want to see that place. I wanted only to look forward.”View image in fullscreen‘Ken and I never talked about what happened. I was only able to move forward after we divorced’ … Muenchrath in Colorado.Photograph: Rebecca Stumpf/The GuardianShe was weak, injured and could barely move, and she would need to cover a rocky and snowy mountain pass, a 4,800ft canyon and hazards including fast-moving meltwater and thick vegetation as they got to lower altitudes. It must have seemed unthinkable. “Well, yeah, and I’m carrying 15kg [her backpack] on my broken spine and pelvis, and I’ve got gangrene now in my butt because of the injury.” She gives a small laugh. “It was daunting, but if I didn’t think too much about the distance we had to cover, or how rugged it was – and it’s still winter at the higher altitudes – it was just one step at a time. Sometimes, it was collapse, and then a step. We were going to die if we didn’t try – and if I was going to die, I was going to die making every effort to live.”Patches of snow had melted, creating holes that were hidden until she stepped on them. They caused her to fall, pain jolting through her broken body. At one point, she crawled across the snowpack to give her back a break.The worst part was traversing a huge glacial trough, where the snow was thigh-deep. She had to haul each foot up, ignoring the pain in her pelvis and back, before planting it again in the deep snow. “That was excruciatingly painful, and you knew you were going to do it again and again. I remember praying a lot. I would just visualise the Himalayas, like, ‘This is why you’re going through this – you’re going to see these mountains.’”Years later, when I began to experience chronic pain, I sometimes wished I hadn’t survivedIt was frightening as well as agonising. “I knew my back was broken, although I didn’t know all the details, and I was really afraid of severing my spinal cord and being paralysed, then freezing to death in a hole in the snow.”Exhausted, they camped that night. The following day, they finally hit a trail. By then, she says, “I was collapsing left and right, literally planting my face in the dirt and then I’d get up. I was walking like a staggering drunk because I was so weak. Ken had taken my backpack at that point. I would think, ‘I’m so close, but I’m just not sure I can make it. I could just die right here.’ But every time that thought popped into my head, I balanced it with, ‘You’ve got to go see the Himalayas. Get your butt up and get walking.’”Ken carried her the final stretch to a car park at the end of the trail. When they arrived, knowing they were close to help, the pain hit her. “I think there was some degree of suppressing it mentally, which I hadn’t realised.” She burst into tears for the first time since the fall five days earlier. She hadn’t let herself cry until then, “because it would have been so overwhelming – I think I would have just died, or couldn’t have made it.”View image in fullscreenMuenchrath in Nepal in 1986, at Mount Everest.Photograph: Courtesy of Jean MuenchrathMuenchrath was still in danger: she had lost a lot of blood, was exhausted and in shock. Ken flagged down a man who took them to hospital, where she was told her spine was broken in several places, her tailbone shattered, and she had fractures to her pubic bone and hip. She had to have the gangrene in her buttock removed, and her bladder had been damaged so she needed a catheter to pass urine.Muenchrath spent the next few months recovering in bed at her mother’s house. Her doctors had told her she probably wouldn’t hike again, which only fired her determination to do so. Within a couple of years, she was almost back to normal and was hiking and skiing with Ken again. When he was offered a job as a park ranger in Colorado, they moved there and got married – and Muenchrath also went on to work as a park ranger.They never talked about what had happened on the mountain, and Ken urged her not to tell anyone else. “I never understood why that was,” says Muenchrath. “Maybe he felt guilty, which he didn’t need to. I’m the one who made the poor choice. Or maybe he was embarrassed.” They were together for more than 25 years, and had many other adventures before they separated in 2003, but the silence around the accident became a “sticking point”. “I really shouldn’t have put up with that, and I do think it held me up in my healing. I think that’s why I was able to move forward more after we had divorced.” Ken died in 2013.Only two years after the fall, Muenchrath did see the Himalayas – armed with disposable catheters (her bladder was still damaged) to see her through the seven-week trek. Then she started running guided tours in Nepal.View image in fullscreenMuenchrath with Ken’s recovered ski on Mount Whitney in Sierra Nevada.Photograph: Courtesy of Jean MuenchrathBy the late 1990s, she was experiencing chronic pain as a result of her injuries, and her body and life seemed to be falling apart. For the next couple of decades, the pain came and went – sometimes she was unable to hobble even a few feet, and was confined to bed for months. “It was a big struggle,” she says. “I did have times where I would just crawl up in bed and bawl, and feel very hopeless, and there were times I even thought I wish maybe I hadn’t survived.”Just as she had kept herself going when she was in that tent on the mountain, Muenchrath trained her mind. On her trips to Nepal, she became interested in Buddhism. She decided to turn those months in bed “into a meditation retreat, and that’s what I did. I did a lot of mantras, a lot of visualisations, I did a lot of compassion practice and thinking about others who were in worse circumstances than myself, because you think it’s all about you, but it’s not. I would think about the things I wanted to do so I could have some hope that I could get past this.” Friends helped, she says. “I learned to draw on Mount Whitney as a source of strength – you got through the worst, you can get through this next thing.”She developed her own stretching and exercise routines, and was lucky to find sympathetic doctors who understood her pain. She also began to have counselling, and her therapist encouraged her to write a book, which she titled If I Live Until Morning (2017), “which was very healing, because I had to really process it all”.In 2013, Muenchrath went back to Mount Whitney with her partner, Paul, and a friend, Jonathan, who were both keen climbers. The trip lasted several days. While she wanted to find her abandoned skis, she was also “going back to face the demon”. When she found the place where she and Ken had set up their emergency camp, Jonathan spotted a ski less than 100m away. Not hers, she realised, but Ken’s. “I went over to pick up this ski. That’s when I lost it, because I’m holding Ken’s ski, it’s broken, I’m looking up at the cliffs and standing on the campsite where I should have died, and I felt like the past and the present just collided. I felt everything rushing up, like I was going to choke on emotion, crying and screaming with rage and sadness, but I felt like I was letting it all out. It was really wonderful.”As she stood there, she realised, “I really hadn’t forgiven myself. There was a lot of self-hatred that I made a bad decision. I’ve suffered as a result for decades, but I realised you have to forgive yourself and own it and move on.” She also recognised she could be proud of surviving something so brutal. “I was like: you really pulled this off, even though it was nearly impossible. You did it.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow we surviveSkiingWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Should I be worried?DiagnosisThose circular brown patches are a classic sign of corking. This is a natural process in many cacti, which causes the lower stem to gradually harden and turn brown, like the bark on a tree. It usually starts at the base and slowly works its way up as the plant matures. While the rough texture can look alarming, it doesn’t harm the plant. However, because corking can be confused with a fungal infection or pests such as scale insects, it’s worth a closer look. Scale insects will appear as raised, uniform bumps that can be scraped off, whereas corking is part of the stem tissue itself and cannot be removed.Houseplant clinic: what are the brown lumps on my fern?Read morePrescriptionIf the patches are firm and part of the stem, no treatment is required; it’s simply a sign of maturity. Continue caring for your cactus as usual with bright light, well-draining soil and cautious watering.PreventionCorking can’t be prevented as it’s part of the natural lifecycle of cacti. As long as there’s healthy growth at the tips, don’t worry. The contrast between the corky base and green growth will become part of the plant’s character over time.Got a plant dilemma?

An estimated £1.4 billion to £2.2 billion is lost every year from women leaving the industry, with “another £640 million to £1.3 billion squandered from the churn of women switching employers for a new tech role”, the report added.Today, only about 20% of UK tech workers are women, and the report looked at “why women in UK tech aren’t progressing — or staying — at the pace they should”.It found that 25% say they leave due to a lack of career advancement; 17% because of inadequate recognition, and 15% due to pay inequity.Are you awoman working in techin the UK?

He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.The judge in Uribe’s original trial said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three imprisoned former paramilitary members into changing testimony they had provided to Iván Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe’s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The whales have showna trend of slow population growthover the past four years and have gained more than 7% of their 2020 population, the consortium said.It’s a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships andentanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.Jem Cresswell’s striking whale images – in picturesRead moreThe whale’s trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. The center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) collaborate to calculate the population estimate.New management measures in Canada that attempt to keep the whales safe amid their increased presence in the Gulf of St Lawrence have been especially important, Hamilton said.“We know that a modest increase every year, if we can sustain it, will lead to population growth,” Hamilton said. “It’s just whether or not we can sustain it.”Scientists have cautioned in recent years that the whale’s slow recovery is happening at a time when the giant animals still face threats, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said.The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whales because they are not producing enough offspring to sustain their population.However, this year four mother whales had calves for the first time, Hamilton said. And some other established mother whales had shorter intervals between calves, he said.In total, 11 calves were born, which is less than researchers had hoped for, but the entry of new females into the reproductive pool is encouraging, Hamilton said.And any number of calves is helpful in a year of no mortalities, said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at Cabot Center and chairs the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium.“The slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,” Pettis said. ”What we’ve seen before is this population can turn on a dime.”The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food.Environmental groups warned on Tuesday that the whales were stillon the brink of extinctionand need more aggressive protection to fully recover.“Continued attacks on the Marine Mammal Protection Act and efforts to weaken Noaa’s science-based safeguards put this fragile population at even greater risk. We need Congress to uphold, not undermine, the laws, programs and experts that give North Atlantic right whales a fighting chance for continued survival,” said Gib Brogan, senior campaign director with Oceana.Explore more on these topicsWhalesCetaceansMarine lifeWildlifeConservationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Bloc Québécois holds 22 seats.The vote was initially marred by confusion, when Auguste was projected to emerge as the winner after final tallies showed her ahead by 35 votes. But an official validation process on 1 May instead found that Sinclair-Desgagné, first elected in 2021, finished ahead by 44 votes.Under election law, a judicial recount is triggered automatically when the number of votes separating the winner and any other candidate is less than 0.1% of the valid votes cast. The recount, completed on Saturday, was overseen by aQuebeccourt judge.The win was returned to Auguste, with the Liberal candidate receiving 23,352 votes and Sinclair-Desgagné receiving 23,351.Within days, however, Terrebonne resident Emmanuelle Bossé said her vote was not included in the final count. Bossé said she voted for Sinclair-Desgagné but her mailed ballot was returned to her due to a postal code error.“I wasn’t the one who got Elections Canada’s address wrong on the envelope,” she told CBC’s Radio-Canada. “ElectionsCanadaglued this label on the envelope. I had nothing to fill. I just had to put my vote in there.” Bossé mailed her ballot on 5 April and it was returned to her nearly a month later on 2 May.Sinclair-Desgagné’s lawyer, Stéphane Chatigny, said in court that Bossé’s Charter rights were violated because her ballot was not counted and that upholding the election result would “send a disastrous message to voters that even Elections Canada … can make mistakes, but that there will be no consequences despite the decisive impact on the outcome of the election”.“By refusing to cancel the election, the court would send the message that some votes count more than others,” said Chatigny. “Such an outcome would permanently undermine public confidence.”At the heading, Justice Éric Dufour raised a 2012 supreme court of Canada decision, Opitz v Wrzesnewskyj, which found simple clerical errors were not enough to annul the election. Instead, the court found there must be proof that the number of ineligible votes could have changed the outcome in order to justify voiding an election result and calling a new vote.Explore more on these topicsCanadaQuebecAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The attack also killed two crew members.Asked why the two survivors were not taken to the United States to be prosecuted, JD Vance told reporters that “so long as they’re not bringing poison into our country”, he did not “really care” what happens to them.Daniel Noboa, Ecuador’s president, said in a post on X on Monday, tagging Trump’s account, that his government was determined to fight drug trafficking.“Ecuador stands firm in the global fight against drug trafficking and illegal mining, challenges that demand unity among nations committed to peace and prosperity,” Noboa said.Ecuador, once considered one of Latin America’s safest nations, has seen a dramatic surge in violence in recent years.Strategically located between Colombia and Peru, two of the world’s largest cocaine producers, it has become a major transit hub for narcotics.Some regional leaders, like Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s president, have harshly criticized the US attacks.In a post on X, Petro said the US operation was part of a “failed strategy” to “control Latin America … and obtain cheap oil from Venezuela”.Last month, Washington announced it had decertified Colombia as an ally in the fight against drugs. Colombia hit back by halting arms purchases from the United States, its biggest military partner.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorCaribbeanUS immigrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts say the agency’s central role means much of the evidence used to select which alleged smugglers to kill on the open sea will almost certainly remain secret.The agency’s central role in the boat strikes has not previously been disclosed. Donald Trumpconfirmedlast Wednesday that he had authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela, but not what the agency would be doing.The sources say theCIAis providing real-time intelligence collected by satellites and signal intercepts to detect which boats it believes are loaded with drugs, tracking their routes and making the recommendations about which vessels should be hit by missiles.“They are the most important part of it,” said one of the sources. Two sources said that the drones or other aircraft actually launching the missiles used to sink the boats belonged to theUS military, not the CIA.CIA historian Tim Weiner: ‘Trump has put national security in the hands of crackpots and fools’Read moreInformation the agency gathers against any of the alleged smugglers – dead or alive – is likely to remain classified and out of public view. That is in spite of the worldwide public interest and debate over the killing of civilians.The agency’s intelligence, unlike information gathered by the DEA or the US Coast Guard, which used to handle maritime interdiction operations against smugglers, is not designed as legal evidence.“We do not produce evidence,” Mark Lowenthal, a former assistant director for analysis for the CIA, said. “We have intelligence. It is not the same thing as evidence. It’s a different milieu. Sometimes it’s cold hard fact and sometimes lots less.” He emphasized he is speaking generally based on his past experience and has no independent information about the current boat strikes or intelligence.CIA intelligence is not designed for disclosure, in court or in public hearings – it is designed to “never see the inside of a courtroom”, one source said, because theCIA goes to great lengths to protect its sources and methods.Lowenthal said he believed it was unlikely the CIA intel on drug boat targets could ever be released. “They are going to claim it’s classified and they are not going to release it publicly. And they may be right. They have all sorts of exemptions in law.”So far, the only information released has been snippets of grainy video of boats exploding, posted online by Trump or the Pentagon.A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment on this story and referred any other questions to the Pentagon.A spokesperson for the US southern command, which oversees military operations in the Caribbean, referred questions to the White House. Pentagon head Pete Hegsethpostedon X on Thursday that the commander of southern command was stepping down.A Pentagon spokesperson said: “Due to operational security, we do not talk about matters of intelligence.”In response to questions from the Guardian, Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, said: “All of these decisive strikes have been against designated narcoterrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores, and the president will continue to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since then, the administration has publicly announced sixmore without ever disclosing details about the targets other than the number of people killed, and the allegation that the boats carried narcotics.Several sources say CIA officials have been trying to play a more central role in the foreign policy objectives of theTrump administrationin the hemisphere. While the agency has long had a counternarcotics effort, the sources say it is beefing up that capability to maintain relevance.The White House also hasn’t disclosed details of any legal basis for strikes against civilian targets. Experts in international humanitarian law say it’s a violation to use deadly force against civilians who aren’t engaged in a war, whether or not they are suspected of smuggling drugs.Harold Koh, a professor of international law at Yale who worked in the Obama-era state department and defended the 2010 lethal strike in Yemen against American Anwar Al Awlaki, said last monththat theCaribbeanstrikes were illegal. “There is no authority for the president to commit summary execution on the high seas,” he said, “especially when there is a capture option which they have been using until now.”Hugo Lowell contributed reportingQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But hours after she was elected by MPs, it was evident that femaleunder representationin the country’s political establishment would continue when she appointed just two women to her cabinet.Takaichi had promised levels of female representation in her government comparable to those in Iceland, Finland and Norway.Satsuki Katayama, who became the first woman to hold the post of finance minister, was joined by Kimi Onoda as economic security minister in Takaichi’s 19-member cabinet.Six of Iceland’s 11 cabinet members are women, including the prime minister, Kristrún Frostadóttir, and in Finland women occupy 11 of 19 cabinet posts.Takaichi’s immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, appointed two women to his cabinet but the record is five, under Ishiba’s predecessor Fumio Kishida.Takaichi, an ultra-conservative whose Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has formed a coalition with a minor party that shares her hawkish approach to defence and revisionist views on wartime history, has said she wants to raise awareness of women’s health and has spoken about her own experience ofmenopause.Sanae Takaichi: Japan’s first female PM, who cites Thatcher as an influenceRead moreBut like her political heroMargaret Thatcher, Takaichi will be guided by the social conservatism that made her the popular choice among MPs and rank-and-file members on the right of the LDP when sheran for the party leadershipthis month.She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples touse the same surname, arguing that allowing women to retain their maiden names would chip away at traditional family values.She also opposes calls for changes to succession laws to allow female members of the imperial household – which has few male heirs –to become reigning empresses. She has spoken out against discrimination towards members of the LGBTQ+ community, butopposes same-sex marriage.“The prospect of a first female prime minister doesn’t make me happy,” the sociologist Chizuko Ueno said in a post on X. Takaichi’s leadership would elevate Japan’s gender equality ranking, Ueno said, but added “that doesn’t mean Japanese politics will become kinder to women”.Others were optimistic that Takaichi’s appointment would lower the psychological barriers to women entering public life. “There is great significance in Takaichi becoming prime minister, with a broader impact on society,” Naomi Koshi, who became Japan’s youngest female mayor in 2012 aged 36, told the Kyodo news agency.Takaichi had a comparatively small pool of female MPs from which to appoint her cabinet. Even though a record 73 women were elected in last year’s lower house elections, they still comprise only 15.7% of the chamber’s 465 MPs.According to the World Economic Forum’s 2025 gender gap index, Japan ranked 118th out of 148 countries.Agencies contributed reporting.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificWomennewsShareReuse this content"

But Katayama is one of only two women in the cabinet, despite Takaichi’s vow last month to make the gender balance among ministers “comparable to those of Nordic countries”. She also appointed two of her rivals in the LDP leadership race, Toshimitsu Motegi and Shinjirō Koizumi, as foreign and defence ministers.But with the LDP and Ishin still two seats shy of a majority, she will have to resume the search for support from non-coalition MPs to pass budgets and other legislation – another sign, according to some analysts, of her precarious hold on power.“The era of LDP domination is over and we are entering the era of multiparty politics,” said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.Masato Kamikubo, a professor at Ritsumeikan University, said Takaichi would be overly constrained by the transactional nature of her coalition. “There is no room for Takaichi to show her true colours. All she can do is [seek] cooperation on each policy. It’s a pathetic situation.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

The plans would seek to send people whose asylum claims had been turned down to foreign detention centres once they had exhausted all avenues of appeal.His comments come in advance of a summit of western Balkans leaders to be held on Wednesday in London by Keir Starmer.Kurti said: “We want to help the UK. We consider that that is our friendly and political duty. We have limited capacity but still we want to help and as we speak there is regular communication between our teams of state officials from our ministry of internal affairs and lawyers about how to do this smoothly for mutual benefit.”Border failings in Europe are eroding trust in nation states, warns MahmoodRead moreHe said, in return, Kosovo would like “mainly to get support in security – be that through strategic agreements or through equipment and projects we might do”.“Of course, we want, as a country, to benefit, but we consider it first and foremost our obligation to help you because you helped us a great deal and we will never forget that,” he added.Kosovo remains a relative outlier compared to its Balkan neighbours. In June, Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, said the idea of the UK wanting to “look for places to dump immigrants” would have been inconceivable pre-Brexit.“The fact that today it’s not just imaginable, it’s happening, is not because of Keir Starmer or [Rishi] Sunak doing something outrageous; it’s because of the country being in a very dark place,” said Rama.He went on to say that “80% of the things that are said or are written or are accepted as a normal part of the discourse in today’s Britain are things that [before Brexit] would have been totally unacceptable, totally ridiculous, totally shameful”.Željko Komšić, the chairman of the presidency ofBosnia and Herzegovina, told the Times that his country was not open to accepting people from the UK. Milojko Spajić, Montenegro’s prime minister, said his country was open to negotiating a return hub agreement but only on the condition that Britain invested significantly in its infrastructure.In comments made to the Sun on Tuesday night, Starmer said Wednesday’s summit was part of an effort to shut down a “criminal highway leading through the western Balkans”.Badenoch says Tories open to quitting more treaties to increase deportationsRead moreHe said we could be “bringing the region together in a joint migration taskforce” to “detect, deter and manage illegal migration”. As part of this, Starmer said the UK would be “deploying British drones and scanners at key checkpoints”.“Working with partners in the western Balkans, we have already cut the number of irregular border crossings through the region by almost 50%. And we will go further – because we will only win this fight by working together with our neighbours.“That is a lesson some are yet to learn. Instead of throwing insults around at countries like Albania, we have worked with them – succeeding in cutting small boat arrivals from Albania by 95% in a year. We’re taking that approach with other countries in the western Balkans, too,” he said.The government announced plans for “return hubs” for people who have their asylum claims rejected in May. If established, the return hubs will be used to process asylum seekers who have lost their paperwork or who are considered to be trying to frustrate their deportation.The plans have drawn scorn from refugee charities. When “return hubs” were first announced, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Threatening to detain people in countries they’ve never set foot in causes fear and panic, leading to low rates of compliance.“The government’s approach to returns must be based on evidence if it’s going to work and it is clear that the most effective returns systems are not punitive but orderly and humane.”Explore more on these topicsRefugeesKosovoAlbaniaBosnia and HerzegovinaMontenegroEuropeImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Contrary to some reports, it said, the display cases protecting the stolen Napoleonic jewellery had been installed in 2019 and “represented a considerable improvement in terms of security”.Paris prosecutors have charged a specialised unit known as the BRB with investigating the crime. The 100-strong force deals with high-profile robberies such as the armed holdup of the reality TV star Kim Kardashian in a Paris hotel in 2016.Investigators from the Central Office for the Fight against Trafficking in Cultural Property are also expected to be involved.It is not known how, where or whether the jewels will resurface. Beccuau told RTL: “The wrongdoers who took these gems won’t earn €88m if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels. We can perhaps hope that they’ll think about this and won’t destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.″skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those at private museums in Paris, such as the Louis Vuitton Foundation or Pinault Collection, are usually covered by private insurance, a government spokesperson said on Tuesday that in the case of the Louvre “the state acts as its own insurer”.This took into account the immensely high cost of insurance “when the claims rate is low”, the spokesperson said in comments first reported by the newspaper Le Parisien.At least four French museums have been robbed in the last two months, according to French media reports, including theAdrien Dubouché National Museumin Limoges, where two Chinese trays and a vase classified as “historical treasures” were stolen overnight in September.In separate case, a prosecutor announced on Tuesday that a Chinese woman had been arrested and charged over the theft of gold worth more than $1m (£750,000) from Paris’ Natural History Museum on 16 September.The 24-year-old was arrested in Barcelona on 30 September and handed over to French authorities on 13 October, Beccuau said.Explore more on these topicsParisFranceMuseumsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, he organised a highly stage-managed departure from his home in the west of the capital where he walked with his wife, Carla Bruni, to greet dozens of supporters in the street outside.First his children, led by Giulia, his 14-year-old daughter with Bruni, walked slowly from his home to greet well-wishers. Louis Sarkozy, one of Sarkozy’s sons, who is preparing to run for mayor in Menton on the French Riviera next spring, had called for supporters to demonstrate in the street. Some shouted “Free Nicolas!” and carried framed photos. At the same time, Sarkozy’s social media account published a message in which he said “I am innocent”, and that his imprisonment was a “judicial scandal”.Sarkozy, 70, hugged his wife in front of TV cameras and supporters, then was driven, accompanied by his lawyers, to La Santé. His car entered via a gate to avoid photographers seeing him on foot. As the doors of the jail closed, reporters outside heard some of the prisoners whistle. One shouted: “Sarkozy’s here.” Another shouted: “Welcome Sarkozy!”View image in fullscreenSarkozy embraces his wife before he steps into the car that will transport him to prison.Photograph: Remon Haazen/Getty ImagesSarkozy wasfound guilty last month of criminal conspiracyover a scheme to seek funding from Gaddafi’s regime for his victorious 2007 French presidential election campaign. The lead judge, Nathalie Gavarino, justified the five-year prison sentence by saying the facts of the case were of an “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.Sarkozy’s lawyers filed a motion for his release as soon as he entered the jail, and the appeals court has two months to examine the request. In such cases, the court can order a release under judicial supervision or home arrest with an ankle tag. The court could also decide against letting out a prisoner if, for example, it deems this the only way to prevent evidence-tampering or witness intimidation.During the three-month trial, the public prosecutor had told the court that Sarkozy entered into a “Faustian pact of corruption with one of the most unspeakable dictators of the last 30 years” to gain election funding from Gaddafi.Sarkozy was acquitted of three separate charges of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding.At his trial, Sarkozy denied wrongdoing and said he was not part of a criminal conspiracy to seek election funding from Libya. He has appealed against his conviction. A new trial is expected in about six months, but the nature of Sarkozy’s prison sentence means he must go to jail as his appeal process plays out.Sarkozy had packed family photos and three books, including a biography of Jesus as well as The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas’s novel in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge. He said he would use his time in prison to write a book.He is expected to be held in solitary confinement for his own security, in an individual cell of about 9 sq metres with his own shower and toilet. He will have no mobile phone but will have a small television. A security-controlled phone line will allow him contact with his lawyers and family. He is expected to have the right to two visits a week from family. He told Le Figaro that he had been advised to take earplugs. “At night you hear lots of noise, shouting, screaming,” he said.Sarkozy is the first French leader to be incarcerated since Philippe Pétain, the head of France’s Nazi collaborationist Vichy regime, who was jailed after the second world war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the well-wishers who gathered outside his home on Tuesday sang the national anthem as he left for La Santé. Priya Martin, 62, told AFP: “It was really important for us to be here, even if we don’t get to see him. What’s important is that he sees the rally before he goes to prison.”Emmanuel Macron welcomed Sarkozy to the Élysée Palace on Friday. “It was normal, on a human level, for me to receive one of my predecessors in this context,” Macron told reporters.Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialist party, criticised Macron for the invite. “This is a pressure on the justice system. It’s giving the feeling that there are some accused who are by nature different to others,” he said.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, a political protege of Sarkozy, said he would visit Sarkozy in prison in his ministerial role.Some notorious inmates have spent time at La Santé, including the Venezuelan militant Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, also known as Carlos the Jackal, who has since been moved.More recently, the French model agent Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was found dead in his cell at La Santé in 2022. He had been charged with the rape of minors.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyFranceParisEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Partially closed for renovation in 2014, the prison reopened five years later and houses more than 1,100 inmates.Famous former detainees include the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, therogue trader Jérôme Kerviel, the civil servant andNazi collaborator Maurice Papon, the businessman and politicianBernard Tapie, the 70s terroristCarlos the Jackal, and model agentJean-Luc Brunel.Prominent or at-risk prisoners are generally held in the jail’s QB4 ward for “vulnerable people” – the so-called “VIP quarters” – in single cells, not the usual three-person units, and kept alone during outdoor activities for security reasons.Located on the first floor, the ward has 19 identical cells and a dedicated exercise yard so inmates are not obliged to mingle with other prisoners – although they remain subject to whistles, jeers and smartphone photos from nearby cells.View image in fullscreenA Sarkozy supporter outside La Santé prison, the last remaining prison inside the Paris city limits.Photograph: Jeanne Accorsini/Sipa/ShutterstockMainly for that reason, Sarkozy will reportedly be held in the isolation ward, which is in a separate wing. In reality, conditions are much the same as in QB4: the former president will be alone in his cell and accompanied by a guard whenever he leaves it.“The goal is to avoid any incidents whatsoever, so we must prevent him from meeting any inmates,” a prison sourcetold Le Monde. “The simplest and most effective solution is to send Nicolas Sarkozy directly to solitary confinement.”Both isolation and VIP cells are identical to those elsewhere in the jail, averaging about 10 sq metres, with window coverings designed to limit communication, a bed, a small desk, a shower, toilet, and landline telephone with pre-recorded numbers.View image in fullscreenCells inside La Santé prison.Photograph: François Mori/APSarkozy will be served regular meals but will also have access to the canteen, where he can buy food to prepare himself, as well as to a small solitary exercise yard, a gym and the library. He can rent a fridge for €7.50 (£6.50) a month and a TV for €14.15.Apart from three permitted visits a week, he will mostly be on his own – a luxury in La Santé, which despite its recent renovation is operating at about double its intended capacity of 657 inmates. France’s jails are the third most overcrowded in the EU.Sarkozy, who has consistently protested his innocence, has said he will be taking with him a biography of Jesus and a copy of The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas, in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge.Sarkozy’s lawyer, Jean-Michel Darrois, said he was also taking earplugs because prison can be noisy at night, and several sweaters, because cells can be cold. Sarkozy has said he is not scared of spending time in jail and plans to use it to write a book.It is unclear, however, how long he will actually stay in La Santé: his lawyers have already filed for his early release, and an appeals judge will have to prove a risk of flight, reoffending of witness-tampering to justify his continued detention.French legal experts have suggested he could be out within a month.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said the UK would play an “anchor role”. Ten days ago the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper,said the UK had “no plans” to send soldiers to Gaza.The commander will work as a deputy in the American-led civil military coordination centre in Israel. It is also expected to include troops from Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.Healey told business leaders: “We can contribute to monitoring the ceasefire, but that’s likely to be led by others.“We’ve also, in response to the American request, we put a first-rate, two-star officer into the civilian and military command as a deputy commander. So, Britain will play an anchor role.”He said the UK would “contribute the specialist experience and skills where we can” without playing a leading role, adding: “We will play our part.”The Times reports that the force is not expected to enter Gaza and is understood to be separate to a plannedinternational stabilisation force, who will be given robust powers to control security inside Gaza if a European and US-backed UN security council motion passes.Gaza’s media office said Israel had violated the ceasefire 80 times and killed at least 80 Palestinian people since the agreement took effect. On Tuesday, the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani,condemnedIsrael’s “continued violation” of the ceasefire.On Sunday, Israel launched lethal airstrikes intoGazathat killed 26 Palestinians after two Israeli soldiers were killed in an attack the army blamed on Hamas. Hamas said it was not responsible because it had not had contact with fighters in the area since communications were cut off in March. The Israeli military later said it had resumed enforcing the ceasefire and both Israel and Hamas have said they are committed to the agreement.In an attempt to show faith in the agreement, the US vice-president, JD Vance,visited Israel on Tuesday, where he expressed “great optimism” for the truce, calling it “durable” and “going better than expected”.AMinistry of Defencespokesperson said: “A small number of UK planning officers have embedded in the US-led CMCC, civil military coordination centre, including a two-star deputy commander to ensure that the UK remains integrated into the US-led planning efforts for Gaza post-conflict stability.“The UK continues to work with international partners to support the Gaza ceasefire to see where the UK can best contribute to the peace process.”Explore more on these topicsMilitaryGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineMinistry of DefenceIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

In some areas, levels of PM2.5 and PM10 – the toxic particles causing pollution – recorded peaks of 1,800, which is 15 to 20 times higher than those deemed healthy.Since 2020, the sale and bursting of firecrackers had been banned in Delhi during Diwali, known as the festival of light, due to their contribution to the deadly smog that engulfs the city as winter sets in.View image in fullscreenPart of Delhi showed an air quality index (AQI) of more than 500, which is 10 times higher than the level deemed healthy by the WHO.Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP‘The air is killing us’: why Delhi’s pollution problem runs deeper than smog seasonRead moreHowever, earlier this year the newly elected regional Delhi government led by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the Hindu nationalist party which also governs at the national level, approached the supreme court to ask for the ban to be relaxed. They proposed that “green crackers” – which have been previously shunned by environmentalists as they are only about 30% less polluting – be allowed over Diwali celebrations as a balance between “tradition and environment”.Much to the frustration of environmental and health campaigners, judges complied with the BJP’s request, stipulating that the green firecrackers could be set off during stipulated time windows during Diwali.On Monday night, there was a widespread flouting of the time restrictions across the capital and little regulation on whether the firecrackers were the more environmentally friendly variety. Many recording stations in Delhi showed pollution peaking at around midnight to some of the worst levels during Diwali in at least three years.On Tuesday morning, the proliferation of firecrackers during Diwali set off a blame game with neighbouring Pakistan, with the Pakistani state of Punjab partly blaming the declining air quality in the city of Lahore on pollutants coming fromIndiaafter the celebrations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Around Diwali, the levels of dangerous particles in the air have been found to shoot up to 70% higher than the worst record of Beijing in China, which was once seen as the world’s most polluted city.The problem for Delhi is caused by a combination of heavy vehicle emissions, dust, construction, rubbish burning and smoke from fires in the neighbouring agricultural states of Punjab and Haryana, where farmers illegally set their fields on fire to clear them quickly. This toxic smog then gets trapped over the capital as the cool air sets in.The economic and health toll on the roughly 33 million people living in the Delhi area is enormous, according to numerous studies. It results in high levels of neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and can lead to cancer. The pollution is estimated to be responsible for 10,000 premature deaths a year in Delhi.Explore more on these topicsDelhiIndiaAir pollutionDiwaliPollutionSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It said 2,198 individuals were detained though it did not give their nationalities.Myanmaris notorious for hosting scam operations responsible for defrauding people all over the world.

The area is only loosely under the control of Myanmar’s military government, and also falls under the influence of ethnic minority militias.Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun, the spokesperson for the military government, on Monday night accused the top leaders of the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic organisation opposed to army rule, of being involved in the scam projects at KK Park.The allegation was previously made based on claims that a company backed by the Karen group allowed the land to be leased. However, the group, which is part of the larger armed resistance movement in Myanmar’s civil war, deny any involvement in the scams.Starlink is part ofElon Musk’sSpaceX company and the terminals link to its satellites. It does not have licensed operations in Myanmar, but hundreds of terminals have been smuggled into the South-east Asian nation.The company could not be immediately reached for comment Monday but its policy bans “conduct that is defamatory, fraudulent, obscene, or deceptive”.There have been previous crackdowns on cyberscam operations in Myanmar earlier this year and in 2023.Pressure from China saw Thailand and Myanmar launch an operation in February in which they released thousands of trafficked people from scam compounds, working with the ethnic armed groups that rule Myanmar’s border areas.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarScamsElon MuskSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

This was a mob intent on violence against gardai.”The disturbances flared a day after a man was charged in connection with an alleged sexual assault. Local media reported that he was a 26-year-old asylum seeker and that the alleged victim was a 10-year-old who was attacked at or near the Citywest facility, which is in the Saggart area of south-west Dublin.A small protest outside the facility passed peacefully on Monday but on Tuesday night a far larger crowd threw rocks and traffic cones. A police van was also torched.Police, some with riot shields, helmets and horses, pushed the crowd back.The justice and migration minister, Jim O’Callaghan, condemned the disturbances. “Unfortunately, the weaponising of a crime by people who wish to sow dissent in our society is not unexpected,” O’Callaghan said in a statement.“This is unacceptable and will result in a forceful response from the gardaí. Those involved will be brought to justice. Attacks on gardaí will not be tolerated. Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy. Violence is not.”The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, condemned the “violent disorder” and “vile abuse” against police in a statement.Demonstrations against immigrants and refugees have become common in recent years, with protesters accusing the arrivals of worsening a housing shortage and driving violent crime. Far-right agitators have used social media and rallies to spread a message that“Ireland is full”.Rioting erupted in central Dublin inNovember 2023after a man stabbed three children outside a primary school. In June crowdstargeted foreigners in Ballymena, inNorthern Ireland, after an alleged sexual assault. Protests outside asylum seeker hotels and centres alsospread across Englandthis summer.Earlier on Tuesday,Ireland’s child and family agency Tusla said the alleged victim of this week’s incident had been in state care at the time and that she had “absconded” during a trip to the city centre.Speaking in parliament, Martin acknowledged “the concern, anger and worry of many people” over the alleged assault. “Clearly, there has been failure here in terms of the state’s obligation to protect this child.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandRefugeesImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

It is traumatising. It is just frankly horrendous, and it’s been left in a mess. So we’re doing everything we can to make it far easier.“This law is saying we’re putting the needs of survivors above the needs of rapists,” she added. “My God, the fact that we’d ever even have to do that is ridiculous in 2025, but I’m thrilled that we are doing that.”After being elected last summer, Fleet took it upon herself to become a voice for survivors of rape, particularly those who had conceived children after being assaulted.“I just think it’s disgusting that we’ve got to the point where we’ve allowed children to be the only proceeds of crime that criminals can have lifelong access to,” she said.Fleet set out to achieve three things: to found a charity to support women who conceive children through rape, to have some acknowledgment of the issue on the NHS website, and to change the law.“When I initially came [to parliament], I didn’t want to achieve this, because rape is so normalised that I didn’t even realise it was part of my story,” she said.“It wasn’t until Westminster journalists started asking me about it and taking an interest in my background, in a way that hadn’t been taken at home, by health visitors, teachers – anybody really, because it was so normal, because my story is so normal in my constituency.”“As soon as I realised that rape was part of my story,” she said, she thought “oh my goodness, I’ve got to change this”.“I genuinely thought that the easiest thing would be to get it on the NHS website,” she said. “The second easiest thing would be to set up a charity. And the third and most difficult thing, that would take years and years and years of campaigning, would be to get the law changed.”Under the new reforms, restriction of parental responsibility will happen immediately after sentencing, removing the necessity to apply through the family court.In cases where it has not been established in criminal proceedings that the child was conceived by rape, crown courts will be mandated to refer the case to the relevant local authority, if the court considers this may be the case.The local authority will then have six months in which to obtain the consent of the mother for them to initiate family court proceedings.“These reforms mark a crucial step forward in restoring faith in our justice system,” David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, said. “Automatically restricting parental responsibility in cases of rape where it has led to the birth of a child and serious child sexual offences sends a clear message: the rights and safety of children come first.“This Government is committed to standing up for victims and ensuring that those who commit the most vile crimes against children are never in a position to cause further harm.”“These reforms will shield both mothers and children from the heinous actions of predatory parents as part of our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade,” Alex Davies-Jones, minister for victims and tackling Violence against women and girls, added.“I’m proud to support these amendments, which build on the tireless campaigning of Natalie Fleet MP, Baroness Harman and Jess Asato MP, who have been unwavering in their advocacy for the protection of children and women.”“I’m still pinching myself that we’ve got a government that took a normal person from an area like mine and brought me into government, and then said, you can use your platform to improve the lives of the women you represent,” Fleet said.“That’s absolutely incredible. That’s unreal. That’s amazing. And I am really, really, just really happy. It’s definitely the best day to be an MP, when you get something like this through.”In a separate move, the government has also said it will repeal a law under the Children Act 1989, which leads the family court to presume that contact with both parents is normally in the best interests of a child.The Ministry of Justice has said the change, which has been welcomed by domestic abuse campaigners, will be made “when parliamentary time allows.”Explore more on these topicsFamily lawViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

Defra recently announced it would beabolishing the much-criticised regulator Ofwatand merging its powers with that of the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency.The environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, said: “I share the public’s anger at the current state of our water system, and this government is taking decisive action.“I want to give the Environment Agency the teeth it needs to tackle all rule breaking. With new, automatic and tougher penalties for water companies, there will be swift consequences for offences – including not treating sewage to the required standard and maintenance failures.”The new policies are expected to cost the water sector between £50m and £67m annually, but the true cost could be lower if the penalties drive improvement in behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have to take comfort from that,” Throssell said.Dame Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner, described the announcement as “a pivotal moment” that will “ensure children are properly heard, protected and supported”, and allow courts to “make safer decisions”.“Every day I hear from survivors who have been failed by the family justice system – where many have been forced to watch as their children are silenced and decisions are taken that directly put them in harm’s way,” she said.“This announcement – which stems from the tireless campaigning by Claire Throssell and the wider domestic abuse sector – will ensure that the courts place the safety and wellbeing of children above all else.”Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie, chief executive of My CWA, said: “Many of us have been lobbying for this for years and years, the families that I work with are going to be thrilled.“Absolutely it makes sense that all parents should have to prove that they’re good enough parents and safe enough parents to have contact with the children, and moving the presumption out of that formula is going to mean that that’s what we’re looking for.“So, instead of only excluding absolutely the worst parents, we can be looking at what it means to be a good and a safe parent, and that’s going to make thousands of children safer. I’m thrilled to bits with it.”Proudman said: “I’ve represented rape victims who have been forced by family courts to take their child to spend regular time with their rapist, and if they refuse, they are at risk of going to prison or their child being handed over to their rapist.“This is abuse. I have been campaigning for more than five years for this groundbreaking legal change – no longer will abusive parents have an automatic presumption to see their child. This will keep children safe, and I honestly believe it will save lives.”Professor Shazia Choudhry, from the University of Oxford,whose research has focused on the experiences of female survivors of domestic abuse of the family court system, described the change as “an unequivocally positive step”.Domestic violence screening tool should be replaced, Jess Phillips saysRead more“A large body of research and survivor experience has demonstrated that this presumption has too often operated as a barrier for victims of domestic abuse, in proving that contact is not in the best interests of children who are themselves at risk,” she said.“Removing it will put safety, welfare and the child’s voice back at the centre of decisions, so contact is earned by behaviour, not assumed by law.”However, experts have cautioned that the change is not a panacea, and that it must be accompanied by proper training for judges in order to facilitate a cultural shift in the family courts.“I think it is really, really important that judges have mandatory training, because if judges don’t have mandatory training, we know that they don’t recognise domestic abuse,” Nazeer said.“Historically, the judiciary haven’t been open to being trained by specialist domestic abuse organisations. It’s not a transparent system, and it’s not particularly accountable, so I think there is a real need to ensure mandatory training happens.”Olive Craig, a senior legal officer at Rights of Women, said: “We think it’s a really positive step towards a prioritisation of the protection of survivors and children’s voices in the court. It’s a really important and significant message about what its priorities should be.She added: “While this is a really, really important step forward, it is just one step towards managing the very real problems of the cultural environment in the family justice system. And while we’re really pleased to see this really positive step, it is just that, it’s a step.“It’s not going to solve everything, so it’s really important that the court takes note of the message that’s being sent.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsFamily lawDomestic violencenewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, she was portrayed as a “cold-blooded killer” but evidence has since emerged that Blakely, a racing-car driver, physically and emotionally abused her.The impact on her emotional state was not considered during the trial that resulted in her hanging. The judge told the jury to disregard the fact that she had been “badly treated by her lover” as a defence.At the time of her death, she was a 28-year-old single mother of two, both of whom were left traumatised.Her grandchildren are presenting the justice secretary,David Lammy, with an application for a conditional pardon, on the grounds that a modern understanding of the impact of abusive and controlling behaviour would probably have resulted in a manslaughter conviction at most, which would not have carried a death sentence. She would also have benefited from concepts such as diminished responsibility and loss of control, which became enshrined in law in 1957.Women who conceived in abusive relationships lose legal challenge over benefits ‘rape clause’Read moreLaura Enston, Ellis’s granddaughter, said: “Ruth’s execution has had a devastating impact on our family. My mother and uncle suffered from trauma from which neither of them were able to recover, and as grandchildren we have felt these ripple effects.“The evidence shared with the justice secretary makes clear that the punishment did not fit the crime. We are determined to do what we can to right this historic injustice and honour not only Ruth but all victims of domestic abuse who have been let down by the criminal justice system.”Enston said that her family – and particularly Ruth’s children – had been dogged by mental health problems. She recalled her mother as “a very tormented woman” who lived a chaotic life, while her uncle, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, died by suicide.She said she had a complicated relationship with her grandmother’s legacy. “For many years, I never wanted any association with this story, due to the narrative around Ruth. She was really positioned as this cold-blooded killer. My mum leaned in on the story, she was almost hardwired into believing the tragedy of it all. As kids, we were bullied at school, I felt I had a target on my head.”It took watchingthe ITV drama A Cruel Love: the Ruth Ellis Story, which aired in March, to change Enston’s perspective. “[Ellis] was a modern-day woman, living in postwar Britain, going against the convention of how women should behave … She was on trial for more than just murder, she was on trial for what she represented, which was change.”View image in fullscreenLucy Boynton played Ruth Ellis and Laurie Davidson played David Blakely in the recent ITV dramatisation of her story.Photograph: Des Willie/ITVAccording to accounts from Ellis, her friends, doctors and witnesses, she was assaulted in public; pushed down the stairs; struck so hard in the ear she was briefly rendered deaf; punched in the stomach, resulting in a miscarriage; left bruised and threatened with murder.Although an appeal filed in 2003 was quashed because it was required to take into account the law at the time of the offence, the justice secretary is able to take into account legal developments since the conviction and sentence were imposed when considering granting a pardon.Grace Houghton, a solicitor at Mishcon de Reya, said it was the “perfect moment” to apply for a pardon owing to the growing body of cases coming through the courts that have raised key issues around domestic abuse and its psychological impact on survivors.Ellis’s story had echoes ofhigh-profile cases such as Virginia Giuffre’sin the way “some men, some abusers, act with impunity and do so because they think they hold all the power, and they’ve been able to manipulate because they think they’ll always get away with it and the woman would not be believed”, Houghton said. Similarly, trial documents showed “the trauma she had to go through on trial – we still see it now that women are not treated with compassion and empathy”, she added.“We’ve come a long way in terms of the justice system acknowledging those effects on women – but we haven’t gone quite far enough,” Houghton said, adding that she hoped the case would be a “stepping stone to get to where we need to be”.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The justice secretary considers all applications for royal pardons, in line with the longstanding conventions which govern use of the prerogative.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeDavid LammynewsShareReuse this content"

The report featured text messages where he allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”.In a post on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, Ingrassiasaid: “I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday’s HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.“I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout this process and will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”Trump’s nomination of Paul Ingrassia loses Republican support following racist text messagesRead moreAfter the release of the alleged text messages earlier this week, reporters asked John Thune, the Senate majority leader, if the administration should pull Ingrassia’s nomination to lead the office of special counsel. Thune said on Monday: “I think so. He’s not going to pass.”Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also said on Tuesday, prior to Ingrassia’s withdrawal, that he would not support Ingrassia’s nomination: “I’m a no. It never should have got this far. They ought to pull the nomination.”By late afternoon on Tuesday, at least five Senate Republicans told theWashington Postthey opposed Ingrassia’s nomination. Had his nomination gone to a vote, Ingrassia could have lost up to three Republican votes on the homeland security committee, which Republicans control by a single seat. Democrats were expected to vote unanimously against the confirmation.The 30-year-old’s attorney, Edward Paltzik, questioned the authenticity of the messages to Politico and suggested they could be AI-generated. He said they were “self-deprecating” and “satirical humor”, adding that his client is “the furthest thing from a Nazi”.Prior to the publication of the alleged texts, Ingrassia found himself in hot water after a separatePolitico reportfrom earlier this month revealed he had been investigated by the Department of Homeland Security. The investigation took place after he allegedly canceled the hotel reservation of a female colleague before a work trip and told her that they would share a room. Politico noted that the woman filed a complaint against Ingrassia and later retracted it.

Shesent a letterto Johnson on 14 October demanding he schedule a swearing-in within two days, which did not happen.“By blocking Adelita Grijalva from taking her rightful oath of office, [Johnson] is subjecting Arizona’s seventh congressional district to taxation without representation. I will not allow Arizonans to be silenced or treated as second-class citizens in their own democracy,” Mayes said in a press release announcing the lawsuit.Johnson has said he would seat Grijalva once the government reopens, but with Democrats andRepublicansdeadlocked, there is no sign that the shutdown – now the second-longest in US history – will end any time soon.Grijalva, who has held local offices in Arizona for decades, went to Washington in early October, expecting to be sworn in and start her new job. Johnson has so far refused to schedule a swearing-in for her, depriving her of the ability to use her office or access parts of the Capitol designated for members of Congress without an escort.“I want to get to work and I can’t,” Grijalva said in early October.In avideoon 16 October, Grijalva walks through her office at the Capitol and shows all the tasks she cannot do because she is not sworn in: she cannot print because she does not have a government email; she cannot access government-owned computers without an access code; and she does not have a budget to send flags to constituents.“Yes, I have access to an office,” she said. “But it’s kind of like someone saying: here’s a car, and it doesn’t have an engine, gas or tires.”Grijalvahas saidshe believes Johnson is holding off on swearing her in because she wants to release the Epstein files. Although her presence would not give Democrats a majority in the House, it could tip the scales for a vote on the files. A legislative manoeuvre known as a discharge petition needs 218 signatures; it has 217 currently, and Grijalva said she would sign it.Grijalva said in a statement: “It’s an unlawful breach of our constitution and the democratic process … Johnson cannot continue to disenfranchise an entire district and suppress their representation to shield this administration from accountability and block justice for the Epstein survivors.”Grijalva has called on her supporters to sign a petition to demand she be sworn in. “The voters in southern Arizona elected Adelita Grijalva to Congress – but Republicans are delaying her swearing-in, blocking her from becoming the decisive 218th signature to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” thepetitionsays.Arizona’s senators, Democrats Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly, have tried to press Johnson on the swearing-in,confronting himearlier this month and asking why he would not seat her. Johnson blamed the government shutdown and called the idea that the Epstein files played a role “totally absurd”. He called the two senators “experts in red herrings and distraction”.In aTV interviewlast week, Johnson called the Grijalva issue a “farce” and blamed Democrats for shutting down the government. He said she still could do her job and access her office despite the lack of official ceremony.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsArizonaDemocratsMike JohnsonRepublicansUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said the man used his vehicle to ram the federal agents’ vehicles in an attempt to flee. Officers then fired “defensive shots”.The man was shot in the elbow. The deputy marshal was struck in the hand by a ricochet bullet, the DHS said. Both were taken to the hospital.Bill Essayli, acting US attorney, in asocial media postidentified the man as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, and said Parias has been charged with assault on a federal officer. Parias could face up to eight years in federal prison if convicted.McLaughlin said the injuries were “the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest”.The homeland security department has said that violence against officers is on the rise, and has blamed activists for the increase. Donald Trump said in an executive memo last month that there has been “a more than 1,000% increase in attacks on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers since January 21 2025, compared to the same period last year”. But the agency has not released data to verify those claims, or explained how it catalogues incidents.Immigration activists say federal immigration enforcement agents are deploying increasinglyviolent tactics.News of the shooting comes amid growing concern about the sometimesviolent tacticsof Ice raids and arrests. During an enforcement operation in August in a Los Angeles suburb, a52-year-old manfrom Guatemala was killed as he fled officers and was struck by a vehicle.In July, aCalifornia farmworker diedduring a raid when he fell off a roof at his workplace.In Augustin San Bernardino, outside of LA, a federal agentfiredat a moving car during an immigration stop after the occupant declined to roll down his window.And earlier this month, during Trump’s federal crackdown in Chicago, border patrol agentsshot a woman, who survived and waschargedwith assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS immigrationWest CoastLos AngelesIce (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

But after receiving “unsolicited interest … from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros”, according to astatementreleased on Monday, the entire company could be up for a transaction. The company could also split up Warner Bros and Discovery, selling off Discovery while merging Warner Bros with another company, it said.Warner Bros Discovery is the parent company of several subsidiaries including CNN, HBO, DC Studios and the Harry Potter franchise.“It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,” said David Zaslav, the Warner Bros Discovery CEO, said in a statement.The company said that there was no deadline or definitive timeline for any transaction besides the split-up of Warner Bros and Discovery. Shares of the company were up over 10% Tuesday.Warner Bros Discovery says Israeli film boycott ‘violates our policies’Read moreThe move is just the latest media shake-up at a time when companies appear emboldened by a White House that is friendly to major mergers and acquisitions.While it is unclear what offers Warner Bros Discovery has received over the last months, the company reportedly rejected a bid from Paramount Skydance for nearly $60bn, according to Reuters.Over the summer, Skydance Media completed an $8bnmergerwith Paramount Global that saw David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison, become the head of a new giant media company.Before the merger was closed, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, paid a $16m settlement to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit against news show 60 Minutes. The network also said that it would cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, a vocal critic of the Trump administration, in 2026.In alettersent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which had to approve the merge, Skydance told the FCC chair, Brendan Carr, that it was “fully committed to presenting a diverse array of viewpoints on television”. Carr later said that he was “pleased” with the commitment the company made to “serious changes at CBS”.Carr would later become the center of the controversy around the brief cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show last month. Nexstar Media, one of the largest owners of local television stations that is looking to conduct amajor mergerthat would require FCC approval, pre-empted Kimmel’s show for more than a week after Carr said that the FCC could “take action” over Kimmel’s comments. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said at the time, though he has sincesaidhe wasn’t making any threats.Earlier this month, Paramount Skydance announced it wouldacquirethe Free Press, a media startup founded by Bari Weiss, known for her takedowns of “cancel culture” and criticisms of the liberal establishment, and gave Weiss a new role at CBS News as editor-in-chief.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

By Monday evening,Amazon saidall of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”.But amid the chaos affecting vital services around the world, some more unexpected consequences arose.Amazon workers posted videos of themselves on TikTokrelishing a slower work day, with some dancing in quiet warehouses, while others told CNN they had been sent home.AWS outage: Amazon Web Services crash shows internet users ‘at mercy’ of too few providers, experts sayRead more“Working for Amazon Flex we’ve been sent home due to their systems not being able to check us in or release us with pay. Because of this outage there’s no telling if the 80 of us here are going to be paid,” James from Texas told the network.Tiffini in Florida said she was hoping to start her Amazon delivery route at 3.30am but the systems were down. “I submitted a ticket but there has been no confirmation that we will get paid for the blocks that we missed due to Amazon’s system issues this morning.”Other social media users described facing delays to medical and vet appointments, while some customers using Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, faced issues with their smart homes.“I use Alexa-enabled smart plugs to control the lamps in my room,” Christina, who uses crutches to get around, told CNN. “During the outage my smart plugs became unresponsive. Before I realised why the plug wasn’t working, I tried unsuccessfully to reset one of them. Now I can’t get it to work at all.”Some Alexa users, however, were quick to make light of the outage.“Due to the Amazon outage, Alexa wasn’t working this morning, so I had to stumble out of bed in the dark, find my way to the kitchen, and turn the coffee-maker on MANUALLY. I can’t live like this. You guys go on without me,” oneX user posted.“I had to turn on my light by hand without Alexa’s help.

The Guardian understands that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, had been using external paid consultants and staff from other programs, some of whom were fired earlier this month.With no indication that the government shutdown will end any time soon, the NEADA is urging utilities to immediately suspend disconnections for overdue bills – until the federal chaos is resolved and Liheap funds are released.“Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again,” said Wolfe.In the first eight months of this year,New York’s monopoly energy provider alone disconnected111,000 households. The national total is expected to hit 4m shutoffs in 2025 – up from 3m in 2023, according to analysis of utility-reported data.Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day back in office, pledging to ramp up fossil-fuel production and slash regulations to bring consumer energy bills down.Key US nuclear agency to send 80% of workforce home as shutdown drags onRead moreIn the past year, electricity bills have risen more than 15% in 10 states plus the District of Columbia, with the highest jumps in Illinois (28%), Indiana (25%) and JD Vance’s home state of Ohio (23%). The price hike is mostly down to the rising cost of fossil gas, utilities passing on the cost of investment in transmission and distribution systems to consumers, and the rapid unchecked growth of datacenters, which is increasing demand for electricity.According to NEADA research, the cost of home-heating this winter is expected to rise by an average of 7.6%, increasing from $907 last winter to an estimated $976 this year.About 21m households – one in six – are currently behind on their energy bills. Household energy arrears rose by more than 30% from $17.5bn in December 2023 to $23bn by June 2025.A health department spokesperson said in a statement: “The Democrat-led shutdown is preventing states from receiving new funds under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

It purports to “fund the next chapter of American Exceptionalism and help Make America Grow Again”.A filing for the company, Colombier Acquisition Corp III, has designated it as a special-purpose acquisition company, or Spac, which is a shell company that raises money on the stock market before merging with an existing company that isn’t on the market yet. The company is looking to raise $260m in its initial public offering (IPO).The announcement emphasizes the growing coziness between Fox and the Trump family. In February, Fox launched a weekend show featuring Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law who joined the network as a contributor in 2021. While the network, during Joe Biden’s Oval Office term, had appeared togrow coldtoward Trump, it has fully embraced his second presidency.Ingraham, a longtime star of the network, was a vocal critic of Hunter Biden and his business dealings while his father was vice-president under Barack Obama. She argued that Biden utilized his dad’s political influence to carry outbusiness deals.Fox News employees expressed concerns network was intentionally aiding Trump, legal filings revealRead moreMedia Matters, a liberal media watchdog group, estimated that IngrahammentionedHunter Biden in more than 150 episodes of her show in 2023 and 2024, in the second half of his father’s presidency. Last December, when Joe Bidenpardonedhis son, a move that wasseen ascontroversialamong liberals and conservatives, Ingraham compared the family to the Corleone mob family of the fictional Godfather movie franchise.“Given what we’ve learned about the long-term corruption and deception of the Biden family, the Corleones have nothing on them,” Ingraham said.Joe Biden had previously said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son. But, upon pardoning him, the then president said his son had become a political target. In addition to controversial links to foreign companies while his father was vice-president, Hunter Biden was alsofound guiltyof felony charges related to a handgun purchase in 2018 andfederal taxes.Last November, after his father won the election, Trump Jrannouncedhis new role at 1789 Capital, an investment firm with close ties to conservative donors. The company’s website says that it funds “the next chapter of American exceptionalism”. So far, it has invested in companies in AI, energy, defense and three of billionaire Elon Musk’s companies. In September, the firm quietly passed $1bn in assets, according toReuters.The company, in a statement to Reuters, said that it “maximizes transparency and compliance, even though no one at the fund has ever worked in government”. The White House, meanwhile, has insisted that Trump and his family have never engaged in conflicts of interest.Trump and his eldest sons werefound guiltyof civil fraud in 2024. In August, an appeals courtthrew outthe $355m penalty a New York judge ordered Trump to pay after he was deemed guilty of fraud in his real estate business, though the appeals court affirmed the overall fraud verdict.Explore more on these topicsFox NewsDonald Trump JrUS politicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenHunter BidennewsShareReuse this content"

Clinical studies have shown that Mounjaro is more effective in causing weight loss than Wegovy.Lund said the board had been unable to reach agreement with the drugmaker’s largest shareholder, Novo Nordisk Foundation, which wanted “a more extensive reconfiguration” of the board.This is Lund’s second corporate departure this year – in April,he agreed to step down as the chair of UK energy company BPamid shareholder opposition to its green energy plans.Novo Nordisk’s share price fell by 1.57% in Copenhagen on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheDetroitautomaker said tariffs would hit its bottom line less than anticipated, lowering the updated impact to a range of $3.5bn to $4.5bn, from a previous $4bn to $5bn.The auto giant earlier this month took a $1.6bn charge from changes to its EV strategy. At the end of September, a $7,500tax crediton battery-powered models went away, and there has been further loosening of regulations around vehicle emissions.China’s economic growth slows amid Trump tariff war and property woesRead moreIn a letter to shareholders, General Motors’ CEO, Mary Barra, said she expects the company to incur future charges related to EVs. “By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond,” she said.Revenue for the quarter ending in September marginally fell to $48.6bn from a year earlier.US car sales have stayed strong despite uncertainty around the tariffs, rising 6% in the third quarter. While automakers have largely avoided raising sticker prices to offset their tariff costs, American car shoppers have continued to opt for pricier models and added features.GM said it plans to mitigate 35% of its anticipated tariff hit. There is relief on the horizon for many US automakers, afterDonald Trumpapprovedan order to expand credits for US auto and engine production, allowing companies to receive a credit equal to 3.75% of the suggested retail price for US-assembled vehicles through 2030 to offset import tariffs on parts.“I also want to thank the president and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday. The MSRP offset program will help make US-produced vehicles more competitive over the next five years,” Barra said in a letter to shareholders.Global companies have flagged more than $35bn in costs from US tariffs heading into third-quarter earnings.Investors are still waiting on trade deals to be ironed out with Mexico and Canada, analysts noted, as well as with South Korea, a major exporter of cars for GM. Automakers have been ramping up US investments to offset Trump’s levies. GM announced in June that it would invest $4bn at three US facilities in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee. The automaker imports about half of the vehicles it sells in the US, mainly from Mexico and South Korea.‘Empty shelves, higher prices’: Americans tell of cost of Trump’s tariffsRead moreStellantis earlier this month said itplans to invest$13bn in the US over the next four years.Barra in 2021 announced the company’s ambition to produce only EVs by 2035, a goal she has since stopped referencing publicly, instead saying customer demand will guide the automaker’s lineup.Sales of EVs were strong for GM and across the industry in the third quarter as shoppers raced to take advantage of the tax credit, but they still comprised less than 10% of the company’s overall sales.To spur consumer demand, GM planned to offer a program that would have allowed its dealers to continue offering the tax credit on EV leases. It has since backtracked on the initiative following backlash from lawmakers, including Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator for Ohio and a former car dealer.Ford also scrapped its program with the same aim. Other automakers, including Hyundai and Stellantis, are offering incentives to slash the prices consumers pay for their EVs.Explore more on these topicsGeneral MotorsTrump tariffsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryTariffsDetroitnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to knowThe move is intended to support the supply of minerals to benefit both countries’ commercial and defence industries – and shareholders are already profitingGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastJonathan BarrettBusiness editorTue 21 Oct 2025 02.47 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 03.15 EDTShareAustralia and the US havesigned a critical minerals dealdesigned to break China’s near complete hold over materials essential to commercial, clean energy and advanced military hardware.Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump have committed to each provide at least US$1bn ($1.54bn) towards a $US8.5bn ($13bn) pipeline of projects in both countries over the next six months to feed their commercial and defence industries.Here are five key takeaways.1.Albanese named two ‘priority projects’ in AustraliaThe Australian prime minister specifically referred to two “priority projects”, one by Alcoa and the other by Arufura Rare Earths, that will get an injection of capital from the government as part of a broader list.The first is a proposed gallium plant in Western Australia, to be co-located at one of Alcoa’s alumina refineries.Gallium is a strategic mineral vital for modern technologies like military equipment – including in advanced electronic warfare systems such as missile guidance technology and radar.The US is wholly dependent on gallium imports, with China having near complete dominance over its production – it is typically churned out as a byproduct by the country’s vast network of aluminium smelters.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailLike much of the critical mineral supply chain, China priced out rival gallium producers over several decades until it achieved its monopoly position. The US briefly had a dedicated gallium mine in the 1980s, according to the Atlantic Council, an American thinktank, but it proved unsustainable.The Australian government will invest up to $US200m in the Alcoa operation while the US will also have an ownership stake. Japan is also a project partner.2.The deal aims to end China’s monopoly on rare earth productionChina is a large producer of rare earths and hasnear-complete control over the refining processesneeded to make the minerals useful. It also produces about 90% of rare-earth magnets.Itsrecent curbs on supplieshas shown how reliant the rest of the world now is on its supplies.Diplomatic triumph or ‘capitulation’? Albanese found Donald Trump in a heavenly mood but the devil may be in the detailRead moreThe Australian government announced it will provide a $US100m equity injection into the Arafura Rare Earths project, located north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.The company, backed by Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart, plans to produce the rare earth oxides – neodymium and praseodymium – crucial to the production of magnets.Rare-earth magnets are used in wind turbines, medical devices, combustion and electric motors and ballistic missile guidance systems.The US government is considering investing up to $US300m, but first requires further due diligence.Australia has some rare earths processing capability through Lynas’ WA facility and the government has backed the development of a project by Iluka designed to produce several oxides.3.The deal doesn’t necessarily mean Australia will become a high-end manufacturerRare earths oxide in Australia would still need to be transported to global partners for metallisation, followed by magnet-making, given Australia does not currently have the manufacturing processes.Tim Buckley, director of thinktank Climate Energy Finance, says it is urgent to position Australia as “more than a quarry digging and shipping our raw commodities”.Government-commissionedmodellinghas shown building refining and processing capability for critical minerals means a greater share of trade and job creation.4.The end product is designed for delivery to US and Australian buyers - not ChinaIn recent years, Australian government officials have crisscrossed the country offering grants, funding and other assistance in order to develop domestic processing capabilities for critical minerals.The mix of government money and public shareholder money raises questions over who the projects will sell to, and at what price, given China is the world’s dominant buyer of materials that go into the production of high-grade magnets.The new framework is designed for delivery to American and Australian buyers and the deal is intended to support the supply of the minerals for the benefit of both countries’ commercial and defence industries.What could a Trump deal on critical minerals mean for Australia – and could Maga be a sticking point?Read moreOne representative of a critical minerals project told Guardian Australia the company was “mindful of the context in which we’ve been funded” and that there’s an assumption they “won’t be making many sales to Chinese customers”.The framework also discusses developing price floors.Non-Chinese resources companies have long complained that Beijing’s near complete control over the supply chain means that it controls benchmark pricing.This creates a problem for new producers, given prices could be kept low to prevent new projects from being feasible – an issue addressed through having a price the various critical minerals will not drop below.5.Investors are profiting alreadyAustralian critical minerals companies have enjoyed a stellar several weeks, with share prices rocketing amid hopes a new mineral boom has taken hold.Shares in Arafura are up more than 150% in a month, enriching investors, while the Australian mining sector has described the framework as a “landmark step forward for both nations’ economic and strategic futures”.There are, however, some voiceswithin Labordescribing the deal as “selling off the family silver”, with government fact sheets showing that America will get prime access through offtake agreements.There is also the lingering question over how China will respond.Explore more on these topicsCritical mineralsDonald TrumpAnthony AlbaneseMiningAustralian foreign policyAustralian militaryChinakey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Diego Simeone’s team had defended robustly. They had just hit the crossbar through Julián Alvarez. But then they were not, and it was the speed and brutality with which Arsenal moved the game away from them that took the breath.There were more set-piece goals, inevitably – for the breakthrough and No 4. It was Declan Rice to Gabriel Magalhães and then a repeat of the link‑up, the only difference being that Gabriel headed square for Viktor Gyökeres to bundle over the line rather than scoring himself. It feels as though nobody can contain Gabriel when he begins his runs and Rice delivers.Arsenal v Atlético Madrid: Champions League – liveRead moreIt was Gyökeres’s second of the evening, his first for 3-0 coming after he dug a breaking ball out of his feet to jam home with the help of a deflection off David Hancko. Gyökeres’s work-rate was tireless. This was his reward.Gabriel Martinelli scored the second after a driving run from Myles Lewis-Skelly, Simeone kicking an imaginary ball in frustration as his players failed to check the progress of theArsenalprovider. Martinelli’s first-time side‑footed finish into the bottom corner was the moment of the night.Atlético saw stars, four concessions in 13 minutes and it added up to a message from Arsenal to the rest of Europe. This was a step up for them in terms of the calibre of opponent after their opening games against Athletic Bilbao and Olympiakos. They stepped up, too. Another win, another clean sheet.Arsenal have conceded just three goals in 12 matches in all competitions this season and there is a bulldozing quality to their game, a remorselessness. Increasingly, there is an inevitability. They did not care that it did not work for them in the first half or the early part of the second period. They kept on doing what they do. The belief is total.Atlético had carried decent form to London, four wins and a draw in five matches, a run that included the 5-2 victory against Real Madrid. After they were breached, they sank without trace, looseness and errors costing them dearly.If Gabriel was the standout performer – he had a couple of important defensive interventions, too – then Gyökeres was surely the grabbiest individual story. There had been an unforgiving spotlight beforehand on his barren run – nine blanks for Arsenal and Sweden; his longest drought since 2021-22. He had just three goals for the club that he joined over the summer from Sporting.View image in fullscreenGabriel Magalhães heads Arsenal into the lead in the 57th minute.Photograph: John Walton/PAGyökeres might not be the smoothest-looking No 9; he is more of a raging bull. And the aesthetics have been a part of the debate. He will care not one jot that his goals here were scruffy, both from close-range, the second bludgeoned in with a thigh. There was a release about the celebrations, and he was given a tremendous ovation from the crowd when he was substituted towards the end.Arsenal brought the intensity, especially in the counter-press. Whenever they lost possession, there was a fury in their veins to regain it. For Atlético, it was the acid test of their composure on the ball and, until they subsided, it was possible to feel they had the technicians to cope. Pablo Barrios was easy on the eye in central midfield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Eberechi Eze made a move and shot from the edge of the area, the ball looped up off Hancko before dropping back down on to the crossbar. Rice could not convert the rebound.Atlético’s big opening of the first period was in the 25th minute when Simeone’s son, Giuliano, caught David Raya in possession after the Arsenal goalkeeper had wandered all the way over to the side of the pitch. After a quick throw-in from Simeone Jr, Alvarez measured a shot for the far corner of the empty net from an unfavourable angle with Raya chasing back. He was narrowly off target.Alvarez shimmered with menace. He had almost got away in the 29th minute after charging down a clearance and running from halfway only for Gabriel – with help from William Saliba – to snuff him out. It was an example of Arsenal’s hunger to keep the back door bolted. Early in the second half, Alvarez thought he had scored after a dart along the left‑hand edge of the area and a wonderful curled effort that beat Raya only to rattle the crossbar.Arsenal’s response was extraordinary. Gyökeres was denied by Jan Oblak but it was not long before the home crowd were saluting the Rice-Gabriel set-piece combination for the opener. Again. Atlético tried to respond. Simeone Jr went close, denied by a Gabriel block after Alvarez’s pass inside Lewis-Skelly. Arsenal had further gears to find.

The six-person jury ruled that the company’s actions damaged the 85-year-old’s reputation and exposed him to “ridicule, hatred, mistrust, distrust or contempt”.The verdict came after four and a half hours of deliberation. Nicklaus embraced family and friends in the courtroom after the decision. “We tremendously appreciate the time that the jury put into this case,” said his attorney, Eugene Stearns. “They were extraordinarily conscientious and dedicated, and we’re happy that Jack’s been vindicated.”The dispute dates back nearly two decades. In 2007, Nicklaus sold the rights to his name, image and golf course design business to Nicklaus Companies for $145m in a deal financed by billionaire banker Howard Milstein. After stepping down from an executive role in 2017, Nicklaus was bound by a five-year noncompete clause that prevented him from taking on new design projects. When that restriction expired in 2022, the company sued him in New York, alleging that he had diverted business opportunities and secretly entertained talks with LIV Golf.Nicklaus responded with a defamation suit of his own, accusing Milstein and other executives of planting false stories that he had “sold out” thePGA Tour– an organization he considered central to his legacy – for Saudi money. According to court documents, a Nicklaus Companies official had arranged for him to meet with Golf Saudi representatives in 2021 to discuss course design work. During that meeting, Nicklaus said, he was asked to take a leadership role with LIV Golf but immediately declined because of the PGA Tour’s opposition to the breakaway league.The lawsuit also accused the company of circulating rumors that Nicklaus was suffering from dementia and could no longer handle his affairs. “What they said was, ‘You need to have the keys taken away,’” Stearnstold ESPN. “It was unfortunate, but Jack’s reputation has now been restored.”Lawyers for Nicklaus Companies argued that the case was simply a business dispute and that Nicklaus’s stature in the game remained untarnished. “His reputation is as stellar as it’s always been,” defense attorney Barry Postman told jurors. But the jury sided with Nicklaus, though Milstein and company executive Andrew O’Brien were cleared of personal liability.The verdict follows a separate court ruling earlier this year in which a New York judge affirmed that Nicklaus isfree to use his own name and likenessin future golf ventures, even as the company retains the rights to sell branded apparel and equipment.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesSaudi Arabia and sportShareReuse this content"

Trout said Skaggs was “very funny, outgoing, fun to be around” and acted as the team’s DJ.Former Angels employee jailed for 22 years over death of team’s pitcherRead moreTrout also said Kay was good at his job, getting players to give interviews and guiding them on which questions they might be asked. At one point, however, Trout said a clubhouse attendant suggested the players should stop paying Kay for stunts like taking a fastball to the leg, shaving off his eyebrows and eating a pimple off Trout’s back. The attendant was concerned the money might be used for a “bad purpose.”Trout said he had seen Kay acting wired and sweating and “the first thing that came to mind was drugs”. Trout added it was clear Kay was “using something”.“I just didn’t know what it was,” Trout told the court, adding he approached Kay and offered to help him if needed. Trout was not asked whether he reported his concerns to the team.The testimony came at the trial for a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs’ wife, Carli, and his parents, who contend the Angels made a series of reckless decisions that gave Kay access to players when he was an addict and dealing drugs. The team has countered that Skaggs was also drinking heavily and his actions occurred on his own time and in the privacy of his hotel room.The trial comes more than six years after the 27-year-oldwas found dead in a Dallas hotel roombefore the Angels were due to play the Texas Rangers. A coroner’s report says Skaggs choked to death on his vomit and that a toxic mix of alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone was found in his system.Kay was convicted in 2022 of providing Skaggs with a counterfeit oxycodone pill laced with fentanyland sentenced to 22 years in federal prison. His trial included testimony from five MLB players who said they received oxycodone from Kay at various times from 2017 to 2019, the years he was accused of obtaining pills and giving them to Angels players.Skaggs’s family is seeking $118m for the pitcher’s lost earnings, compensation for pain and suffering, as well as punitive damages against the team.Skaggs had been a regular in the Angels’ starting rotation since late 2016 and struggled with injuries repeatedly during that time. He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks.After Skaggs’s death, theMLBreached a deal with the players association to start testing for opioids and to refer those who test positive to the treatment board.In addition to Trout, other players including former Angels pitcher Wade Miley, who currently plays for the Cincinnati Reds, could also testify in what is expected to be a weekslong trial in Santa Ana, California.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles AngelsMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Speaking about the team’s play on Tuesday, Johnson said: “If we can just complete a pass, it would look good.”With his top weapon sidelined, Sean McVay proves the ultimate chameleonRead moreHowever, he was quick to praise Glenn, who is in his first season as anNFLhead coach. “I do believe in Aaron,” Johnson said. “I’ve known Aaron since 1996 [when] I was a fan. I’ve always been a fan of him. I see the way he handles the room. If I were a player, I’d respond to him because he’s the real deal. No BS. No second agendas. What you’re hearing is the truth, and a lot of times players don’t get the truth. They get a lot of gobbledegook.”Johnson was more withering in his assessment of the team’s struggling quarterback, Justin Fields, who was given a two-year, $40m contract in the offseason. In six games this season Fields has thrown just four touchdowns while his QBR of 31.8 puts him 31st among 33 eligible quarterbacks. Some reports say the Jets will bench Fields in favor of 36-year-old journeyman Tyrod Taylor, who has been uninspiring in his appearances this season.“It’s hard when you have a quarterback with a rating that [Fields] has got,” Johnson said. “I mean, he has ability, but something just is not [working] … You have to play consistently at that position, and that’s what we’re going to try to do for the remainder of the season.”Despite the Jets’ struggles on offense, Johnson insists that he has no regrets about the team’s decision to cut Aaron Rodgers in the offseason. Rodgers has since led the Pittsburgh Steelers to the top of the AFC North with a 4-2 record.“I never look back,” Johnson said. “You have to look forward to football. Even when you cut players, they could be a Hall of Famer. You just never know. But Aaron’s playing great now. He’s in a situation that’s working for him.”While the Jets have tried numerous head coaches and starting quarterbacks in recent seasons one constant, except for his stint as ambassador to the United Kingdom during Donald Trump’s first term, has been Johnson’s ownership. The Jets have missed the playoffs every season since 2011, the longest drought in the NFL.Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest round of fixtures were disrupted by protests this past weekend. Players refused to move for the first 15 seconds of games, with the Spanish footballers’ association saying the decision to “symbolically protest” had been taken because of the league’s “lack of transparency, dialogue and coherence” over the Miami match.Real Madrid have filed two complaints over the move to the Spanish sports ministry, with their manager, Xabi Alonso, saying his side were against it because it “distorts the competition”. Alonso’s goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said: “La Liga does whatever it wants because it suits them.”The protests followed Uefa’s decision this month to“reluctantly” allow the match, along with a Serie A fixture between Milan and Como in Perth, Australia, to go ahead. The European governing body, which also has a working relationship with Relevent, said at the time that it “reiterated its clear opposition to domestic league matches being played outside their home country”, adding: “However … the Uefa executive committee has reluctantly taken the decision to approve, on an exceptional basis, the two requests referred to it.”In a separate statement, first published in the Athletic, Relevent said it had informed La Liga of the need “to postpone” the match, arguing that the uncertainty in Spain had left “insufficient time to properly execute an event of this scale”.Following Villarreal’s Champions Leaguedefeat by Manchester Cityon Tuesday night, during which the news was released, the club’s manager Marcelino blasted the timing of the announcement.After the club press officer had asked for questions on the match only, Marcelino was asked anyway. “OK, I am going to answer only one question and I am going to be clear,” he said. “I think it is an absolute lack of respect for them to release a statement at half-time about something that they knew would not be done. It is a lack of respect to the directors, the club, the professionals and the fans … the club will release an official statement tomorrow saying what they think. What I think is this.”Marcelino was asked again a few questions later. “I was clear, wasn’t I?” he said. “One question, one answer. I repeat myself: I found out at the end of the game, and the rest of what I said is my opinion.”Explore more on these topicsLa LigaVillarrealBarcelonaEuropean club footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least that’s what could, and probablyshouldbe revealed, preferably as early as possible.Seem dramatic? It isn’t. Though Bend It Like Beckham brilliantly tackles issues around racism, gender norms, homophobia, culture, immigration, and feminism with an endearing comedic twist, a core point of the plot rests on an adult coach pursuing a romantic relationship with a teenage player. In 2025, after multiple high-profile instances of inappropriate player/coach relationships have been reported in women’s soccer, and after the harm inherent in those relationships has been exposed, the normalization of one in a celebrated film is hard to ignore.For those who came in late, Bend It Like Beckham tells the story of Jess (Parminder Nagra) and Jules (Keira Knightley), two London high schoolers who love soccer. Jules has talent, plays for a seemingly high-level local team (Hounslow Harriers), and dreams of playing college soccer in the United States.Bend It Like Beckham follow-up in pipeline more than 20 years after original film was releasedRead moreJess, too, loves soccer, has talent, and pins posters of David Beckham on her bedroom wall. Jess is from a middle class Punjabi family and must meet the added challenge of overcoming her family’s initial reluctance for her to pursue soccer with the Harriers and, eventually, a college career in the US.Narrative conflict between Jess and Jules erupts when the girls realize they’re infatuated with the same man – their charming coach, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who would be close to a decade older than the girls.“Do you like him?” Jess asks Jules.“Nah,” responds Jules. “He’d get sacked if he was caught shagging one of his players.”So there is at least some awareness of the problem here. And yet …Later in the film, the girls’ team travels to a tournament in Germany, where they are invited to a nightclub by their opponents. There appears to be little supervision of the young players by anyone except Joe, Rhys-Myers’ character. The coach seems in his element on the dancefloor after a few drinks, dancing with the players supposedly in his care. It’s obvious Joe desires Jess, even though the nightclub contains hundreds of potentially consenting adults for him to pursue for post-game shenanigans if that was his goal. But no. Jess is his target.Outside the club, Joe and Jess are prevented from taking the relationship to another level – not by a sudden realization that the power dynamic is off the rails, but rather when they’re interrupted by Jules, who spots the pair and yells “You bitch!” at Jess.“Nothing happened,” Jess later explains to her older sister.“You make sure it doesn’t, alright?” her sister responds. The issue for Jess’s sister, though, is that the coach is white, rather than his age. Jess potentially being groomed by her coach isn’t discussed as a potential problem.These are all straightforwardly problematic situations to today’s eyes. It’s jarring to see them essentially ignored. It’s possible the husband-and-wife writing team of Gurinder Chadha (who also directed) and Paul Mayeda Berges were simply being prescient about what was to be revealed about women’s soccer over the next two decades or so. Similar issues really were swept under the rug by a lot of people that should have known better. If the sequel is similarly faithful to its era of release, it’s going to be must-see (and not at all kind to Coach Joe).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we stick with the original timeline, and real life parallels, Santa Clara will be conference champions in 2003, 2004, and 2006 featuring those players developed and coached back in England. The team will make the NCAA final four in 2004. The London girls may encounter Aly Wagner, a 2002 Santa Clara graduate who would go on to play for the US women’s national team. They’d be teammates with Jordan Angeli, who went on for a pro career in the NWSL and is now a well-known commentator.After they graduate, they may also eventually meet a talented Santa Clara recruit named Meleana “Mana” Shim who will later play in the NWSL – and speak out against her former coach Paul Riley for his alleged inappropriate behavior with players. Jess and Jules may eventually readthe 2021 Yates Report that detailed Shim’s experience at Portland Thornswhere Riley made “persistent and unwanted advances and his retaliation against her,” or an internal report from the Thorns that explained how the coach: “sent ‘inappropriate texts’,’ served alcohol to players, invited ‘a player to his hotel room,’ and danced ‘with a player and touch[ed] her while doing so,’ among other things.”Maybe, now several years later in the timeline, the Hounslow Harriers players would see some parallels with their own experience. Perhaps they’ll report Joe’s behavior – including excessive punishment for Jess on the training ground, having made her run enough to aggravate an injury. Not that the club – or local football associations or confederations – would pay attention to the complaints.That is a story that could be pulled straight from real life headlines.Believe it or not, I’m not trying to cancel Bend it Like Beckham, or its sequel. The original film should continue to be celebrated – for reasons it already has been, and also as an exquisite story-of-its-time example of how abuse in sport thrives in plain sight.“It’s OK,” Joe tells Jess, who has just graduated from high school, as Bend It Like Beckham heads toward its conclusion. “I’m not your coach anymore. We can do what we want.”You always could, Joe.Explore more on these topicsFootballWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

We got four more to go,” said Guerrero, the ALCS MVP.The defending champion Dodgers completed a four-game sweep of Milwaukee in the NLCS last week.“I truly think that the best two teams are left standing,” Toronto manager John Schneider said.Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez each hit a solo home run for Seattle in the team’s first postseason Game 7, but the heartbroken Mariners squandered a 3-1 lead in the seventh and fell eight outs short of their first World Series appearance.Shohei Ohtani powers Dodgers back to World Series with two-way masterpieceRead more“I hate to use the word failure, but it’s a failure,” Raleigh said. “What we expected was to get to the World Series and win a World Series. That’s what the bar is and the standard is and that’s what we want to hold ourselves accountable to.”Seattle remain the only major league club without a pennant.“There’s no question that it’s going to sting,” manager Dan Wilson said. “It’s a special team in there. It’s a shame that we had to come out on the wrong side of this one.”Addison Barger walked to begin the seventh, Isiah Kiner-Falefa singled on an 0-2 pitch and Mariners right-hander Bryan Woo was removed after No 9 batter Andrés Giménez advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt.Springer, the 2017 World Series MVP for Houston, greeted Eduard Bazardo with his fourth homer this postseason, a 381-foot drive to left field that sent the sellout crowd of 44,770 into a roaring, pulsating frenzy.“It’s so fitting,” Schneider said. “Bottom of our order gets it done again. There’s probably not another person on planet Earth that I want up other than George Springer and his October magic.”It was the first go-ahead homer in Game 7 history when a team trailed by multiple runs in the seventh inning or later.And it was the 23rd career postseason homer for Springer, tying Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber for third place. Manny Ramírez holds the major league record with 29.“Unbelievable moment,” Springer said. “So happy for our team, our fans, our city, our country.”Toronto became the fourth team to lose the first two games in a best-of-seven postseason series at home and rebound to win. The others were the 1985 Kansas City Royals, 1986 New York Mets and 1996 New York Yankees – all in the World Series.“I think it’s an inspiration for 41 million people in Canada, from coast to coast to coast,” Blue Jays chairman Edward Rogers said. “This is Canada’s team.”Making his first relief appearance since the 2021 playoffs, Kevin Gausman worked around three walks in a scoreless seventh inning to earn the win.View image in fullscreenBlue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr holds the American League Championship Series MVP trophy after Monday’s win.Photograph: Frank Gunn/APFellow starter Chris Bassitt tossed a perfect eighth and Jeff Hoffman struck out all three batters in the ninth for his second save this postseason.Rodríguez opened the game with a double and scored on a one-out single by Josh Naylor. Daulton Varsho tied it with an RBI single off George Kirby in the bottom half before Rodríguez restored the lead for Seattle with a leadoff homer in the third.Raleigh, who led the majors with 60 homers in the regular season, made it 3-1 with a leadoff homer against Louis Varland in the fifth.Raleigh has 10 home runs in 15 career games at Rogers Centre, three of them in the postseason. He also homered at Toronto in Game 1 of a 2022 wildcard series and Game 1 of this year’s ALCS.Naylor was called out to end the first after umpires ruled he interfered with Ernie Clement’s relay to first base on a double play by jumping into the throw and deflecting it.Kirby allowed one run and four hits in four innings. He walked one and struck out three.Toronto starter Shane Bieber permitted two runs and seven hits in three and two-thirds innings. He walked one and struck out five.The Blue Jays were playing in a Game 7 for the first time since losing at home to Kansas City in the 1985 ALCS.The 26-year-old Guerrero, born in Montreal, arrived at the stadium wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey jersey with Auston Matthews’ name and number. The star forward is 0-6 in Game 7s with Toronto during his 10 NHL seasons.“I think Vladdy broke the curse,” Schneider joked.The Blue Jays’ victory also put 64-year-old bench coach Don Mattingly in the World Series for the first time after a long career in baseball.

And will Thunder strike twice?Our writers give their verdicts on the new season, which tips off Tuesday. Can New York or Houston thwart an OKC repeat? And which youngster will make the superstar leap?Jakub Frankowicz,Bryan Armen Graham,Andrew LawrenceandAR ShawTue 21 Oct 2025 02.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 08.29 EDTShareWhat I’m most looking forward toIf we’re lucky,a fully healthy campaign from Victor Wembanyama. He’s already shown flashes of his insane ceiling in his previous two seasons. He’s such a difficult matchup with the ball in his hands, and on defense, he changes the entire calculus of opposing teams’ schemes with his length.Jakub FrankowiczFrom Wembanyama’s looming superstardom (he’s 7ft 5in now?!) to 18-year-old Cooper Flagg’s rookie spark, this season feels likea generational crossroads. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s encore, Paolo Banchero’s breakout and Nikola Jokić’s quiet dominance all converge. The old heads still matter, but the league now truly belongs to its twentysomethings: audacious, unpredictable and already rewriting the hierarchy.Bryan Armen GrahamThe revamped Atlanta Hawks, whose summer trade for Kristaps Porziņģis sent shockwaves across the league. The question isn’t if the unicorn big man will vibe with Trae Young, an unselfish point guard famous for scoring threes in bunches; the question is, when will Porziņģis fall injured and how much time will he ultimately miss?Andrew LawrenceThe battle of emerging contenders in the wide-open Eastern Conference.With Tatum and Haliburton sidelined with achilles injuries, multiple teams will have an opportunity to seize power. I expect more intensity in the East now that earning a trip to theNBAfinals seems more attainable.AR ShawBiggest offseason developmentThe off-court issues with the Los Angeles Clippersand the allegations they circumvented the salary cap to sign Kawhi Leonard. As details continue to come out, it leaves a black cloud hanging over the team and a league until they conclude their investigation.JFTwo earthquakes: Kevin Durant to Houston, and the East losing Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton to season-long achilles rehabs. KD supercharges a massive, physical Rockets core, while Boston and Indiana’s injuries fling the East wide open for New York, Cleveland and (my sleeper finals pick) Orlando. Secondary wave: Denver bolstering Jokić’s minutes with true bench competence.BAGView image in fullscreenThe free-agent addition of Kevin Durant has Houston Rockets fans dreaming big.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APKevin Durant move to Houston was significant, given that the league’s most promising young team now has one of the best scorers in league history on their side. (They’d give up Dillon Brooks, Jalen Green and a number of draft picksin a record seven-team swap.) After having to share the ball with Devin Booker and Bradley Beal for so long, Durant, 37, can get back to what he does best: being the undisputed No 1 option.ALDurant joining the surging Rockets.Last season’s No 2 seed took the biggest step forward by adding the league’s most lethal scorer who will also provide leadership to a youthful group. The Rockets were bullied and ousted in the first round of the playoffs by the veteran Warriors. But the addition of Durant ensures that they will no longer be pushed around in their quest for a first NBA championship since 1995.ASYoung player to make the superstar leapIf we presume that Wembanyama is already a superstar (which I do), my pick isCooper Flagg, who hasbeen on the radar of the NBAsince he had a now-mythical scrimmage as part of the practice squad went toe-to-toe with the USA’s men’s Olympic squad, pre-Paris.JFOrlando’sPaolo Banchero.The scoring was already there for the No 1 pick from the 2022 draft. Add Desmond Bane’s spacing, Franz Wagner’s two-way glue and a meatier on-ball role for the 6ft 10in power forward. If Banchero can trim the midrange diet and make a home at the stripe, he goes from All-Star to the All-NBA first team conversation.BAGWembanyama’s glabrous adventures in China learning the art of war from Shaolin monksmade headlines. But the pilgrimage he made to see Hakeem Olajuwon is no less significant. Big men have been seeking out the Dream to learn the secrets of his devastating low-post game for decades. Wemby, though, is already applying those lessons while showing flashes of Shaq, Giannis and more NBA greats. Add all that with the two inches Wemby grew over the summer, and what you have is the makings of the NBA’s next top superstar.ALThe Hawks’Jalen Johnsonaveraged 18.9 points, 10.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists before suffering a season-ending injury. With Porziņģis joining him in the Atlanta frontcourt, Johnson will have more one-on-one offensive opportunities and a chance to increase his statistical averages. Look for the dexterous forward to have a breakout season and earn his first NBA All-Star appearance.ASView image in fullscreenSan Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama could factor into the MVP conversation in his third NBA season.Photograph: Justin Casterline/Getty ImagesThe surprise package will be ...… theSacramento Kings.Domantas Sabonis is probably one of the most under-discussed players in the NBA, and while the Kings have failed to launch on a number of occasions, this year’s edition is filled with veteran players who could make it work under the right system.JF… the Toronto Raptors.Scottie Barnes plus Brandon Ingram gives the Raptors the length, shot creation and lineup versatility to skip the play-in entirely. Immanuel Quickley’s pace and RJ Barrett’s downhill juice stabilize the half court, while Darko Rajaković pulls the strings of a top-10 defense. It won’t always be pretty, but it will be effective.BAG… the Sacramento Kings. I know, I know, the roster makes even less sense now that it did before thelast-minute pickup of Russell Westbrook. But remember: the Wizards didn’t look like they were going anywhere when Westbrook joined that squad five years ago, and all he did was lead them to a rare playoff berth and turn Bradley Beal into the league’s top scorer while averaging a triple-double. I could easily see Westbrook pulling off the same trick with the cap-crunched Kings, aka the California Chicago Bulls.AL… the Philadelphia 76ers.Due to a disastrous season marred by injuries, the 76ers have become an afterthought. Their big three (Joel Embiid, Paul George, Tyrese Maxey) only played 15 games together, but can change the dynamics of the East if they can remain healthy this season. Combined with emerging young talent such as VJ Edgecombe, Jared McCain and Quentin Grimes, a healthy Sixers team will possess enough firepower to make a deep run in the playoffs.ASOne bold predictionThe Lakers miss the playoffs.Los Angeles’s depth remains an issue and unless Deandre Ayton makes a leap, they’ll struggle with bigs as well. Without another splashy midseason trade, I don’t see this roster making the tournament despite their abundance of top-end talent led byLeBron James, Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves.JFThe Thunder become the third 70-win team ever.With a league-best defense, absurd depth and a healthy Chet amplifying Shai’s late-game mastery, OKC steamroll the regular season even while load-managing. Whether they can catch the2016 Dubswill be an open question until springtime.BAGView image in fullscreenCooper Flagg, still only 18, may have the skillset in place to be an NBA superstar out of the box.Photograph: Stacy Revere/Getty ImagesSteve Ballmer is forced to sell the Clippersafter the whole no-show job debacle with Kawhi, who becomes a free agent.ALWembanyama will record the first quadruple-double since Spurs legend David Robinson in 1994.Wemby will score, rebound and block shots with ease on a nightly basis, but he’ll also have a few games with double-digit assists. This season, he’ll achieve a quadruple-double and approach a quintuple-double, a feat only accomplished by Wilt Chamberlin in 1968.ASMost Valuable PlayerJokićhas won three of the last five MVP trophies and finished runner-up twice.

Yet in lauding the terrifying pace of Howe’s wingers, not to mention his team’s aggression and organisation, Benfica’s manager was perhaps not being disingenuous after all. By the end his insistence that Newcastle’s modest Premier League position is false certainly rang true.At the final whistle no one doubted Mourinho’s sincerity as he strode up to Anthony Gordon and informed the England left-winger that he had been “absolutely brilliant”.Newcastle v Benfica, Villarreal v Manchester City and more: Champions League – liveRead moreAlthough it took a while for the home side to subdue more than decent opponents – and Benfica’s Belgium right-winger Dodi Lukébakio in particular – a fine goal from Gordon and two more from Harvey Barnes, on as a substitute, left the Portuguese visitors without a point in theChampions League.Mourinho has barely been in charge in Lisbon for a month but, after this, Benfica’s hopes of reaching the knockout out stages appear almost in tatters. His problem was that, after a compelling, delicately poised opening hour featuring some important saves from Newcastle’s impressive goalkeeper, Nick Pope, Howe’s substitutes altered the power balance. The Portuguese’s attempts to overturn a 1-0 deficit backfired.“I’m really pleased,” Howe said. “Benfica are a very good team so we had to show our quality. It wasn’t an easy game for sure. We were patient and kept at it. After our second goal you saw the real us and the threat we can be. We haven’t quite clicked into gear this season but hopefully this is the start of getting where we want to be.”Mourinho stressed that his team had played their part in an engrossing evening. “I think St James’ Park is beautiful but it was quiet tonight,” he said. “The crowd felt the game wasn’t easy and that Benfica were more likely to score. Newcastle are a team of giants but we felt very comfortable in the first half. Then the second goal killed the game and it was easy for them.”The two managers had exchanged a slightly perfunctory, rather cool, embrace before kick-off and it quickly became clear that Mourinho had instructed his side to subdue St James’ Park by slowing Newcastle down, disrupting their passing rhythm and generally lowering the temperature at every opportunity.View image in fullscreenNick Pope is beaten by a shot from Benfica’s Dodi Lukébakio hits a post.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersDespite even Gordon’s best efforts, a Newcastle side lacking the benched Sandro Tonali and Joelinton in midfield struggled initially to create much more than half chances.Lukébakio very nearly showed his hosts how to finish when, having deposited Dan Burn on his backside, he tested Pope with a tremendous shot that was met with an equally terrific one-handed save. No wonder Howe’s goalkeeper retains hope of an England recall in time for next summer’s World Cup.Yet when Lukébakio struck another shot against a post, Newcastle began really raising their game and Anatoliy Trubin made an impressive close‑range save from Bruno Guimarães before Gordon broke the deadlock. The England winger’s scorching pace had caused Mourinho’s technical area consternation all night and now he side‑footed that opener beyond Trubin after Jacob Murphy’s ability to deliver an early ball into the box had once again paid dividends.When, for once, Newcastle’s high press was not read by Benfica, Murphy, passed low across the face of goal for Gordon to polish of and become the first Newcastle player to score in three straight Champions League games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If Gordon, morale evidently buoyed by scoring his fourth goal in three Champions League appearances this season, played with the zeal of a winger determined to eclipse all rivals, Lukébakio emphasised that, while Burn is a fine central defender, he is not a natural left-back.Howe’s solution was to introduce Barnes and Joelinton as Mourinho threw on an extra striker in Franjo Ivanovic. It proved to be Benfica’s undoing.Until then the visitors, and their defender Antonio Silva especially, had done a decent job in restricting Nick Woltemade’s room for manoeuvre and forcing Newcastle’s Germany centre-forward deep. Now, though, the right-back Amar Dedic was off, the defence underpowered and the path clear for Barnes to prove that Gordon is not Howe’s only goalscoring winger.His introduction was already paying off by the time Pope dispatched a mighty, near 70-yard throw in Barnes’s direction. When Silva misread the bounce, Barnes was away accelerating into the area before maintaining commendable poise to lash a sublime shot beyond Trubin.Once Barnes rolled a shot through poor Trubin’s legs after meeting Gordon’s stellar pass, it was all over. The warning from Mourinho, by now slumped back in his seat, about Newcastle’s “very fast, very dangerous wingers” had not been empty.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedBenficaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was only one, which is not many for a man on 24 in his past 14 matches for club and country, but his early strike opened the way towards a win sufficiently dominant to suggest that a team is emerging once again. Pep Guardiola said: “We have the feeling that again we can control the games … that in many things you are coming back to what you were in the past.”If Haaland is inevitable, he is not alone. Bernardo Silva added the second towards the end of a first half of notable superiority, before there were brief moments in whichManchester Cityallowed their hosts the illusion of making a game of this when it was gone.Gyökeres double adds gloss to Arsenal’s Champions League rout of AtléticoRead moreWhen Haaland was withdrawn with five minutes left, there were whistles and relief; he had just fired two more shots at them, each saved by Luiz Júnior, but now at least he could do no more damage. He had already done enough.City had, almost from the start, Haaland, Savinho and Jérémy Doku combining to force Luiz Júnior into making his first save after just 26 seconds and the Norwegian heading just wide 143 seconds later.The Villarreal head coach, Marcelino García Toral, said: “That filled us with doubts about everything. We were like a boxer waiting to be hit. City are very good, and they have a plan. And this City is not the team from last season.”It wasn’t easy to define Guardiola’s formation; at times it was something like 3-2-4-1, with the exceptional John Stones stepping forward. City had 65% of possession and the surprise was that it was that low.Marcelino’s team certainly had difficulty deciphering that plan. Theirs was clearer and characteristic. This is a fast, athletic and tall side – 10 of the starting XI over 6ft – liable to sit deep and seek to run. That at least is the theory, but even in athleticism City looked stronger and Villarreal’s confidence was hit early, any threat seen fleetingly in the opening 45 minutes, Rúben Dias closing down Georges Mikautadze and Pape Gueye firing wide.View image in fullscreenSanti Comesaña (right) reacts with disappointment after Villarreal are denied by Manchester City’s Gianluigi Donnarumma.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesBesides, if Villarreal waited, City were willing to wait too, the goal that started it all on 17 minutes a portrait of patience, then sudden incisiveness. The ball was worked to the right where Savinho, faced by a yellow wall, stopped, looked, and turned away again. He played the ball back to Stones, who played the ball back to Savinho, who played the ball back to Stones, who … well, you get the picture. Six times they exchanged short passes, none of it done at top speed but all of it at the right speed, their opponents watched, tested, and slowly drawn out.When Savinho played to Stones the last time, the Englishman went one step deeper towards Josko Gvardiol, whose pass broke a line as it was hit faster to Savinho. Suddenly, everything accelerated and, while the ball travelled, so did Rico Lewis up the inside track between two defenders. “I adore that player, he’s so intelligent,” Guardiola said.Savinho slotted that familiar little angled ball into the area and into the run, Lewis arriving ahead of everyone and turning it across the six-yard box. Thundering in to score was, of course, Haaland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, there was patience from City and passivity from Villarreal; again, it came from the right, another player slipping into the box undetected. There were nine Villarreal players in there, but when Savinho clipped in a cross Silva, who Guardiola said has “a head like a hammer”, was still alone to finish.Champions League roundup: Barcelona and PSG romp to victoriesRead moreWhen Nicolas Pépé rolled his eyes to the sky on the hour having seen City pass around him again, it had seemed to say it all, but Marcelino said he had been proud of his team’s response. In the second half he said, “we were alive”.Alberto Moleiro’s shot was blocked and Juan Foyth struck wide. Next Pépé thudded a shot against Gianluigi Donnarumma’s gloves before Gueye headed just wide. Pépé then volleyed over at the far post when Dias could only half clear a deep cross from Moleiro.The reaction, though, was brief and a little late. There wasn’t time for much more: a Tani Oluwaseyi header off a post in the last minute and, before that, a couple more demonstrations of Haaland’s qualities. First, when he superbly brought down Mateo Kovacic’s diagonal and thumped a shot. Then when he carried it to the edge of the area and guided an effort towards the fair post. This time, there was no goal, Luiz Júnior saving twice; one would have to do.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueVillarrealManchester CityEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The plane did at least depart in time to arrive before Frankfurt airport closed at 11pm German time (10pm BST).Liverpool’s 21-member travelling squad did not include Ryan Gravenberch because of the ankle injury he sustained in the defeatby Manchester United on Sunday.The lateness of their departure forced Liverpool had to cancel their pre-match press conference featuring Slot and Dominik Szoboszlai.A club statement released 40 minutes before the press conference was scheduled to start confirmed: “Our pre-match press conference for the clash with Eintracht Frankfurt has been cancelled. A delay in the squad’s scheduled flight out to Frankfurt, due to technical issues with the aircraft, means the briefing will now not be able to take place.”Technically they were in breach of Uefa regulations by not hosting a press conference but the club are unlikely to be fined because the delay was beyond their control. Arsenal found themselves in a similar situation in October 2023 when their flight to Lens was delayed by nearly five hours because of adverse weather conditions. Arsenal were not fined on that occasion.Uefa rules state: “The clubs must arrange for their teams to arrive on-site by the evening before the match concerned at the latest, and in time to fulfil their media obligations the day before the match.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are bottom of the Premier League’s fair play table and Maresca, who served a touchline ban at Forest after beingsent off against Liverpoolthis month, acknowledged that Gusto’s dismissal for a late tackle highlighted where his team could show more restraint.“It’s something that we can do better,” the Italian said. “The last one is completely avoidable, because it’s 0-3, the game is finished. For sure there is something that we have to improve.”Maresca added context, saying Gusto’s challenge stemmed from a desire to preserve a clean sheet. But accusations of naivety are not going away. Chelsea have the youngest side in the Premier League and Maresca was asked whether he would try to stamp out bad habits by punishing his squad.“I’m not that kind of manager to punish players,” he said. “I don’t think it’s the right way to do things. I prefer to help them to understand, and then do the right things. They are all different kinds of red cards, but if you concede four or five it’s something that we have to improve.“I have four kids and when they do something wrong, I don’t punish them. I try to teach them to do the right things. I try to treat the players in the same way. I think the players have a system inside the changing room, so a fine is something that they manage.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Nottingham Forest job has been of interest to him for a long time, and not only because he lives close by. The circumstances in which the role has become available are not ideal for anincoming head coachbut his appointment is the pragmatic choice in ludicrous circumstances.Ange Postecoglou was never the right man, inheriting a squad that did not suit his style and did not adapt quickly enough, though it did not help that he told the players their previous achievements meant nothing. His tenure will go down in history forall the wrong reasons. Dyche, on the other hand, has plenty of respect for what Forest achieved under Nuno Espírito Santo and is far more aligned with that conservatism than with what was witnessed under Postecoglou.Ange Postecoglou’s reputation has taken a hit that only time and the right move can restoreRead moreForest needed someone who will not require time to assess what they are working with, and Dyche knows this squad well, having watched on from near and far. He had been thought about at the club for a while because of his record in the Premier League with Burnley and Everton. Forest were impressed by his work at Everton, where in 2024 he would have finished level with Brighton and Bournemouth, two lauded clubs, but for a points deduction. It showed he was getting the best from the squad and not being distracted by off‑field matters.Unlike when Postecoglou was brought in, full due diligence was done on Dyche before it was decided he was the best fit for the squad from the available managers. About £200m was spent on 13 summer signings to try to ensure Forest had the capabilities to compete in the Premier League and Europe. The recruitment made this the best Forest squad of the 21st century, one the club think should finish in the top 10 again, but theysit in the relegation zone with five points from eight games.Dyche has never known such riches. Burnley’s squad never experienced much turnover and rarely involved high expenditure; at Everton finances were tight. At Forest he will have a team capable of competing at the highest level.View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest were impressed by Sean Dyche’s work at Everton.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAt Burnley and Everton his successes were based on a strong defensive unit, marshalled by two centre-backs. Ben Mee and James Tarkowski were the foundation at Turf Moor, and the team conceded relatively few goals for one regularly in a relegation battle. Dyche also achieved a seventh-placed finish with Burnley through meticulous planning and by creating a strong work ethic. Bringing the squad together will be imperative because some of the players found Postecoglou grating, but Dyche has worked on unity before.Forest’s Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo were, under Nuno, one of the best centre-back pairings in England and, with Dyche’s attention to detail at the back, they potentially can be again. The club wanted someone who can fix the defence and even those who question Dyche’s style could not dispute his credentials as a defensive coach. In 2023-24 his Everton team conceded 51 goals – only the top three let in fewer. Postecoglou could not organise Forest for set pieces and the team became quickly porous. Dyche will not stand for that.The appointment will also bring counterattacking back to Forest, something that was instilled by Nuno and is why the club have invested heavily in wingers in recent years. Dan Ndoye, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Omari Hutchinson and Dilane Bakwa form an impressive group if Dyche can harness their attributes. It was a priority for Forest to get a manager who will work well with a squad that shines in transitions and has the speed and athleticism to scare opponents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is confidence at Forest that if the defence can be rebuilt the forwards will look after themselves, considering Dyche can also call upon Chris Wood, who he worked with at Burnley, and has Igor Jesus and Taiwo Awoniyi as options, depending on how he wants to play. Dyche showed when bringing Iliman Ndiaye to Everton that he is open to working with more creative players.The Forest legends Ian Woan and Steve Stone being part of the Dyche package will be popular with most fans. Dyche was a youth player at Forest during the Brian Clough era and bringing a little bit of that period back will add a nostalgic tint.Marco Silva was the manager the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, wanted but it was too difficult to prise him away from Fulham mid-season for various reasons. Roberto Mancini was also under consideration but his personality has brought tension to previous jobs and considering the egos at the City Ground his arrival might have resulted in another combustion. Dyche likes to stay out of club politics, focusing on the running of the team, although whether it is possible to do so at Forest remains to be seen.Unity is craved by the club and gave them great strength under Nuno. Dyche is there to bring calm and camaraderie and to shut out the noise, which is often of their own making. Things are rarely quiet at the City Ground but gruff notes of contentment, rather than the smashing of TV screens and chants for a sacking, are all that is wanted.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestSean DycheanalysisShareReuse this content"

The patched-up Lions secured a third successive win, 2-0 against fellow high-flyersStokeat the Den.The flying winger Femi Azeez grabbed his third goal in three matches before the French defender Tristan Crama hit his first for the club in a sweet victory for Neil against his former club. But the injuries are still piling up. Will Smallbone became the latest victim when theSouthamptonloanee pulled up clutching his hamstring in the first half.“We nearly had a full squad a few days ago but since then about five players have fallen over,” Neil said. “It’s an incredible effort from the players to be where we are considering how many injuries we have had. Will’s hurt his hamstring which is a blow. I don’t know how serious it is yet. We beat a good side tonight. They were third before tonight and we deserved to win.”Scott Twine netted a second-half double asBristol Citycame from behind to go fourth with a 3-1 victory againstSouthamptonat Ashton Gate. The Saints took the lead on the half-hour when Adam Armstrong broke clear on to a precise through ball from Shea Charles and deftly chipped the advancing goalkeeper Radek Vitek. But it took City just three minutes to level, Anis Mehmeti converting a similar chance from Rob Dickie’s deflected pass, this time with an unerring right-footed shot from 12 yards when left with only Alex McCarthy to beat.Twine shot the hosts ahead on 57 minutes arriving unchallenged to score from close range after Zak Vyner’s shot from the edge of the box had deflected off a Saints player and spun back off a post.Twine was on target again seven minutes later as wretched defending allowed him plenty of space to race away and chip past McCarthy.

Arteta has never doubted him, believing it was simply a matter of time before his selflessness and persistence translated into goals.Man in the mask Gyökeres silences ‘invisible’ taunts to make Arsenal mark | Ed AaronsRead moreGyökeres scored Arsenal’s third and fourth as theyswatted Atlético asidein a four-goal salvo that began with Gabriel Magalhães’s goal in the 57th minute. Gabriel Martinelli scored the second after an excellent run by Myles Lewis-Skelly as Arsenal maintained their 100% record after three Champions League games, keeping a third clean sheet into the bargain.“Viktor deserved it because everything that we were seeing in terms of what he was bringing to the team and how much he was helping the team in many areas, apart from scoring goals in the last few weeks … there was no debate about that,” Arteta said.“It was about keeping that belief in himself, that emotional state that he can enjoy and play freely. I look at his teammates as well – they are all so happy for him.“We all appreciate him because he makes us a much better team. I think we’ve become much more unpredictable. He’s so physical, opens the spaces for everyone. The way he presses the ball, holds the ball, it’s just phenomenal. And then the icing on the cake and the biggest thing that we’re going to debate about him is goals. He’s scored two very different ones today and hopefully he starts to get some momentum and a good run of goals.”Arteta made only two changes to the lineup that had started Saturday’s 1-0 Premier League win at Fulham, Lewis-Skelly and Martinelli coming in. But he feels that the competition for places is drivingArsenalto new heights. He had impressive options on the bench.“This is what we need and when you look at the top teams in Europe, that’s what they have and we have to manage that in a really cohesive system,” Arteta said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Burnley manager has replaced Ange Postecoglou after the Australian’s calamitous40-day tenure.Dyche has signed a deal until 2027 at the City Ground, where he started his career as a youth player but never reached the first team. He has brought the club legends Ian Woan and Steve Stone back as part of his backroom staff. One of the key reasons Forest chose Dyche was because of his record of building defensively solid teams at Burnley and Everton but he will be aiming to utilise the attacking talent available to him too.“The basics have always got to be in place,” Dyche toldForest’s media channels. “Strong, fit and organised is always a good place to start, but I want the players to have the freedom to go and play. There’s some real talent here, so our job now is to find that balance – the risk and reward of going forward to score goals and excite the crowd, but equally the solid base which has been such a big weapon for the club, particularly last season. Finding that balance will be key.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It’s been important to familiarise ourselves with the players, get a feel for them, and for them to get a feel for us – but more importantly, we want to get them going again and bring that vibrancy back among them.”Dyche and his staff, which also includes Tony Loughlan and Billy Mercer, oversaw training on Tuesday. Dyche has been out of work since beingsacked in January by Everton, where he was in charge for two years, and will get his first taste of the home dugout against Porto in the Europa League on Thursday.“There was a nice edge to them in our first session, and we want to keep that going and take those plans into the schedule,” he said. “We’ve reminded them how good they are, what they’ve already achieved, and how we can build on that to bring consistency.”The Fulham manager, Marco Silva, and the former Manchester City head coach Roberto Mancini were also considered but Forest opted for the experience of Dyche. Evangelos Marinakis was interested in appointing Silva, with whom he worked at Olympiakos, but a deal to bring him from Fulham mid-season was deemed too difficult.In the background, the global head of football, Edu, and the technical director, George Syrianos, had been carrying out due diligence on potential candidates, with Dyche and Mancini regarded as the most compatible with the squad. The clarity of messaging from Dyche and his staff impressed Forest’s hierarchy in the hiring process.A Forest statement said: “Dyche brings the perfect blend of character, tactical acumen and proven achievement to guide the club through its next chapter. Having managed more than 330 Premier League matches in his career to date, Dyche has built teams defined by defensive organisation, resilience, and strength from set pieces – qualities that align closely with the current squad’s attributes and the club’s footballing identity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wales are due to kick off their autumn Test campaign against Argentina on 9 November before ­facing Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.Tandy, formerly the Scotland defence coach, has also selected ­Saracens’ Rhys Carré, who was pre­viously barred from representing Wales under the rule that demands that players based outside the ­country require at least 25 caps to be eligible. Carré has made 20 ­appearances but now requalifies on the basis he was not offered a decent deal to stay in Wales when he moved back to north London in 2024.There are five uncapped players, with the Dragons hooker Brodie Coghlan, the Ospreys lock James Fender and back-row Morgan Morse, the Cardiff prop Danny ­Southworth and the Bath centre Louie Hennessey all making a squad led by the flanker Jac Morgan.“It’s been really exciting going through the whole process and ­realising how many good players we’ve got,” Tandy said. “There’s a really good mix of some young guys coming in, mixed with some ­experience as well. But the ­overall feeling is really exciting and I can’t wait to get the boys into camp on Monday.”The long-serving Racing 92 lock Will Rowlands, capped 41 times by his country, will not be involved and has announced his retirement from international rugby.

While Uefa has“reluctantly” approved the plan, Real Madrid and other teams in Spain’s top flight have expressed their opposition.Mikel Arteta happy with George Graham comparison as Arsenal prepare for AtléticoRead moreSpeaking on Tuesday before Real’s Champions League fixture against Juventus, Courtois accused La Liga of bypassing clubs in the decision-making process and argued that the move undermines the principles of fairness in the home-and-away league format. “La Liga does whatever it wants because it suits them,” said the Belgian. “This decision distorts the competition. Playing at home is not the same as playing away. In La Liga, playing away is very difficult, as we saw against Real Sociedad and Getafe.Villarrealaway is tough. It’s not fair to change the rules mid-season without consulting us.”Courtois also contrasted La Liga’s plans with the NBA and NFL, who regularly play matches abroad. “The NBA has 82 games, and the NFL’s owners collectively approve these decisions. Here,La Ligaacts unilaterally. It’s not the same,” he said.La Liga players staged silent protests at the weekend by standing motionless at kick-offs across all matches, symbolising their discontent with the decision. La Liga’s broadcasts ignored the protests in several games, showing a wide, aerial shot of the stadiums accompanied by a banner that read “Commitment to peace”.“Hiding the protests and trying to change the narrative is censorship and manipulation,” Courtois said. “I’m not surprised. [La Liga president, Javier Tebas] behaves like no other sports executive I’ve ever seen. His actions on social media and in public speak volumes.”Real Madrid have filed two complaints with Spain’s sports ministry, arguing the moving of a domestic game overseas undermines La Liga’s competitive integrity. The Atlético Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, has also weighed in on the controversy, expressing his scepticism over the Miami fixture. “I won’t believe it until I see it,” he said. “The home team loses the advantage. Their fans won’t be there, and they have to travel thousands of miles. We need to respect the fans.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fourteen Australians are set to compete for minutes around the league, ranging from veteran centres Jock Landale and Duop Reath, emerging wings in Johnny Furphy and Josh Green, to intriguing draftees like Tyrese Proctor and Rocco Zikarsky.Josh Giddey out to prove himselfAfter protracted negotiations with the Chicago Bulls, Giddey finally signed his rookie extension worth $US100m ($153m) over four years last month. It’s a huge contract for the Melburnian, but in NBA terms it is cheap for Giddey’s position and profile as a lead playmaker. The reluctance for Chicago’s front office to pay top dollar means the 23-year-old enters this season with much to prove.‘Never done that before’: Josh Giddey hits half-court buzzer-beater as Bulls stun LakersRead moreHaving been traded by Oklahoma City at the start of last season, Giddey watched as his old team stormed to the NBA championship without him. As the Bulls look to make the playoffs in the weaker Eastern Conference, he will need to demonstrate his shooting and defence are starter-worthy or else he may fall back towards the NBA’s fringe.View image in fullscreenBulls guard Josh Giddey has recently signed a mega deal to stay in Chicago.Photograph: Jack Dempsey/APDyson Daniels eyes another stepDaniels signed the same deal as Giddey this week, and after his most-improved player award last season, the Hawks guard’s career has taken off in Atlanta following his departure from the Pelicans. He is now lauded as one of the league’s best perimeter defenders, and led the league in steals with three per game – more than one whole takeaway per match higher than the tally of second place.Playing next to flamboyant Trae Young in Atlanta, the 22-year-old can be successful this season as a secondary ballhandler and elite defender as long as the Hawks make the playoffs. But if he can elevate his three-point shooting, which was below league average last year, and continue to develop his passing and driving, Daniels could become one of the league’s most versatile players.Johnny Furphy on highlight watchPacers wing Furphy has emerged as a fan favourite in Indiana following a succession of highlight-reel dunks in pre-season. His acrobatics prompted NBA personality Pat Beverley to describe him as the “best white dunker we’ve seen in a while”, and an invite to the mid-season dunk contest could be on the table.After playing just eight minutes per contest over 50 games in his rookie campaign, the former Maribyrnong College student is in contention for a Pacers rotation that might lean towards youth following injury to lead guard Tyrese Haliburton.View image in fullscreenJohnny Furphy’s dunks have attracted attention in pre-season.Photograph: Darron Cummings/APTyrese Proctor an outside shotGuard Proctor fell in the June draft all the way to the 49th pick, where Eastern Conference contenders Cleveland picked him. The Cavs are favourites to make the NBA finals from the East, so it would be rare for a rookie taken in the second round to see much court time. But the Sydney product has seen minutes in pre-season, and his NBA-ready shot gives him a chance to contribute.Minutes crunch looms for veteran quintetVeteran centre Jock Landale has a chance to secure the starting centre position in Memphis given highly-touted Zach Edey will miss the start of the season after ankle surgery.View image in fullscreenDetroit Pistons forward Isaiah Stewart backs into Memphis Grizzlies center Jock Landale.Photograph: Brandon Dill/APIn Portland, Duop Reath is the veteran backup to young centres Donovan Clingan and Yang Hansen, but could play consistent minutes if the Blazers find themselves competitive. His teammate Matisse Thybulle is likely to be used as a defensive spark off the bench.In Charlotte, Josh Green’s off-season shoulder surgery has left him without a timeline to return. The 24-year-old still has a contract for next season, but won’t want to give his teammates at the rebuilding Hornets too much of a head start. And injury has already slowed Dante Exum, who has a knee complaint and has missed key pre-season opportunities in Dallas.Australian NBA players on the fringeThen there are those who are unlikely to see much, if any, court time this season. Thirty-eight-year-old Joe Ingles is back in Minnesota, but appears to be little more than a big brother keeping Anthony Edwards in check.Rocco Zikarsky is likely to be developed by Minnesota Timberwolves through their G-League team. Fellow rookies Lachlan Olbrich in Chicago and Alex Toohey for the Golden State Warriors are also in the slow cooker, while the more seasoned Luke Travers will be hoping to win minutes alongside Proctor for the Cavs.Ben Simmons and Patty Mills fish for a dealIf there were any doubts Mills was set to retire, he answered them with a workout video posted on his social media over the weekend, showing the 37-year-old remains sharp and focused on securing another NBA contract.What Simmons is thinking is anyone’s guess after an off-season in Australia, going fishing and playing with a Sherrin. Although he took to Instagram last month to reject suggestions he was retired, the 29-year-old – an All Star as recently as 2021 – has yet to surface.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Goff, though, lost a fumble and overthrew rookie receiver Isaac TeSlaa on fourth-and-2 on the next two possessions and later threw an interception – all in Tampa Bay territory.Baker Mayfield was 28 of 50 for 228 yards with one touchdown and one interception against a short-handed defense. Mayfield threw an incomplete pass in the end zone with 4:24 left, ending potential comeback hopes.“As a skill group, we didn’t connect on a lot of plays,” Mayfield said. “Once the defense knows we are going to have to pass, they can pin their ears back. That’s not a fair situation to the offensive line.”Gibbs took advantage of a big hole and his speed to score on a careerlong, 78-yard run late in the second quarter to put Detroit ahead 14-0.“If you can get him to second level, he can do the rest,” Campbell said.After Detroit’s Jake Bates missed a 54-yard field goal, Chase McLaughlin made a 53-yard field goal to end the half and put the Bucs on the scoreboard.Bates did connect on a 58-yard field goal early in the fourth, knocking it in off an upright, to give the Lions a 24-9 lead.“They are a tough matchup for every team right now,” Bowles said. “We know about the loud crowd. We just didn’t execute, but they played a very good game.”The Lions are 13-3 in night games under Campbell and they’ve won five straight on Monday Night Football.Houston Texans 19-27 Seattle SeahawksJaxon Smith-Njigba had his NFL-leading fifth 100-yard receiving game of the season as the Seahawks beat the Texans 27-19 on Monday night.Smith-Njigba, who entered the game leading the league in receiving yards, gave Seattle a 14-0 lead late in the first quarter when he caught an 11-yard TD pass from Sam Darnold. Smith-Njigba celebrated his fourth touchdown catch of the season by dunking on the crossbar of the goalposts, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the process.In total, Smith-Njigba caught eight passes for 123 yards receiving. He became the second player in franchise history to record three straight 100-yard games, and his five 100-yard games this season are tied for the second-most in a year by any Seahawks player.Seattle struck first when RB Zach Charbonnet plunged in from one yard out on the Seahawks’ second drive of the game to give them a 7-0 lead. They had excellent field position thanks to LB Uchenna Nwosu sacking CJ Stroud for an 18-yard loss, which pinned the Texans at their own one-yard line. It was the third-longest sack in Seahawks franchise history.View image in fullscreenSeahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba celebrates his touchdown catch as an official signals and looks on during the first half of Monday’s game.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APCharbonnet punched in his second touchdown of the game, a two-yard rush, late in the third quarter to give the Seahawks a 27-12 advantage.Houston, meanwhile, scored their first touchdown of the game when Darnold was strip-sacked in his own end zone midway through the third quarter. Texans edge rusher Will Anderson Jr recovered the fumble in the Seahawks’ end zone, but Houston failed to convert its two-point conversion attempt.The Texans’ only offensive touchdown came courtesy of a four-yard TD pass from Stroud to running back Woody Marks with only 2:04 remaining in regulation.Ka’imi Fairbairn added two field goals for the Texans, whose two-game win streak was snapped and dropped to 2-4 on the year. Jason Myers, meanwhile, converted two of three attempts for the Seahawks, who advanced to 5-2 on the season and moved into a tie atop the NFC West with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams.The victory moved Seattle’s home record to 2-2. Last season, the Seahawks went 3-6 at Lumen Field. The Texans are 1-3 on the road.Explore more on these topicsNFLDetroit LionsTampa Bay BuccaneersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The cases against Tate for crimes including human trafficking and rape in both Romania and the UK, allegations Tate denies, have also been widely reported.The conversation about Tate, however, often misses the full spectrum of his messaging. What is he offering young men?We looked at his videos to find out.You are on slide 7 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.What is best-known about Tate are his views on women: he has described himself as a misogynist. But when we used a GenAI LLM to analyse transcripts of 640 videos from his channel on video site Rumble, we found that though Tate talks about women a lot, they’re not his biggest topic.We found that women came up a significant amount in about a fifth (21%) of his videos (highlighted in blue below).This is an example of a phrase that we identified as being about women:Women do not hydratevideo credit:Rumble | tatespeech% of sentences referencing women05102050You are on slide 8 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.But the topic Tate returns to much more frequently? Being rich.In twice as many videos (43%), he talks a significant amount about being rich, getting rich and other words related to success and money.This is a sentence we classed as being about success:I don't buy Ferraris to drive fast. I do sometimes, but if I'm in\n          London traffic, it's not to go quick. It's to show everyone else I'm\n          richer than them.video credit:Rumble | tatespeech% of sentences referencing success05102050You are on slide 9 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You only need to watch a few videos to find examples of Tate telling you how rich he is.You are on slide 10 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:Rumble | tatespeechVideo progressYou are on slide 11 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.The young men we spoke to acknowledge the appeal.You are on slide 12 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 13 of chapter 1.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Tate doesn’t just talk about being rich.

Or taking his top off.But the enormous success of his videos in 2020-21 helped popularise a blueprint for a generation of influencers making content aimed at men.Discussing Tate’s impact on the manosphere, Anki Deo, a senior policy officer at non-profit Hope not Hate says that this type of content used to be more niche:There is a debate now as to whether [the manosphere] still exists in its original form, which was this quite niche, private, cut-off space.

And getting rich, they claim, will solve your problems.Thousands of influencers have a similar message:Iman Gadzhi offers7 Principles for Teenagers to Become Millionaires.Jordan Welch explains how to turn $100 into a million dollars.Hamza offersNo BS advice on how to become a top 1% man.Sometimes this advice is presented as empowering.You are on slide 2 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:Youtube | Hamza97, ImanGadzhi; Rumble | tatespeechVideo progressYou are on slide 3 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.When you ask young people why they like influencers like Tate, the empowerment message is what comes up, says Deo of Hope not Hate:The answer often comes down to self-improvement – 'being a better version of myself'.\"It’s the belief that you actually do have agency and you can shape your world and you can change yourself. That’s appealing to them.\"Talking about Tate but missing this point caused young men to switch off, she said:The portrayal of Tate jars with them and doesn't fit with their perception, which then drives them away.\"One young man described what he saw in Tate, when his videos started turning up in his feed.You are on slide 4 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.That is echoed in the research of journalist Matt Shea, who has met a lot of Tate fans in the process of making several documentaries and writing a bookClown Worldabout Tate.So many of his followers will say, ‘I used to smoke weed and play video games all day, and Andrew Tate got me out of that.’“And that really does speak to young men – they are playing a lot of video games – but a lot of them feel guilt about that because they want to be succeeding and making money and moving forward in life.“There are definitely men who benefit from that tough love message, which maybe is lacking in our society of like, ‘get to work, you know, stop wasting your life’.”You are on slide 6 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Another thing Tate has helped popularise is an important manosphere business model: selling courses.Tate and many other influencers are not only offering advice, but selling it through online courses.The strapline of Tate’s $49 a month Real World course is: ‘I grew up broke and now I am a billionaire. I teach the deserving the secrets to modern wealth creation.’Iman Gadzhi sells business courses such as Six Figure Sales Rep and Pathway to Profits on his own e-learning platform educate.io for £30 a month.eLearning site skool.com offers courses ranging from ‘wisdom on life, business and leadership’ from a self-described former mafia boss, to an AI Cash Skool – To Unlock Multiple Income Streams Using AI at $20 and $5 a month respectively.These promises may sound suspiciously like ‘get rich quick’ schemes, but one young man described why he got pulled in by Tate's course.You are on slide 7 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 8 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Tate was still making £4.4m a month from the Real World platform in 2024, Sky News reported.Participants seem to have a harder time making money. A journalist from The Independent who subscribed to the Real World for a story, reported that one member claimed to have been posting Tate videos for months, hoping that they would go viral so he could get an affiliate link payout. When he finally got a signup, the member boasted that this first ‘big win’ earned him $11.Joshua Thorburn, who researches online misogyny at Monash University believes that many of these courses take advantage of men’s insecurities:A generally untold story about the manosphere is that it is in large part financed by men and boys who have fallen victim to grandiose promises or outright lies, suggesting that certain courses or products would make them rich, or socially and sexually successful.”Why are young men falling for it?You are on slide 9 of chapter 2.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Why does the promise of Lamborghinis in Dubai resonate so strongly with young men today?You are on slide 2 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 3 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.But while the expectation that a man should be able to pay for a house, car, wedding and kids has persisted from previous generations, the economic situation today makes it much harder to fulfil.Ben Rich, a senior lecturer in International Relations at Curtin University specialising in extremism and radicalisation, puts it this way:There is a growing number of men who feel very disempowered in their own lives. The traditional social contract that a lot of men were brought up with, is broken”For many young people of all genders the long path to a university degree paid for by debt, with an uncertain job market at the end, doesn’t seem like a good deal, or even an option.You are on slide 4 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Even in the last few years, that message has become more appealing.The pandemic and global wars have pushed up prices, from energy to eggs, on top of longer-running issues like the rising cost of housing and higher education that hit younger people hardest.In England, the average home in 2024 cost £290,000,7.7 timesthe average salary of £37,600.In 1997 it cost £58,750,3.5 timesthe average salary of £16,958, according tothe ONS.A degree used to be free and a secure route to a job, but it’s neither of those things now.

Traditional ideas of masculinity have been tied up with the money-making ‘provider’ role, and taking this out of most young men’s reach can make them feel a sense of failure. And also anger – they are being asked to live up to an unattainable standard.And that plays out in areas like dating.Regardless of the realities of the modern job market and advances in gender equality, one of our interviewees held the belief that women prefer to date wealthy men.He described a viral TikTok song last year - ‘I’m looking for a man in finance’.I'm looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6'5\", blue eyes.\n          Finance, trust find, 6'5\", blue eyes.video credit:TikTok | girl_on_the_couchYou are on slide 7 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 8 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.It’s easy to confirm a perception like this online – someone somewhere will have expressed an extreme opinion. Dating apps make this worse, says Jilly Boyce-Kay, a senior lecturer at Loughborough University researching feminism and popular culture:On dating apps your popularity – or lack of it – is painfully apparent and becomes so reduced to metrics: how many times you get swiped on, those kinds of things. Self-worth has become tied to these metricised, quantified ways in which people are ranked.”This means dating becomes another arena where some men feel they are doomed to fail, says Thorburn:Unless economic conditions improve or cultural attitudes shift to recognise that a man's wealth doesn't define him, this will continue to be an issue.”The young men we spoke to had positive things to say about traditional male roles. But, in this social media age, there was also a sense of confusion.You are on slide 9 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 10 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.GrievanceFor some men, disappointments can become grievances. One of the manosphere's most harmful aspects is how it channels these grievances at particular targets, for example feminism, as Ben Rich of Curtin University wrote in a 2023 article:The major problem [of the manosphere] lies in its diagnosis of the cause of male disenfranchisement, which fixates on the impacts of feminism.”He describes manosphere logic as zero-sum: if women make gains, it's at the cost of men.This zero-sum claim posits that female empowerment must necessarily equate to male disempowerment.”You can see what appears to be this misogynist fear in the message of a range of different influencers, the following clips are just a few examples.You are on slide 11 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:X | sneako; Youtube | JordanBPeterson, Hamza97Video progressYou are on slide 12 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This messaging has an impact.Some men – particularly younger men – are moving backward in their support of gender equality. Across the political spectrum, large percentages of men said feminism had ‘gone too far’, with men who reported the highest level of economic stress being most likely to oppose women’s rights, according to2024 report into the manosphereby the non-profit gender equality group Equimundo, which draws a direct link from manosphere content to these changing attitudes. In a 2023 survey, 53% of American men agreed that men in America have it harder than women.But people watching this kind of content usually start in a more innocent place.According to the same report, key searches that take young men into the manosphere are simple questions about fitness, gaming, career and finance, or sex and dating.One young man explained the relatable reasons he goes to the internet for help.You are on slide 13 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 14 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.However, what starts with a simple search can end up somewhere very different, particularly as social platforms are designed to keep users consuming more and more.You are on slide 15 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 16 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.If you’re spending 14 hours a day on TikTok, that’s not just a lot of exposure to influencers – it’s also 14 hours you are not connecting with people in real life. Not surprisingly, the rise in time spent online has caused a big fall in real-world interaction.That’s true for everyone but it has been particularly striking for young men.Gary Barker, president of Equimundo, says young men are suffering from a lack of friendship:We're seeing in lots of places, Europe, US, Australia, young men reporting a lot of friendship recession. When we compare young men and young women, there's a lot of guys telling us they have fewer people they can count on to tell personal stuff.“We have that as a trend that's been happening for 10, 15 years. Then Covid came along. Young men seem to have been slower to rebound”You are on slide 17 of chapter 3.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.As technology has accelerated, and policies like austerity have taken hold, spaces that allowed for real-world interaction have declined too.For example, approximatelyhalf of all youth clubsin England closed between between 2012 and 2019 due to government cuts. And Covid has changed habits.

But really all those things are part of their self-love, their sense of purpose and their happiness. They're not happy. That's it.\"Whether that's a young boy who's 13 and feels like he's not the cool one in school. Or maybe it's an older man who's divorced his wife, or his wife has cheated on him or something like that.\"Or maybe he's lost his job.\"Or maybe he has a great job, but having a job and doing a 9-5, is not being James Bond, which is what he thinks being a man should be.\"You are on slide 6 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Age of anxietyIn another era the message that everyone should stop having fun, work constantly and remain in a state of anxiety might not have been so popular.But something about this celebration of stress resonates. Young people suffer anxiety at a higher rate than everyone else, according to data from the US, UK and Australia.Inthe UK, a 2021 study estimated that28% of 16-29 year olds had anxietyin the last two weeks, compared with 16% of all adultsSimilarlyin the US, a 2024 studyfound27% of 18-29 year olds had anxiety symptomsin the past two weeks compared with 18% of US adultsInAustralia a 2020-22 studyfound that39% of 16–24 year olds had a mental health disorderin the last year, compared with 17% of all adultsYou are on slide 7 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Influencers like Tate validate men's experiences of fear and anxiety in a way that few other areas of society do.Tate often describes his own appeal this way, arguing that he says something that the rest of society doesn't: that life is difficult for men.You are on slide 8 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audiovideo credit:Rumble | tatespeechVideo progressYou are on slide 9 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Society can make it hard for men to express that they are struggling.You are on slide 10 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 11 of chapter 4.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.The manosphere claims to empower men, but it can damage them too.Getting rich is one of the solutions the manosphere offers for men’s unhappiness. But not everyone taking a digital marketing course will make a million pounds.In the meantime handing over cash for online courses and spending more and more time on a computer grinding to achieve unrealistic goals may exacerbate people's other problems.It can leave young men more confused and worse off than they were to start with.And once you’re in that world, it’s hard to get out.

Joshua Thorburn has looked at the experiences of people in these forums attempting to follow some of these strategies:If you're following their advice and nothing changes, the onus often falls back on you, not the strategies themselves.\"If you still believe that women are only attracted to alpha males, that means you'll probably blame yourself for not being an alpha male”Joshua Thorburn, Monash UniversityOne of our interviewees explained why he thinks everyone keeps going back for more.You are on slide 4 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 5 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.When the conversation around the manosphere doesn’t helpSome approaches to the manosphere can be simplistic: telling young men that the content is bad and that they are bad if they watch it.An example that one of our interviewees pointed out emerged with the media and political reaction to the Netflix show Adolescence. UK PM Keir Starmer backed a campaign to show the TV series – a drama about a young boy who murders a girl – in schools as a primer against toxic masculinity.You are on slide 6 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 7 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Experts in this space agree that it is challenging to have conversations with young people about this. Deo from Hope not Hate gave an example from her experience running focus groups in schools.There can be a point of tension – young men see themselves as trying to bring nuance into the conversation, whereas the young women are kind of refusing to engage and shutting it down.“So I think that's part of a wider conversation around identity politics and progressive politics. And that feeds conspiratorial thinking because it's like, well, why aren't we allowed to think about it? The polarisation gets reinforced from both sides.”There’s also disillusionment and a kind of hopelessness on the other side of the political spectrum, the Hope not Hate research found. ‘It was sad,’ Deo said, ‘seeing some young people with progressive and inclusive views [who] don't feel like their voice matters’.You are on slide 8 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 9 of chapter 5.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.You are on slide 1 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.What is the actual thing that's causing the ideology to take hold? Are you trying to treat the cause, or the symptom?\"Manosphere views may be extreme, but they are the symptom not the underlying problem, argues Ben Rich.He says that manosphere views such as Tate frequently expresses – that romantic relationships are a financial transaction between men and women, individuals are entirely responsible for their own success or failure and everyone else is a competitor – simply articulate the underpinnings of our neoliberal society:There's been a real acceleration in people feeling they can't rely on the state. They can't.\"Neoliberalism has led to an extremely alienated, atomised society. The emphasis is on you as the individual and your self-actualisation, you identifying your brand, your value-add.

Digital spaces are part of the problem, she says. Her research into groups like tradwives and ‘femcels’ traces how online spaces have also brought out reactionary politics and gender attitudes in women.I think there is something in the very architecture of digital culture: it's like a mirror world where the femcels mirror incels and these sort of ideas, that kind of bleakness and fatalistic view just gets reflected back and forth. There's something which tends towards this kind of inward hopelessness.\"A serious intervention in online platforms whose business models incentivise both extreme content and addictive behaviour is another avenue for change, she suggests.But though the big picture may be bleak, there are some hopeful stories.You are on slide 9 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.Leaving the manosphereOn an individual level, people move out of the manosphere in many ways. For those who have been pulled into the more misogynist dating-focused side, there seemed to be one clear path out:The most common theme in people who break out of the manosphere – they get a girlfriend\"Matt Shea, journalistSometimes even just talking to women made a difference. Thorburn studied the stories of people who had left the manosphere in a Reddit forum called ‘ex-red-pill’:A couple of people in the ex-red-pill forum basically said that for them, friendly relationships with women who they interacted, simply at work, were enough for them to start questioning those sexist, manosphere beliefs and realise that they weren't actually correct.\"Joshua Thorburn, Monash UniversityYou are on slide 10 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.For men drawn into the success and money side of the manosphere, the exit point could be simply doing the maths on the business proposals on offer:You are on slide 11 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.This article contains audio/>Video progressYou are on slide 12 of chapter 6.Use right arrow to continue.Alternatively, use the open square bracket key and close square bracket\n      key to navigate, and disable left arrow and right arrow\n      key navigation.For David Bartlett from Equimundo, just the fact that young men are talking about the problems they face is an opportunity:That the sense of vulnerability that young men are feeling is itself a cause for optimism – because I think they're open to a conversation about the things in their lives that don't feel right.\"So I think there's an opportunity there to say, I want to hear: I want to be in dialogue with you.

Here is how:Topic analysisWe used two GenAI large language models (LLMs). Videos were transcribed usingstable_whisper, an augmented version ofOpenAI’s Whisper. Transcripts were divided into passages of up to 80 words, grouped by time proximity. Each passage was classified using theMoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2.0-cmodel into one or more of three topics: “wealth,” “success,” and “women.” A topic is considered significant in a video if it appears in over 10% of passages.Image analysisScreenshots were taken from each video every four seconds, or more frequently for short videos. For each, the AI modelgoogle/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemblewas used to detect cigars, topless figures, and sports cars.

By Monday evening,Amazon saidall of its cloud services had “returned to normal operations”.But amid the chaos affecting vital services around the world, some more unexpected consequences arose.Amazon workers posted videos of themselves on TikTokrelishing a slower work day, with some dancing in quiet warehouses, while others told CNN they had been sent home.AWS outage: Amazon Web Services crash shows internet users ‘at mercy’ of too few providers, experts sayRead more“Working for Amazon Flex we’ve been sent home due to their systems not being able to check us in or release us with pay. Because of this outage there’s no telling if the 80 of us here are going to be paid,” James from Texas told the network.Tiffini in Florida said she was hoping to start her Amazon delivery route at 3.30am but the systems were down. “I submitted a ticket but there has been no confirmation that we will get paid for the blocks that we missed due to Amazon’s system issues this morning.”Other social media users described facing delays to medical and vet appointments, while some customers using Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, faced issues with their smart homes.“I use Alexa-enabled smart plugs to control the lamps in my room,” Christina, who uses crutches to get around, told CNN. “During the outage my smart plugs became unresponsive. Before I realised why the plug wasn’t working, I tried unsuccessfully to reset one of them. Now I can’t get it to work at all.”Some Alexa users, however, were quick to make light of the outage.“Due to the Amazon outage, Alexa wasn’t working this morning, so I had to stumble out of bed in the dark, find my way to the kitchen, and turn the coffee-maker on MANUALLY. I can’t live like this. You guys go on without me,” oneX user posted.“I had to turn on my light by hand without Alexa’s help. Rough start to the day,” another posted to Reddit.Some avid users of Duolingo, which records how many days in a row a customer has practised, known as “streaks”, were beside themselves with anxiety about their progress.Some threatened to “riot” if their streak was lost, others complained their 900+ day streak had reset to zero, while one poster on X took aim at Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos. “If I lose my 1,300-day Duolingo streak because of the pissing AWS [Amazon Web Services] outage, I will personally throw an egg at Bezos’ bald head.”Duolingo reassured customers on Tuesday theirstreaks would be safe.PSA: your streaks will be saved! thank you for your patience 💚🔥#awsoutagepic.twitter.com/tYvfLwzikJ— Duolingo (@duolingo)October 20, 2025For some, meanwhile, the outage ofweb services such as Canvas– an education tool – was cause for celebration.“Can’t grade on Canvas because Amazon Web Services is experiencing an outage.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Fenix 8 Pro takes thealready fantastic Fenix 8and adds in the new cellular tech, plus the option of a cutting-edge microLED screen in a special edition of the watch. It is Garmin’s top model and designed to be the only tool you need to more-or-less go anywhere and track anything.That makes it an extremely pricey proposition starting at £1,030 (€1,200, $1,200, A$2,300) for the 47mm OLED version and stretching to a colossal £1,730 (€2,000/$2,000/A$3,399) for the 51mm version with microLED display – almost twice the price of the regular Fenix 8.You do get a lot of watch for your money with best-in-class workout, activity and adventure tracking. The full offline maps of the globe can automatically guide you back on to the trail if you get lost without a phone, and look great on the large, sharp and super-bright touchscreen.View image in fullscreenThe Fenix 8 Pro is thicker and heavier than the standard Fenix 8 by 2.2mm and 4g respectively, and pretty chunky on the wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Fenix 8 Pro only comes in 47mm or 51mm case sizes, not the smaller 43mm version Garmin offers in other models, so it is a big watch for big wrists. But the 47mm OLED version as tested does have an extra day of smartwatch-use battery life even with the screen on all the time, lasting a solid eight to nine days between charges.Phone-free messaging, calls and live trackingGarmin has itsown inReach LTE (4G) and satellite subscription serviceinstead of relying on a watch plan linked to your phone provider, like other smartwatches. But unlike Apple or Google’s satellite-capable devices, emergency SOS messaging is not included for free.Instead, plansstart at £7.99 or equivalent a month, which provides unlimited LTE text and voice messaging, calls andLiveTracklocation sharing – so your friends or loved ones can keep an eye on you while out running, cycling or similar – plus emergency satellite SOS messaging.View image in fullscreenThe setup and activation of the inReach subscription is a fairly long-winded affair, but only needs to be done once.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCheck-ins and texts over satellite are then charged on top, with more expensive plans including various allowances of satellite use, climbing to a £50 a month unlimited plan. The watch comes with a 30-day free trial so you can test out the service.Once you have got it set up, you simply head out the door without your phone and the watch will connect to LTE. You can not use it for streaming music or similar, but you can make and take calls, send texts and generally keep in touch with your family and friends.View image in fullscreenHere are what messages look like on the watch and the recipient’s Garmin Messenger app, including texts, reactions, voice messages and transcriptions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWhen you text someone, Garmin sends them an SMS from a random phone number, which they can reply to back to your watch. If they install theGarmin Messenger app, you can then message back and forth via text or voice messages, and make voice calls. Your recipient does not need a Garmin account to use the Messenger app, just a phone number is sufficient to register for texts.Messaging on the watch works fine but typing out texts on the tiny on-screen keyboard is slow. It has a set of customisable canned responses you can send to speed things up. Voice messages and calls work OK, though as with most smartwatches, you’re not going to want to use it for extended conversations as the quality is not fantastic.LiveTrack is the most useful feature. You can configure it to automatically send a link to chosen contacts every time you start an activity, so they can follow your real time location on a map. It’s great for following race progress, but it mostly serves as a tool for someone you trust to know your whereabouts in case something happens. It has generally worked well, though the real location has sometimes lagged when moving in and out of good LTE signal.View image in fullscreenSending satellite messages requires that you point your watch in the right direction and face it to an unobstructed view of the sky.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAll of these features are available on other Garmin watches if you carry your phone with you, but in the places where LTE does not reach, the satellite kicks in on the Fenix 8 Pro to send texts, location check-ins and emergency SOS.A guide shows you how to find the line of sight to the satellite, which then sends and receives messages within about 10 to 30 seconds. It was surprisingly easy to use and could be a crucial lifeline, though it is important to note thatsatellite coverage is restrictedto the US mainland, most of Canada, and most of Europe except for parts of Scandinavia above 65 degrees north.SustainabilityThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via the support site. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Fenix 8 Pro costs from£1,029.99(€1,199.99/$1,199.99/A$2,299). The optional Garmin inReach subscription plans cost begins from£7.99(€9.99/$7.99/A$13.50).VerdictThe Fenix 8 Pro takes a fantastic adventure watch in the regular Fenix 8 and adds LTE for messaging, calls and LiveTrack – plus satellite messaging, check-in and emergency SOS for when you’re out of signal.The result is an even more impressive adventure tool for those that want to be phone-free. If you want to have someone keep an eye on you remotely while running out at night or in the middle of nowhere, the Garmin does so without needing anything else.It is quite freeing to be outside without a phone, but that capability comes at quite a cost, both in terms of the colossal price of the watch and the monthly subscription of the inReach plan to provide the service. At least it isn’t dependent on your phone provider so works with any brand of smartphone and network.The Fenix 8 Pro is a killer device for someone who hates being weighed down by their phone when running, cycling or hiking, but still wants to be trackable and contactable. For everyone else, it is a lot of money when the excellent Fenix 8 already exists.Pros:LTE and satellite messaging, super-bright OLED screen, tracks everything with best-in-class GPS, built-in torch, phone and offline voice control, 8+ day battery life, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping and routes, offline Spotify, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre diving, buttons and touch.Cons:extremely expensive, LTE and satellite features need monthly subscription, limited Garmin Pay bank support, voice features are slow, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches.Explore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will its new ‘PG-13’ guidelines make a difference?Tayo BeroThe content guardrails introduced this week feel like hollow posturing after the failure of past promisesTue 21 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 14.45 EDTShareFor months, Instagram has been struggling to convince parents, advocates and officials that it’s a safe place for kids, even though there’s a mountain of evidence to show quite the opposite. Now, the company isintroducingyet another set of guardrails that will supposedly keep teens on the platform safe. But going by their track record, parents shouldn’t be smiling yet.Starting this week, all users aged under 18 will automatically be placed into the 13+ setting, which restricts their feed to content that meets the standards of the US PG-13 movie rating.But Instagram’s failed past promises make this new content clampdown feel like just more hollow posturing so they canlooklike they’re actually doing something about the problem.Advocacy groups have been sounding the alarm for years about minors being exposed to content and people that they shouldn’t be, while the company rakes in over$100bn a yearin revenue. Meta itselfestimatedthat about 100,000 children using Facebook and Instagram were experiencing online sexual harassment each day. This is unsurprising, given that as of July 2020 (according to aninternal Meta chatmade public through a New Mexico lawsuit against the company), the actions being taken to prevent child grooming on the platform lay “somewhere between zero and negligible”. The New Mexico lawsuit alleges that Meta’s social networks – including Instagram – have become hubs for child predators. (Meta denies the core allegations andclaims the lawsuit “cherry-picked”from documents.)Last year, the company finally set up mandatoryInstagram teen accounts. Butnew researchled by a Meta whistleblower found that 64% of the new safety tools that came with Instagram teensweren’t effective.According to the study, 47% of young teen Instagram usersencountered unsafe contentand unwanted messages in a month, and 37% of 13- to 15-year-old users experienced at least one piece of unsafe content or unwanted message on a weekly basis, “including roughly 1 in 7 who were seeing either self-harm content, unwanted sexual content, discriminatory content, or alcohol and drug content weekly”.“These failings point to a corporate culture at Meta that puts engagement and profit before safety,” Andy Burrows, chief executive of the UK’s Molly Rose Foundation, which seeks stronger online safety laws, and was part of the team that conducted the research,toldthe BBC. A Meta spokesperson said the study “repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them”.Meanwhile, the measures the company put in place last year came after another significant moment for Meta’s public image: in January 2024, the heads of the world’s biggest social media companies were hauled before the US Senate to answer for their company’s safety policies. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO,apologisedto a group of parents who said their children had been harmed by social media.But Instagram has had years to get this right and it still seems to choose the way of letting children be harmed, and then saying sorry afterwards. On Monday,Reuters reportedthat thecompany’s own researchfound teens who said Instagram frequently made them feel bad about their bodies saw three times more “eating disorder-adjacent content” than others did. What’s worse, tech companies and social media startups have insinuated themselves so deeply into our lives that it’s virtually impossible to participate in society – especially as a kid – without them.So what’s the solution? First, it’s important to think seriously about online spaces as an extension of the real world and not just a digital approximation of it.Social mediaplatforms do not just replicate real life violence in digital form, they are also used as a vehicle to help furnish other forms of in-real-life harm, and children are most susceptible to this danger.Pushing lawmakers to compel these companies to incorporate safety measures as part of the design, and not as an afterthought, is one thing; but it’s also crucial that parents teach kids about online safety in the same way we would teach them about any other kind of safety when they are out in the world.The technologies these carnivorous companies create, leverage and very often abuse simply aren’t going anywhere. If we can’t trust them to protect their most vulnerable users, then it’s on us to do it ourselves.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsInstagramOpinionMetaChildrenSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

OpenAI has strengthened guardrails around replication of voice and likeness when individuals do not opt-in,” the statement read.Actor Sean Astin, the new president of Sag-Aftra, warned that Cranston “is one of countless performers whose voice and likeness are in danger of massive misappropriation by replication technology”.“Bryan did the right thing by communicating with his union and his professional representatives to have the matter addressed. This particular case has a positive resolution. I’m glad that OpenAI has committed to using an opt-in protocol, where all artists have the ability to choose whether they wish to participate in the exploitation of their voice and likeness using AI,” Astin said.“Simply put, opt-in protocols are the only way to do business and the NO FAKES Act will make us safer,” he added, referring to theNO FAKES Act currently being considered by Congress, which seeks to ban the production and distribution of AI-generated replica of any individual without their consent.OpenAI publicly supports the No FAKES Act, with the CEO, Sam Altman, saying the company is “deeply committed to protecting performers from the misappropriation of their voice and likeness”.Sora 2 does allow users to generate “historical figures”, defined broadly as anyone both famous and dead. However, OpenAI has recently agreed to allow representatives of “recently deceased” public figures to request that their likeness be blocked from Sora 2.Earlier this month OpenAI announced that they had “worked together” with the estate of Martin Luther King Jr and, at their request, was pausing the ability to depict King on Sora 2 as the company “strengthens guardrails for historical figures”.Recently Zelda Williams, the daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, pleaded with people to“please stop” sending her AI videos of her father, while Kelly Carlin, daughter of the late comedian George Carlin, has called AI videos of her father“overwhelming, and depressing”.Legal experts have speculatedthat generative AI platforms are allowing the use of dead, historical figures to test what is permissible under the law.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIBryan CranstonArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

At home, just breathing makes the air more humid, let alone cooking or showering.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And when it gets too humid, it’s bad for our health as well as our homes. In fact, the two are connected: humidity lets mould and dust mites flourish – and they, in turn, can trigger asthma and allergies.Dehumidifiers can make your indoor environment more comfortable by reducing the amount of moisture in the air. Because of this, they’re also a great laundry-drying hack. I use mine to dry clothes fast, and for a fraction of the cost of tumble drying.Not sure if you need one? You can buy a hygrometer cheaply –the one I used for testing cost less than £10– to check your home’s relative humidity and make an informed decision. Should you opt to buy one, do your research at reputable sources (like, hint, the Filter). Researching this piece, I was shocked to learn thatcustomers had been dupedinto buying very basic dehumidifiers for well over the odds.At a glanceBest dehumidifier overall:Ebac 4650e£329 at EbacBest budget dehumidifier:VonHaus smart dehumidifier with laundry mode£139.99 at AmazonBest combined dehumidifier and air purifier:Devola Platinum Hybrid DVHA20L£199.99 at DevolaBest dehumidifier for drying laundry:Duux Bora Smart£299 at AmazonBest quiet dehumidifier:MeacoDry Arete Two£299 at John LewisBest compact dehumidifier:Devola DVH12L£128.99 at DevolaWhy you should trust meI’m an award-winning consumer technology journalist with decades of experience testing electrical appliances; I’ve been reviewing gadgets for almost 30 years. I live in a terrace house with a lovely number of children and far too many pets, so there’s lots of laundry: I use a dehumidifier to dry clothes. I’ve also been known to use one for speedy DIY, drying plaster and paint faster.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach dehumidifier’s performance, energy consumption and noise levels were recorded.Photograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianI selected 14 dehumidifiers from leading brands to test, then set them up and used them, each for several days. I used a power meter to measure how much electricity (and therefore money and carbon) they use. Using the Sound Meter app, I measured the noise from 1m away in decibels (dB) on multiple occasions – the figures featured here are all the ones that I measured at home, in consistent conditions, so they often differ from manufacturers’ official figures, which are measured in lab conditions but in inconsistent ways. More subjectively, I paid attention to the quality of the sound – was it annoying, gurgly, hard to ignore, easy to fall asleep to? And I measured each dehumidifier’s size.To measure the room’s humidity while testing, I used a digital hygrometer held 1m away (though humidity would be roughly the same elsewhere in the room), and a thermometer to check the temperature. Dehumidifiers fill a tank with water they have extracted from the air, so one measure of how good a job they’ve done is to measure how much water is in there – which I did, using a jug.Because conditions vary from moment to moment and room to room, it was impossible to test each one in precisely the same conditions. As such, I’ve only mentioned the results of these not-so-scientific tests when they stood out.After testing, any dehumidifiers that weren’t collected by manufacturers were donated toFurnishing Futures, a charity that fully furnishes the empty social housing in which women and children are placed after surviving domestic abuse.The best dehumidifiers in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The GuardianBestdehumidifier overall:Ebac 4650eView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caramel Quin/The Guardian£329 at Ebac£329 at ArgosThis is the priciest dehumidifier on test, but it’s worth the money. It’s large but luggable, with a single deep handle on the rear that makes it easy to carry and an integrated cable tidy on the back that’s great when you want to store it.Why we love itI like the design. For example, a flap at the front opens to reveal a black water tank that’s easy to empty, with water coming out of just one hole (most water tanks are messier).The small display is colourful, and there’s a good range of modes, including laundry. A smart control feature remembers your home’s humidity levels and kicks in only when the levels start to rise: in a home that doesn’t have major damp problems, this will save a lot of electricity. It can be controlled via an app, and it also comes with an activated carbon filter for removing unwanted smells.Performance was good, bringing relative humidity down by 4% in a short time, and its capacity and smart controls make it a great all-rounder. You can simply leave it switched on and trust it to manage your home’s humidity levels without wasting electricity. The Ebac’s sound was inoffensive, too: I could definitely sleep with it on. It’s pretty energy efficient and it’s made in north-east England, so its carbon footprint is lower than some other models. It also comes with a four-year warranty if bought directly from the brand.It’s a shame that …there’s no window to inspect the fill level.Dimensions:34 x 27 x 54cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:18lTank capacity:3.5lPeak power use on test:180WAverage noise level on top setting:10dBTarget humidity range:35-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:5p/hourBestbudget dehumidifier:VonHaus smart dehumidifier with laundry modeView image in fullscreen£169.99 at VonHaus£139.99 at AmazonAt the time of writing, a discount code brings this dehumidifier’s price down to less than £150. Even at full price, though, it’s a bargain.Why we love itAlongside a laundry mode, there’s a sleep mode, which brought down volume levels from an already quiet 15dB to 10dB by slowing the fan speed, and turns off the screen so the lights won’t disturb you.Other modes include auto, which turns the machine off when it reaches the target relative humidity, and continuous, which means it won’t turn off until the tank is full. An app lets you control it from your phone or with Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Simple coloured lights on the front give a visual indicator of what mode it’s in.It’s a great all-rounder for the price. On test, it started cutting humidity levels within minutes, and over a couple of hours, it brought relative humidity down by at least 5%, pulling 450ml of water out of the air. It’s good for drying laundry and tackling damp – the only corner cut, when compared with pricier models, is Hepa air filtration.If you’re not sure whether or not to invest in a dehumidifier, this is a good buy for the price.It’s a shame that …it only has a washable dust filter, not Hepa air purification, even though there looks to be enough room for a larger filter.Dimensions:31 x 24 x 49cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4.5lPeak power use on test:290WAverage noise level on top setting:15dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:8p/hourBest combined dehumidifierand air purifier:Devola Platinum Hybrid DVHA20LView image in fullscreen£199.99 at Devola£199.99 at Aircon CentreKill two birds with one stone with this new hybrid model that promises cleaner as well as drier air. It comes with a Hepa filter (for filtering the air), an ioniser (for pulling dust out of the air) and an ultraviolet lamp (for killing germs).Why we love itSeveral models on test come with Hepa filters, but what sets this model apart is that it measures air quality too: simply press a button to get a traffic light measure of PM2.5 particles (green, blue or red light, depending on your air quality). Air pollution is a silent killer, andindoor air quality can be worse than outdoor, so filtering these fine particles is a brilliant idea if you don’t already have an air purifier.Dehumidifier modes include laundry and night (quieter at 20dB), and the flap on the top is motorised, so it opens automatically and can be set to “swing” to circulate air.It was great being able to see the air quality improve, as well as the humidity. The Devola is well designed, too: the water tank is accessed from the side and its handle doubles as a visual level indicator. And I found the tank easy to empty without making a mess.It’s a shame that …it’s not quieter.Hepa filterswill need replacing periodically, too (Devola suggests every six months, so budget about £15 a year).Dimensions:36 x 27 x 57cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:2.9lPeak power use on test:330WAverage noise level on top setting:30dBTarget humidity range:40-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:9p/hourBest dehumidifier for drying laundry:Duux Bora SmartView image in fullscreen£299.99 at Duux£299 at AmazonThis is a good-looking dehumidifier, with clean lines. The water drawer at the front has a useful visual indicator, so you can see at a glance how full it is.It features wifi and app control so that you can set schedules, and an activated carbon filter works to remove odours, gases and smoke.Why we love itI loved the four-hour laundry mode: it reduced relative humidity by 5% in the first five minutes, swiftly drying clothes. And you’ll be able to sleep nearby, since the Duux is Quiet Mark certified for its ultra-quiet operation. The night mode turns off the lights, although I had to turn down the fan speed myself – and in my tests it then reached an impressively low average of below 10dB, much quieter than the manufacturer’s claims. It sounds like a fan with a little bit of fridge sound thrown in, but quieter.I also like that it uses the environmentally friendlyR290 refrigerant, which has a lowglobal warming potential (GWP). In fact, its GWP is only triple that of carbon dioxide, while some refrigerants have a GWP that’s hundreds of times that of CO2 (andsome refrigerants now banned from salehave GWPs of thousands).It’s a shame that …it doesn’t offer Hepa air purification at this price.Dimensions:32 x 24 x 51cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4lPeak power use on test:270WAverage noise level on top setting:20dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:7p/hourBest quiet dehumidifier:MeacoDry Arete TwoView image in fullscreen£299 at John Lewis£299.99 at MeacoYou’d expect the successor to the popularArete Oneto be impressive, and this doesn’t disappoint. It’s not just a dehumidifier – it also purifies the air, thanks to the included dust and medical-grade H13 Hepa filters.Why we love itThe Arete Two can be controlled via a smartphone app or voice control via Google Home or Amazon Alexa. Modes include continuous, smart (which aims for a middle-of-the-road 55% humidity) and laundry. The louvre on top opens manually and can be directed at your washing.Its display is slightly unusual: rather than a number, it shows a sliding scale of humidity levels, giving you a clear visual indication of the current humidity and your target. The interface is intuitive, however, and there aren’t too many buttons.The five-year warranty is the longest I’ve seen for a dehumidifier. But most of all, I was impressed by the quiet. The average noise was just 5dB, and this went down to 4dB (considerably quieter than the manufacturer’s claimed noise level) in night mode. You can honestly forget that it’s on.It also has some thoughtful features. For example, if you leave it plugged in but not switched on, it will say “wet” on screen to alert you when it detects a relative humidity of 70% plus.You can also choose your type of air filtration when you buy refills (£39.99 for a pack of three). Replace the Hepa filter if you have allergies or pets; swap for an activatedcharcoal filterif you’d prefer to remove cooking smells, smoke and VOCs (chemicals that come off new furniture, paint, carpets and so on).It’s a shame that …the louvre isn’t motorised, considering the price.Dimensions:37 x 27 x 62cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:20lTank capacity:4.8lPeak power use on test:230WAverage noise level on top setting:5dBTarget humidity range:40-70%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:6p/hourBest compact dehumidifier:Devola DVH12LView image in fullscreen£128.99 at Devola£128.99 at Aircon CentreWhen compared with the other smaller (12-litre capacity) models on test, this extracted the most water from the air. It removed 200ml, reducing relative humidity by 5% in a short time. It also looks good.Why we love itPerformance is impressive for a small dehumidifier. And it’s especially impressive considering it comes with a Hepa filter for air purification, which is bound to slow airflow for dehumidification.It was pretty quiet and sounded like a fan. I could definitely sleep through its 5dB on low fan mode.Got enough space for a larger model? For only a little more, you can buy the larger Devola DVHA20L above, which features a built-in PM2.5 air quality monitor, so you can see the impact it’s having on air quality.It’s a shame that …the rear tank doesn’t have a visual indicator, so you can’t tell how full it is without pulling it out.Dimensions:30 x 23 x 47cm (WDH)Dailyextraction rate:12lTank capacity:2.7lPeak power use on test:180WAverage noise level on top setting:10dBTarget humidity range:30-80%Laundry setting?YesRunning costs:5p/hourThe best of the restView image in fullscreenExtracted moisture powerfully during testing: the ProBreeze dehumidifier.Swan low-energy dehumidifierView image in fullscreen£149 at Currys£149.99 at SwanBest for:looksThe Swan’s design is as elegant as its feathery namesake. It’s also a contender for best bargain when reduced.It didn’t make the final cut because …the powerful upwards fan and motorised flap make it great for drying laundry, but there’s no laundry mode, and the minimum target for relative humidity is 40% (many models go down to 30% and laundry mode is invariably 35% with a timer).You can still dry laundry by choosing 40% and setting a timer, but it seems like an oversight.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

As such, it uses more electricity but can be used in colder spaces, operating as low as 1C: perfect for a garage or shed. This one features an ioniser that helps cut airborne dust, and it’s compact, light and easy to carry. On test, it performed well, cutting relative humidity by 10% but raising the temperature slightly.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s good for garages, but since it uses twice as much electricity as condenser dehumidifiers, I wouldn’t use it in the home. It doesn’t display the humidity level, either.Dimensions:36 x 20 x 55cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:8l;tank capacity:2l;peak power use on test:690W;average noise level on top setting:40dB;target humidity range:40-60%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:18p/hourProBreeze Dehumidifier with Max Extraction and Laundry ModeView image in fullscreen£189.99 at ProBreeze£189.99 at AmazonBest for:powerful dryingAt the time of writing, the ProBreeze website had a discount code that brought this dehumidifier’s price down by £30, making it a bargain for such a workhorse. In my tests, it extracted moisture powerfully, bringing relative humidity down by more than 10% in a couple of hours.For £10 extra, you can get a version with smart app control.It didn’t make the final cut because …it uses quite a lot of electricity, even on low power mode. And although it was fairly quiet (15dB on low fan mode), there was an annoying low hum as well as the fan noise.Dimensions:32 x 20 x 58cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:20l;tank capacity:5.5l;peak power use on test:360W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:9p/hourDevola DV12LView image in fullscreen£119.99 at Aircon Centre£119.99 at DevolaBest for:clever designI liked the way this affordable dehumidifier looked, and loved the little notch at the top of the rear water tank. It means that, when dry, you can stow the power cable in there, making this an easy machine to store.A light-up ring on the front indicates relative humidity at a glance: green for good, red for too humid, blue for too dry.It didn’t make the final cut because …I preferred the newer Devola DVH12L, which also has a Hepa filter for air purification.Dimensions:26 x 22 x 47cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2l;peak power use on test:180W;average noise level on top setting:25dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourHoneywell TP FitView image in fullscreen£139.99 at Aircon Centre£139.99 at AmazonBest for:the smallest dehumidifierThis was the smallest on test, so it could be worth considering if you only want to use it occasionally and need to stow it away most of the time. The dust filter is washable, and while there’s no true sleep mode (there’s one that dims the lights, but it doesn’t reduce noise), most of the lights turn off after a minute, and it’s not too loud.The comfort mode targets a relative humidity based on the temperature, and its front water drawer gives a visual indication. I also like that it uses the environmentally friendly R290 refrigerant, which has a low GWP.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t reduce humidity as much as some, collecting just 150ml overnight. Also, unusually, I spilled some water when carrying it after testing.Dimensions:28 x 24 x 39cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2.5l;peak power use on test:180W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-90%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourMeaco 12 LEView image in fullscreen£166.93 at Aircon Centre£189.99 at MeacoBest for:compact air purificationThis has excellent features, including top-notch air filtration and a three-year warranty from some retailers. Like its big sibling, the MeacoDry Arete Two (above), it purifies the air thanks to an included medical-grade H13 Hepa filter and dust filter. TheHepa filter is optional, and it will need replacing (about every three months) if you want to use it. Budget £40 a year for refills.It didn’t make the final cut because …you can’t see whether the air purification is working. For only a little more, you can buy the larger Devola DVHA20L, which features a built-in PM2.5 air quality monitor. I also didn’t like the looks, finding the green and white a bit clinical.Dimensions:32 x 24 x 49cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:12l;tank capacity:2.5l;peak power use on test:200W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:5p/hourBlyss Madden WDH-316DBView image in fullscreen£190 at B&Q£190 at TradePointBest for:easy carryingThis has a daily extraction rate of 16 litres, which isn’t the weediest but is one of the smaller models on test. It has a simple handle across the full width that’s well balanced. If you find it difficult to carry heavy items up and down stairs, choose a smaller model like this.I liked the display, with relative humidity and temperature shown inside a cartoon house. And there’s a fan swing function that helps with drying laundry.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s no sleep function, although it’s fairly quiet.Dimensions:30 x 19 x 47cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:16l;tank capacity:2.4l;peak power use on test:230W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:50-70%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:6p/hourBlack+Decker BXEH60014GBView image in fullscreen£179 at Currys£159 at AmazonBest for:smart controlsI liked the Black+Decker’s design, from the coloured light at the top that indicates humidity (red for high, green for good, blue for low) to the large, white digits on its front that tell you the precise relative humidity.These quick-glance displays work well when it’s paired with the app, so you can control it from afar. You can even add Google Home and Amazon Alexa voice controls. I could use my phone as a remote control from anywhere in the home to check on progress – rare for a dehumidifier at this price point.It didn’t make the final cut because …the machine was loud at times (although the sleep setting averaged 17dB).Dimensions:34 x 24 x 57cm (WDH);dailyextraction rate:20l;tank capacity:6.5l;peak power use on test:395W;average noise level on top setting:20dB;target humidity range:30-80%;laundry setting?Yes;running costs:10p/hourWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenYour home’s ideal relative humidity is 40-60% in summer and 30-50% in winter.What is relative humidity?Relative humidity is the percentage of water vapour in the air compared with the maximum that the air can hold.Warm air can hold more water vapour than cold air. So if the amount of water in the air stays the same but the temperature drops, relative humidity increases.When relative humidity hits 100%, the air is fully saturated, and water condenses on surfaces, like how dew condenses on cool morning grass.What humidity should I aim for?All the dehumidifiers tested here measure the relative humidity (a percentage) and let you set a target.If the air is too humid, it feels muggy, and it’s hard for sweat to cool you on a hot day. If the air is too dry, it can lead to problems such as dry eyes and throats.For your health and your home, the ideal relative humidity is 40-60% in summer and 30-50% in winter.Do I need a dehumidifier?You might benefit from a dehumidifier if you have damp and mould problems. Humidity helps mould and dust mites flourish – and they, in turn, can trigger asthma and allergies.Another benefit is to dry laundry fast. Use a dehumidifier to pull moisture out of the air, then clothes in the room dry much faster and without causing damp problems such as condensation on windows or walls.Dehumidifiers are also good for specific uses, such as drying paint or plaster faster, or helping a room dry out after flooding.If in doubt, usea cheap hygrometerto check your home’s relative humidity and make an informed decision.What are the different types of dehumidifier?Most of the dehumidifiers tested here arecompressor dehumidifiers, so they work a bit like a fridge, compressing and then expanding a refrigerant to cool a metal coil. Water from the air then condenses on the coil and drains off into a water tank. These are usually the best style of dehumidifier for the home.Don’t throw away the plastic tube if you find one in the box. Some models come with a drain hose – so you can constantly dry rather than stopping when the tank is full. Other models let you add a hose if you need it (but most people don’t use them, which is why they’re not always included).I tested onedesiccant dehumidifier. These excel in cold environments, such as garages, cellars and outbuildings. This is because they work by using moisture-absorbing materials that don’t rely on temperature to remove humidity. However, they use more electricity to do so. They don’t require refills (none of the units featured here need refills for dehumidification – the only ongoing cost apart from electricity is that some have Hepa air filters that need replacing every three to six months).Peltier dehumidifiersare small and quiet, but they’re not very effective and they use more energy, so we haven’t featured any in this roundup.What size dehumidifier do I need?The larger (20l a day) models tested here are good for larger homes and open-plan spaces. You can put them somewhere central to tackle humidity in the whole home.The smaller (12l a day) models are very popular and better for smaller homes or single tasks, such as drying laundry. However, if you have persistent damp problems, then it could be worth sizing up.You can add a hose to most dehumidifiers if you want to keep them in constant use without having to empty the tank.How much does a dehumidifier cost to run?I measured each dehumidifier’s power use on the top setting, in watts (W). Electricity costs are in kilowatt hours (kWh). For example, if you’re running a 200W dehumidifier for four hours, it would use 800Wh or 0.8kWh.The energy price cap for 1 October to 31 December 2025 is 26.35p a kWh. Multiply this by the last figure and you’ll discover it costs 21p to run the dehumidifier for four hours.This compares favourably with a tumble dryer.One load in a traditional model uses about 4.5kWh (£1.19), although an energy-saving heat pump model uses half that. Either way, it’s much cheaper to run a dehumidifier than either type of tumble dryer.What’s a laundry mode?Many dehumidifiers have a laundry mode that aims for a low relative humidity of 35%, with a timer that turns off automatically, typically after six hours.To dry laundry effectively, hang it in a room, turn on the dehumidifier and close the doors. That way, it’s drying the air (and speeding the laundry drying) without having to dry moister air that comes in from the outside world.For more, read the Filter’s guides:The best heated airers, testedThe best electric heatersThe best electric blankets to keep you toasty for lessCaramel Quin is a journalist specialising in consumer technology.

Channel 4’s first AI presenter is dizzyingly grim on so many levelsThe AI-generated host of Dispatches raises worrying questions about Channel 4’s environmental impact. She’s also a dead-eyed host who might leave Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Kevin McCloud fearing for their futureStuart HeritageTue 21 Oct 2025 07.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.31 EDTShareLast night’s Dispatches was called Will AI Take My Job? Usually when something like this employs a question mark in the title, it’s because the answer is no. Not this time, though, because the sheer overwhelming inevitability of AI taking our jobs is genuinely painful to think about.According to the film, 8m jobs in the UK alone are at risk of being outsourced by AI. Call centre workers, translators, graphic designers – anyone who isn’t a masseur or a scaffolder, basically – will soon be made redundant by a technology that, despite its catastrophic effect on the environment, is growing more sophisticated by the hour. My days are almost certainly numbered; it stands to reason that I will soon be replaced by the ChatGPT prompt “Be performatively exasperated about whatever was just on the telly”. Grok could even whip up a byline photo of an unpleasantly smug egg to go with it. Nobody would be any the wiser.But if we know AI is going to render us all useless, why would anyone watch Dispatches? Unless they get a perverse kick out of reinforcing all their darkest beliefs about the future of humanity, surely there was very little to be excited by. But the film anticipated this, and reacted with a cute little rug-pull of its own. The episode was presented by a journalist called Aisha Gaban. But, get this, she was AI all along.That’s right, Channel 4 justTilly Norwooded itself. There was not a single human thing about Gaban. She was an entirely computer generated presence. But despite being a bundle of pixels and code, she was a fairly convincing host. Sure, she was dead behind the eyes, and her mouth couldn’t animate sibilance very well, but she looked more or less human and nailed the stilted cadence of the television documentarian. What a lark. That person you trusted as a figure of authority? Not even a person! Joke’s on you, fleshbag.The meat of the show itself was diverting enough, taking four professionals – a doctor, a lawyer, a musician and a photographer – and pitting them against the best that AI can offer. The thrust of the results seemed to be that while humans are better, AI is quicker and cheaper. And, given that avarice is the motivating factor for every industry, this means that we are all royally screwed.Admittedly, some of the technology made sense. A tool that can diagnose patients in half the time of a traditional GP, for example, has the potential to support human medics who are already buckling under the strain of a broken system. But who the hell needs an AI photographer? Surely the point of AI is to remove drudgery from our lives, not automate creativity. The existence of AI photographers points to a horrifying future where we’re all doomed to work in full service of machines that puke out crap art for ever.But anyway, this was all a sideshow to Aisha Gaban, apparently Britain’s first AI television host. And honestly, it was hard to see her as anything but Channel 4’s attempt to have its cake and eat it. Not only did it get to show off its swanky new toy, but it also got to tut-tut at the technology that created her. What an ingenious trick.It was even harder to see the film as anything other than a stark warning to all the other Channel 4 presenters. Hey Krishnan Guru-Murthy, you’d better not complain about office snacks in the future, or you’ll be sacked in favour of a blinking mannequin we’ve programmed to read an Autocue. And no contract disputes from you, Kevin McCloud, because we can replace you with a virtual avatar that can frown at terrazzo worktops without ever needing a loo break.And that’s without mentioning the environmental cost of it all. It would have been nice if Dispatches had Gaban end the show by detailing exactly how much water was used to run the datacentre that created her, especially given Channel 4’s longstanding commitment to achieving net zero.All in all, it made for a dizzyingly grim watch on multiple levels. And given the speed with which AI is improving, this will only get worse. Three years from now you’ll be getting ChatGPT to give you a bullet-pointed precis of an AI-generated criticism of a show that was presented by AI-generated hosts, while you dig in the dirt for worms to feed your family. Still, it was nice while it lasted, wasn’t it?Explore more on these topicsTelevisionArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starmer wasequally effusive, gushing: “This deal shows that our plan for change is working –bringing in investment, driving growth, and putting more money in people’s pockets.”Four months later, and the tech company was left scrambling to fix a devastating global outage on Monday that left thousands of businesses in limbo – and shed light on the UK government’s reliance on its cloud computing business,AmazonWeb Services (AWS).Figures compiled for the Guardian hint at the British state’s increasing reliance on the services of the giant US internet group, which has also drawn criticism from unions and politicians about working conditions within its logistics and internet retailing business.AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016 – during which time it has invoiced about £1.4bn, according to the figures compiled by Tussell, a public procurement intelligence firm.The research group added that “35 public sector authorities currently use [AWS] services across 41 contracts worth a combined £1.1bn.

The first thing you do is feed on the cop who finds you, before smacking his partner into a wall so hard that his blood spatters the brick. A violent fanged rampage ensues, where you beat up and tear apart rival undead and their ghouls while currying the favour of the local court of vampires, and trying to keep your existence hidden from the mortal populace of this sultry city.But this is also a detective story: there’s a younger night-stalker sharing your brain, a voice in your head named Fabian, who talks like a 1920s gumshoe (presumably because he once was one). Fabian isn’t violent at all; he evidently works with the human police and the vampire underworld, snacking on consenting volunteers’ blood and using his mind-delving powers to solve murders. These two stories are two entirely different games in the same setting, but then everything about Bloodlines 2 feels stitched awkwardly together. It is unfortunate that I happen to be playing this right after bingeingAMC’s Interview with the Vampire TV series, because the contrast is stark. One is a masterful, frightening, sexually charged and deftly comic reimagining of vampire mythology. The other isOK.View image in fullscreen‘My interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveAppropriately, the development of this vampiric saga appears to have been cursed. The first Bloodlines game was a cult classic PC role-playing game released in 2004, and it took more than a decade for a sequel to get off the ground. Bloodlines 2’s development began in 2015 at Seattle-based Hardsuit Labs, led by the first game’s writer. But the development was fraught with difficulties, and in 2021 the whole project got passed on to a new developer, The Chinese Room. What has resulted is an interesting cut-and-shut job with elements of Hardsuit’s version of the game woven together by The Chinese Room into a 25-hour story that just about makes sense. It’s not a total bust, but there are a lot of evident loose ends.For example, there is a giant screenful of vampire abilities that you can learn, evidently intended to give you some choices about how you approach the game – seduction, brute strength, manipulation. But you start off already super powerful, and you get the most fun mind-control and neck-snapping dark powers in the first couple of hours, giving you little reason to learn more. When I tried to do something interesting with these abilities – such as possessing mortal prey on the street, or interrogating someone by breaking into their head – the game often refused to comply.And though my interactions with my vampiric brethren have been interesting, my interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling. Walking down the streets you’ll hear sex workers shout “Just gotta pay off these college fees!” to nobody. A businessman sitting on a bench opened with the line “Want to get into business together? Sexy business?”, then got up and followed me around the streets saying “I can’t wait to fuck you!” until I got so annoyed that I ate him. I know that vampires see mortals as inconsequential puppets, but not like this.View image in fullscreen‘Some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveBizarre, out of place non-player character behaviour is not the only thing about Bloodlines 2 that feels extremely late 00s. It reminds me of the spate of awkward-but-interesting first-person games that followed 2000’s Deus Ex, and not just because of the outdated animation. Gliding with unnatural speed across the rooftops of Seattle is fun, which is just as well, as most of the game’s missions have you pootling back and forth across the city talking to people. But when you encounter ghouls – and there areso manyof them – you get drawn into some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades. It is so unfun that I knocked the difficulty down to easy after the first few hours so that these annoying skirmishes would be over faster.There is an OK vamp story hiding in here; careful, dicey conversations with dangerous fellow vampires are by far the most interesting thing that Bloodlines 2 has going for it. And I enjoyed some parts of Seattle, particularly the dive bars packed with people gyrating to (of course) goth music. The Chinese Room has managed to make something playable and vaguely interesting out of a game development disaster. But after the first few hours, I kept going more out of morbid curiosity than enjoyment.Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is out 21 October; £49.99/$59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesAction gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But his own country looks a lot like itDaniel MendiolaThe US president’s efforts to consolidate power are strikingly similar to historical authoritarian moves in CaracasTue 21 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 13.35 EDTShareHere in the Americas, we have a peculiar tradition. Every time there is a major election, prominent figures on the right find themselves compelled to repeat some version of the vaguely menacing prediction: if the candidate for the left wins, we will become “the next Venezuela”.WhetherBrazil,Peru,Mexico,ColombiaorEcuador, countries throughout the western hemisphere keep this tradition. Donald Trump has also participated in this ritual, proclaiming during the 2024 election cycle that if Kamala Harris won, our country would become “Venezuela on steroids”.Oddly spoken with disdain.Harris, of course, lost the election, so we will never know how Venezuela-esque her version of the US might have been. But we are seeing Trump’s America, and the reality is: it’s looking a lot like Venezuela.The Guardian view on the US and Venezuela: Trump’s ‘war on drugs’ ramps up military threats to Maduro | EditorialRead moreSince the 1998 election ofHugo Chávez– a charismatic yet polarizing leftwing figure – political discourses have shrouded Venezuela in conflicting layers of partisan caricature, often making it difficult to parse what is actually happening. At this point, however, there is no doubt that the country is in crisis.Migration statistics alone provide compelling evidence.Amnesty Internationaland theUN refugee agencyestimate that nearly 8 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 – as much as 25% of the population.Hyperinflationandfood shortageshave driven this exodus, compounded by authoritarianism andincreasing repressionunder Chávez’s successor,Nicolás Maduro, who has held on to power since 2013 through elections with overwhelmingevidence of fraud.Significantly, the US has hardly been an innocent bystander. Not only have we frequently doled outreprehensibletreatment to Venezuelanasylum seekers, but we have also played a role in creating the conditions that are forcing people to migrate in the first place. The US has maintained a belligerent stance toward Venezuela for more than two decades – for example, supporting ashort-lived coupto overthrow Chávez in 2002, as well as hitting the country withsanctions– and the Trump administration has recently escalated the conflict by ordering a series of deadly strikeson civilian boatssuspected of smuggling drugs off the Venezuelan the coast. Reports also indicate that Trump is consideringan interventiontodepose Maduro, and the CIA may already be carrying outcovert operationsin the country.Journalists and legal analysts have done excellent work explaining how these strikes are illegal according to US andinternationallaw, in addition to beingmurderously cruel. There has also been great coverage of how the demonization of Venezuelan immigrants – including a steady stream of propaganda painting Venezuelan immigrants asgang membersandterrorists– has long been a centerpiece of Trump’s platform.These actions are disgraceful on their own terms. But they are also bitterly ironic: even while terrorizing Venezuelans in the name of defending democracy, Trump has, in fact, been running a strikingly similar authoritarian playbook. Noteworthy parallels include dismantling constitutional limits on presidential authority, manipulating electoral districts to inflate his party’s representation in Congress, and using state power to repress political opponents.In Venezuela’s case, the story begins with a fraught referendum.Immediately upon taking officein 1999, Chávez decreed anew executive power: the ability to call for a referendum on writing a new constitution. The legality of the claim was dubious given that the Venezuelan legal system already had mechanisms for updating the constitution, and a simple majority popular vote was not one of them. Nonetheless, the Venezuelan supreme court relented, and when the referendum passed, Chávez asserted a heavy hand in creating the process for how a constitutional assembly would work. Moreover, he unilaterally gave this assemblyoutsized powersto govern, suspending Congress and the supreme court in the meantime. Unsurprisingly, the resulting constitution of 1999 expanded executive authority considerably, and the entire process established a precedent to continue using these largely hand-pickedconstitutional assembliesto overrule congress whenever the opposition gained ground.Trump’s bullying of Latin America isn’t part of any plan – he doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing | Simon TisdallRead moreWhile there are, likewise, calls for aconstitutional conventioncoming from Trump allies that could function in a similar way, this hasn’t actually been necessary in the US. Rather, the conservative supermajority on the supreme court has managed to effectivelydo the same thingon its own: repeatedly ignoring plain text as well as its own precedent in order to assign new powers to the presidency while at the same timeeviscerating longstandingchecks from other branches of government andindependent agenciesalike. In short, even without literally rewriting the constitution, the supreme court has in practice served as a comparable constitutional assembly, fundamentally reshaping constitutional norms to create a “unitary executive” with fewer checks on executive power than ever before.Taking this comparison even deeper, there are also important parallels in Trump’s efforts to stack Congress through “gerrymandering”: a trick that hinges on exploiting the mathematical quirks of single-member, winner-take-all districts. For example, in a system where every district has an isolated winner-take-all race, even if one party gets 49% of the vote across the country, that does not mean that it will end up having 49% of the representation in Congress. In fact, if each district is a perfect microcosm of society with 49% of voters supporting this party, it could actually end up with zero seats in congress, despite representing roughly half the population.In short, single-member, winner-take-all districts have the potential to massively inflate or deflate a party’s overall electoral showing, depending on how the voters are distributed among the districts. And if the party in power gets to redraw the districts, they can easily rig the game. Knowing full well the consequences, the US supreme courtblessed this approachduring Trump’s first term, and now at a time when Republicans have a clear advantage in controlling redistricting, the justices are poised tomake it even easier. Within this context, Trump ispushingRepublican-governed states to capitalize.Significantly, Chávez’s early efforts to consolidate power used a similar mechanism. Though under-appreciated now, Venezuela’s earlier election system under its1961 constitutionactually included a clause guaranteeing minority representation, and officials developed a clever method to allocate seats roughly proportional to a party’s overall support. This made gerrymandering impossible, limiting the ability of the ruling party to press their advantage by further manipulating districts. In 1999, however, Chávez’s constitutional assembly eliminated this system, changing the rules so that most congressional seats would instead come from winner-take-all districts. The effect –at least in the short termwhile Chávez consolidated power – was to considerably inflate his party’s congressional representation.Trump disdains conservatism. His governing philosophy is absolute power | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreAlong with expanding executive power and manipulating congressional elections, a third commonality – repression of political opponents – needs little explanation. Even before Maduro apparently resorted to overt election fraud, the Chávez governmentfaced accusationsof intimidating judges andarresting oppositioncandidates. Vocal critics of the government have also reported heavy-handed tactics from formalmilitaryandparamilitaryforces alike.As we now watch Trumpdeploy troopsin Democratic-led cities across the country; turn federal agencies such asIceand into personalsecret policewho operate with impunity; and push to systematicallyarrest political opponents, the parallels are obvious.Ultimately, while there is every reason to believe that Venezuela is in crisis, there is no reason to believe that Trump’s military aggression will have any benefit for the people of either country. The bottom line: the Trump administration has demonstrated time and time again that it has no qualms about wreaking havoc on Venezuelan civilians – noron its own. Trump’s abuses of power at home and in the Caribbean are two sides of the same coin. We must condemn both.Daniel Mendiola is a professor of Latin American history and migration studies at Vassar CollegeExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionHugo ChávezNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

At least that’s what could, and probablyshouldbe revealed, preferably as early as possible.Seem dramatic? It isn’t. Though Bend It Like Beckham brilliantly tackles issues around racism, gender norms, homophobia, culture, immigration, and feminism with an endearing comedic twist, a core point of the plot rests on an adult coach pursuing a romantic relationship with a teenage player. In 2025, after multiple high-profile instances of inappropriate player/coach relationships have been reported in women’s soccer, and after the harm inherent in those relationships has been exposed, the normalization of one in a celebrated film is hard to ignore.For those who came in late, Bend It Like Beckham tells the story of Jess (Parminder Nagra) and Jules (Keira Knightley), two London high schoolers who love soccer. Jules has talent, plays for a seemingly high-level local team (Hounslow Harriers), and dreams of playing college soccer in the United States.Bend It Like Beckham follow-up in pipeline more than 20 years after original film was releasedRead moreJess, too, loves soccer, has talent, and pins posters of David Beckham on her bedroom wall. Jess is from a middle class Punjabi family and must meet the added challenge of overcoming her family’s initial reluctance for her to pursue soccer with the Harriers and, eventually, a college career in the US.Narrative conflict between Jess and Jules erupts when the girls realize they’re infatuated with the same man – their charming coach, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who would be close to a decade older than the girls.“Do you like him?” Jess asks Jules.“Nah,” responds Jules. “He’d get sacked if he was caught shagging one of his players.”So there is at least some awareness of the problem here. And yet …Later in the film, the girls’ team travels to a tournament in Germany, where they are invited to a nightclub by their opponents. There appears to be little supervision of the young players by anyone except Joe, Rhys-Myers’ character. The coach seems in his element on the dancefloor after a few drinks, dancing with the players supposedly in his care. It’s obvious Joe desires Jess, even though the nightclub contains hundreds of potentially consenting adults for him to pursue for post-game shenanigans if that was his goal. But no. Jess is his target.Outside the club, Joe and Jess are prevented from taking the relationship to another level – not by a sudden realization that the power dynamic is off the rails, but rather when they’re interrupted by Jules, who spots the pair and yells “You bitch!” at Jess.“Nothing happened,” Jess later explains to her older sister.“You make sure it doesn’t, alright?” her sister responds. The issue for Jess’s sister, though, is that the coach is white, rather than his age. Jess potentially being groomed by her coach isn’t discussed as a potential problem.These are all straightforwardly problematic situations to today’s eyes. It’s jarring to see them essentially ignored. It’s possible the husband-and-wife writing team of Gurinder Chadha (who also directed) and Paul Mayeda Berges were simply being prescient about what was to be revealed about women’s soccer over the next two decades or so. Similar issues really were swept under the rug by a lot of people that should have known better. If the sequel is similarly faithful to its era of release, it’s going to be must-see (and not at all kind to Coach Joe).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If we stick with the original timeline, and real life parallels, Santa Clara will be conference champions in 2003, 2004, and 2006 featuring those players developed and coached back in England. The team will make the NCAA final four in 2004. The London girls may encounter Aly Wagner, a 2002 Santa Clara graduate who would go on to play for the US women’s national team. They’d be teammates with Jordan Angeli, who went on for a pro career in the NWSL and is now a well-known commentator.After they graduate, they may also eventually meet a talented Santa Clara recruit named Meleana “Mana” Shim who will later play in the NWSL – and speak out against her former coach Paul Riley for his alleged inappropriate behavior with players. Jess and Jules may eventually readthe 2021 Yates Report that detailed Shim’s experience at Portland Thornswhere Riley made “persistent and unwanted advances and his retaliation against her,” or an internal report from the Thorns that explained how the coach: “sent ‘inappropriate texts’,’ served alcohol to players, invited ‘a player to his hotel room,’ and danced ‘with a player and touch[ed] her while doing so,’ among other things.”Maybe, now several years later in the timeline, the Hounslow Harriers players would see some parallels with their own experience. Perhaps they’ll report Joe’s behavior – including excessive punishment for Jess on the training ground, having made her run enough to aggravate an injury. Not that the club – or local football associations or confederations – would pay attention to the complaints.That is a story that could be pulled straight from real life headlines.Believe it or not, I’m not trying to cancel Bend it Like Beckham, or its sequel. The original film should continue to be celebrated – for reasons it already has been, and also as an exquisite story-of-its-time example of how abuse in sport thrives in plain sight.“It’s OK,” Joe tells Jess, who has just graduated from high school, as Bend It Like Beckham heads toward its conclusion. “I’m not your coach anymore. We can do what we want.”You always could, Joe.Explore more on these topicsFootballWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s possible overhaul would be disastrousBahati KanyamanzaI fled war at 14 and decades later became a US citizen. Now I fear racism and exclusion could become official policyTue 21 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 14.14 EDTShareLast week,leaked documentsfrom the Trump administration reportedly revealed plans to gut the US refugee program, not only capping refugee resettlement at arecord lowof 7,500, but also transforming it from a life-saving humanitarian system into one that favors white South Africans and Europeans over the world’s most vulnerable people. As a refugee who found safety and belonging in this country, I broke into a sweat reading the news. Memories of my own journey rushed back, now mixed with a deeper fear that racism and exclusion are not just social undercurrents, but official policy.I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and fled war at 14, spending nearly two decades in a refugee camp in Uganda before finally being resettled in the United States. Here, I reunited with my family, built a new life, and became a citizen. My story is one of patience, resilience and gratitude for a country that gave me safety and the chance to rebuild my life and give back.Despite these troubling political developments, I still love my country and wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. Historically, generosity, welcoming and caring for people fleeing violence, war and persecution have been America’s core values.Refugees and immigrants like mehave benefited from these values when we were welcomed into this nation, and passed them on to our children. Since 1975 a total of3.7 millionrefugees have been resettled in the United States. Refugees and immigrants are our neighbors and community members. We provide essential services in hospitals caring for people, in the military defending and protecting our nation, in restaurants, hotels and airports, and as workers on farms feeding the American people. We build houses and construct roads and highways so we can all safely make it home to our families. These services make everyone’s daily lives better while driving our nation’s socio-economic development.The current administration conveniently ignores this. This week’s reports unfortunately fit into the pattern we’ve seen as Donald Trump looks to fundamentally upend our refugee systems. The presidentsuspended the United States Refugee Admission Program(USRAP) on his first day in office, leaving120,000 refugeeswho were conditionally approved to travel to the US in limbo, and frozefunding to refugee agenciesproviding critical services. The International Refugee Assistance Project is currently engaged in a class-action lawsuit challenging this suspension in the casePacito v Trump.In May, the Trump administrationprioritized the admission of Afrikanersdespite the suspension of USRAP, showing preference for one group instead of others, some of whom have been waiting a decade or more.The administration alleges that part of its rationale for doing all of this is an unfounded claim that refugeesplace a burdenon local communities. Yet, between 2005 and 2019, refugees contributed nearly$124bnmore in state and local revenuecombined than they received in services. During the same period, refugees paid$581bnin federal, state and local taxes. A majority of Americans recognize the great effect of their neighbors and want to continue welcoming them, and more than300 elected officialsfrom across the country have vocalized bipartisan support to uphold and strengthen refugee resettlement.Through USRAP, refugees like me are thoroughly vetted for years before we are allowed to travel to the US. USRAP is the most successful and celebrated refugee resettlement program, but now its future remains uncertain. Despitebroad public supportacross the country for traditional resettlement, the Trump administration appears to be deciding who is worthy of safety based on the color of their skin and their political views. This is deeply alarming and betrays America’s deepest values. As someone who found hope and belonging here, I know that our greatness has never come from exclusion. It comes from compassion, courage and the belief that every person deserves a chance to rebuild their life in safety.We must hold our elected leaders accountable for keeping their promises and passing policies that support and care for all who call America home. This includes protecting refugees and immigrants who give so much to our communities and implementing humane policies to address immigration without harming people seeking safety. That is true leadership.Bahati Kanyamanza is a former refugee who spent about 25 years in a Ugandan refugee camp and as a refugee in the US before he became a naturalized US citizen.

Will its new ‘PG-13’ guidelines make a difference?Tayo BeroThe content guardrails introduced this week feel like hollow posturing after the failure of past promisesTue 21 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 14.45 EDTShareFor months, Instagram has been struggling to convince parents, advocates and officials that it’s a safe place for kids, even though there’s a mountain of evidence to show quite the opposite. Now, the company isintroducingyet another set of guardrails that will supposedly keep teens on the platform safe. But going by their track record, parents shouldn’t be smiling yet.Starting this week, all users aged under 18 will automatically be placed into the 13+ setting, which restricts their feed to content that meets the standards of the US PG-13 movie rating.But Instagram’s failed past promises make this new content clampdown feel like just more hollow posturing so they canlooklike they’re actually doing something about the problem.Advocacy groups have been sounding the alarm for years about minors being exposed to content and people that they shouldn’t be, while the company rakes in over$100bn a yearin revenue. Meta itselfestimatedthat about 100,000 children using Facebook and Instagram were experiencing online sexual harassment each day. This is unsurprising, given that as of July 2020 (according to aninternal Meta chatmade public through a New Mexico lawsuit against the company), the actions being taken to prevent child grooming on the platform lay “somewhere between zero and negligible”. The New Mexico lawsuit alleges that Meta’s social networks – including Instagram – have become hubs for child predators. (Meta denies the core allegations andclaims the lawsuit “cherry-picked”from documents.)Last year, the company finally set up mandatoryInstagram teen accounts. Butnew researchled by a Meta whistleblower found that 64% of the new safety tools that came with Instagram teensweren’t effective.According to the study, 47% of young teen Instagram usersencountered unsafe contentand unwanted messages in a month, and 37% of 13- to 15-year-old users experienced at least one piece of unsafe content or unwanted message on a weekly basis, “including roughly 1 in 7 who were seeing either self-harm content, unwanted sexual content, discriminatory content, or alcohol and drug content weekly”.“These failings point to a corporate culture at Meta that puts engagement and profit before safety,” Andy Burrows, chief executive of the UK’s Molly Rose Foundation, which seeks stronger online safety laws, and was part of the team that conducted the research,toldthe BBC. A Meta spokesperson said the study “repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them”.Meanwhile, the measures the company put in place last year came after another significant moment for Meta’s public image: in January 2024, the heads of the world’s biggest social media companies were hauled before the US Senate to answer for their company’s safety policies. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO,apologisedto a group of parents who said their children had been harmed by social media.But Instagram has had years to get this right and it still seems to choose the way of letting children be harmed, and then saying sorry afterwards. On Monday,Reuters reportedthat thecompany’s own researchfound teens who said Instagram frequently made them feel bad about their bodies saw three times more “eating disorder-adjacent content” than others did. What’s worse, tech companies and social media startups have insinuated themselves so deeply into our lives that it’s virtually impossible to participate in society – especially as a kid – without them.So what’s the solution? First, it’s important to think seriously about online spaces as an extension of the real world and not just a digital approximation of it.Social mediaplatforms do not just replicate real life violence in digital form, they are also used as a vehicle to help furnish other forms of in-real-life harm, and children are most susceptible to this danger.Pushing lawmakers to compel these companies to incorporate safety measures as part of the design, and not as an afterthought, is one thing; but it’s also crucial that parents teach kids about online safety in the same way we would teach them about any other kind of safety when they are out in the world.The technologies these carnivorous companies create, leverage and very often abuse simply aren’t going anywhere. If we can’t trust them to protect their most vulnerable users, then it’s on us to do it ourselves.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsInstagramOpinionMetaChildrenSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

She is elderly, hard of hearing and a non-native English speaker – just one of these would qualify for an extra pair of hands and ears, but with all three, I am not taking any chances.Being a doctor is a privilege in so many ways. My first realisation that I am on the patient side of the equation is when I drive past staff parking to find a spot. The two minutes I am used to become 20.The admissions clerk is faintly unimpressed that my mother omitted to bring one of her many types of health-related cards. I feel for both clerk and patient and problem-solve by messaging my dad.We doctors will help our own – but not at the expense of other patients | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThe room is nice and quiet. I gauge whether the couch is enough to sleep on. Maybe – if I lie still on my right side on with legs at 90 degrees.The nurse has leftthe beleaguered NHSand has a brogue that I can only just decipher; I am impressed that my mum understood his first two questions.“Are you in transit from an international destination?”The big words are lost in enunciation.“How about pressure sores?”She looks at him quizzically; he tries to explain. It’s painful: the questioning, not the sores. Most patients are not aware of developing pressure sores. The ones who suffer from them are typically emaciated.“No,” I reply before explaining in Hindi how pressure sores develop. She shudders.“Do you use a gait aid?”I translate and let her answer, the more to empower her for the future.“Are you cognitively impaired?”I consider the irony of this question and the singular unreliability of a response. Cognitively impaired patients would deny this or not know how to answer and the well ones might be offended.There is no easy Hindi translation; before I say more, the nurse helpfully adds, “like dementia”.Her expression clouds.“Do you have dietary restrictions?”“He is asking what you don’t eat.”“Beef and pork.”“Are you on a fluid restriction?”“I just don’t eat beef and pork.”The questions keep coming. My mum nods and smiles, confident that if somethingreallymatters, I will step in.By now, I am wondering how other patients faithfully answer these questions filled with jargon and some even unintentionally discomfiting. How many anxious people simply nod along, trusting the staff know what they are doing?I wouldn’t rely on a cognitively impaired patient to provide the details that would help me provide better care – being vigilant about the risk of delirium and falls, for instance. It is the uncommon patient who knows the date of their last blood test, every dose of every medication and the precise indication for every procedure.I am an oncologist. Please don’t ask me to write a business case | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreAs the nurse continues, all I can think is: who writes these questions and who vets them? How can we know that this is time well spent on patient care? Is there a box saying that the patient did not (seem to) understand? Or one saying that an interpreter was required but not provided? (Large public hospitals typically provide access; private hospitals bypass the very expectation.)Her doctor is calm and confident, but his reassurance is marred by the next entrant, dressed in a black cassock and purple Roman collar.The priest’s eyes flick between my mother and me. He has probably been called to administer last rites and looks confused.“Are you Joan, or is she Joan?”“Neither of us looks like a Joan,” I smile, prompting him to flee.I am guffawing when I hear my mum concerned.“Why did the doctor send a priest?”“It wasn’t for you.”“Are you sure?”It’s a scene dying for a comedy scriptwriter.To do something nice, I call the kitchen and order jelly, one of two things she is allowed.“She can’t have it,” the chef rules. “Jelly contains gelatin and your mum is allergic to beef and pork.”“She is not allergic; she is Hindu!” I protest. “And she eats jelly.”But my protests fall on closed ears.“The allergy label has to go first.”I hang up, bursting with laughter but also sympathetic to the strain it places on patients and relatives to settle inane issues among important ones.Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, a least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.Susan Sontag’s words, written in 1978 during her cancer diagnosis, remain as meaningful then as now, in an era of unprecedented gains in medical technology and treatment but not necessarily in the way we communicate with patients.My mother’s experience has given me renewed empathy for patients and their caregivers. While we are busy documenting their needs, we are not actually meeting their needs. From visible symptoms to unspoken suffering, from cultural preferences to deeply personal choices – there is a lot healthcare providers need to know but only if our head is not buried in the paperwork. True patient-centred care takes more than a checklist.It takes the nurse on the next shift time to understand the issue, re-enter the computer system and delete the allergy. A triumphant chef delivers the jelly. I feel bad knowing that the nurse had more fruitful tasks at hand.Australiaperforms very wellin the world in important healthcare metrics.We must not rest on our laurels – and continue to strive for patient-centred care, which includes stopping doing things because “they have always been done that way”.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

To voters they are very useful idiotsTue 21 Oct 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 13.54 EDTShare“I’m meant to be on bloody holiday this week, Paul! I don’t want to be having this meeting!” There is much to enjoy about the patriotic revolution in government promised by theleaked footageobtained by the Guardian of the Reform UK group of councillors running Kent county council. Take council leader Linden Kemkaran speaking for all free speech absolutists when she declares: “Paul! Paul! I’m going to mute you in a minute!” Or consider her repeatedly stated vision of the imperfections of representative democracy: “You’re just going to have to fucking suck it up, OK?”Even so I think the standout bit is when Kemkaran, who acknowledged Kent’s “flagship” status for the party and its leaderNigel Farage, says: “If we can avoid putting up council tax by the full 5%, that is going to be the best thing that we can do to show that Reform can run something as big as Kent council.”As big as Kent council? The thing about Reform is that it could fairly soon be running something as big as the United Kingdom, with the most recent MRP poll suggesting that if a general election were run right now, with tactical voting, Reform would win amajority with 367 seats. Without tactical voting, they could be on for 445 – the largest majority since the franchise was extended in 1918. (Not to refuse to get swept up in the moment, but I do think we might have to allow for a bit of tactical voting.)Either way, there are currently two broad schools of thought around Reform. The first one is summed up by Dominic Cummings, who this week emerged to give a full interview explaining that he had absolutely no desire to return to politics, while observing thatFarage will be prime ministerif he builds the right team around him. The second school of thought is that displays such as Kent Reform’s Teams meltdown will be the thing that eventually implodes Farage’s march towards Downing Street, with people ultimately thinking the party is a too-risky crew of not-gifted amateurs.For my money, a third way is currently most likely. Namely, that Reform will win, and that beyond a few golden blazers at the top, the Kent councillors – think of them as the loony lightweight tendency –arebroadly representative of the team that will run Britain. But enough people will have had enough – have already had enough – that they just won’t care about that bit enough not to vote them in.When David Cameron blithely called the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, the then-Conservative prime minister may have thought he was offering a sensible we-know-best choice which could be swayed by the remain campaign’s hilarious strategy ofcoordinating lettersto the Times from 100 big business leaders, or coordinating letters to the Times from 100 medium business leaders.But what Cameron was actually doing was giving the British public a fuck-you button, and asking: “Do you want to press it?” Personally, I didn’t at the time, but it has since become abundantly clear why a lot of people did. Pressing it has not, it must be conceded, made anything any better, although many espouse the view that it is only not betteryet.In any case, things have developed significantly since then. Fuck-you has become the fastest growing and currently biggest tribe in British politics. And instead of being simply adjacent to the fuck-you button, Farage has now fused himself with it. Go on, press him. You know you want to.View image in fullscreenReform UK leader Nigel Farage with members of Kent county council in Maidstone, 7 July 2025.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAA lot of people have been wanting to for really quite some time. It’s just possible this method isn’t psephologically scientific, but I’ve long spent a lot of time reading comments beneath MailOnline articles. A few years ago now, I was struck by just how many upvoted comments, beneath a huge range of different stories, would simply be one word: “Reform”. This was back when Reform was polling at 2%, Farage wasn’t even the party leader, and the popular perception still held that you could never really break the two-party stranglehold on British politics under first past the post. The story could be about potholes or small boats or the BBC or phone theft or whatever, but the comment was as frequent as it was monolithically stark. “Reform”.Flash forward to today, and in Reform’s dry run for running the world’s sixth largest economy, the party’s councils are finding it a lot harder than they made out. In Nottingham, the Reform council leaderbanned party engagementwith the Nottingham Post after completely wetting his pants over an article in the paper about … local government reorganisation. Elsewhere, Reform have frequently shown themselves to be the free-speech warriors who love the mute button, the anti-snowflake crew who somehow constantly make complaints about bullying – and do so top to bottom. There have reportedly been eight official complaints of bullying to Reform’s south-east regional director in the past three months, while Reform’s top brass actuallycalled the policeabout the mean words of Rupert Lowe (previously one of their five MPs but now suspended and independent). Meanwhile, having honked endlessly about their Doge knock-off and all the millions in savings they would find just lying on the table when they took control, multiple Reform councilshave found there aren’t anyand they’re all probably going to have to raise the council tax by the maximum amount allowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once people have gone fuck-you, it’s quite hard to get them back, and it certainly feels far beyond the limited political gifts of either Keir Starmer or Kemi Badenoch.There is a surprisingly common affective disorder known as the “high places phenomenon”, which is the irrational impulse to jump when on top of a tall building or precipice or suchlike, despite having absolutely no urge to die. A lot of people get it, and there is, by most accounts, a certain mad thrill to it. The phenomenon arises, apparently, when the brain misinterprets a survival signal, and the instinctive fear of the height is somehow mangled into the momentary possibility of “What if I jumped?” It is sometimes known as the “call of the void”. Typically, the call of the void only lasts a split second – but it’s hard not to feel the UK is going to be experiencing it constantly for the next few years.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistA year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa Crerar.On Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back with special guests at another extraordinary year, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.Book tickets hereExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionLocal governmentNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

As visitors queued to get in to the Louvre, thieves were escaping out of another wing, after a raid on the crown jewels that took just seven minutes. The story could have been lifted straight from a Hollywood movie or an episode of the French mystery thriller seriesLupin.Yet, although this outrageous theft has stunnedFrance, it was perhaps a fitting act of larceny for a country that has just been the victim of another incredible heist. From one Monday to the next the French people were swindled into thinking we were getting a new government. The political drama left many of us feeling like confused characters in Groundhog Day, but perhaps the closer symbolism is to be found in the surreal theft at the Louvre.To recap: Sébastien Lecornu, the prime minister,resigned on 6 October, less than a month into his term. Lecornu threw in the towel when it became clear he could not win the support of the national assembly for his budget. His resignation provoked the collapse of the shortest-lived government in the history of the Fifth Republic. Yet, 48 hours afterpromisingthat his “mission” as prime minister was “over”, Lecornuwas reinstatedin an audacious move by the president Emmanuel Macron, who entrusted the now ex-PM with the same mission he had just failed at.Over the next seven days, the country was rocked byunprecedented political upheaval, yet we ended up back exactly where we had been, although led to believe that we had a new government.This deception goes back to Macron’s reckless decision to call asnap election in 2024, after the far right made historic gains in European elections. The “back me or sack me” challenge produced a decisive rebuff for the president:a hung parliamentwith nobody able to command an overall majority. Macron could no longer dictate his politics to legislators. The problem is that Macron has never accepted that outcome. Not only has he repeatedly refused to appoint a prime minister from the left coalition which secured a plurality of votes, but he stubbornly keeps trying to build a government aligned with his own views, even though they have been rejected at the polls. Each attempt so far has ended in failure with prime ministers falling in quick succession.Lecornu’s reappointment (he isone of the most faithful of Macron’s inner circle), gives us two successive governments with barely any variation, with many of the “new” ministers identifying as “Macronists” and several others coming from the rightwing party Les Républicains, whichscored only 6.2%in the last legislative elections.We are now at the mercy of a single individual – a president long accustomed to dictating his policies to a compliant parliamentary majority. His party is on political life support but it has made a last, desperate raid on power thanks to the unlikely support of a leftwing party. The Socialist party, which in 2024 was part of the left coalition that fiercely opposed Macron, has now entered intoa pact with the government. It came to the table with high initial demands – including, notably, the creation of a “Zucman tax” (a proposed levy on the super-rich, inspired by the economist Gabriel Zucman), and the repeal of Macron’s pension reform. In the end, the mere promise of suspending the hugely unpopular pension change – with no real guarantee – was enough to win a commitmentnot to censurethe entire budget.The Socialists are busy applauding the suspension of thehated pension reform. But according to the economist Michaël Zemmour, thisis merely a postponementin the implementation schedule – one that keeps the retirement age at 64 and allows a few generations to benefit, without any structural reconsideration of the reform itself.It is important to note, too, that austerity-driven budget cuts have already inflicted tangible damage: in June, Louvre employeeswent on strike and blocked the museum,denouncing staff reductions and the lack of resources for security.Yet, instead of standing up for their voters, Socialist leaders are letting Macron buy more time for his doomed reform project.Last week Iappeared ona TV panel, commenting on the appointment of the new government. I said how exasperating it was to find ourselves in the exact same situation as the previous Monday, only now with the impression that politicians were gaslighting us. One of the other panellists interrupted me to say there had been “some progress” and that we needed “to explain it to the audience”.What is there to explain? People can see and understand for themselves. To me, such a reaction says a lot about the disconnect between the commentariat in France, who seem to enjoy the political game, and ordinary French people, reduced to the role of onlookers of a pathetic spectacle that only entrenches their daily problems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And now a prime minister who declared live on television that he was done with the job – is back in the job. How can French voters trust such politicians?The authoritarian nature of Macron’s politics – and the dominance of the executive inherent to France’s Fifth Republic – have long been defended in the name of political stability. That rationale has served as a pretext for an increasingly hyper-presidential regime, which today stands as a true obstacle to the popular will.No wonder French voters feel as if we have been the victims of a double heist; twice in the same month left wondering who is really in charge, and if the system is capable of protecting our most treasured assets.Rokhaya Diallo is a GuardianEuropecolumnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How meat is produced in China may mean the drugs you need here won’t workTue 21 Oct 2025 05.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 12.42 EDTShareWhat we’re putting into our bodies can either nourish us, or make us ill. With that in mind, I wrote recently about the role of food consumption in terms of the risk ofcolon cancer. But what about food production?Across the world, we are seeing the rise of cheap meat: largely driven by demand from a rising middle class whofinally can affordbeef, pork and chicken, which used to be out of reach, given their cost. Approximately 45% of global consumption growth is occurring in upper-middle-income countries including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines. Poultry is set to take an increasingly large share of that growth (projected to grow by 21% by 2034), because it is relatively cheap, widely acceptable and requires fewer resources per kilogram compared with beef or pork. By 2034, it is estimated that poultry will provide 45% of the protein consumed from all meat sources.But this comes with costs. With limited land and intense time pressure,the solutionin many countries has been touse antibiotics at scale. This isn’t just to treat illness, but also as a prophylactic to prevent disease in crowded conditions. And giving antibiotics causes livestock to grow faster, although scientists aren’t sure exactly why that is. All of this means that, unlike their use for humans – where antibiotics are almost always given to treat illness – their use in farming is much more widespread and indiscriminate. Studies tracking their useestimate that 73%of all antimicrobials sold globally are used in animals raised for food.This enormous overuse is leading to a rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. For example,resistance to colistin, a “last-resort antibiotic”, first developed in E coli bacteria which then infected pigs. E coli was later found in pig farmers. All it takes is aeroplanes and global travel networks for these pathogens to spread globally. And now, colistin-resistant bacteria have been identified not only in hospitals in China, butacross the world.What does this mean for someone sitting in a GP clinic or a hospital in England or Scotland? It means that infections that were once easily treatable (think of ear infections, urinary tract infections or post-operative infections) become untreatable even after a dose of antibiotics. It means that surgeries such as caesarean sections, hip replacements and cancer therapies that rely on immune suppression all become riskier. And while new antibiotics are technically possible to develop, thepipeline is slow and costly. We have to preserve the arsenal we have.View image in fullscreen‘With limited land and intense time pressure, the solutionin many countries has been to use antibiotics at scale’.Photograph: Md Saiful Islam Khan/Getty ImagesThe solutions to this problem can only come from changing global food production. To be fair, the UK has made significant progress in reducing antibiotics in farming. Sales of antibiotics for animals reared for food has droppedby 59% since 2014. The use of colistin is now effectively zero. The use of critically important antibiotics has dropped to less than 0.5% of all animal antibiotic sales. And research by several EU bodies suggested that after antibiotic use in farming wascut by nearly halfbetween 2014 and 2021, antibiotic resistance in E coli across the bloc also began to decline.But just focusing on the UK or EU is a drop in the bucket. Unless the large middle-income countries are part of the conversation on how meat is produced, we remain just as vulnerable to antibiotic resistance. The challenge is that moving towards different production practices takes more space and time: making meat even more expensive in countries with large populations can quickly trigger social unrest, political backlash and frustration. The health imperative is clear, but this needs to be balanced with concerns over food security, economics and public demand.Climate scientistshave long warnedabout the environmental costs of the current global food system, whether it’s methane emissions, biodiversity loss, or deforestation. But these effects often feel long-term and abstract, especially for people struggling with cost-of-living pressures or concerned with immediate healthcare access.Antibiotic resistance is tangible. Almost everyone has taken antibiotics at some point, and we can imagine what would happen if their infection-clearing effect was suddenly switched off.Foodproduction, health and climate are all connected. How pork is produced in China affects whether your child’s antibiotics work in Edinburgh. Whether a woman in Lagos survives a C-section is linked to how chickens are farmed in Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It may be her defining mistakeChris MullinBy taking Jeremy Hunt’s NI cuts and ruling out other rises, Labour tried to out-Tory the Tories. And made a bad situation worseTue 21 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.29 EDTShareKeir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have only themselves to blame for the mess they are in over tax. The key moment was not thedefenestration of their welfare billor the uprising over pensioners’ winter fuel payments. The die was cast more than a year earlier.In January 2024, the then chancellor Jeremy Huntimplemented a cutin employee national insurance contributions. Four months later he announced afurther reductionfrom 10% to 8% and even hinted that he was considering abolishing employee contributions altogether. It was the mother of all election bribes, costing the exchequer about£10bn a year. It was also entirely cynical, offered in the absolute confidence that the Tories would not be in office long enough to grapple with the consequences. Had they by any chance won the election, he would have had to recoup the tax revenue forgone by either tax increases or by further swingeing cuts to the public sector.ForLabour, this was an obvious trap. Faced with these utterly irresponsible tax cuts at a time when pressure on the public sector was approaching breaking point, Reeves was challenged by Hunt to say whether, if she became chancellor, she would reinstate them. The sensible reply would have been to say: “We will decide if and when we are elected, and discover how much of a mess you have left us.” She might also have added, “And, by the way, the next election will not be about tax cuts. It will be about the dreadful state of the public sector.”Instead, however, Reeves fell headlong into the trap Hunt had set, promising not only that she would not reinstate his cuts, but incredibly going further and promisingnot to raiseany of the main sources of revenue: income tax, VAT or national insurance. From that moment on the party was doomed.Labour in opposition is understandably nervous about making commitments on tax, given the near hysteria that can be organised by the Tories and their friends at even the slightest hint of an increase. So nervous, in fact, that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, on their way to a landslide victory, undertook in advance of the 1997 election that they would stick to Tory spending plans for their first two years in office.They did not know they were destined to win by a landslide: they expected to win by only a handful of seats. In 2024, however, the political landscape was entirely different and for one very good reason. The Tories were hoist on the Brexit petard. For the first time in living memory, they had to compete for votes with a more or less credible party to the right of them. This was a historic opportunity. It was always obvious that Labour was going to win and win big, if only because of a quirk in the first-pass-the-post electoral system. Instead of trying to out-Tory the Tories on tax, the 2024 election presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an honest conversation with the electorate about tax. A challenge that both parties conspicuously ducked.What should Starmer and Reeves have done? In a nutshell, they should have delivered a simple message to the electorate. If we want decent public services, we are going to have to pay for them. And let’s not pretend, as some do, that it can all be paid for solely by taxing the rich. To be sure, there are steps that could be taken to tap the prosperous – a couple more bands on council tax, for example – but the top 10% of earners already account for60% of income tax revenue. Extra funding on the scale necessary can only come from an increase in thebasicrate of income tax – which, by the way, was 22% until Gordon Brown cut 2p off it in return for a round of applause that had faded within 24 hours. Rishi Sunak then followed this up in 2024 with a further1p cutin the basic rate. Bang went another seven or eight billion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Reeves took the opposite tack. She adopted the Tory language, repeatedly talking of the “tax burden”. She could not bring herself to point out the obvious connection between tax and the preservation of the social fabric. She could have argued that tax fairly raised and wisely used is the subscription we pay for living in civilisation. She might have added that, far from being extortionate, theUK is well downthe north European league table and, the tax burden in the UKis higher nowthan at any time since 1950, that is because demands on the public sector are greater than they have ever been.We have been here before. It is now widely recognised that the 1964 Labour government should have devalued immediately on taking office. As today, its inheritance was dire. The pound, then a reserve currency, was under enormous pressure. The new government could easily have got away with blaming devaluation on the outgoing Tories. Instead, it kicked the can down the road, hoping against hope to avoid the inevitable with the result that in 1967 it was forced into a humiliating U-turn.“What was your biggest mistake?” I asked Harold Wilson when, as a young journalist, I interviewed him in Downing Street in March 1970. He replied, “That I underestimated the power of speculators to undermine the value of the pound.” Wilson at least had the excuse that in 1964 he had just been elected on a wafer-thin majority. Starmer and Reeves have no such alibi.Chris Mullin is a former Labour minister and the author of four volumes of widely acclaimed diariesExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionRachel ReevesLabourJeremy HuntcommentShareReuse this content"

Do  the politicians jumping on this bandwagon care what they are doingTue 21 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 09.24 EDTShareIf social media posts are anything to go by,Tommy Robinson is planning to visit Villa Parknext month as a Maccabi Tel Aviv fan. What can possibly have attracted the Luton-born political activist to the Israeli Premier League’s second-placed club? The stylish all-action midfield play of Dor Peretz? The stirring run to the group stages of the 2004-05 Champions League? Perhaps, in the fashion of the club’s former manager Robbie Keane, Robinson’s embrace is simply the fulfilment of a cherished and multifaceted boyhood dream.But of course there is a natural synergy there too, one we should probably have identified long before the Uefa computer pitted Aston Villa against the club long known in Israel as “the country’s team”, and inadvertently threw a hand grenade into British politics. Like Robinson, Maccabi attracts a fervid following of young men from the far right, who gather at weekends to chant racist and anti-Arab slogans. Like Robinson’s disciples, Maccabi’s fans have occasionally been known to indulge in a little light violence.A decade agoMaccabi fans unveiled a banner reading “refugees (not) welcome”, a refrain with which you can imagine the artist formerly known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon nodding heartily along.Then there was Maharan Radi, the Israeli international midfielder who after signing for the team was greeted withracist slursand death threats by members of the Maccabi Fanatics, the club’s ultra group. Anti-Arab graffiti began to appear in the city. Later, many years after leaving the club, Radi would testify that some of his teammates had tried to mediate with some of the more hard-line supporters. A few days later, Radi said, they reported back. “There’s nothing we can do,” they told him. “They just hate Arabs.”None of this explains on its own the decision by West Midlands police to ban travelling Maccabi fans from their Europa League game againstAston Villa. But it does offer a context so sorely lacking from the incendiary discussion and ill-informed grandstanding that have engulfed the subsequent days. Many Maccabi fans will doubtless have travelled to Birmingham with the sole intention of watching a game of football. But it takes a certain wilful blindness to ignore the likelihood that a significant number will have had other intentions in mind.Partly this stems from the fact that elite football in England is a largely depoliticised space, that most fanbases are not overtly activist in the manner of many of their foreign counterparts. In Israel, by contrast, football and politics remain deeply intertwined. Traditionally Maccabi teams were associated with the right; Hapoel with the left. And even if this distinction is no longer strictly observed, football in Israel – as with much of civic life – is often an alternative battleground upon which to enact some very familiar feuds.In 2020, a group of protesters demonstrating against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was attacked by a group of Maccabi Fanaticswielding batons and broken bottles. Anti-Arab chants and songs are commonplace at home games. A banner displayed at a recent game read “fuck Hamas, fuck St Pauli, fuck Hapoel”: the last of these a reference to their city rivals, the second a small German club famous for its progressive, anti-racist values.The point here is that to treat this as your common or garden football hooliganism threat is to miss the point. Rather, it is the prospect oftargeted, politicised footballing violencethat renders this particular case so potentially toxic. Violence of the sort seenin Amsterdam late last year, when travelling fans and local thugs fought in the streets, far from the Johan Cruyff Arena where Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv were playing. Israeli fans, an Arab taxi driver and pro-Palestinian protesters were all targeted and subjected to lawless violence.Who started it? Who was more to blame? At what precise point did tension, provocation and goading cross the boundary into criminality? Nobody can really be sure, and in any case these are questions whose answers are framed by what you already choose to believe. And in recent days, as politicians from across the spectrum have stampeded to condemn West Midlands police – from the centre to the far right – it is clear what lessons our political class chose to learn from the episode.Perhaps, given the government’s recent record on policing protest, we should assume it has some classified intelligence on theMaccabi Tel Avivfanbase that it is regrettably unable to share with us. Perhaps they’ve done a secret straw poll of the Fanatics and concluded that they’re all great lads who just want to see Villa’s Morgan Rogers in the flesh. In which case, it certainly seems to have materialised in a hurry.Aston Villa put out their statement confirming the police decisionat 5.17pmon Thursday. Kemi Badenoch put out her reactionat 8.02pm. Nigel Farage’s statement dropped at 8.58pm. Keir Starmer’sat 9pm. Ed Davey, 9.45pm (must do better). Presumably they all took the time to consult stakeholders, take security briefings and make the required calls to foreign officials before doing so. But the speed of the bandwagon-jumping should at least give us pause.There is, ironically, a broader cross-border debate to be had about the increasingly sinister securitisation of football fans at matches. After all, Maccabi are by no means the only club to see their supporters banned from European away games.Eintracht Frankfurt fanswill not be welcome in Naples this week. Ajax fans were banned from Marseille last month. Eventhe cancellation of the Tel Aviv derbyat the weekend was as much a case of police brutality as fan behaviour, part of a pattern by which Israeli security forces have increasingly been engaged in stoking violence rather than trying to suppress it.But of course none of this fits neatly into a clicky, media-friendly race-war narrative, fed by social media algorithms and all the usual provocateurs. We are spun the line that a few hundred far-right ultras with a history of violence are somehow representative of all Jews everywhere, in much the same way that the Netanyahu government appoints itself the mouthpiece for an entire religion of 16 million people based around the world, many of whom despise him and actively mobilise against him every day. We are expected to believe in the existence of a hostile antisemitic conspiracy co-hatched by the police and the residents ofBirmingham.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But at the same time it is a fascinating case study into the instincts of our political and media class. You want concerted international action against Israel for its crimes in Gaza and elsewhere? Good luck with that when you can’t even get a few violent far-right football fans turned away at Birmingham Airport.The quiet part, of course, is that when Maccabi fans speak out against refugees, chant “death to Arabs”, associate their enemies with Hamas and commit violence in our city centres, there is a small but significant part of our country that tacitly agrees with them, and a much larger part of our country willing to humour them out of expediency.And really Robinson is just the thin end of the wedge here, the racist canary in the mine, thereductio ad absurdumof an impulse that has long been embedded in our politics. Choosing to stand with the far-right foreign football hooligan against the local police force: this, apparently, is what British patriotism looks like in 2025. Truly, we are through the looking-glass here.Jonathan Liew is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But to find out, follow the money. Its boldest investment is in green energy, designed to create prodigious returns in economic growth, employment, training, climate action and more. So far it has been hard to sell. Wafty talk of greenness passes most people by, and “whose growth is it, anyway?” is a realistic question in a country of stagnant pay and public decay. But, this week, Ed Miliband put flesh on the green words, making jobs and projects concrete. A very big number of green jobs –400,000 by 2030– are set to be created in 31 “priority occupations”, from welders to production managers, plumbers and joiners, everywhere from Centrica’s £35m state-of-the-art training academy in Lutterworth to Teesside’s net-zero decarbonisation cluster.This is what a Labour industrial strategy should look like. Nigel Farage’s retro campaign for this week’s Caerphilly byelection promises toreopen Welsh coalmines. But well-paid, clean, green-energy jobs within their home districts are what Miliband’s Doncaster North constituents want, the minister tells me, not sending young people down reopened mines. Government figures show wind, nuclear and electricity jobs pay more than most – the average advertised salary in the wind sector is£51,000 a year, against an average £37,000. Unions, once sceptical and fearful of losing jobs in unionised industries, now sign up with guarantees that any new plant getting grants must “support greater trade union recognition” and a fair work charter.Against the prospect of a tough budget, Miliband is good at providing hope. Big green investment is Labour’s best hope for growth, and the best way to repair the great skills deficit, getting thosenear million lost young peopleback into work.Political hope should be an easy win against the right’s misbegotten culture wars. It’s a fists-up challenge to Reform UK and Tory bluster on abolishing net-zero aims. Those 400,000 jobs will be facts on the ground in places Farage expects to win. Will he and Kemi Badenoch tell a thousand Siemens workers in Hull to stop building wind turbines, or Teesside workers to down tools on decarbonisation, or close the new cable factory in Scotland? Miliband met a young woman who left her Pizza Hut job when she won an apprenticeship in clean energy at Sheffield Forgemasters. Who would pull the plug on her?Rightwing politicians’ net-zero culture war is wildly out of kilter withpublic opinion. Perhaps they think they are doing battle with the ideas of Greta Thunberg; instead they will find themselves explaining to families why jobs for them and friends will be taken away. Voters are staunchly pro-renewable energy andanti-fracking(which Farage wants to restart). Miliband’s promise to cut energy bills by £300 by the next election stands: he doesn’t rule out apossible VAT cuton energy bills in the budget. Meanwhile, this is a firm challenge to the Green party threat coming up fast on Labour’s left.Where are the people for these new green jobs? The usually depressed and undervalued further education (FE) sector is suddenly jubilant, as Miliband spells out exactly what new skills are needed, from super-battery making to fitting solar panels. He pledges thatfive new technical excellence collegeswill focus on boosting clean energy skills. Over the years I’ve had glum conversations with David Hughes, CEO of the Association of Colleges, about “15 years of absolute devastation when adult training and retraining was cut by half”. The pay gap between school teachers and his college staff is huge, he says. We often talked about UK employersinvesting only halfthe EU average in workforce skills: employer organisations griping about Labour should ask themselves why they arestill cutting apprenticeships.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He celebrated the prime minister announcing that instead of 50% of students going to university, the target istwo-thirds gainingeither a degree or a technical qualification, a great step towards equalising the value of skills. He is delighted that employers will get no migrant visas without investing in training young people. He thinks Keir Starmer’s background, that famous tool-maker dad, nurse sister and mother, roots him in knowing the worth of technical skills.The enthusiasm is catching. I visited Crawley College, with its specialist “green village”,already training upthousands for green jobs. A house sliced in half teaches them about insulation techniques, heat pump installation, retrofitting and energy savers of all kinds. Walking around an FE college is always a reminder that these are places of hope. Teachers here talk emotionally of second chances for those who have been failed, of lives turned around and eyes opened by the extraordinarily wide range of courses. Colleges can expect a new burst of life from now on.As for culture wars – a Reform or Tory government would presumably cut teaching this “green crap”, in David Cameron’s timeless phrase. Goodbye to Crawley College’s green village and new clean-energy technical excellence colleges? As an election pitch, Miliband is turning the right’s culture war into “waging a war on jobs”.

It’s more likely to get the cold shoulderAnand MenonLabour now wants to use the damage from Brexit to combat the threat of Nigel Farage, but the union has bigger fish to fryTue 21 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 09.36 EDTShareApalpable sense of urgency has emerged in the UK’s approach to relations with the European Union. Ministers are beginning to sound enthusiastic, impatient even. The chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, haseven pointed to Brexitas a major cause of the country’s economic travails. You might think that this bodes well for prospects of improved UK-EU relations. But – and here’s the rub – enthusiasm on one side is not enough to drive substantive progress.In opposition, Labour shadow ministers and spokespeople were understandably reluctant to add flesh to the bones of their intention to “reset” relations with the EU. More detail was provided at thesummit in May this year,as the two sides not only signed off a long-term deal on fisheries but declared their intention to negotiate further agreements covering agrifoods, energy and defence.And over the past few weeks, the British tone has shifted still further. I was struck at a conference in Brussels last month by the emphasis placed by Nick Thomas-Symonds, the UK’s minister for EU relations, on the need for rapid progress in these various negotiations.The change of tone has perhaps been most marked when it comes to the “youth experience scheme”. Labour in opposition wasadamant that it had no plansfor such a scheme. Yet last month, Thomas-Symondstold the College of Europethat “giving the opportunity for young people to learn and get experience is vital”. Reeves, for her part, publiclycalled for an “ambitious” scheme, which would be “good for the economy, good for growth and good for business”.By the time of theLabourparty conference, things had ramped up another notch, with Thomas-Symonds claiming he’d “negotiated” an agriculture deal with the EU (spoiler: he hasn’t yet), although it was erroneously reported that this simply needs to be implemented).There seems to be a pattern here. One of talking up the urgency, of pushing for rapid practical results. This makes sense in a number of ways. For one thing, the UK government has decided that the economic impacts of Brexit are a stick with which they can beatNigel Farage. Second, as the budget approaches, the chancellor is anxious to get the Office for Budget Responsibility to factor a youth experience scheme into its forecasts.And finally, there is genuine time pressure. The EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism comes into effect in January 2026. This is a climate tool that imposes a tax on imports, such as steel and glass, produced using carbon-intensive methods. Without an agreement (andthere are rumoursof one in the offing), UK exports to the EU face the prospect of tariffs. Equally, if no deal is struck soon on UK access to the EU’s new defence funding scheme,Security Action for Europe (Safe), the UK risks missing out on being able to bid in the first round of contracts.Sadly, however, London’s enthusiasm will not, in and of itself, guarantee progress. Partly, this is because there are genuine practical hurdles to be overcome. On agriculture andemissions, the scope of regulatory alignment may be a stumbling block. Will the EU insist on alignment with its rules on issues such asgene editing? Will the UK have to adhere to the EU’s market stability mechanism on carbon pricing?On youth mobility, the two sides are still some way apart when it comes to issues such as the fees payable and the total numbers involved.Practical differences aside, the EU does not share the sense of urgency now manifested by London. The economic stakes are lower for Brussels, and EU governments have a whole load of other priorities. The EU itself has bigger fish to fry (having secured access to Britain’s).Meanwhile London’s newfound enthusiasm for youth mobility could even backfire. We know this is a central ask for Brussels. Yet if a scheme is agreed, what is to say the EU won’t drag its feet on other dossiers it doesn’t see as priorities? Sequencing matters, asDavid Davis found to his costduring the Brexit negotiations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLooking ahead, the logic of the government’s new position – that Brexit is damaging the economy and necessitating tax rises – is to attempt to rub away other sources of trade friction. There are hints that the UK is willing to go much further and to consider, asReeves suggested in opposition, aligning automatically with EU rules in sectors such as chemicals.Unfortunately, this is not something the EU is likely to accept. There is no appetite among most member states for doing the UK a favour and helping it thrive outside the bloc. As one senior German official put it to me: “We do not want to help make Brexit work.” With populist parties demanding less subservience to Brussels, a Brexit Britain that is thriving economically is not something European governments are keen to facilitate.Keir Starmer’s EU “reset” has not only helped rebuild close ties with European allies but seemingly become a government priority for driving growth. Sadly, however there are two sides to a negotiation and the danger now is that enthusiasm may give way to frustration as the UK comes to realise that its priorities are not necessarily shared.Anand Menon is director of UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College LondonExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionEuropeNigel FarageLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

This thrilling show, boasting 270 works, reveals the German in all his contradictory brillianceAdrian SearleTue 21 Oct 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 16.24 EDTShareGerhard Richter recalls, as a child, drawing with his finger on his empty, slightly greasy dinner plate, tracing and retracing fanciful curves and spatial structures in endless alterations on the china. Decades later, he would place blobs of different colours on a canvas then intermingle them using slithery curving brushstrokes, lubricated by the oil and paint, until the entire surface was covered. More or less pure colour slid among the passages of impure, much-mixed pigment. Other paintings were made using large squeegees and spatulas, pushing and dragging paint over the surface, and just as often scraping it off again. The squeegee would often pick up previously applied, sometimes half-dried paint, excavating previous layers even as it applied new ones. Smearing paint on, dragging it off again, Richter would keep working until he could no longer think of anything else to do to a painting. One day in 2017, he stopped painting entirely. Since then, he has devoted himself mostly to drawing.View image in fullscreenNod to Duchamp … his wife Ema on the stairs.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025Richter’s art is filled with beginnings and endings, revelling in chance as often as he has used craftsmanship and exactitude to paint people and places and things, from flowers wilting in a vase to street corners, elegiac landscapes and the dead. Standing amid his retrospective at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, it strikes me that however one chooses to describe or compartmentalise the different strands of his work, his art remains irreducible. It’s contrarian, fickle, controlled yet intemperate, the contradictions make a mockery of fixed readings. His art is filled with fugues, with self-absorption and an objective stare.Having had an academic art school training as a mural painter in Dresden, Richter and his wife Ema escaped to West Germany in 1961. After a few false starts, he soon began painting black and white images derived from photographs in newspapers and magazines, and from family snapshots. Here’s his Aunt Marianne, 14, with the infant Gerhard. A schizophrenic, Marianne was later institutionalised and then killed in the Nazi’s euthanasia programme in 1945. Here’s Uncle Rudi, buttoned up in his Wehrmacht greatcoat, smiling for his picture. He looks a kind of innocent, and died early in the war. Here’s Richter’s father, a not-long released prisoner of war, his hair comically awry and mugging for the camera. Family portraits and newspaper shots, airplanes and bombs, histories and holidays jostle on the wall.From early on, Richter has been both fascinated by and mistrustful of photographs, which he has often taken himself and returned to as a basis for paintings. He has also returned, time and again, to subjects taken from his own life, to the events and things that surround him. These have included subjects as laden as the Holocaust and the deaths in prison of four members of the Baader-Meinhof Group. He has painted a dangling toilet roll, a kitchen chair, a wine bottle and an apple on a table, a candle and a skull, and the moment when the second plane hit the tower on 9/11.Sometimes Richter has played with banality and even kitsch mawkishness and sentimentality. Shuttling between choices, he has painted Isa Genzken’s naked back, with a kind of tender objectivity, and his daughter Ella looking down as she reads a book. Light striking the corner of a gothic wall, unkempt wintry branches in the snow, a squatter’s house. Everything leads somewhere else, even when we can’t see it.View image in fullscreenButtoned up … Uncle Rudi, 1965.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)This is the most comprehensive retrospective I have seen of the now 93-year-old artist’s work. Organised chronologically and thematically and including around 270 works, the exhibition is filled with shifts and telling juxtapositions, across its multiple rooms. But where’s that vast and jumbled painting of the Alps, or the porn paintings, or the ones he painted of a tourist being attacked by a lion in a safari park, or the portrait of his daughter Betty, her head leant on its side? Having everything here, of course, would be impossible.A lover of lists, of categorising and archiving his works by subject, including all the photographs he has collected in his monumental Atlas of images, Richter has fittingly been the subject of numerous retrospectives and appraisals – including, in 2020, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a show that closed within days of its opening, due to Covid. Each exhibition tells his story differently.The point is to be able to linger as well as to follow Richter’s development over the decades. As much as we progress, we digress, like Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, and like Richter himself, through this electrifying exhibition. Ema, Richter’s first wife, comes down the stairs naked (a nod to Marcel Duchamp’s 1912 Nude Descending a Staircase). She takes her place among the first of his photographically derived cloudscapes and landscapes. The tide breaks on a muddy foreshore. A causeway crosses a tilted horizon, and there’s a green field under a sullen sky. Now an aerial view of a city. Have the streets and buildings been bombed or just strafed by Richter’s brushstrokes?View image in fullscreenWater therapy … a view of Venice, 1985.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)Sometimes, he works from photos and postcards, at other times from nothing at all. There are paintings that offer almost too much and others that give you nothing but a grey surface to wallow in. One is built up in fast glossy marks that catch the light. Another has a puckered, orange-peel texture, and another seems matt and blotted, faint light grinning through the murk.I swerve up close, pace between flip-flopping clear glass panels that are angled this way and that on a structure in the middle of the room, trying to look between them and through them, where Richter’s paintings are refracted and reflected and interrupted by bursts of gallery lights bouncing off the glass, complicating the view. Then there are the mirrors and the strip paintings whose multiple horizontal stripes zoom past like a train hurtling by, lifting my hair as it goes.View image in fullscreenSelf portrait, 1996.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025 (18102025)There are moments of quiet, in the thick white abstractions and in the brick side of a house that reminds me of Vermeer, with the blurred tree beside it thrashing in the wind; and the surging and the roaring and the unutterable silence and the muteness of the black and white abstractions named for the winter months; and the abstractions that had John Cage in mind when Richter painted them; and the 4,900 squares of lacquered colour made when Richter was working on the stained glass window for Cologne Cathedral. The exhibition leads you back and forth, from one thing to another, to drawings that are barely discernible, some like circuits of unknowable terrain quartered and mapped by a private cartography.Constantly re-complicating things even when he empties them out, Richter reworked a postcard of Titian’s 1530s Annunciation – which resides in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice – over a series of five paintings in 1973. The image becomes successively more jumbled and amorphous, the sacred light diffusing over the scene it illuminates, which swims and surges and becomes progressively less graspable. It dissolves, like the icebergs in the Greenland mist he later went on to paint, or the film still he used as the source of the panoramic Funeral, which concludes his 1988 cycle of 15 Baader-Meinhof paintings (titled October 18, 1977). The crowd and the coffins have become a barely discernible, a milling grey shimmer. As much as anything, these paintings seem to me to describe a kind of impossibility.View image in fullscreenPostcard origins … a 1973 Titian reworking.Photograph: © Gerhard Richter 2025In 2014, Richter tried to work with the photographs taken, at great risk, by a prisoner at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, even sketching the terrible, surreptitious images recording the cremation of gassed victims on to his bare canvases, but found that the impossibility of painting them led the artist to expunge the images entirely. But the images are not so much erased as buried. The masses of dark and light, the layered judderings of black, grey and red make any reference impossible to trace back to their original source. You can’t squint your eyes and find them.Except, of course, that is exactly where Richter’s calculated mise en scène, contained in the exhibition’s final room, leads us, with its juxtaposition of photographs, abstract paintings and greyed mirrors hung opposite. They leave us wanting to see deeper. Turning away from the paintings to the grey mirror, you find yourself dimly reflected, implicated among the things in the room.AtFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, until 2 MarchExplore more on these topicsGerhard RichterEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Can it work on stage in Bradford?Catherine LoveTue 21 Oct 2025 10.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 12.26 EDTShareNovelist Fiona Mozley and theatre-maker Javaad Alipoor are not an obvious match.Elmet, Mozley’s Booker prize-shortlisted 2017 novel, is a lyrical and violent tale of land, family and revenge in semi-rural Yorkshire. Alipoor is best known for complex multimedia performances exploring digital technology, internet culture and geopolitics. But the contrast is what energises them about working on a stage adaptation for Bradford’s year as City of Culture. “I couldn’t see how it was going to come together,” says Mozley. “But that excited me.”Alipoor read Elmet during the pandemic and was struck by its “gut-punch story”. As fans of his company’s work might expect, this is not what he calls a “route one” adaptation. Instead of focusing on plot and dialogue, he is maintaining the novel’s evocative narrative mode and underlining the show’s theatricality, with actors stepping in and out of character. Everything is refracted through the perspective of teenage Danny, who lives in the woods with his quietly seething sister Cathy and the hulking, almost superhuman Daddy, whose sense of right and hunger for violence sets them on a collision course with the avaricious local landowner.In this version, memory is a central theme. In rehearsals, I watch the company build a scene in which LJ Parkinson’s Danny remembers a loaded exchange with Cathy. While Parkinson speaks, Jennifer Jackson as Cathy emerges from behind like a figure in a dream. The company starts to layer subtle movement with a delicate folk song by the Unthanks, who will be performing music on stage throughout the show. The effect is haunting, even in this early draft.View image in fullscreenShifting the narrative around his home town … Javaad Alipoor at rehearsals for Elmet.Photograph: Lee BaxterAlipoor and his collaborators have seized on the idea of Elmet as a tragedy. Mozley hadn’t thought of the novel that way but agrees that “it does hit all those beats” with its escalation towards seemingly inevitable devastation. For Alipoor, it was important to think about “what it means to set a tragedy somewhere like this” – asBradfordhas often been defined by its poverty in the mainstream media. “There’s something about making tragedy out of that,” he says. “Getting people to look at this with fresh eyes and not tell ourselves a story that’s just about the drudgery of a place.”One of the most striking things about Mozley’s prose is the way it conjures the family’s woodland home. This is a place where “the soil was alive with ruptured stories” and “the ghosts of the ancient forest could be marked when the wind blew”. Mozley and Alipoor grew up in York and Bradford respectively and, in one of their first meetings, Mozley recalls that they talked about “being very much from Yorkshire and steeped in Yorkshire, but maybe not in a typical sense, and having that immersion in the place but also the ability to step outside and look in”.Mozley has since left York for Edinburgh, where she is working on her third novel, and Alipoor and his company are now based in Manchester. In different ways, place has been central to their work. Mozley’s second novelHot Stewdepicts a vivid Soho under threat from luxury development, while in shows such asRich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in TehranandThings Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, Alipoor has explored the Iranian side of his heritage.There’s a sense in which nature is breaking throughThe name Elmet refers to the Celtic kingdom that stretched across what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire. Alipoor suggests that this region retains a distinctive, mythical quality today: “The boundary between the urban and the rural is not what it is in other places, and our sense of rurality isn’t the polite sense of what it means in Cheshire or the home counties.”He says there is in Mozley’s book “a sense in which nature is breaking through”, something this production will convey through language, movement and music.

Its overreliance on TikTok clips of rubbernecking strangers is in very poor tasteHannah J DaviesTue 21 Oct 2025 17.00 EDTShareIn July 2023, 17-year-old Charlie Cosser attended a party in Warnham, West Sussex. Like many parents of teenagers, Martin and Tara Cosser were happy that their son was going to a gathering at a private house, rather than on a potentially rowdy night out in Guildford, Surrey, as he had originally planned.Tragically, the Cossers were wrong. A fight broke out on the party’s dancefloor, and Charlie was stabbed three times in the chest by Yura Varybrus, who was 16 at the time. Charlie’s catastrophic injuries included a cut to his aorta, which led to internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. The many harrowing moments recalled here include Charlie’s sister, Eloise – now 18 – listening to her brother’s heart beat for the final time, before his life support was turned off two and a half days after the attack. He was, says Martin, “a beautiful son in every way”.The murder of Charlie Cosser is one of three cases featured in the second series of ITV’s TikTok: Murder Gone Viral, a series centred on crimes with apparent (some are more clear than others) links to social media, be it in their causes or the publicity generated after the fact. It is a strange show that veers unevenly from lurid true crime to excruciating family testimony (Eloise describes the family’s life today as “a lonely bubble”). Even when it is at its least sensationalist, its overreliance on clips of strangers taken from the titular social media app cheapens the whole thing dramatically.That is most clearly the case in episode two, about the death of a 13-year-old girl, Tristyn Bailey, in Florida. Here, the TikTok connection is largely confined to the wild speculation that erupted online in the wake of Bailey’s death. Heartfelt contributions from her family are interspersed with vapid proclamations from people who didn’t know her (Annie Elise, a crime vlogger, says she “knew something was wrong instantly” when she heard the teenager was missing). One uncredited TikTok clip describes Aiden Fucci – the classmate who would later go on to be sentenced to life in prison for Bailey’s murder – as “a piece of garbage”.While contempt of court is less of an issue in the US than the UK, the idea that people were discussing and hypothesising around the case so openly online is presented as something more worthy than the rubbernecking it so obviously was. Some of the TikTok clips still have their usernames intact; while it feels unfair to pick out any one of these social media sleuths by name here, a quick Google shows some of them posting short clickbait videos with titles such as “what are the most brutal true crime cases?” and “the unsolved mystery of human remains in a skip”.‘I felt doomed’: social media guessed I was pregnant – and my feed soon grew horrifyingRead moreThe episode about Cosser has, at least initially, a much less icky connection with social media; it was, in fact, his father, Martin, who was posting on TikTok about his son’s death, and who continues to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime online and in the wider world through the charityCharlie’s Promise. Even so, I can’t help but feel as though the family deserved better than to be lumped into a series that picks and chooses how it feels about the internet from minute to minute. Later, we are told that there was a deluge of racist material on the app about Varybrus, claiming he was a Ukrainian refugee, but we are given no further information. TikTok: Murder Gone Viral prefers a more facile approach, flashing up comments such as “I’m so sorry. [Varybrus] will pay in hell”.The final episode in the series revisits the deeply sad yet already heavily publicised death of Brianna Ghey, adding little to what the public already knows. However, given that Ghey – a transgender teen trying to find her place in the world – had a following on the app, it perhaps feels the least shoehorned of the three. Brianna “blossomed” on TikTok, says her dad, Peter, while we also hear from her friend Viv, another trans girl she met through the app. It’s a shame, then, that the programme once again relies on the generic waffling of strangers to fill the gaps.As standalone films, The Killing of Charlie Cosser and The Killing of Brianna Ghey could have worked, but they also could have been so much better. On balance, I think they will probably do more good than harm. But I’m still not totally sure what they’re trying to say about social media’s role in these devastating deaths.TikTok: Murder Gone Viral aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTikTokSocial mediaKnife crimereviewsShareReuse this content"

Actually, on second thought, maybe there is something bold about the way audiences have rejected, in quick succession, new movies collectively starring Margot Robbie,Colin Farrell,Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Channing Tatum, Kristen Dunst, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield, Keanu Reeves,Seth Rogenand none other thanDaniel Day-Lewis. This group of actors that would constitute an especially star-studded Oscars broadcast couldn’t muster a single hit among them. EvenLeonardo DiCapriomust accept his status as the exception that proves the rule: his movieOne Battle After Anotheris heading toward a respectable $200m worldwide – and all it took was one of the biggest stars in the world with support from familiar faces Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, a multiple-time Oscar nomineedirectingwith an Imax-sized budget, and almost universallyrapturous reviews. Put all that together in an adult-driven drama and maybe you can outgross, and lose somewhat less money than, Disney’sSnow White remake. (One Battle is unlikely to turn a profit on its theatrical release.)Apparently most male film stars don’t wear underpants. Have they never heard of #MeToo? Or accidents?Read moreMeanwhile, movies such asA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,The Smashing Machine,Roofman,After the Hunt,Good Fortune,Kiss of the Spider WomanandAnemonehad no such constellation of exciting elements forming in their orbit alongside their stars. Some of them couldn’t even manage particularly great reviews. But that used to be what movie stars were there to provide: some kind of baseline level of interest in a movie, even if it wasn’t getting best-of-year reviews or boasting cutting-edge spectacle. None of the aforementioned stars are expected to perform with the superhuman consistency of Tom Cruise between 1986 and 2006 or Will Smith between 1996 and 2016. But there used to be a certain number of dramas and comedies that would make $50m or more in the US every year as a matter of course, the ones with stars tending to have an advantage in that respect.View image in fullscreenMargot Robbie and Colin Farrell in A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.Photograph: Matt Kennedy/Sony Pictures EntertainmentIt’s not breaking news that franchise brand names have largelyreplaced starsin terms of ticket sales. But it is notable that in 2025, Warner Bros in particular has shown that not every smash has to be a presoldsequel or a reboot, with original, non-IP successes includingSinners,Weapons,F1and the aforementioned (if less wildly profitable) One Battle After Another. Between that and theincreasingly fallibleDisney empire, studios would be forgiven for assuming audiences might be willing to sample some more non-genre movies, and that stars might nudge them in that direction, just as DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Michael B Jordan presumably helped those Warner titles.So far, that assumption would be completely wrong. It’s not so much that any of this autumn’s star-laden bombs are One Battle-level world-beaters that audiences have painfully shunned. (Many of the year’s best movies will have platform releases, giving audiences more time to eventually shun them.) It’s more that not a single one has connected in a meaningful or even minor way; nothing even close to the modest but successful fall-season financial runs of past non-classic titles such asTicket to Paradise(Roberts, George Clooney),Hustlers(Lopez), orNight School(Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish). For that matter, any of these fall 2025 bombs probably would have been happy to match 2022’s disappointingDon’t Worry Darling, which nonetheless eked out close to $100m worldwide, presumably based in part on itsgossipy star power.View image in fullscreenKirsten Dunst and Channing Tatum in Roofman.Photograph: Photo Credit: Davi Russo/Paramount PicturesInstead, it seems increasingly like everything has to go right (great reviews, great trailers, online buzz, low competition) for even a modest audience to turn up for old-fashioned non-genre movies. This in turn creates a strange deflation effect where even those films that are able to become non-franchise events to certain segments of the population – One Battle After Another,Challengers,Poor Things, even something sillier likeThe Fall Guy– are not reaching the heights of genuine phenoms past. Some consider this a sign of audiences too savvy to run out and fork over hard-earned money just for a glimpse of their supposed betters, and there may be truth to that. Again, it is hard to make a case that anyone who skipped A Big Bold Beautiful Journey was doing a disservice to the art of cinema. (After Yang, a much better movie from the same director also starring Farrell, is available at home!)Yet it is also not as if celebrity culture is dying a deserved death in the face of increased sophistication. Kidsyearn forhard-to-attain careers as influencers or YouTubers rather than movie stars or singers, and plenty of podcasters trade in a cult of personality far scarier than the waning desire to watch Robbie for two hours because she has a nice smile. At their best, movie stars can guide viewers into stories or worlds that might not otherwise interest them; DiCaprio has been doing this for decades at this point. And if stars were truly no longer of any interest, streamers wouldn’t keep paying them to defect to various miniseries andimitations of their old movies.View image in fullscreenDwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in The Smashing Machine.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockSome stars, granted, tend to provide something more akin to advertised services, with clockwork consistency. A lot of those figures have had great luck on Netflix and the like, where, say, theAdam Sandlerbrand can be preserved (even, based onthesurprisinglyvariedworkhe has done for the streamer, perfected). But some of the best aspects of these current flops involve getting a look at what a longtime performer finds interesting at this point in their career: Julia Roberts playing especially prickly as an imperious yet dissatisfied college professor inAfter the Hunt, or Reeves refining the comedy of his Bill & Ted days as a well-meaning but fumbling angel getting a taste of genuine humanity in Good Fortune. There are smaller, less starry movies that explore similarly rich characters, to be sure, but they are not playing on several thousand screens. These movies aren’t being rejected in favor of anything in particular, except maybe staying home.Spinal Tap II, Julia Roberts and Paul Thomas Anderson: the best films of autumn 2025Read moreRecentlymusingon social media about why these types of movies no longer seem to draw an audience, I received hundreds of responses, including many variations on the greater cost-effectiveness of waiting for streaming and plenty of irritable insistence that these particular movies all looked bad or uninspired, as if they were just an anomalous blip as everyone waited for better movies. (To that I say: some better movies calledSplitsville,TwinlessandBlack Bagcame out earlier this year. You probably skipped those, too.) Potential moviegoers like to imagine themselves as egalitarian, smart, immune to the familiar and in search of novelty – and some of them are. But the truth is, it now requires an onslaught of inescapable hype to get people out to theaters in any kind of decent numbers, and being susceptible to hype is not necessarily the same thing as being a discerning viewer who only sees the good stuff. (There are also, of course, plenty of people who can’t afford constant nights out. This is not directed at them.) Liking a movie star enough to see them play a criminalhiding out in a Toys “R” Us storeor an earlyMMA fighter in the 90sisn’t necessarily a badge of honor. It is, however, one more form of engagement with your personal tastes, like having an interest in horror movies or romantic comedies. No one is obligated to follow a big name wherever they go. Just be aware of what companies are happy to swap in for old-fashioned irrational devotion: an algorithm designed to keep you on the couch.Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryMargot RobbieDwayne JohnsonColin FarrellJulia RobertsChanning TatumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last week on The Celebrity Traitors, the gothic drama of the creepy cabin mission was interrupted by an audible parp. “What just happened?” asked host Claudia Winkleman, struggling to keep her composure. “I just farted,” said actorCelia Imriesweetly. “I’m so sorry. It’s nerves – but I always own up.”All around her, fellow famous types dissolved into fits of laughter. It was immediately hailed as a contender for TV moment of the year. Take note, Bafta, if you’re not too busy holding your nose. Deadline magazinereportedthat the viral scene “put some wind in the sails of the show’s ratings”.At a time when doom merchants are sounding the death knell for traditional channels, talking point programmes such as The Celebrity Traitors might help save terrestrial TV. Powered by Imrie’s gas, viewing figures have risen to nearly 7m live and 11.7m in total, making the current contest an even bigger hit than the three “civilian” series. Half of all Britons watching TV at 9pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays are glued to the goings-on at Ardross Castle. And it’s two residents in particular about whom everyone is talking.Traitor Alan and Faithful Celia are locked in a battle to be the reality game’s undisputed MVP. Sure, there are deadlier Traitors (see quiet assassin Cat Burns) and more effective Faithful (see the two Joes), but it’s Carr and Imrie who are truly box office.View image in fullscreenHilarious value … Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryComedian Carr came out of the gate first, hogging the spotlight in early episodes. When he felt the shoulder-tap from Winkleman to anoint him as a Traitor, our bespectacled cult hero flew into a panic. “I have a sweating problem and can’t keep a secret,” he wailed, immediately dubbing himself “the new Linda”. Tasked with murdering in plain sight, he came over all a-fluster.“It’s such a stretch for my acting skills,” he said. “I don’t know how Meryl Streep does it.” As he gabbled nervously, glugged rosé and gave unsubtle winks, it was highly relatable. Carr was behaving exactly how many of us would if asked to commit televised subterfuge. Asone social media wag noted, it’s like your favourite wine o’clock auntie was suddenly moonlighting for MI5.Since coldly betraying his real-life pal Paloma Faith, Carr has grown into his treacherous role. He slyly covered his tracks with a heartfelt eulogy at Faith’s graveside and a string of pot-stirring fibs. He’s now writing death order scrolls with relish, chuckling: “I’ve got a taste for it now.” When the Faithful bemoaned the “murder” of Tom Daley, he shrugged: “Deal with it.” “Alan has become a killing machine,” said co-conspirator Jonathan Ross approvingly.That green velvet cloak becomes him. As Richard Osmansaid last weekon The Rest Is Entertainment: “Alan’s like an accountant who’s accidentally been made head of a mafia family. Everyone goes, ‘He’s not going to be able to handle the violence’, and within a year, he’s killed everyone.”Even in the midst of his murder spree, quick-witted Carr is hilarious value. When Daley threw shade at Kate Garraway for using the word “flabbergasted”, Carr told him: “You can’t call someone a Traitor just because they have a better vocabulary than you.” When Ross wore a leopard-print cardigan, Carr asked if he’d come dressed as the Flintstones and muttered:“Yabba-dabba-don’t.”He said of scatty Garraway: “If Kate doesn’t come down for breakfast, people will just assume she’s gone into a broom cupboard by mistake.” During the forest wailing mission, he said of one throaty banshee: “She needs to suck on a Fisherman’s Friend.”This one-man meme machine has alreadyspawned his own merch. After a “Carr crash” start to his stint in the Traitors’ conclave, the wild card comedian has miraculously dodged suspicion, using his impish humour and main character charisma to turn the tide in his favour. Giggly, gossipy Alan simply couldn’t be guilty … Could he? Carr has seen his odds to win slashed. He’s now among the bookies’ favourite to triumph.View image in fullscreenGloriously unfiltered … Celia Imrie confesses her flatulence.Photograph: BBCMeanwhile, Imrie is winning hearts and minds as the castle’s eccentric elder stateswoman. The faultless comic timing of her flatulence aside, she’s a total hoot. When her team had to wail down a woodland well for the latest mission, Imrie’s deranged shrieks went on for longer than was comfortable, reducing her castmates to hysterics.She dropped an arcane reference to “putting the pussy in”, to be met with blank looks all round. Imrie somehow kept a straight face while explaining that she was quoting nursery rhyme Ding Dong Bell. Back at the castle, she decided to conduct some amateur investigations, proudly announcing: “I’m going to snoop and listen in to other people’s conversations.” “You know you’re not meant to tell people when you’re snooping?” pointed out Carr.The pairhave already become soulmatesand sparring partners. While playing badminton in the castle grounds, Carr called out: “Celia, we need a bit of wind to get the shuttlecock over the net.” “Oh shut up,” she retorted, faux-crossly. At the normally po-faced Round Table showdowns, they keep giving each other the giggles, which pricks the tension perfectly.Gloriously unfiltered and mischievous, the 73-year-old makes for mesmeric viewing. If Carr is ascending towards national treasure status, stage and screen veteran Imrie is already there. On the same episode of The Rest Is Entertainment, Marina Hyde told Osman that Thursday Murder Club star Imrie was an object lesson in not underestimating older people. “She’s a walking marketing campaign for the world you’ve created,” said Hyde.Other players have had their moments – Nick Mohammed with his puzzle mastery, Daley with his graveside side eye, Ruth Codd with her anti-Ross rants (“Don’t piss in my ear and tell me it’s raining”) – but Carr and Imrie have been the most consistently fun.The unlikely sleuthing duo of rugby player Joe Marler and comedian Joe Wilkinson recently hatched their “big dog theory”, speculating that Ross and Stephen Fry are the two alpha stars. They posited that one will be de facto leader of the Faithfuls and the other of the Traitors, pitted against each other in a VIP death match. Combined with the growing suspicion around Ross, it means that Carr could soon become top dog in the turret. At which point all bets would be off.Against all odds, the Spexy Beast and the Pooper Snooper are the comedy double act the nation didn’t know it needed. If Carr chose to recruit Imrie to the dark side, it would be pure TV gold. A total gas, you might say.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe TraitorsAlan CarrCelia ImriefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s easy to miss: the plaque is not at eye level as they normally are, but up on the first floor, almost as if the blue plaque committee lost confidence in their uncharacteristic joke. Or perhaps John Cleese put it up.Terry Gilliam arrives. I like his jacket. It looks like it’s been stitched together from bits of blankets. “Me too,” he says. “I got it 30 years ago in a secondhand store in New York.” We’re going to wander around London, revisiting places that have played significant parts in his career, as he approaches his 85th birthday.The mother and son who worked the hotdog stall were filthy, totally Dickensian. I was in love with this placeThe dates on the plaque are right, he thinks. After the success of 1975’s Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which Gilliam co-directed (with Terry Jones), they had money. So he, Michael Palin and special effects whiz Julian Doyle rented this building. On the ground floor, they recorded the Monty Python albums. Upstairs was a studio where they did some of the effects for Life of Brian, like the spaceship crash. “We went down to the local magic shop, bought exploding cigars, emptied the gunpowder, then broke a lightbulb and put it on the filament.” Boom. Gilliam giggles at the memory. He giggles a lot, a childish, naughty giggle. I was half-expecting a grumpy old man. “At home I am,” he admits. “This is a performance.”View image in fullscreenWhere it began … the blue plaque on the old banana warehouse.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe area is much gentrified. He tells me about a mother and son who used to prepare their hotdog stall here, before wheeling it to Leicester Square. “They were filthy, totally Dickensian. I was in love with this place.” And over there was an armourer, “making armour the old way, pounding away on steel”.Really? It sounds like he’s recalling scenes from his films, but I check later and aNew York Times piece from 1978also mentions the Covent Garden armourer. Now it’s all high-end coffee shops and hair salons. What was once the Python’s warehouse is now Neal’s Yard Remedies, currently being refurbished. A workman notices Gilliam looking up at the plaque and asks who he is. “Terry Gilliam.” The man nods, but not knowingly. Wrong generation.After arriving on a boat from the US in 1968, Gilliam’s career really took off with the TV comedy sketch show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. I wonder if he felt an outsider? They’d all been to Oxford or Cambridge while he was, in his own words, “a monosyllabic Minnesota farm boy”, albeit one with a talent for animation.“I was in awe. They were so clever with words, great performers. I was just this guy cutting up pieces of paper and mucking around. But my sense of humour was like theirs, even though mine was more visual. That’s the thing about Python: the chemistry of the six of us. We were different, we fought, but the combination produced an inexplicable chemical magic.” Who could have known the only thing lacking would be a giant stampy foot?View image in fullscreen‘I was in awe’ … Gilliam, far right, with the Pythons.Photograph: Python/Sportsphoto/AllstarOriginally credited as animator, Gilliam was soon an integral Python, going on to co-direct Holy Grail, which led to a whole new chapter of making his own films. This building we’re standing outside is part of that chapter: he cut his 1985 satirical Orwellian fantasy Brazil here and cast Time Bandits, the film that preceded Brazil in his Trilogy of Imagination. We talk and walk. “Luckily I’m not recognisable like Cleese or Palin,” he says. He likes to talk to people though, stopping for a chat with a woman in a key-cutting booth. “Keep cutting those keys,” he tells her.Gilliam has nominal aphasia, meaning he struggles to remember the names of things. Once he couldn’t remember the name of his wife (it’s Maggie Weston – they met when she was a makeup artist on Monty Python). So much of ageing, he says, is regressive. “I’m actually regressing back to the clay that God uses to make Adam. What does Adam do when he gets going? He has to name everything? I’m doing the opposite. I’m un-naming everything!” The nominal aphasia might have something to do with a recent stroke. Gilliam didn’t know it was a stroke at the time, thought he was going blind, he tells an amusing anecdote about walking into an invisible man.We are at our next stop: the London Coliseum on St Martin’s Lane. Our route is planned around geography rather than along a timeline, so we’ve jumped to 2011, when Gilliam directed Berlioz’s The Damnation of Faust here. “I know nothing about opera. I’d probably seen one or maybe two maximum in my whole life.” But he was persuaded to do it. He set Faust in Nazi Germany, though had to tone it down when the production moved to Berlin. “They were very nervous about Faust in hell, with Hitler so prominent.”View image in fullscreen‘I know nothing about opera’ … where Gilliam directed The Damnation of Faust.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe security guard isn’t keen to let us in. Maybe he doesn’t believe that this guy with a rat-tail haircut in an old patchwork jacket once directed an opera here. While phone calls are made, Gilliam says, “I can show you where a good place to piss is,” and disappears down another alley.Ew. Yes, it stinks. I’m happy to report we don’t add to the stench: Gilliam just wants to show me a bit of proper London. It’s quite a contrast to the ornate Edwardian splendour of the Coliseum interior when we’re eventually allowed in.His Faust was a big success. “I was so proud – and 41% of the audience had never been to an opera before. They were coming in jeans. My happiest moment was on the last day. In the queue for tickets, a fight broke out! I thought, ‘Yes, we’ve made it!’”On our way to the final stop, Gilliam says he sees his life as a fairytale. “There’s the king and knights doing their thing. There’s the lovely maid who’s virtuous and being abducted all the time, and witches waiting. It’s all there.”His last film,The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, took 25 years to make because he kept running out of money. “Then my daughter met a lady who, late in life, had come into a lot of money. She had been following my career – or lack of it – and she gave us three and a half million euros, just like that. A Fairy Godmother came into our life. You’re going to the ball, Terry!”View image in fullscreen‘He was going to be the finest actor of his generation’ … Heath Ledger in The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus.Photograph: APWe arrive not at a ball but at a pub, the Horseshoe in Clerkenwell where, in 2008, Gilliam shot a scene forThe Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. The film follows a travelling theatre troupe whose leader, played by Christopher Plummer, is both wise and childlike and has more than a hint of Gilliam about him. Gilliam says he identifies more with Don Quixote. “It’s about a man who sees reality in a more noble beautiful way, constantly failing and smashed down, but you keep getting up. That’s the task.”Richard the landlord greets Gilliam warmly, and has fond memories of when Doctor Parnassus’s strange travelling theatre came to town. But a sadness hangs over the project.Heath Ledgeralso starred in the film – the last he ever made. Gilliam wants to show me where they had their last conversation and leads me to the men’s toilet. “So I’m here, having a piss, and Heath comes in and stands over there.” He indicates the other end of the urinal. “I’m happy pissing away and he says, ‘Terry.’ I turned and he had this ridiculous mask and clown makeup on. He says, ‘We’ve got to stop meeting like this.’ What a place to say goodbye.”Two days later Ledger was dead, having taken an accidental overdose of prescription drugs in his New York apartment. He was 28, although Gilliam says he always seemed much older. “Everybody who knew him said there’s somebody very old inside this young body. There was no question he was going to be the finest actor of his generation. He had it all, and everybody loved him because there was such a warmth about him. And it was his magnetism that worked on so many different levels, he was so smart and just capable of everything you’d ever want of an actor.”View image in fullscreen‘I think about my death every day. I’m not worried at all’ … Gilliam in the Horseshoe.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianLater, Gilliam was in Vancouver to shoot the sequences featuring the Imaginarium – a mirror through which people could step to explore their own imaginations – when he got the call about Ledger. “I just wanted to die,” Gilliam says. His immediate thought was to abandon the whole project, but he was persuaded to carry on. They ended up using footage they’d already shot of Ledger, but then got three actors who had known him – Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law – to play transformed versions of his character. The film is dedicated to Ledger.Not that he’s anywhere near it, but does Gilliam ever consider his own demise? “My death is something I’m not worried about at all. I think about it every day of course, but in fun ways. I just don’t want anybody in my family to jump the queue, that’s all. I’m out first, number uno.” He has a plan, it’s in his will. They have a house in Italy, he says, that sits like a nipple on a breast-shaped hill in Puglia. “I want to be buried there with the best view. Put me in the ground in a cardboard coffin, then get an oak sapling and stick it in my chest so I can grow up to be an oak tree. It’s beautiful.”It is indeed beautiful. And perhaps a little inappropriate, appropriately. Maybe a giant foot then stamps down on it …Film-maker and Monty Python veteran Terry Gilliam will be in interview at aspecial Guardian eventon 29 October to celebrate his extraordinary life and 50 years in film, live at Cadogan Hall in London and online.

We speak to some to find out whyElla GloverTue 21 Oct 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 11.31 EDTShareFromsolo traveltodining alone, people have increasingly been embracing social activities by themselves in the years since the pandemic – even in the ultra-social contexts of live music and club culture.A recent survey by Ticketmaster found that the number of people who have attended either a weekend or day festival by themselves has risen from8% in 2019 to 29% this year. Reading and Leeds festival introduced a campsite area for solo attendees this year, joining Download’s longstanding “lone wolf” area, and there are a growing number of social media pages such as London Solo Ravers, and WhatsApp groups such as Untitled Rave Community Project, for people venturing to nightclubs alone.“If I go to an event with someone else, I can very much spend the night doing their night, as they would want it,” says Anaïs Espinosa, a 26-year-old from London. “When I’m alone, I get to do whatever I want in the moment, whether that’s going to get a drink or being right at the front where the DJ is. You just act on pure instinct. I feel like a little video game character in a funny story.”Dr Karenza Moore, a researcher of club culture and recreational drug use at Newcastle University, says people’s top reason for going it alone is “a particular interest in a genre of music”: maybe you love happy hardcore but struggle to find anyone else who shares your enthusiasm for 180bpm insanity. This is reflected in Ticketmaster’s findings, too, which showed that interest in the music was the main draw for solo punters at festivals. And amid the cost of living crisis, people may struggle to find enthused friends who can also afford to go out. “If you don’t know anybody, and you want to go to that kind of thing, you just have to be OK with going on your own,” says Imi Jagger, who is 26 and based in Manchester, and has gone solo to a number of electronic music nights and queer parties.View image in fullscreenSome gig attendees say they go solo because their friends aren’t interested in the same kind of music.Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty ImagesSince the pandemic, there has been a rise in meetups such assingles nights, group events for strangers,offline hangoutsandwalking groups, lessening the stigma around being “a loner”. Two other reasons cited in Ticketmaster’s research were a sense of freedom and the opportunity to meet like-minded people, and Moore adds that many of us have become fatigued with meeting and interacting with people online: “People are really appreciating doing things in real life,” she says.Cat Rossi, a professor at the University for the Creative Arts in Surrey, who has a research interest in club culture, suggests that the rise in solo partying may be another facet of how “people are more interested in consuming experiences than things” today. And perhaps there’s a more cynical impetus at work: “What you want is the experience – and also you want to sharethat experience on social media.”But anyone in it for the Instagram likes will be in a minority, and Moore says that many solo ravers end up finding a sense of togetherness: “Invariably you go on your own, and then you’re not on your own.”Thirty-year-old Ben Walton from north Wales has been going out alone since he was 23, and does so two or three times a month. “I can meet new people from a variety of different backgrounds, and people I may never see again,” he says. “There’s a beauty in that.” Jagger agrees. During her time at Awakenings, a Netherlands techno festival, she tacked on to a group of Dutch friends she’d never met before, which she says she never would have done if she’d been with people she already knew. “Getting to know them for a weekend was so interesting. It’s fascinating, especially if you’re in a different country, because you get to experience a different culture.”This trend is partly facilitated by social media. Rossi says people have gotten used to “a hybrid digital and in-person community, and there’s lots of research about how the internet can connect you with communities that are not on your doorstep, but that are yours in the sense that you have shared interests”.View image in fullscreenSolo clubbers and ravers say they talk to people they would never have met if they’d been out with friends.Photograph: Slavica/Getty ImagesHaving enjoyed similar events with friends for around a decade, Espinosa only started going out alone this year, and chalks it up to age and confidence. Some research suggests that the averageage of festivalgoers is increasing, andolder people are still going out frequently, which may account for the increased number of people attending solo, something Moore also points to as a potential driver.‘I’ve made friends for life’: Rising number of travellers find going solo is the ticket to happinessRead moreBeyond that, there has been a focus on welfare and harm reduction at live music events, meaning that they are “perceived as safe: people know that if something happens, they can go and speak to the staff,” says Moore. For Espinosa, it depends on the crowd: “In general, it feels safer for me to be alone at a rave than a club, where people are usually just trying to pull and drinking loads of alcohol, whereas at raves, people are usually just there for the music and to dance.” Jagger is a little more sceptical. “I don’t feel physically safer at raves because spiking, harassment and assault are still so common,” she says. “But I do often feel more accepted.”But while it can be difficult at first to “let go”, as Espinosa puts it, going solo can also increase self-esteem. “It’s quite validating,” says Jagger. “To know I’m not dependent on other people and I can create great experiences on my own, too.”Explore more on these topicsMusicClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But these juvenile stories and essays shed fascinating light on the repression of Lee’s early lifeSandra NewmanTue 21 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareWhen a new book is published by a writer dead for a decade, there is always some suspicion that the bottom of the barrel is being scraped. When the writer is Harper Lee, there is also the unpleasant aftertaste of the release of her second novel, 2015’sGo Set a Watchman, which was promoted as a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, when in fact it was a formless early draft. The publication was also surrounded by controversy over whether the aged Lee, by then seriously disabled, had really consented to its publication.This new book, The Land of Sweet Forever, is a much more conventional enterprise: a collection of Lee’s unpublished short stories and previously uncollected essays. No deception is being practised here, and if people want to read the lesser scribblings of a favourite author, it is surely a victimless crime. However, like most such books, it has little to offer to those who aren’t diehard fans.The short stories, written in Lee’s youth, are all badly underdeveloped. Most fail to work even as vignettes. One centres on trying to find a place to unload a truck in Manhattan; another on a temporary change to the way the doxology is sung in a Methodist church. A slender piece about the quirks of New York movie audiences is categorised as a story, but feels more like a newspaper sketch.The young Lee seems to have little sense of what a story is.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe conventionally cheery tone is almost a hostile presence, drowning out and censoring Lee’s real thoughtsOn the positive side, there is already wit and charisma in the voice. One narrator, returning to her southern home town, recognises “a tall young man whose face belonged to the Wade family, but whose body showed extensive Talbert influence. He was Talbert Wade, of course.” This may be slight, but it’s elegantly done. There are also hints of iconoclastic anger struggling to get out, especially in The Water Tower, where a 12-year-old Mississippi girl erroneously thinks she is pregnant. Understanding that being an unwed mother would wreck the lives of her whole family, she decides the only way to save them is to destroy her shameful body. With another draft or two, this story could have been truly haunting. But the version we’ve been given is meandering and clumsy, and peters out inconsequentially. Perhaps the strongest story in the collection, The Cat’s Meow, deals with the Jim Crow-era mass incarceration of Black men. Here, the dialogue of the clueless white people is painfully convincing, but the narration keeps jarringly falling into the conventional chirpiness of mid-century women’s magazines.Up in smoke: should an author’s dying wishes be obeyed?Read moreIf the stories are juvenilia, the essays are rote outings on subjects such as “Love is the most important thing”, “Reading matters” and “My happiest Christmas”. The essay on love includes such insights as “Man is on his way to Venus, but he still hasn’t learned to live with his wife … Man now has the power to destroy himself and his planet: depend upon it, he will – should he cease to love.” The overwhelming feeling with these is that Lee was nagged by a publicist or friend into writing something, and struggled to achieve the minimum word count. It’s initially exciting to notice an essay on Truman Capote, Lee’s close childhood friend. But this turns out to be a puff piece written for the Book of the Month Club newsletter, and consists of stuff like: “Kansans will spend the rest of their days at the tantalising game of discovering Truman; what Truman found in Kansans will make people everywhere discover themselves.”If we regard this book as literature, it is an unqualified failure. But it’s more properly seen – and will surely be read – for the light it sheds on Lee’s life. As such, it’s obliquely fascinating, largely because it radiates repression. Often there’s a sense that we’re seeing the side ofHarper Leethat wasn’t exceptional, but representative of a generation of women who were mostly muzzled.Again and again, the narration is choked off just when things begin to get challenging. The gender nonconformity of the protagonists – all thinly disguised versions of Lee – is often obvious but never explicitly mentioned. The conventionally cheery tone is almost a hostile presence, drowning out and censoring Lee’s real thoughts. Beneath the surface, we often feel the stubborn surging of the excluded. Lee writes in The Cat’s Meow: “I suppose a lot of people like me have mastered the first lesson of living at home these days: if you don’t agree with what you hear, place your tongue between your teeth and bite hard.” We feel those painfully gritted teeth on every page of this book. In a time of rising censorship, it’s salutary to be reminded that an author as important as Harper Lee came so close to being entirely silenced.The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£22).

The chant was condemned by Glastonbury and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described it as “appalling hate speech”.Who are Bob Vylan? The British punks who had their US visas revoked for anti-IDF chantsRead moreBob Vylanwas dropped by its agency UTA, and the US state department revoked the member’s visas, forcing them to cancel a North American tour.Speaking on TheLouis TherouxPodcast in his first interview since Glastonbury, Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, was asked if he would do it all again.He replied: “Oh yeah. Like what if I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes I would do it again. I’m not regretful of it. I’d do it again tomorrow, twice on Sundays.He said the backlash the band had faced was “minimal compared to what people in Palestine are going through”.“I don’t want to overstate the importance of the chant,” he added. “That’s not what I’m trying to do, but if I have their support, they’re the people that I’m doing it for, they’re the people that I’m being vocal for, then what is there to regret? Oh, because I’ve upset some rightwing politician or some rightwing media?”Vylan’s conversation with Theroux was recorded on 1 October. At the start of the episode, the presenter states that it took place before the Manchester synagogue attacks on 2 October, in which two people were killed and three others injured, and before theceasefire in Gazacame into effect on 10 October.The musician said he was taken aback by the uproar sparked by the chant, and claimed members ofBBCstaff at Glastonbury told him on the day that the set was “fantastic”.The corporation’s executive complaints unit (ECU) has since found the BBC’s broadcast of the performancebreached editorial standardsin relation to harm and offence.Vylan told Theroux there was no sign of a controversy in the moment: “It wasn’t like we came off stage, and everybody was like [gasps]. It’s just normal. We come off stage. It’s normal. Nobody thought anything. Nobody. Even staff at the BBC were like ‘That was fantastic! We loved that!’”Vylan also hit back at Damon Albarn from Blur, who called the chant “one of the most spectacular misfires I’ve seen in my life” and described Vylan as “goose-stepping in tennis gear”.Albarn’s reaction was “disappointing” and “lacked self-awareness”, Vylan said.“I just want to say that categorising it as a ‘spectacular misfire’ implies that somehow the politics of the band or our stance on Palestinian liberation is not thought out,” he said.“I take great issue with the phrase ‘goose-stepping’ being used because it’s only used around Nazi Germany,” he added. “That’s it. And for him to use that language, I think is disgusting. I think his response was disgusting.”Asked what he meant by the chant “Death to the IDF,” Vylan said the chant itself was “unimportant”.“What is important is the conditions that exist to allow that chant to even take place on that stage. And I mean, the conditions that exist in Palestine. Where the Palestinian people are being killed at an alarming rate. Who cares about the chant?” he said.“Death to the IDF” rhymes, he added: “‘End, End the IDF’ does not rhyme, wouldn’t have caught on, would it? … We are there to entertain. We are there to play music. I am a lyricist. ‘Death, Death to IDF’ rhymes. Perfect chant.”Vylan also rejected claims from the Community Security Trust (CST), a monitoring and Jewish community safety organisation, that their set contributed to aspike in antisemitic incidentsreported two days later.“I don’t think I have created an unsafe atmosphere for the Jewish community. If there were large numbers of people going out and going like ‘Bob Vylan made me do this’. I might go, oof, I’ve had a negative impact here,” he said.When Vylan said he thought the band had been criticised more heavily than others for speaking about the conflict, Theroux mentioned the Irish band Kneecap, who havealso faced backlashfor their approach to pro-Palestine messaging.“That’s an interesting one,” Vylan said, “because as with everything race comes to play a part in that we are an easier villain, no pun intended, than they are because we are already the enemy.”Press Association contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsBob VylanGlastonbury 2025Louis TherouxIsrael-Gaza warBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI has strengthened guardrails around replication of voice and likeness when individuals do not opt-in,” the statement read.Actor Sean Astin, the new president of Sag-Aftra, warned that Cranston “is one of countless performers whose voice and likeness are in danger of massive misappropriation by replication technology”.“Bryan did the right thing by communicating with his union and his professional representatives to have the matter addressed. This particular case has a positive resolution. I’m glad that OpenAI has committed to using an opt-in protocol, where all artists have the ability to choose whether they wish to participate in the exploitation of their voice and likeness using AI,” Astin said.“Simply put, opt-in protocols are the only way to do business and the NO FAKES Act will make us safer,” he added, referring to theNO FAKES Act currently being considered by Congress, which seeks to ban the production and distribution of AI-generated replica of any individual without their consent.OpenAI publicly supports the No FAKES Act, with the CEO, Sam Altman, saying the company is “deeply committed to protecting performers from the misappropriation of their voice and likeness”.Sora 2 does allow users to generate “historical figures”, defined broadly as anyone both famous and dead. However, OpenAI has recently agreed to allow representatives of “recently deceased” public figures to request that their likeness be blocked from Sora 2.Earlier this month OpenAI announced that they had “worked together” with the estate of Martin Luther King Jr and, at their request, was pausing the ability to depict King on Sora 2 as the company “strengthens guardrails for historical figures”.Recently Zelda Williams, the daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, pleaded with people to“please stop” sending her AI videos of her father, while Kelly Carlin, daughter of the late comedian George Carlin, has called AI videos of her father“overwhelming, and depressing”.Legal experts have speculatedthat generative AI platforms are allowing the use of dead, historical figures to test what is permissible under the law.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIBryan CranstonArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Despite the conflict in Ukraine, the war is a background presence.

He did 19 jobs – shop assistant, hotel waiter, petrol attendant and security guard, among other things – in six cities. Although all these jobs were atrociously paid, they still earned him more than the one he tried for two years in the middle of this period: writer. (An 8,000-word story earned him less than 300 yuan – about £30.) Then, during Covid, he wrote a blog about his night shifts in a logistics warehouse, and it went viral. The blog expanded and became I Deliver Parcels in Beijing, which has sold nearly 2m copies inChinasince being published in 2023, and now appears in Jack Hargreaves’s English translation.The low-paid Chinese worker is at the mercy of an entirely unrestrained market. The jobs Hu does demand unpaid trial periods and have no base pay, and he works mainly for commission or a handling fee, which his employers can reduce on a whim. Disgruntled employees pick on each other, because “going after the powerful will only cost us in the end”. Experienced hands refuse to help newbies, on the grounds that “teaching the disciple might starve the master”. The only power Hu has is to walk away. When his bosses learn that he has no children, that his parents have pensions and medical insurance and don’t need his support, they worry that he will leave at a moment’s notice (and are sometimes right).To his customers, Hu is just a blurred head on their video intercomThe book’s longest and most compelling section narrates Hu’s time as a courier in Beijing, delivering parcels ordered online to workplaces or gated residential developments. On the busiest days, even with an unreliable battery-operated trike to get around, he walks 30,000 steps. He works out that he must earn 0.5 yuan a minute (about 5p) so as not to run his life at a loss, which means completing a delivery every four minutes. The 20 minutes he takes for lunch costs 10 yuan. Urination costs 1 yuan – provided the toilet is free and he only takes two minutes – so he avoids drinking too much water on his shifts. Some neighbourhoods have especially troublesome and time-devouring customers: Hu spends on them the time he saves in the better neighbourhoods, like a subsidy.To his customers, Hu is just a blurred head on their video intercom staring awkwardly into the camera. Even the online shopping addicts among them have no clue about a courier’s life, and neither know nor care that each failed delivery costs Hu at least 0.5 yuan. One frequent shopper, a tower crane driver, is always busy midair when Hu tries to deliver. Another tells him that “the customer is king” and Hu replies, with rare defiance, that “there should only be one king. I have to serve hundreds every day.” In China, though, the customer really is king. They can try on the clothes Hu has just delivered and then cancel the order on the spot, in which case he receives no commission and even has to repackage it all himself, eating up yet more time. He must pay compensation to dissatisfied customers. One fellow courier, after a customer complains about his attitude, is ordered to spend three days visiting neighbouring depots, reading aloud his own letter of self-abnegation.We learn little about Hu himself, other than that he is frugal – he doesn’t smoke or drink, cycles everywhere, and gets his hair cut at five-yuan stalls by the roadside – and that his natural shyness sometimes spirals into social anxiety and paranoia. One paranoid episode comes during a two-year stretch working in a windowless mall in Nanning, when the only time he spends outdoors is on the walk to and from work, usually in the dark. The 2008 Beijing Olympics pass him by; only the Wenchuan earthquake of that year, the tremors from which reach the mall from more than 900 miles away, briefly registers.Although this book is full of illuminating and often startling detail, it is written in flat, one-note prose that I found uninviting. Its deadpan, faux-naif quality has echoes of Haruki Murakami, but without Murakami’s surreal switchbacks or storytelling power. Hu manages transitions with phrases like “But I digress” and “Another thing that happened”, and his chapters and subheadings have austere titles like “My first job to my eighth” and “Other jobs I’ve had”. An avid reader of Chekhov, Salinger and Carver, he says little about how their work connects with his own life, other than that they are “powerfully resonant”. There are few concessions to the non-Chinese reader. We learn about the big online shopping peaks created by “Singles Day” and “Double Twelve” (12 December) that are the bane of a courier’s life, but I had to look up what these festivals involved.For all this book’s fascinating anthropological insights, I was left wondering if its bestselling success in China was the result of an authorial tone, and a cultural context, that has been lost in transit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Have they never heard of #MeToo? Or accidents?The Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan has let slip that an alarming number of actors go commando to fittings. The profession has rarely felt more alienStuart HeritageTue 21 Oct 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Tue 21 Oct 2025 10.04 EDTShareJenny Beavan is a living legend in the world of film. A three-time Oscar-winning costume designer, she gave Merchant Ivory films their distinctive look but was equally responsible for the visual onslaught of Mad Max: Fury Road.In 2016, her decision to attend various awards shows wearing unconventional fashion captured the zeitgeist twice; first when Stephen Frycalled her a “bag lady”and was forced off Twitter, and second whena clip of Alejandro González Iñárritu gloweringas she passed him went viral. In other words, Jenny Beavan can do whatever the hell she likes.What’s everyone’s beef with Jenny Beavan? Ten unfounded Oscars conspiracy theoriesRead moreAnd she has. In aninterview with the Telegraph, Beavan has decided to offer us a peek into her working world, by revealing that actors don’t wear pants very often. “It’s astonishing the number of male actors who don’t wear underwear,” she said. “I’ve had to go out and buy them pants – not Calvin Klein or anything like that; I usually get them from Marks – otherwise they try to hide themselves behind a chair looking marginally awkward. I think, ‘For God’s sake, if I was going to a fitting and trying on second-hand clothes I’d wear some pants’”.She has a point. Being fitted for costumes is an integral part of an actor’s job. Indeed, it is only during this process that many of them begin to understand the role that they have agreed to play. So with that in mind – if you knew that a vital aspect of your professional life will involve taking off your trousers in front of a respected head of department – wouldn’t you try to remember to put on some underpants before you left the house?Especially in this day and age. The #MeToo movement has done wonders in the last eight years, illuminating the sorts of abuses of power that the industry used to tolerate. And while dropping your trousers to reveal that you’re not wearing anything underneath may rank fairly low on the spectrum of showbiz impropriety, the culprits are still putting costume designers in a position of potential embarrassment. You’d think that in today’s culture, in which an exposed penis can end a career in a heartbeat, they’d all frankly be too scared to go pantless.And, moral outrage aside, why? Why forgo underwear in any circumstance? Underwear is really useful. It offers support and protection in equal measure. Have none of these actors ever had to break into an unexpected sprint? Testicular torsion is a real thing, and can in extreme cases lead to injuries so severe that removal is the only option. Are these actors so cavalier in their attitudes to free-swinging genitalia that they’re willing to risk testicular amputation in the pursuit of their favoured lifestyle?View image in fullscreenIt’s not worth speculating … Daniel Day Lewis in A Room With a View (1986).Photograph: Goldcrest/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHave none of them ever had to rush away from the toilet before they’ve been able to satisfactorily conclude their post-urination shake? Has a DPD driver never knocked on their front door while they were mid-stream? Has a smoke alarm never gone off? Have they never heard their toddler squeal “Look daddy, a knife!” from another room? You’d have to assume not, because if any of these things had happened, they would understand that a major benefit of underwear is to act as a drip blotter. Underwear is often the only reason men don’t walk around with little wet patches on their trousers. And actors are willing to relinquish this? Crazy.‘I couldn’t be less interested in fashion’: the designer who dressed Mad Max and Cruella – and changed the worldRead moreObviously, the worst thing to do would be to systematically parse every project on which Jenny Beavan has worked and try to figure out which actors she is referring to. This is a woman who has been in gainful employment for close to half a century, and the list of actors she has worked with is practically endless. She worked with Daniel Day-Lewis on A Room With a View, with Anthony Hopkins on The Remains of the Day, with Robert Downey Jr on Sherlock Holmes, with Frankie Howerd on HMS Pinafore. She could have been referring to any one of them – or none of them at all – but the identities don’t really matter. We are clearly in the midst of a pantless actor epidemic.

It’s about a 10-year-old girl named Amber (Bianca Belle) whose drawings of monsters magically come to life and wreak all kinds of havoc. Since they are the product of a 10-year-old brain, and drawn with felt-tip pens, the monsters are mostly a cute bunch of fuzzballs with googly eyes, burping up glitter. Though be warned, one or two near the end could spook even adult audiences.Things start to go wrong for Amber after she is caught drawing a picture of herself stabbing a classmate – loudmouth, obnoxious Bowman (Kalon Cox). Amber lives with her big brother Jack (Kue Lawrence) and their lovely dad (Tony Hale); her mum has recently died, and there’s a funny scene around the dinner table as her brother Jack looks up on his phone if they are orphans, resulting in Amber coining the phrase “morphan” (as in maternal orphan).Close to their house, the kids discover a bright blue lake that can miraculously fix anything. When Amber drops her notebook in the lake, the monsters on the pages come to life. The lake’s power is never properly defined in the story, but the action is good fun, and there is a valuable message about difficult emotions. Amber’s pictures are graphic but they express how she is feeling, while her brother and dad are bottling up grief. Another lesson, possibly learned from 80s kids’ movies, is that adults generally, parents in particular, are well-meaning but essentially ineffectual.This is a family film with an IQ higher than the average – though before you book your half-term tickets, ask yourself if your little one is ready to watch a kid take a DIY flamethrower to the face of a scary monster.Sketch is in UK and Irish cinemas from 24 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmFamily filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their zero-budget feature is fun for a while, but in the end it’s just not scary enough. There is nothing to make jump out of your skin or frighten you out of your senses. Kempt and Toti also star in the film, playing fictional versions of themselves: Rachel and Nick, horror-obsessed film-makers living in Kirksville, Missouri. Things go wrong after they buy a house on the cheap to shoot a haunted house movie. (Which sounds unrealistic, but you can actually buy a fixer-upper in Kirksville for less than $30,000)The idea is that we are watching behind the scenes documentary footage shot by Nick, who provides a forlorn voiceover: “I wish I never filmed any of it.” At first, the new house seems the perfect setting for a horror movie: there’s some satanic graffiti inside, a door that looks as though someone has taken an axe to it, even some creepy little portraits of stern-faced Victorians. The pair’s easygoing, self-satirising banter is good fun as Rachel considers the ways in which their haunted house might actually kill them: “We are literally inhaling rat faeces!”It’s all fairly entertaining until the scary stuff starts happening. As if the movie were coated in Gore-Tex, the frights simply don’t permeate the surface. After Nick films Rachel and her best friend Christian holding a seance in the house, a disturbing image appears on a wall. Strangers in hoodies start gathering outside in the dead of night, standing motionless and staring in. The longer it goes on, the more obvious it becomes that this isn’t going anywhere particularly interesting, and time drags as it gets there.It Doesn’t Get Any Better Than This is in UK cinemas from 22 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

So it’s taken a surprisingly long time to see a direct imitator: the dark-clad avenger El Corvo, played here by Marko Zaror. Not only does he have the gauche coiffuring (bald on top this time), but also the philosophical penchant, asking imminent victims if they’ve given themselves a present recently. If the Cormac McCarthy rip-off wasn’t enough, Ernesto Díaz Espinoza’s ponderous thriller also gives El Corvo a couple of scenes lifted from The Terminator, and the villain from Enter the Dragon’s blade-hand for good measure.Diablo isn’t all cliches though: martial arts multitool Scott Adkins has a potentially interesting role inverting the usual over-the-border revenge mission. He plays former bank robber Kris, who’s been charged with entering Colombia and kidnapping Elisa (Alanna De La Rossa), the daughter of drug baron Vicente (Lucho Velasco). Making good on a promise to her dead mother to extract her from the kingpin’s clutches, he bundles her into a car boot – and soon he not only has Vicente and assorted ne’er-do-wells on his six, but El Corvo too, hoping to cut in on the bounty.Giving Elisa a gun to reassure her while she’s in the backseat, Kris has to play daddy day-care to the coddled teenager who – for reasons not hard to guess – has the same volcanic temperament as his own. Despite a smartly animalistic performance from De La Rossa, nostrils flaring in outrage, it’s a mismatched pairing that never fully ignites. Given relatively little character detailing on his side, Adkins comes over more dour than an uncontrollable dervish game for sparring. Despite the exposition dumps, his backstory doesn’t translate into a satisfying redemption on the run.Luckily, there’s always gratuitous violence. After a couple of lacklustre bouts in which Kris dispatches sundry henchmen, Adkins and Zaror tear into each other impressively (twice). With Zaror also acting as action choreographer, the combat is kept rangy and flailing: they atomise an illegal casino the first time around, and in the climactic second, Adkins fends off El Corvo as he heads up a long staircase to join Vicente in trying to stop Elisa being dragged into an aggregate crusher, in a kind of heavy-industrial version of My Two Dads. Unlike the laborious setup elsewhere, this is the right kind of basic.Diablo is on digital platforms from 27 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I am greatly indebted to Reading Blue Coat school for giving me the confidence to express myself from a young age, particularly Mr Holleley. When I left, I had incredible confidence that I had something to offer the world, neatly wrapped in a deep ignorance of what the world actually was.I was handed a flyer for a comedy competition outside a charity fundraiser gig my dad took to me at the Royal Albert Hall. It was calledcomedystars.tv, where you uploaded a video to get voted into a final at the Edinburgh festival. It was brilliantly hosted bySimon Amstell, who eviscerated the entire endeavour on the basis it contained no stars or comedy.What inspired your latest show, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I Am?Short answer: Alex Turner,Arctic Monkeysand their creative journey thus far. Long answer: I quit standup for about four years after my last tour,Manhood. I had found the entire ordeal physically and mentally draining – not least because what was supposed to last four months ended up lasting two years due to a global pandemic. Comedian friends told me the Machynlleth festival is the nicest place in the world to do comedy, so when pondering if I ever wanted to do standup again, I booked myself a work-in-progress there. I resolved that if I enjoyed it, I’d keep going. The show is a statement about public perception, identity and Arctic Monkeys.Your show plays with the gap between how people see you and who you feel you are. When did that tension first become something you wanted to confront publicly?Without standup I have the potential to be an incredibly isolated person. What’s brilliant about the form is that it forces you into a room of people, and the wisdom of the crowd dictates to you who you are in relation to society. Communicating your private experiences to a room full of people – having them validated, or in the case of a number of my work-in-progresses, completely rejected – proffers one a much clearer sense of who one is. Oh, and bringing it back to the show, most people quite clearly see me as [Friday Night Dinner’s] Jonny Goodman. Or Pissface. Which they are well within their rights to do.View image in fullscreen‘Most people quite clearly see me as Jonny’ …Tom Rosenthal (far right) with Paul Ritter, Tasmin Greig and Simon Bird in Friday Night Dinner.Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4What’s one of the strangest fan encounters you’ve had?Very recently we moved house and I went to drop off some of our excess belongings to the local charity shop. On arrival they had a sign that stipulated it was a one-box maximum. I asked a staff member to confirm this was the case, at which point she said: “Well, not for Tom Rosenthal.” I dropped off six boxes. Never has charity felt so grubby.What’s been one of your all-time favourite gigs?Going to school in Reading and being born in the late 80s meant my friends and I adored The Office, so the time I warmed up forRicky Gervaisat the Cambridge Corn Exchange and got to take my best mate along is probably my best memory in comedy. Recently I’ve been very much enjoying the Comedy Garden gigs, where promoter Will Briggs gets a big tent and puts it up in various cities. But in truth I quickly forget nice gigs and will take bad ones with me to the grave.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?I don’t like it when comedians are negative about other comedians. Even though the industry actively rewards rampant self-promotion, narcissism and egregious behaviour of all types, there’s a fine line to tread. You are literally trading on being an extreme character – not to mention the fact you are financially incentivised to remind people of your very existence. It’s an annoying job to have, by its nature. So I think comedians should offer more compassion and understanding to other comedians, even if they’ve decided to tackle the industry in a different way or with a different style. Having said all that I do have five minutes in my show when I have a go at David Baddiel for writing about me and my dad [sports presenter Jim Rosenthal] in his book. So I guess another bugbear would be the rampant hypocrisy.Best heckle?One of my best friends in comedy once got heckled with: “Why do you do this?”‘Liam Gallagher is funnier than most standups!’: Is comedy the new rock’n’roll – or vice versa?Read moreCan you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?One thing that is true in standup and of life generally is nothing teaches you more than failure. I did the Cornbury festival once, and I followedFrisky and Mannish, a quite brilliant musical act. I was inexperienced and not good enough to handle a festival gig and following something far more impressive than a young boy talking. I was fresh out of my public-speaking club and keen to impress the middle-class folk of the Cotswolds. My dad’s friends were watching, and afterwards they gently commiserated with me. But I reasoned a part of them must have thought less of my dad’s capacity to procreate. I know it’s insane but the idea people had lost respect for my father’s sperm comprises my worst moment in comedy.What are you most excited about right now?I’ve become incredibly excited about the idea we live in a simulated holographic reality that we are all creating in our own minds, and that the reason we think a number of paranormal things are impossible is more to due to our scientific paradigm than their actual impossibility. Which is why it’s good that I have to get out a lot in the coming months to perform standup.Tom Rosenthal: Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I Am is atSoho theatre, London, 28 October-8 November and thenon tourin the UK and Ireland.Explore more on these topicsComedyComedy Q&ATV comedyTelevisionFriday Night DinnerRicky GervaisSimon AmstellArctic MonkeysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She takes off my shoes, dresses me in soft pyjamas and hands me a VR headset. Mum will be along soon to read a bedtime story, she says. ZU-UK’s tender encounter Within Touching Distance is part ofTake Me Somewhere, Glasgow’s biennial festival of wild-hearted international performance. With a teddy bear pressed into my hands, this is a deceptively gentle start to my day, which ends with a queering of the Apostles and a greased-up naked man being hand-fed fish.View image in fullscreenA slow act of care-taking … Within Touching Distance.Photograph: Zu-UKWithin Touching Distance is a slow act of care-taking, walking one audience member at a time through the course of a life, from being read a story as a child to clutching a walking frame in old age. Blending the physical with the digital, this smartly choreographed piece fights against technology’s lack of intimacy; when I’m watching “Mum” squeeze my shoulder in my VR goggles, I feel my shoulder squeezed for real. When she wiggles my toes, I feel each one pinched in perfect time with the image. I’d have thought being caressed by a stranger would be disorienting, but I’m so snug in bed that the contact only feels comforting and safe.The show works best in these framing scenes that ground us with physical contact, the story pressed into our skin. But with the bulk of the narration told solely through the VR, the middle is harder to hold on to, inviting vague philosophical questions and sorely missing the soft anchor of touch.Two dance shows walk the line between the limitations and possibilities of the body. Dressed in intricately embroidered bridalwear, Mexican dancer Lukas Avendaño leaps off the indigenous Mexican concept of the gender-straddling “muxhe” to conjure the restrictions we have invented around identity. In Requiem para un Alcaraván, he picks through slow, feminine rituals and scattily sprinkled snippets of story, employing us to help create a celebration of queer bodies. We are his bar staff, stage managers, dance partners and translators. An uncaptioned improv scene is hard to hear above the recorded brass band, but this messy procession from marriage to mourning is an entertaining riot of colour, leaving the audience in a blazing tangle of bright streamers.View image in fullscreenCelebrating queer bodies … Lukas Avendaño in Requiem para un Alcaraván.Across town, Susanne Kirnbauer-Bundy defies expectations of the ageing female body. A former principal dancer with the Vienna StateOpera, the elegant 83-year -old reclaims the spotlight in Come Back Again, which at times feels such an internal grappling that our presence as an audience is merely incidental. With flashes of raw beauty, this uneven production shines when Kirnbauer-Bundy is joined by her younger choreographer, Doris Uhlich, the limitations of the older woman’s movements a direct contrast to the younger’s speed and strength. Dancing together, they twirl the decades between them, a mirror and an archive, each oozing the joy of movement. Sitting together for a Q&A within the show, they shame the blinkered vision of the dance industry that continues to control a woman’s body, rejecting the idea that she can be too large or too old to be worthy of watching.View image in fullscreenReclaiming the spotlight … Susanne Kirnbauer-Bundy in Come Back Again.Photograph: Alexi PelekanosMy day’s standout is Selkie: The Wet and Wild Show!, a slippery piece of high camp that comes with the warning of a splash zone. Naked and rope-tied at the ankles “for health and safety reasons”, Scottish performer Craig Manson is a mythical seal in human form. Slopping greasily into a paddling pool and skidding around the stage belly-first, with a permanent docile smile, he is fed instructions and fish by his wetsuited, increasingly cruel trainers (a lavishly hammy Agnes Evans-Forrest and Jessica Kucelin).In a matching wetsuit, Melissa Toner’s imaginatively integrated BSL interpretation adds depth and complexity to this satirical comic-tragedy, keeping watch as our selkie interacts with the audience, flirting and probing and asking with wide, uncomprehending eyes, if we really get to go home whenever we want. A deliciously irreverent show, Selkie manages to sneak an unexpected meditation on animal rights and the misery of capitalism into its silliness. All while pumping out iconic queer anthems.Closing the night, The Last Supper is an audacious piece of large-scale political theatre. Mexa are a decade-old activist-artist collective from Brazil, made up of primarily trans and queer performers. With experience of homelessness and gender-based violence, they met in São Paulo shelters. They deliberately reject the type of stories you might expect from these details; an earnest sob story wouldn’t last a second on this unruly, catty stage. Instead, under João Turchi’s volatile direction, the group announces their final show together: a goodbye deserving of a last supper.Performed in Portuguese, grand attempts to recreate Leonardo da Vinci’s ubiquitous painting are curtailed by constant bickering, from creative debates to outright fist fights. If this performance is how they will be remembered, they say, it must be spectacular. So much is thrown at this haphazard cabaret that intentions are sometimes untethered, but the idea of determining your own legacy carries weight, especially as some of Mexa’s former members have gone missing in unexplained circumstances.The cast’s stubborn, fleeting ideas overlay and interrupt, thrown together with documentary-style footage of their fractious rehearsal process. But for all the animosity, The Last Supper is an invitation. Transforming the stage into a banquet for 30 audience members, a lavish meal of meat, fruit and wine appears for those fast enough to claim a seat. Fuelled by solidarity and built from precarity, this charged, raucous performance clings to the messy resilience of found family, which can be relied on in the absence of all else.View image in fullscreenDelicious … The Last Supper by Brazilian collective Mexa.Photograph: Maringas MacielUnexpected revelations and full-bodied participation are a constant at this festival. Across the UK, funding cuts continue to shut down performance venues and festivals, with European comparisons putting our funding models to shame. Last week MAYK, the company behind Bristol’s luminous international theatre festival,Mayfest, were the latest to announce their closure. What a relief that Take Me Somewhere has secured multi-year funding from Creative Scotland, covering the bold experiments of this festival and the next. Intrepid platforms committed to beauty, mess, wildness and risk should always have a seat at the table.Take Me Somewhereruns in Glasgow until 26 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreImmersive theatrePerformance artGlasgowDanceOperaVirtual realityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His voice was entwined with Erykah Badu’s on Your Precious Love, a duet that felt like an offering being passed between sweethearts. I was 14, the edge of adolescence, opening to my own life. Their voices sounded delicate, blooming – almost shy. A cover of a classic Motown record written by Ashford & Simpson and sung, most memorably, by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, D’Angelo and Erykah’s churchy call-and-response nodded to the past while low-pitchedboom-bapsreflected contemporary trends on the FM dial. It was a crossroads sound, working two ways at once, and the blend, the hybridity of it all, heralded the future.Before long, D’Angelo’s 1995 debut Brown Sugar got shared and traded and analyzed among my girlfriends. Though we were deep in hip-hop’s high-flossing, shiny suit era, we noticed how he insisted on tenderness. It was the ’90s; crack and the crime bill had ravaged our neighborhoods and hurt our pride. His visuals seemed to seek to restore it. His music videos had a relaxed, smoky cool; clips such as Lady and Me and Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine showed women in every hue of brown whirling beneath warm lights and D’Angelo’s own devoted gaze. I had a dozen first loves, just as many fears, and a bouquet of dreams for the future – D’Angelo’s songs seemed to catch my currents.The pathbreaking soul vocalist and multi-instrumentalist born Michael Eugene Archer in 1974 in Richmond, Virginia,died last weekin New York City at just 51. His passing has prompted a global outpouring of grief and remembrance for an artist who fused the sacred and the sensual and remade soul music for a new generation. Female listeners, especially, had long been attuned to his art. We could sense, perhaps, the women inside his sound. Even when he sang alone, his music carried the influence of female collaborators, muses, ministers, and church mothers who shaped his voice, his arrangements, and his emotional acuity.His duet on Lauryn Hill’s song Nothing Even Matters was yet another hymn about devotion. Syncopated finger snaps hit like heartbeats, and the lyrics crooned “You’re part of my identity.” What truer thing could be said about the concentrated learning of girlhood days dawning into womanhood? The first high heels, the first heartbreak, the first time I knew I wanted to write. “Oh to be a pear tree –anytree in bloom!” Zora Neale Hurston writes of her protagonist Janie’s awakening to herself and her world in Their Eyes Were Watching God. I was in bloom, and the music helped me know it.“Neo-soul,” a term coined by the music executive Kedar Massenburg to market young singers who revered the records of their parents, is something like a discredited term now: D’Angelo himselfsaidhe’d never claimed to play it. But there was a moment when something new quaked in commercial rhythm and blues. Jill Scott scatted her own tunes of devotion, self-love, separation, and incense. Angie Stone’s afro halo sparkled, and her velvet voice held our hearts in lovesick ballads like No More Rain (In This Cloud). She was a key collaborator of D’Angelo’s, a co-architect of his debut and co-writer of many of his most evocative tunes. And it worked both ways: Everyday, from her 1999 debut Black Diamond,was a rhythmic, deeply funky feminine reckoning that D’Angelo helped her pen.Around the same time, high-tech R&B songs like TLC’s No Scrubs skewered no-account men. Its response from the male rap group Sporty Thieves, No Pigeons, gave it right back to the women. D’Angelo’s, Angie’s, and Jill’s stream of soul offered a more harmonious vision of the sexes coexisting. Even if it wasn’t always rosy.D’Angelo’s vision of love felt effortless. And his frictionless fusion of the sacred and the sensual recalled another church-raised prodigy, Aretha Franklin, whom he echoes in the verses of the Latin jazz breakup cut, Spanish Joint. Franklin moaned about all the ways Dr Feelgood loved her well while insisting that she“never left”the church.The currency of soul music is sweat. The trickle of wet above Whitney Houston’s top lip. James Brown laboring until he drenched his clothing, groaning “it’s a man’s, man’s world” like both a promise and a threat. I was in a college dorm when I first saw D’Angelo’s video for Untitled (How Does It Feel), a single from his sophomore album Voodoo.The clip famously showed close-ups of the artist’s face and torso. Droplets of sweat, frame after frame of gleaming brown skin. It is an ecstatic performance, full of wails and shouts, but also a subtle dance of retreat, tension, release, call and response. He sang about spiritual ecstasy and sensual pleasure simultaneously; he reveled in his body before us. He did not separate the divine from the flesh, or tarry over the two realms as if they were in conflict.Now, after his death, we know his labors toward a holistic theology and a unified sound were anything but easy.By the time Voodoo arrived in 2000, critics were calling D’Angelo “R&B Jesus”, who’d come to save us from the vapid. They placed him in the lineage of soul men like Marvin, Donny, and Al Green – men who shouted and hummed with intense virtuosity but sometimes buckled under their own contradictions. D’Angelo was the son of a preacher, and he’d first displayed his talents at the Pentecostal church his parents ran, the Refuge Assembly of Yahweh. His father led the congregation, but his mother, Marian Cox, also ministered. “She spoke with fervor and fire,” according to her 2023 obituary. She was known for powerful prayers and for tending the less fortunate – especially women – in her community. Most critics took for granted that women had helped raise D’Angelo and failed to consider that they’d had any influence on his sound.Directing choirs, playing the organ and keyboards during service, the young artist noticed that covering contemporary gospel from groups like the Hawkins family offended some of his church’s elders. The sound was too funky, too close to the secular sounds found on the radio.Marian Cox wasn’t the only minister in D’Angelo’s maternal line. His grandparents ran a congregation thirty miles west of Richmond. It was deeper in the red-clay Piedmont, along the James River – a major artery of the domestic slave trade. After emancipation, Black families settled along its banks and built autonomous farming communities and a constellation of churches where they could worship as they chose. In this church, dancing was allowed. And the drum.It was Pastor Alberta Cox, D’Angelo’s beloved grandmother, who told him that he could sing what he wanted without fear of damnation. “I spent a lot of time with her,” the artist says in the 2019 Dutch documentary Devil’s Pie.She assured him that holiness could move, sweat, and groove. When she died in 2002, shortly after D’Angelo finished the Voodoo tour, the artist descended into a deep depression that led to his withdrawal from public life for over a decade.In the 2025 documentary Sly Lives! (The Burden of Black Genius), about the legacy of multi-talented funk and rock musician Sly Stone, D’Angelo spoke of the pressure to endure. “It can be unbearable, man,” he said. I wonder if he also meant the burden of genius. The film imagines genius as solitary – and male: D’Angelo is shown among peers like Q-Tip and André 3000, with only Chaka Khan as a counterpoint. But Stone’s most celebrated band had women on trumpet and keys, and many of D’Angelo’s most piercing compositions were co-written, arranged, or conjured with women. The solitary male genius is both a myth and a lie.In 2015, D’Angelo told the talk show host Tavis Smiley that he’d borrowed some of his fervor from the female gospelquartetMaggie Ingram and the Ingrammettes. His guitar, spare and unhurried, recalled the Piedmont blues of Etta Baker, all restraint and quiet intricacy. D’Angelo was a synthesizer of centuries, a musician who made one sound out of many histories – pressure and release, sensual and sacred, Holy Ghost and bawdy house. And women were there all along, moving him toward something whole.Explore more on these topicsBlack US cultureSoulfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first thing you do is feed on the cop who finds you, before smacking his partner into a wall so hard that his blood spatters the brick. A violent fanged rampage ensues, where you beat up and tear apart rival undead and their ghouls while currying the favour of the local court of vampires, and trying to keep your existence hidden from the mortal populace of this sultry city.But this is also a detective story: there’s a younger night-stalker sharing your brain, a voice in your head named Fabian, who talks like a 1920s gumshoe (presumably because he once was one). Fabian isn’t violent at all; he evidently works with the human police and the vampire underworld, snacking on consenting volunteers’ blood and using his mind-delving powers to solve murders. These two stories are two entirely different games in the same setting, but then everything about Bloodlines 2 feels stitched awkwardly together. It is unfortunate that I happen to be playing this right after bingeingAMC’s Interview with the Vampire TV series, because the contrast is stark. One is a masterful, frightening, sexually charged and deftly comic reimagining of vampire mythology. The other isOK.View image in fullscreen‘My interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveAppropriately, the development of this vampiric saga appears to have been cursed. The first Bloodlines game was a cult classic PC role-playing game released in 2004, and it took more than a decade for a sequel to get off the ground. Bloodlines 2’s development began in 2015 at Seattle-based Hardsuit Labs, led by the first game’s writer. But the development was fraught with difficulties, and in 2021 the whole project got passed on to a new developer, The Chinese Room. What has resulted is an interesting cut-and-shut job with elements of Hardsuit’s version of the game woven together by The Chinese Room into a 25-hour story that just about makes sense. It’s not a total bust, but there are a lot of evident loose ends.For example, there is a giant screenful of vampire abilities that you can learn, evidently intended to give you some choices about how you approach the game – seduction, brute strength, manipulation. But you start off already super powerful, and you get the most fun mind-control and neck-snapping dark powers in the first couple of hours, giving you little reason to learn more. When I tried to do something interesting with these abilities – such as possessing mortal prey on the street, or interrogating someone by breaking into their head – the game often refused to comply.And though my interactions with my vampiric brethren have been interesting, my interactions with the humans of Seattle have been downright baffling. Walking down the streets you’ll hear sex workers shout “Just gotta pay off these college fees!” to nobody. A businessman sitting on a bench opened with the line “Want to get into business together? Sexy business?”, then got up and followed me around the streets saying “I can’t wait to fuck you!” until I got so annoyed that I ate him. I know that vampires see mortals as inconsequential puppets, but not like this.View image in fullscreen‘Some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades’ … Bloodlines 2.Photograph: The Chinese Room/ Paradox InteractiveBizarre, out of place non-player character behaviour is not the only thing about Bloodlines 2 that feels extremely late 00s. It reminds me of the spate of awkward-but-interesting first-person games that followed 2000’s Deus Ex, and not just because of the outdated animation. Gliding with unnatural speed across the rooftops of Seattle is fun, which is just as well, as most of the game’s missions have you pootling back and forth across the city talking to people. But when you encounter ghouls – and there areso manyof them – you get drawn into some of the most awkward first-person fighting I’ve played in decades. It is so unfun that I knocked the difficulty down to easy after the first few hours so that these annoying skirmishes would be over faster.There is an OK vamp story hiding in here; careful, dicey conversations with dangerous fellow vampires are by far the most interesting thing that Bloodlines 2 has going for it. And I enjoyed some parts of Seattle, particularly the dive bars packed with people gyrating to (of course) goth music. The Chinese Room has managed to make something playable and vaguely interesting out of a game development disaster. But after the first few hours, I kept going more out of morbid curiosity than enjoyment.Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is out 21 October; £49.99/$59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesAction gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

When a walker or cyclist delivers the damning judgment “there’s no decent caff” to a group of friends, the ghastly silence is followed by everyone crossing the accursed region off their map. The sheer importance of this staple dietary ingredient is obvious from our island geography: Dundee, Eccles, Bakewell, Chelsea …So it was with some trepidation that I set out to walk around the Llŷn peninsula in Gwynedd, Wales, on part of what is called theSeafood Trail. I mean, I love a lobster, but what about the fruit scones? Bangor University’s school of ocean sciences has produceda map of seafood producersand outlets to encourage hikers as they stride along the coastal path. Fine, but it’s the late afternoon sugar lull that I worry about.Llŷn peninsula map, north WalesWe start on the north coast in Nefyn, a place that boasts anexcellent breweryand a good beach with one of the most Instagrammed pubs in Wales, theTŷ Coch Inn. Me and my friend Andy are both nervously scanning the weather apps as the forecast is stormy. The plan is to walk and camp, but only after a gentle start in theNanhoron Arms hotel. This proves doubly beneficial as the dinner includes a delicious Anglesey sea bass and, next morning, we can stay dry while watching a barrage of lashing rain come down. We have each brought a tent, but neither item has been tested at this level of downpour.The translation of Cwt Tatws is roughly the Potato Shed, but the name belies the true magnificence of this cafe close to a sandy beach in TowynI am already a convert to theWales Coast Path, one of the finest walks in the world, but I have never done this particular section. Immediately, we are off to a great start: the rain stops and we cross Nefyn golf course and settle into a rhythm of cliff and cove. In one sheltered spot, a few Atlantic grey seals play in the shallows while the older ones snooze on the beach. A kestrel hovers overhead and butterflies skip around a few late flowers. In May this would be a floral bonanza, but now we have blackberries to keep us going.View image in fullscreenLooking down onto the Tŷ Coch Inn, Nefyn under stormy skies.Photograph: Loop Images/AlamyThen, with lunchtime approaching, we start scanning ahead and almost immediately we seeCwt Tatws. The translation is roughly the Potato Shed but the name belies the true magnificence of this cafe, all the more splendid for its ideal location close to a beautiful stretch of sandy beach in Towyn. A rich selection of sandwiches, salads, pies and, of course, cakes, is augmented by cosy seating, a vintage clothing section and a range of Welsh products. Neither of us, unfortunately, has space in our rucksacks for a sack of sea salt or a bottle of Welsh whisky. However, we do manage an extra slice of coffee and walnut sponge before heading off.After 3 miles (5km), we drop down on to a sandy beach at low tide and weave through a set of sentinel rocks. This long lovely stretch, Traeth Penllech, is a real gem, leading us up to the first campsite atMoel-y-Berth. Run by Mike and Joanna Smith, this is the kind of place people return to every year. There is a shop and a handy cafe for breakfast where, the next morning, we sit and watch another rampaging storm come blasting through. When we emerge, however, the sun is out again.View image in fullscreenLobster lunch at Top Cat Caffi.Photograph: Kevin RushbyOur luck holds all day, but by midafternoon a crisis is looming. Without tea and cake, I reckon, I’ve only got a few miles left in my legs. But then at Porthor’sWhistling Sands beach,Caffi Porthorpops up, another gem, serving a vast range of delicious homemade cakes, including a Welsh stalwart,Bara brith. If you’re not familiar with this heavenly manna, it’s a fruit cake made with tea and spices. And Caffi Porthor makes the best I’ve ever tasted. Andy, foolishly, turns it down and the result, three miles later, is that he runs out of steam, taking a short cut across the headland toDwyros, our second campsite. Meanwhile, powered by tea and cake, I stride on for a further seven miles around what is the best section so far: the actual tip of the Llŷn peninsula. The spectacular cliffs offer a fine view of the tidal race between the headland and Bardsey Island. On a day like this one, when the wind is gusting powerfully and the current is running at about four metres per second, it’s a fearsome sight.If you’re not familiar with this heavenly manna, Bara brith is a fruit cake made with tea and spicesAberdaron, just around the corner, is a lovely village with an excellent fish and chip shop,Sblash, and a fine pub,The Ship, a good spot to try out a few words of Welsh as that’s the main language here, as on most of the Llŷn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I ask some teenage boys for the path to Rhiw, the next village, I’m met with sniggers. Apparently I’m asking for sex.View image in fullscreenKevin Rushby takes in an Irish Sea view.Photograph: Andy PietrasikThe seafood, however, has really kicked in now. At Rhiw I meet Brett and Nia who harvest crab and lobster for theirTop Cat Caffiwhere we eat a lobster salad lunch. However, the weather is deteriorating fast so we can’t get out to help with the day’s catch, something Brett encourages visitors to do. That evening, camped atRhydolion farm, we stagger an extra mile to the pretty inland village of Llanengan and eat bowls of delicious mussels at theSun Inn.The final day is a bracing stomp across surfers’ beach, Hell’s Mouth, a notorious shipwreck spot in the past, then aroundMynydd Cilanheadland to Abersoch where there’s plenty of cafes to hide from the storm. The seafood has been great, but it’s the memories of tea and cakes that I will treasure.The trip was provided byNatural Resources WalesExplore more on these topicsWales holidaysWalking holidaysFood and drinkUnited Kingdom holidaysWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where should I start?Ben, by email“Maybe with some carrots, onions, cucumber or beetroot – anything Ben has an excess of,” saysConnor Wilson, head chef atThe Kirkstyle Innin Slaggyford, Northumberland. “Fermentation is a great way of preserving produce, but it won’t give new life to things that are past their best.”That said, tired-looking carrots would be perfect forOlia Hercules’ go-to for newbie fermenters: “If they look dehydrated but without any rotting, they’re amazing to ferment,” says the author ofStrong Roots. “The sugars concentrate and you get this bright carrot flavour.” Start by slicing carrots (“the thinner or smaller the pieces, the quicker they’ll ferment”), then make a brine by mixing 35g rock or sea salt (“don’t use table salt”) with a litre of water (“tap is fine, filtered is better”), and making sure the salt dissolves. You can then go as fancy or simple as you like: “Drop in some peppercorns, allspice berries, coriander seeds, fennel seeds or anything else you think might go, bring the brine mix up to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to infuse and cool to room temperature.” Pop the sliced carrots in a sterilised jar, then fill with the brine, making sure the veg are fully submerged: “You don’t want any sticking out and meeting the air, because that’s when bad bacteria can attach.” Hercules then leaves the sealed jar(s) for a few days until signs of fermentation emerge – “The brine will turn opaque, and you’ll see some bubbles” – then taste, taste, taste: “Once the carrots are nice and sour, stick the jar in the fridge.”Yoko Nakazawa, author ofThe Japanese Art of Pickling and Fermenting, agrees that Ben should keep things simple. “Cabbage or turnips would be a great choice,” she says. “In Japan, there’s a type of pickle calledasazuke, which means ‘lightly pickled’, and they’re made by rubbing cut veg with 2-3% of their weight in salt.” Their taste will evolve over time: “With this one simple method, you can enjoy different flavours – crisp and salty at first, then slightly tangy and finally distinctly sour – and serve at different stages, either as a side dish, palate cleanser or even a simple garnish.”Of course, half the fun of fermenting is having a play around, so feel free to add spices, herbs or citrus peel as you see fit. Just be sure to follow a few simple rules. “First, it’s essential to keep everything clean to prevent unwanted bacteria and let only the beneficial microbes do their work,” says Nakazawa, who sterilises her containers, jars and utensils with boiling water. Then, she says, it’s just a case of trusting your senses and asking yourself: “Does it look appealing, smell inviting and taste lively?” That’s to say, look for “vegetables becoming bright, remaining crisp and bubbles appearing in the liquid; a pleasant, tangy aroma; a gentle fizzing or small pop when you open the lid; and the flavour evolving from salty to a refreshing acidity and great complexity.”Finally, just like the rest of us, ferments respond best when they’re treated well: “I speak kindly to them and avoid making them when I’m stressed or rushed,” Nakazawa says. “It’s a mindfulness activity.”Got a culinary dilemma?
