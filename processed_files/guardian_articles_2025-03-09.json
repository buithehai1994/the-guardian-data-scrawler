Last week Donald Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carveout for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada’s fragile economy in a recession.“America is notCanada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney told supporters, laying bare the existential crisis that has outraged Canadians, riven the longstanding relationship with the US, and promises to be the overarching theme in his tenure as prime minister.View image in fullscreenBefore the announcement, Trudeau said he was ‘damn proud’ of his government’s legacy.Photograph: Blair Gable/ReutersCarney said that while Canada had not asked for the fight: “We will win.”Before the announcement, the outgoing prime minister,Justin Trudeau, electrified the crowd by telling Liberals he was “damn proud” of his government’s legacy.But he warned of dangerous time for the country. “This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,” he told supporters.He also drew on the “elbows up” rallying cry to intense applause – a phrase from ice hockey legend Gordie Howe popularised in recent weeks after threats from Trump to annex Canada.It is unclear when Carney, who was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, will assume office. Trudeau and the new Liberal leader are expected to hold conversations in the coming days to determine the outgoing prime minister’s final day in office.With 85.9% of the vote, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis.Carney has followed anunusual path to power: he will be only the second prime minister in Canadian history without a seat in the House of Commons. While no rule bars this, convention suggests Carney will need to quickly announce plans to run for a federal seat.He will also be the first Liberal prime minister from western Canada, a valuable identity in a country that is politically divided along geographical lines.Carney spent much of his campaign pitching himself as an outsider, despite years-long ties to the Liberal party, including serving as an economic adviser to Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister.His definitive victory, foreshadowed by fundraising success and a spate of key endorsements from senior cabinet members with vast organising networks, could energise the incumbent Liberals.In recent weeks, theparty has reversed its political freefall,sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely.Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead moreThe shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent.In a leaked memo, the leftwing federal New Democratic party recently warned its members Carney would probably call a snap election within days of winning the leadership race, capitalising on his rising popularity and depriving the opposition parties the rich political optics of bringing down the Liberal government through a vote of non-confidence to force an election.The move in the polls is, in part, explained by repeated threats by Trump to annex Canada. In polling, Carney is widely viewed as the most trusted federal leader to navigate the current trade crisis because of his extensive economic background.“My government will keep the tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,” said Carney.Carney also attacked the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, the current frontrunner if an election were held soon, calling him a “career politician” who was running a deeply divisive campaign. “Division doesn’t win in a tariff war,” Carney said.But in recent weeks, several fumbles have underlined the challenges in moving from the corporate world to politics.Carney has waffled over his role at the investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, when it moved its headquarters from Toronto to New York – a politically sensitive issue given recent pressure from the US on businesses to uproot and move south.His attempts to clarify the issue prompted the Globe and Mail’s editorial board to praise him as a “fast learner in the art of prevarication and hairsplitting”.He has promised to put his substantial assets,believed to be valuedat more than C$30m (£16m), into a blind trust immediately.Speaking before the new leader was announced, former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Trump had united Canadians “like never before” and jokingly called on him to receive the country’s highest honours as thanks.“From one old guy to another old guy. Stop this nonsense. Canada will never join the United States,” he said to raucous cheers.“No one will starve us into submission because Canada is and will remain the best country in the world.

We’re clear there are no more emergency measures to do. We just need to make sure we use all of the operational levers we have,” he said.Prisons across England and Wales were 100 spaces away from reaching full capacity last August after more than 1,280 arrests during riots sparked by misinformation about the murders of three girls in Southport.The “operational levers” being pulled by ministers this year to try to avoid a repeat scenario include hundreds of “rapid deployment cells”, makeshift secure rooms that will be set up in the grounds of existing prisons. Another 350 cells that have been in a state of disrepair are being fixed up for use, sources said.View image in fullscreenHM Prison Highpoint is a category C men's prison in the village of Stradishall in Suffolk.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMinister were forced to introduce emergency measures to hold those arrested, charged and convicted last summer. It is understood that the Ministry of Justice’s latest preparations are not a result of any specific intelligence warning of riots.The riots took place between 30 July and 7 August following false claims circulated by far-right activists that the perpetrator of theSouthport attackwas a Muslim and an asylum seeker.Ministers were forced to activate Operation Early Dawn, when defendants were held in police custody and only brought to court if prison places were first confirmed as available.More than 500 new prison places were made available under emergency measures to hold arrested rioters at Stocken prison in Rutland and the newly repurposed HMP Cookham Wood, a former young offender institution in Borstal, Kent.Before the riots, the government had already implemented emergency measures to help ease short-term capacity pressures on prisons. More than 3,000 prisoners have been released on licence after serving 40% of their sentence, rather than the usual 50%.A Whitehall source said the cells being installed this year will be needed regardless of any sudden increases in demand because of the overcrowding crisis inherited by Labour.Lord Timpson, a surprise private sector recruit to Keir Starmer’s ministerial team, spoke to the Guardian at the launch of a 700-place expansion of HMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, which will make it the largest prison in the UK.View image in fullscreenCells and recreational facilities at HM Prison Highpoint.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianNew “house blocks” built over the next two years will include workshops and educational facilities to teach prisoners skills that could help them secure a job on release.As chief executive of the eponymous shoe repair chain Timpsons, Timpson has been responsible for training and employing hundreds of former prisoners, which he believes is vital to reducing demand for more prisons.“One of the ways we’re going to combat this ever-increasing demand on prison places is when people leave, they don’t come back. When 80% of offending is reoffending, something is not working. We have to get people ready to leave,” Timpson said.Many of Highpoint’s 1,300 inmates – men convicted of non-violent offences such as drug-related crimes, burglary and theft – should be retrained and spend more time serving community orders, Timpson said.Inmates at the prison can apply for employment and retraining including railway maintenance, electronic recycling and clothes recycling schemes. Some of the courses can offer a guaranteed job once they are freed.Despite being incarcerated at one of the UK’s best resourced prisons, Highpoint inmates face waiting lists of over 100 for some courses, they told the Guardian.One Highpoint prisoner said: “There are courses here, there is work here, but you can’t get on the vocational courses. So unless you are lucky, or know the right people, you don’t get training before you get out.”A reportby the prisons watchdog last year found that too few Highpoint prisoners were attending purposeful activity or receiving adequate education or training.Other inmates said there was little point being behind bars facing lengthy sentences unless they learn new skills.View image in fullscreenInmate Ross Payton says: ‘I don’t see the point in just sitting in my cell, not doing anything.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianRoss Payton, 33, from Harlow, Essex, who has served four years of a 24-year sentence for supplying drugs and guns, said: “I have changed since being here – I do not want to ever come back to prison – but I don’t see the point in just sitting in my cell, not doing anything.”Timpson acknowledged that there are too few vocational opportunities in prison, a problem exacerbated by the rise in the number of prisoners.“The prison population has increased – a lot of the cells here will be double cells now – but the number of courses and workshops haven’t doubled,” he said.Expanding courses and workshop options will require more public money – but the Ministry of Justice’s budget is vulnerable to cuts at the spring statement on 26 March because the department is “unprotected”, Timpson said.“We’re an unprotected department and, like all the other unprotected departments, we need to put our case forward to the chancellor for the spending review. I come from a commercial background and am very interested in the money and finances but it’s out of my hands,” he said.Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary,disclosed last monththat prisoners may be given the chance to earn their freedom through “good behaviour credits” after examining a similar scheme in Texas.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationJames TimpsonUK criminal justiceSouthport attackCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The criminals then demand money and threaten to share the material with others.The UK-based internet safety watchdog said it had five confirmed reports of 11 to 13-year-olds falling victim to sextortion attempts last year, out of a total of 175 confirmed incidents involving under-17s. The 2024 total was marginally lower than the 176 recorded in the previous year, but the IWF said sextortion remained a “huge problem”.Don’t scare us and use our language to discuss sextortion, say teenagersRead more“The fact that these perpetrators are casting the net to get 11 to 13-year-olds is worrying,” said Tamsin McNally, IWF’s hotline manager. “Although it is a small amount, I do worry that number will grow.”Last month, parents at a primary school in Edinburgh were warned to check their children’s devices after an eight-year-old girl was reportedly a victim of a sextortion scam.The school informed parents that an individual had been impersonating pupils on Snapchat and police confirmed that an investigation was under way after they received “several reports” of indecent images being shared.McNally said a new trend seen by the IWF involved criminals threatening to portray victims as perpetrators of a sex crime.“They are now saying they will send the image to others, but also make it look like you are a perpetrator of a sexual crime. That is imposing an extraordinary level of pressure to try to make victims pay the perpetrator,” she said.Last year, the National Crime Agency (NCA)warned international cybercriminals that it could seek to extradite themas it cracked down on sextortion. West Africa, and Nigeria in particular, has become a hub for sextortion gangs, according to the NCA.McNally said there would still be children living in fear of the consequences of a sextortion attack without being aware of an online system specially designed to take down sexual images from the internet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tech platforms are then able to take down the image or prevent it from being uploaded.The number of children using Report Remove surged in 2024, according to IWF. data that showed 1,142 reports were processed by the watchdog last year, a 44% increase on 2023. Nearly half the images came from the 14- to 15-year-old age group. Of the 175 sextortion incidents last year, 151 came via the Report Remove tool.One parent, speaking anonymously, said the service had been a “gamechanger” for their family after their 16-year-old son had fallen victim to a sextortion attempt.The IWF interim chief executive, Derek Ray-Hill, said: “It is crystal clear that there has never been a greater need for the service that the Report Remove tool provides.“These concerning figures show that offenders continue to ruthlessly target our children online, knowing that they are vulnerable to coercion, exploitation and abuse.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleSextortionInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

But when asked in an interview with the Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures “are you expecting a recession this year?” he demurred.“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,” Trump said.1:41‘I hate to predict things’: Trump downplays US recession fears amid trade tariffs – videoWhen asked whether he thought his tariffs on US imports would fuel inflation, he said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”He downplayed recent stock marketvolatilitythat followed hisducking and weavingover tariff policy on exports from Canada, Mexico and China and similar threats to other countries, despite his usual fixation with market performance in relation to the politics of the day and an appetite to claim credit when stocks rise on his watch.“You have to do what’s right,” he said.Last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested that theUS economyis on course to contract in the first quarter, triggering fears a recession could hit the world’s largest economy if weakness persisted and fueling stock market jitters.In 2018 Trumppostedon Twitter, now X, that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”, a view that isnot widelyshared by financial and economic experts.On Sunday, however, he was cautious overall after boasting throughout his election campaign of the swift gains his policies would bring for the US economy and ordinary Americans’ finances.Fox News Sunday Morning Futures anchor Maria Bartiromo introduced the topic of recession by telling Trump “look, I know you inherited a mess”, even though most experts agree that predecessor Joe Biden, a Democrat, left the Republican president a stable economy where inflation, although painfully high for a long time, was continuing to come down and international trading conditions for the US were steady.Meanwhile, also on Sunday morning, NBC’s Meet the Press TV politics show was interviewing US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.He pushed back on concerns that the prospect of Trump’s global tariffs would cause a recession in the US. “Absolutely not,” he said. “There’s going to be no recession in America.”Lutnickadded: “Anybody who bets against Donald Trump, it’s like the same people who thought Donald Trump wasn’t going to win a year ago … you are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America … I would never bet on recession, no chance.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS economyTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company, which has been a major polluter of the Unesco world heritage site, recentlyconceded defeat in its legal efforts to block the public from accessing data related to how much sewage it was dumping into the lake.United Utilities had argued that information on how much phosphorus was being detected at a main sewage treatment works on Windermere did not fall into publicly accessible environmental information.On top of legal discharges made by the company into the important habitat, various investigationshave found it also illegally dumped millions of litres of raw sewageinto the watercourse.Reed and the water minister, Emma Hardy, will be in Windermere on Monday as part of a “Things Can Only Get Cleaner” tour, to see where investment in water infrastructure will underpin the building of new homes, create jobs and bolster local economies.Reed said: “Windermere is a stunningly beautiful national treasure – but it’s being choked by unacceptable levels of sewage pollution.”He added that the government was “committed to cleaning up this iconic lake” as part of its Plan for Change scheme to upgrade the crumbling water infrastructure and increase economic growth using more than £100bn of private investment.The government was also working “to stop all sewage going into the lake and restore it to its natural beauty”, Reed added.Local groups and organisations have set up a feasibility study to look into what is needed to eliminate sewage discharges into Windermere and draw on successful examples and innovation from around the world.The study has been set up by a coalition that includes United Utilities, the Environment Agency, Ofwat, Save Windermere, Love Windermere, the Lake District national park authority and Westmorland and Furness council.A £200 investment from United Utilities will go towards upgrading 10 wastewater treatment works at Windermere and reducing spills from four storm overflows discharging into the lake to two a year by 2030. Upgrades to the remaining two storm overflows are due from around 2030-35.The private sector money will go towards sewage pipes, water treatment works and nine reservoirs, supporting 1.5 m new homes, 150 large infrastructure projects and power industries such as gigafactories and datacentres.Money from water company fines and penalties has been ringfenced to deliver local water projects, and schemes to clean up waterways are to get up to £11m.Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery, rare species and cultural heritage attract seven million visitors a year, generating £750m for the local economy.Explore more on these topicsPollutionLake DistrictUnited UtilitiesWater industryRiversWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Merz is hoping for the backing of the Social Democrats and the Greens, with whom the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority is still possible in the existing parliament, which remains in place until 25 March.However, Merz acknowledged on Sunday he still had work to do in order to win over the Greens to his plans, whose support is needed if a two-thirds majority is to be reached. The Greens have signalled their strong objection to the fact that hardly any reference has been made to climate protection in Merz’s proposals.Merz said in the Deutschlandfunk interview that “intensive” talks would take place with the Green party next week. “We will integrate climate protection measures [in the investment proposals],” he said.Merz’s CDU/CSU came first in a federal election last month and is seeking to form a “mini-grand” coalition with the Social Democrats. The two parties announced on Saturday they had completed a round of “sounding talks” to establish whether there was sufficient common ground between them before the start of formal negotiations. Official talks could begin in the coming week.Major sticking points are expected to be migration and security, with Merz having ridden on a pre-election ticket of considerably toughening up on rules over who can enter Germany and under what circumstances they could stay.The new government is under huge pressure to take the wind out of the sails of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which soared to second place in the election, with almost 21%, promising among other policies a mass “remigration” of criminal foreigners and migrants with no legal right to stay in Germany, should it come to power.Addressing concerns that his plans to tighten migration regulations would put Germany at odds with its neighbours, Merz said he intended to be fully compliant with EU rules and would seek pan-European consensus. “We want European solidarity … but Germany also of course has a right to defend its own security and order,” he said.Merz has said he has hopes of forming a coalition by Easter, on 20 April.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzNuclear weaponsFranceForeign policyDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They sit beside the kidneys and make three key hormones: adrenaline, cortisol and aldosterone. Nodules, which can develop on one or both glands, produce excess amounts of aldosterone, a steroid hormone which regulates how much salt the body retains instead of using the kidneys to flush it away. The retained salt then gives someone high blood pressure or hypertension.Primary aldosteronism can send someone’s blood pressure as high as 200/130, far above the 120/80 level doctors say is healthy, increasing the probability they may suffer a fatal cardiovascular event. It can be challenging to treat because some patients do not respond well to standard blood pressure medications and thus remain at heightened risk of death.Doctors in London and Cambridge have developed the innovative treatment, which is called targeted thermal therapy (TTT) or endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation. It could “transform” the lives of patients and cure that type of high blood pressure by using short bursts of intense heat from a needle to destroy the nodules, medics involved say.It takes only 20 minutes, is done under sedation and allows the patient to go home that day, whereas surgery to remove an adrenal gland takes one and a half to two hours and involves the patient having a general anaesthetic and a two or three-night stay in hospital.A trial of TTT in 28 patients with primary aldosteronism reported in The Lancet last month provided “proof of principle”. Four patients were able to come off drugs altogether after undergoing the procedure while another 12 greatly improved their blood pressure or halved their drug intake, and it stopped the body producing too much aldosterone in three-quarters of participants.“This procedure could potentially transform life for one in 20 people with high blood pressure by reducing their risk of stroke, heart attack and heart arrhythmias. They feel better, they have more energy, they are less depressed and they achieve a normal blood pressure without having to take a medication every day or having surgery,” said Prof Morris Brown, a co-author of the Lancet study and professor of endocrinology at BartsHealthNHS trust in London.Brown, who is also a professor of endocrine hypertension at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said: “We have known about primary aldosteronism for 70 years but nothing has changed in how we manage it for 30 years. And now we are able to get away from cutting out an entire organ for the sake of a fingernail-sized nodule and hugely improve the lives of people who have high blood pressure for this particular reason.“It’s very exciting when people who’ve had uncontrolled high blood pressure for years have this procedure and come home the same day and find that their blood pressure is back to normal literally the next day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This minimally invasive technique appears to be safe and effective. There are potentially many individuals living with high blood pressure that may benefit from this new treatment.”She added: “High blood pressure is often called the ‘silent killer’ because it usually presents no noticeable symptoms yet significantly increases the risk of serious health issues such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.”Explore more on these topicsHealthHeart diseaseHeart attackMedical researchNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

The figures reveal a significant rise in applications during the final three months of last year, coinciding with Donald Trump’s re-election to the White House, when there was a 40% year-on-year rise in applications.The Guardian spoke with three Americans living in the UK about their reasons for wanting to become British citizens.View image in fullscreenMichael Lark.Photograph: none‘Healthcare, gun violence and politics – it all pushed us out’Michael Lark, 58I grew up in Pennsylvania but spent most of my life in Texas. My wife and I always thought we’d stay in the US and work to make things better, but after a while, we realised some things just weren’t going to change.When my wife developed health issues after Covid, we started seeing just how much money we were spending on healthcare. That got us re-evaluating everything else. We’d always leaned more democratic. We’d always felt like when there were problems, we needed to stick around and try to help make everything better. But with my wife’s health issues and everything that was happening with Donald Trump, the more we looked at it, the more we realised that things weren’t going to get any better.But it wasn’t just about politics: the culture of gun violence, the resignation people have about it. I think polls show that something like 80% of people want stronger gun laws, but the government won’t change things. I remember reading an interview with a parent in the US who told their kids: “Well, this is just the world we live in.” And I thought, no. It’s not the world we live in. It’s the world America lives in.We moved to the UK in 2023 and settled in Shrewsbury, which has a great community of comic book professionals – my industry. Within weeks, we knew we weren’t going back.With my particular visa, I have three years before I can apply for settlement and that’s what we intend to do. I already know I want to become a British citizen. We love it here and compared with where we lived in the United States, we just feel the quality of our life immediately improved dramatically.There’s a sense of we’re all in this together and that does not exist in the United States. In the United States, it’s every man for himself, and everybody wants to get ahead with the implication being you’ve got to get ahead of somebody else to do that. I’m sure there are people have that sense here, but it’s not just an overriding cultural feeling.View image in fullscreenJoshua Hickman.Photograph: none‘I knew America wasn’t going in a good direction’Joshua Hickman, 38I was born in Virginia and grew up in rural Texas. I originally came to the UK in 2010 for what was supposed to be a short stay, but once I was here, I realised I wanted to stay permanently. I just felt like something was off about the US, though I couldn’t put my finger on it at first. Then Snowden exposed NSA surveillance, and it all clicked – I knew America wasn’t going in a good direction.In 2016, after finishing my master’s degree, I had to return to the US because of visa restrictions. But by then, I’ve been too, how should I say, anglicised, if you will. My viewpoints on life in the world have been changed by being over here. And eventually I just got to the point where I realised that living in the US was never going to be an option. By that point, Trump was in power.I was involved in Black Lives Matter protests in Montana, where we had militia men pointing guns at us while police stood by, and that was when I knew I couldn’t stay in the US long term. It was never going to be the safe place I wanted it to be. And, it was only going to get worse.I came back to the UK in 2020 to study musical psychology, and now I work here on a visa. By 2028, I’ll be eligible for indefinite leave to remain. I always knew America had this in it. I just made sure I got out early. It takes a year before I can get a passport, so it’ll be by 2030 that I’m fully English.‘It hit me that laws can change in an instant’Melissa Clements, 38I grew up right outside New York City and I moved here in 2009 for a blind date with my now husband. At the time, I thought I would be going back to the US for graduate school, but had to change to go here. I did my graduate degree at King’s and at the time they had the highly skilled migrant visa which they have gotten rid of which I think is one of the many reasons people are thinking about citizenship. I then got married to my husband and switched over to a [different] visa.In 2014, I decided to pursue my German citizenship through my Jewish father’s heritage. At that point, I didn’t think of getting British citizenship because I thought I could live here for ever and it’s fine. And then Brexit happened. There was a question of EU rights, but I got my settled status.I had two daughters and we bought a house here so we felt settled. But my dad is actually the one who keeps pushing me to get my British citizenship. Perhaps because he grew up as an immigrant and he knows what a piece of paper means. He always tells me you never know when they’re going to change the laws. And that is the predominant thing that echoes through my head.When Trump was sworn in a second time and started making moves to revoke birthright citizenship, it hit me that laws can change in an instant.Now, after years of living in the UK, I’ve completed all the requirements for citizenship. The only thing stopping me? I just don’t want to spend £1,500 on it. Still, I probably will. I just want to make sure I can always be wherever my daughters are.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the pandemic, many of us got used to using lateral flow tests to check if we were infected with Covid or were likely to infect others. But despite the gag-inducing testing routines of the pandemic thankfully fading into memory, we may not have seen the back of those small diagnostic cartridges.Boots UK recently launched finger-prick lateral flow tests (LFTs) to detect levels of vitamin D, iron or cholesterol in people’s blood, as well as an influenza test. Trials of LFTs to rapidly diagnose strokes are under way, and the type of sample that can be loaded on to these tests is expanding rapidly, from fingerprint sweat or river water to cat vomit.LFTs are designed to rapidly detect a molecule of interest without the need for specialised, costly equipment, by incorporating highly specific antibodies into a plastic cartridge. These bind to the target and trigger a colour change if it is present, usually resulting in a red or blue line in the device’s reading window.Speedy finger-prick tests to diagnose strokes trialled in CambridgeshireRead moreThe first commercial LFT, the Clearblue pregnancy test, was launched in the late 1980s, and until Covid hit, such urine-based pregnancy tests were their primary application. However, the pandemic has ushered in a new era of innovation for these tests.“First of all, there’s a much wider awareness – not only with the general public but the scientific community – of lateral flow, and treating it as a more serious alternative to laboratory testing,” said Dr Chris Hand, the chair and co-founder ofAbingdon Health, which develops and manufactures LFTs on behalf of other companies.“People are starting to understand the benefit of being able to test on site or at the point of care, that you can do the next stage of whatever process you’re doing immediately.”Thanks to the pandemic, the capacity to manufacture these tests has also expanded massively, while the experience of self-testing means most people are familiar and comfortable with this technology.“The beauty of lateral flows is that they are easy to use but also easy for people to understand: you put a sample here, and a line means positive; no line is negative,” saidGonzalo Ladreda, the chief executive of Upfront Diagnostics, which is developing LFTs for early stroke detection.graphic showing how LFTs workBecause of this, not to mention the innate flexibility of the technology, the number of potential applications is expanding rapidly.“Most things you want to measure, you can measure with lateral flow,” Hand said. Tests are being developed or launched to detectmicrobial contaminants in aircraft fuel, disease-causing organisms such asE coli in river water, orconcussionin contact sports. In July, the UK’s first range ofLFTs for petswas launched, capable of detecting the 12 most common infections in cats and dogs.Advances in the materials used in LFTs are also opening up the possibility of testing additional substances – such as faeces, milk or sweat, orplantmaterial such as leaves or roots – in increasingly smaller volumes. For instance, Cambridge-basedIntelligent Fingerprintinghas developed LFTs that can detect drugs including cannabis, cocaine and opiates in fingerprint sweat, which are already being used to test employees and job candidates in safety-critical industries.A major growth area is healthcare. Besides early stroke detection, UK trials of two LFTs to detect the deadly bloodstream infection sepsis are getting started.The first,Neutrocheck, is designed to be used at home by patients whose immune systems have been weakened through chemotherapy, and who are therefore at high risk of sepsis. Currently, such patients are advised to attend hospital if they are experiencing even mild signs of infection, to check their levels of infection-busting immune cells called neutrophils are high enough. While awaiting the results, they are usually injected with antibiotics as a precaution, even though most are fine and don’t need to be in hospital at all. This puts pressure on the NHS and is stressful and inconvenient for patients.“If you’re in your final month of life and you’re trying to deliver your bucket list, you don’t want to spend 12 hours waiting in an emergency department to be told to go home,” said Dr Ron Daniels, an NHS intensive care consultant and founder and chief medical officer of the UK Sepsis Trust. It has been supporting development of the Neutrocheck device in the hope that it could identify which patients genuinely need to attend hospital and which could remain at home.Whereas LFTs typically measure dissolved substances or tiny viral particles, Neutrocheck captures and quantifies much larger neutrophils, as well as a blood protein called C-reactive protein that is associated with infection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA separate device calledSeptiloopdetects whether immune cells in the blood have recently been exposed to bacteria. It is designed for use by A&E departments to identify early signs of sepsis in patients who are not yet showing symptoms. A trial to investigate the economic impact of this test on the NHS is expected to begin within months.The ability to rapidly identify high-risk patients or the likely cause of their symptoms could also be particularly valuable in lower-income countries, where laboratory infrastructure may be weak or nonexistent and patients’ nearest hospital many hours away.Daniels believes LFTs could help to counter the growing threat posed by antimicrobial resistance. Giving antibiotics to patients who don’t need them, or won’t respond to them, is contributing to this problem. Yet, because laboratory tests often take days to return a result, doctors often err on the side of caution and prescribe these drugs. “I think there are huge opportunities for LFTs to identify which patients with symptoms of infection require antibiotics and which don’t,” Daniels said.Further innovations are coming.“One of the advantages of lateral flow is that it can multiplex, so you can measure different things at the same time,” said Umaima Ahmad, the chief executive and co-founder of52 North, which developed Neutrocheck. “We’re currently measuring two things but we could definitely look at incorporating five or six things across a single device.”Abingdon is working on reducing the amount of single-use plastic associated with these tests. “We’re looking at using more sustainable material in the cassettes, including paper-based systems or biodegradable plastics,” Hand said.Even so, there may be challenges ahead. Useful as rapid diagnostic tests might be, Daniels said: “I think we have to recognise that the quality of lateral flow tests is not as high as that of laboratory tests, and so we have to make sure that we integrate them into clinical systems in a careful way.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “While the use of self-testing kits, including lateral flow tests, can have benefits for patient care, it’s vital that a thorough pilot and evaluation is undertaken before any wider rollout of self-testing initiatives takes place in the NHS.”She urged similar caution about consumer tests for hormonal or nutritional deficiencies, or infections. “With the risk of false positives and negatives, and no offer of an interpretation of the results or aftercare, self-testing kits can mean patients experience a significant amount of stress and anxiety – prompting them to seek guidance from their GP to interpret any results,” she said. “This not only negatively impacts our patients but it can also intensify the enormous pressures that GPs and their teams are currently under.”Daniels said there was little incentive for hospital laboratories – which control testing budgets – to support the incorporation of LFTs into hospital workflows, when they could manage quality control more easily with lab-based tests. Also, whereas funding is available to support innovations in specific disease areas, “there isn’t really any innovation budget available to deliver more general service change,” he said.“I’m a moderately senior intensive care clinician but if I decided I wanted to buy these lateral flow tests, I would have no budget available to me.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here, Klev has created a house within a house, placing her bespoke building inside a vast glass barn, delivered as a kit from Denmark and erected on site in just two weeks. This glass shell not only protects the family home inside it, but also shelters an indoor garden and garden rooms, where Klev can nurture plants and trees that would never usually survive a Norwegian winter.View image in fullscreenThe open-plan kitchen and dining room on the ground floor.Photograph: Richard Powers/Inside Living“Inside the greenhouse I can grow grapes, apricots, nectarines and peaches,” says Klev, whose two greatest passions are architecture and gardening. “I can also grow a lot of herbs around the other plants: parsley, salvia, melissa… herbs that don’t grow so well outside. And I can also use the greenhouse to grow small plants from seeds that I can plant out in the open later on, in the spring or early summer.”Klev grew up on the farm, situated in a rural area to the west of Drammen and Oslo. Now her mother and father, as well as her brother and sister, all live close by. She initially studied ecology before switching her attention to architecture at university in Trondheim, followed by a year in Stockholm. She worked with two practices in Oslo before co-founding her own business, known as Outline, based in Drammen. The Greenhouse Home was one of her first independent projects and also one of the most personal, shared with her husband, physicist and hydrogen specialist Arnstein Norheim, and their two young children.View image in fullscreenThe bedrooms have windows that open to outside the greenhouse allowing fresh air in.Photograph: Richard Powers/Inside LivingHaving inherited a parcel of land on the farm, one of Klev and Norheim’s greatest wishes was to be able to enjoy the feeling of being outside and immersed in the natural world all year round – including even the harsh Norwegian winters. The solution was the super-sized greenhouse, manufactured by Drivadan in Denmark, and delivered to the site as a vast kit of parts, ready for assembly on a pre-prepared concrete pad. The resulting glass shed is 38ft tall with an integrated ventilation system providing natural cooling via roof vents during the warmer months. This glass shell provided a secure and stable environment, beneath which Klev was able to create her own unique home, the indoor garden and a collection of garden rooms.View image in fullscreen‘The glasshouse helps make it possible for us to grow things and keep using these garden spaces through the winter.’Photograph: Richard Powers/Inside Living“One really important thing was that I wanted to make sure every room in the house had a window that opened on to fresh air and not just into the greenhouse,” she says. “So all the bedrooms and key spaces are located to the north, or to the east, which also helps keep those rooms cool in the summer. Then I also angled one side of the house holding the most important space – the kitchen, where we spend most of our time – so that it fully connects with the greenhouse spaces alongside. The kitchen is really the hub of the house.”View image in fullscreenSocial spaces, like the dining room and library, open out into the garden zone.Photograph: Richard Powers/Inside LivingThe layout evolved from these key decisions. This spacious kitchen also holds the dining area and a small lounge, all spilling out into the bright and enticing garden zones alongside. A library, his and her offices and two of the four bedrooms are also on the ground floor, while the main sitting room plus the master suite and an additional bedroom are upstairs. The flat roof of the house-within-a-house also offered the opportunity to create another shared space – a rooftop terrace ideal for entertaining, or as an additional sleeping zone in the spring and autumn.“Also we have no lights or streetlights on the farm,” says Klev, “so it gets completely dark, and we can see the stars through the glass ceiling.”View image in fullscreenThe glass ceiling lets in ample light, but also a chance to stargaze, thanks to a lack of light pollution.Photograph: Richard Powers/Inside LivingSustainability is a key concern, and the farmstead is close to functioning off-grid with its own biomass plant, water source and, most recently, a micro hydroelectricity station installed by Klev’s father, as well as solar arrays. There is also an element of self-sufficiency to the family’s way of living, with Klev growing fruit and vegetables, while sourcing other food and livestock as locally as possible, including rearing their own sheep.“I spend most of my spare time growing vegetables and, for me, sustainability is part of a bigger picture,” she says. “The biomass plant uses wood from the forests around here, which my sister owns. It heats the houses and brings us hot water. My brother’s wife has horses, so we use the manure on the vegetable garden. It’s all connected. There are big changes in how we experience the house and the garden during the year, but the glasshouse does help to make it possible for us to carry on growing things and keep using these garden spaces all through the winter.”For more information, go tooutline-ark.noExplore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesSustainable developmentDesignArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was a time of automation and global competition, a new era of enormous change, and Terkel wanted to discover how the world of work might offer ordinary people a sense of purpose; of what he described as “daily meaning as well as daily bread”.What he discovered is that there were people doing “good” jobs, sometimes performed with grace and beauty – the piano tuner, for example, the stone mason, the firefighter – but that most workers were trying merely to survive the day. As one of his interviewees told him: “Most of us… have jobs that are too small for our spirit.”Not just about the money: pioneering study reveals best and worst jobs in UKRead moreTerkel’s book – whose full title isWorking: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do– later spawned a Broadway musical, a graphic novel and thena Netflix seriespresented by Barack Obama.Now it has inspired an examination of the world of work in the UK in the 2020s; one that is again based upon extensive interviews, across a landscape that has largely been deindustrialised. This too is published at a time when the workplace is being revolutionised, this time by artificial intelligence.Inhis book, Charlie Colenutt aims, like Terkel, to discover the ways in which our employment can nourish us, or leave us drained. As in the US half a century ago, many people seem to suffer the latter. A panel beater says he aches all the time and has too little time for his children; a chef says most of his colleagues are alcoholics or drug addicts; an accountant laments the loneliness of working from home during lockdown: “I know everyone’s on LinkedIn posting a picture of their coffee with their dog at their feet, sun shining through the kitchen window. It looks like you’re having a nice morning but what are you like at 6pm when it’s gloomy and you haven’t spoken to anyone all day?”Even a derivatives trader, paid a vast fortune in the City while still in his 20s, endures existential disquiet: “I struggle to see the point of my job. I think it doesn’t really need to be done. It basically serves only to make myself and my company’s shareholders richer. I’m totally checked-out, to be honest.”A chef says most of his colleagues are alcoholics or drug addicts; an accountant laments the loneliness of working from home during lockdownWhile Terkel heard frequently how gruelling manual labour could be – “strictly muscle work”, as one steel mill employee put it – most of Colenutt’s 68 interviewees work in the service economy, and he encounters many complaints about mushrooming bureaucracy.A midwife says that whenever she gives an expectant mother a back massage, she must fill in a form. A childminder has three filing cabinets in her kitchen – “and that’s before you go to my attic”. A construction site manager has 1,600 unread emails in his inbox. A church minister in Northern Ireland says he has less and less time to study his Bible, as “an awful lot of ministry today is like being an administrator”.In this way, occupations that looked very different a generation ago are now coming to resemble one another. They also entail similarly increased workloads. A lawyer usually sends her last email at 2.30am. A primary school teacher, who was previously a soldier, says: “There were some tough times in the army, but I’ve never felt under more pressure. I’ve probably cried in front of my headteacher more than anyone else in my life. It was far less stressful in Afghanistan.”View image in fullscreenAuthor Charlie Colenutt believes the mountains of paperwork generated today stem from corporate fears of failure.Colenutt believes that the mountains of paperwork are being generated by organisations’ fears of failure: of being sued or publicly criticised by a regulator. As a consequence, workers are doing less of their actual work, instead spending their time inputting data, writing reports and ticking boxes. Morale is sapped and staff turnover rises.But he finds too that the joy and pride of work can be found in unexpected places. A food delivery rider says he is often exhausted and occasionally very wet, but that he loves cycling around London. “It’s a chance to see the sights. I’ve crossed Tower Bridge a hundred times. You feel a freedom on the bike. You are not strapped to a desk. That’s the best thing.”A cleaner knows she is making a difference in her clients’ lives and says: “I get a real sense of fulfilment when I look back at a room I’ve cleaned. I think, oh yeah, lovely.”Perhaps one of the most satisfied workers in Colenutt’s book is a joiner, who employs one apprentice and who finds that the work he delivers, and the training he gives, results in a life of deep contentment. “I don’t want a fleet of 10 vans,” he says. “I don’t want to be on a million pounds a year. I don’t want to be any higher than I am. I’m happy. Everything’s balanced nicely, work, social life, family, gym, and still time for other things.“I know that what balances can easily topple over, but if that happens, I’ll deal with it.”Ian Cobain is the author of Anatomy of a Killing (Granta, £10.99)Is This Working?: The Jobs We Do, Told by the People Who Do Themby Charlie Colenutt is published by Picador (£20).

The exercise you need for a healthy, happy life – and eight ways to make it easierFast, free and phenomenally effective, push-ups are an unbeatable way to build the muscle you need every day – all the way into old age. Here’s how to master them, even if you’ve previously struggledPhil DaoustSun 9 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareIf you can’t do push-ups – or if you’re still scarred by being forced to do them as a kid – it can be hard to see the point of them. Sure, they look impressive, especiallythe “explosive” varietythat launches you into the air, but even the standard version is so demanding thatarmies use it as a punishment: “Drop and give me 50!” Then there’s all the macho, chest-beating rubbish that surrounds them. It is no surprise many of us avoid them, or think we will never master them.The thing is, we probably can with the right preparation, and we should definitely try. Push-ups are one of the most effective ways to strengthen your upper body, building your chest muscles, your shoulders and your triceps. They will help you open a heavy door, lift your bag into an overhead locker, lever yourself off the floor after a fall. You can do them whenever you have a few minutes at home, at work or on holiday – no need to go to the gym or spend a penny on equipment. Once you’re used to them, they won’t even leave you sweaty.“If you’re doing them correctly they will recruit your core as well as your upper body,” addsCali Joseph, a personal trainer (PT) based in Walthamstow, east London, who is helping me try a few variations. Those core muscles, such as your abs and your spinal erectors, are what stabilise your pelvis and lower back. “Push-ups also improve joint health, daily movement quality, posture and injury resilience,” saysDeborah Lee, a PT from Grantham, Lincolnshire. Like any resistance exercise, they will keep you healthier as you age by slowing the muscle loss that starts in your 30s, as well as bone diseases such as osteoporosis.View image in fullscreenFuture-proofing … push-ups strengthen your bones as well as your muscles.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDonnaJean Wilde, the Canadian teacher who holds thewomen’s world recordfor the most push-ups in an hour – a jawdropping 1,575 – won the title last year at the age of 59, watched by 11 of her 12 grandchildren. She still does at least 500 push-ups every day. “I’m not getting any younger,” she says, “but it’s such a safe activity that I hope I can continue it to keep other problems at bay.”“It’s something that you can probably do in some form for ever,” says Joseph.There’s no denying that push-ups take training, though. For the standard version, you have to start in ahigh plank, lower yourself in controlled fashion until your chest is almost touching the ground, then lift yourself back up again – without bending anything other than your arms. Viewed from the side, your body must remain in a straight line from your head to your heels – no sagging at the knees or hips, no dipping of the head, no lifting of the bum. You need to brace your core, tuck in your pelvis and clench your buttocks from start to finish. It’s two-thirds strength, one-third concentration and one-third bloodymindedness. Yes, this is mathematically impossible, but that’s push-ups for you.You’re lifting between 50% and 70% of your body weight. It’s hard because it’s hard“Many people think push-ups are hard because they are somehow weak or not doing them correctly,” says online PTAmy Snelling. “I always put it like this: you wouldn’t walk into a gym and expect to bench press half your body weight on the first go – most people train for years to get to this point. In a standard straight push-up, you’re pushing about 70% of your body weight. Even in a modified knee push-up” – where you take some of the weight on your knees – “you’re lifting around 50% of yourself. It’s hard because it’s hard.”View image in fullscreen‘Push-ups teach you the importance of consistency,’ says Joseph.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianParticularly if you’re a woman. “Women tend to have a lower percentage of muscle mass on their upper body than men,” says Snelling. “There are also plenty of social and psychological factors at play. When fitness is marketed to women, it’s all about toning, flat stomachs and big glutes, whereas men are talked to in terms of growing muscle and having big arms – so it’s easy to see why push-ups would be on most men’s training programmes and not women’s. Traditional gender roles also mean that some women tend to have less time to train than their male counterparts.”Stick with it, put in the work and women can be just as good as the guysThat’s still no reason to avoid them. “You just have to stick with it, put in the work, and you can be just as good as the guys,” says calisthenics starRaahavy Rasaiya, who started doing push-ups at the age of 10. Thirteen years later, she can crank them outon her fingertips, while wearing a weighted jacket.It’s not just muscle that you’ll be growing. “A push-up might help you get up off the floor more easily,” Snelling says, “but to me, learning to do push-ups is about creating confidence as well as building upper body strength.”“They teach you to do difficult things,” agrees Joseph. “They teach you discipline, they teach you the importance of consistency.”“I used to hate them,” says Lee. “To an extent I still do. But I persist.”Eight tips to take the pain out of push-upsAching arms? Short of breath? Can’t face it any longer? Here are the ins and outs of the up and downs.You don’t have to start on the ground …View image in fullscreenSofa so good.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianYou can build up to full push-ups by doing them against a wall, the edge of a table or the back of a sofa. This shifts some of the weight off your hands. If you’re training in a gym, you can stick a barbell in a squat rack and use that. As with standard push-ups, keep your body in a straight line as you move. Once things get easier (they will!), you can graduate to something closer to the ground.… or in a full-body plankView image in fullscreenHead, shoulders, knees and toes.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianA partial plank, with your hands and knees on the ground, rather than your hands and toes, will also make things easier. But make sure you keep that straight line from knees to shoulders as you go up and down. No hinging at the hips!You can skip the up bitFor a “negative” or “eccentric” push-up, start in a high plank, lower yourself with correct form until your chest is almost touching the ground, then get back up however you like. Do this enough and you will build the strength to do a full rep without losing your form. Slower is better.You need to look after your wristsView image in fullscreenShake it off.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianEspecially when you’re starting out, it’s worth warming up with some gentle strengthening exercises. Get on all fours in a tabletop position, then put just a little weight on your hands as you turn them palm up, palm down, fingers facing forward, fingers facing your knees, fingers facing out, fingers facing in … Then sit back and give your hands a good shake.Don’t flare your elbows …View image in fullscreenClose action.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianYour hands should automatically drop into a comfortable position, under and a little wider than your shoulders, but beginners often flare their elbows and put unnecessary strain on their shoulders. Better to have them closer to your body. Especially if you do a lot of yoga, you may be comfortable with them almost brushing your ribs, though this will work your triceps harder. Joseph goes a little wider: “An American lady said you want your elbows to be a slice of pizza away from your torso. I’m like, yeah, a generous slice of pizza away.”… unless you have a good reasonFootage of Wilde racing through her 1,575 push-ups shows her with her upper arms at right angles to her torso, and her hands unusually far from it. This would normally make everything harder. “I have this condition in my hand called transverse myelitis,” says Wilde, “and it gives me quite a bit of pain. This stance feels better.”Don’t be afraid to experimentDepending on your build, mobility etc, you may find you prefer one of the supposedly advanced pushup variations. I like push-ups with rotation, where you turn your body 90 degrees at the top of the move and reach one hand to the sky, so you’re almost in a side plank. You get a nice little rest in that rotated position and anyone watching thinks you’re much more athletic than you are.You need to breathe!View image in fullscreenAnd relax.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThat’s right: one more thing to think about. But it is easy to forget as you focus on your core, your elbows, your bum … Try to breatheinon the way down andouton the way up.Drop and give us 12!This training guide from Cali Joseph should build the strength and stamina for a dozen push-ups without a break. Aim for three sessions a week, taking at least one rest day between sessions. Each stage should take at least two weeks; don’t move on until you’re happy with your progress. If it takes longer, it takes longer.Stage oneWall push-upsStand a few feet from a wall, place your hands on it at shoulder width, and lower your chest to it. Push back up. Do three sets of 10-12 reps.Knee push-upsPosition your knees on the ground, keeping your body straight from head to knees. Lower your chest to the ground, then push up. Do three sets of eight to 12 reps.Plank holdsHold a high plank for 20-30 seconds, keeping your body straight from head to heels. Do three sets.Stage twoIncline push-upsPlace your hands on a raised surface (bench, step, table etc). Lower your chest towards the surface and push back up. Do three sets of eight to 12 reps.View image in fullscreenDon’t forget to celebrate your wins.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianNegative push-upsStart in a full push-up position, then slowly lower your body to the ground (three to five seconds descent). Push back up or reset to the start position. Do three sets of five to eight reps.Advanced plank holdsHold a high plank for 30-45 seconds, maintaining a straight body from head to heels. Do three sets.Stage threeFull push-upsPerform a full push-up with your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Do three sets of one to three reps.Full push-up variationsFor more of a challenge, add variations likediamond push-upsor wide push-ups. Do three sets of five to 10 reps.Stage fourAim for three or four sessions a week, but keep at least one rest day between them.Full push-upsBuild up to three sets of 10-15 reps.Stage fiveAdvanced push-up variationsSpice things up with decline push-ups (feet elevated) orclapping push-ups.

But what’s this? We’re thousands of miles away and in the distant past, but we’re uncomfortable and frustrated, mopping our troubled brows and wondering if we’ve all made a horrible mistake? That’s right: Ten Pound Poms is back for a second season.Based on a real scheme that saw hundreds of thousands of Britons flee postwar austerity and move to Australia, paying a tenner for their passage on the understanding that a utopian existence awaited them in Oz, Ten Pound Poms concerns a gang of unfortunate Englanders who sail from Southampton to Sydney in 1956. Their plucky optimism is instantly squished when they find that, as was often the case with thereal ten-pounders, the suburban idyll they’ve been promised is more like two-star glamping. Dumped in bug-infested huts built in a ring around a scrubby field, the would-be new Australians are derided and exploited at every turn, which makes their preexisting problems – teen pregnancy, addiction, loveless marriages – even more taxing.That domestic heartbreak plays out as a never-ending series of calamities that are bleak but simply resolved, which stops Ten Pound Poms aiming for prestige drama status and makes it more of a soap. British viewers who want to draw a chuckling Prisoner: Cell Block H comparison can point to the bad-matron manager of the migrant hostels, Mrs Walker, whose contempt for her helpless wards is reminiscent of a prison officer – and who is played with some relish by Tina Bursill, once top-dog inmate Sonia Stevens in Prisoner itself.There’s a brimming cocktail of influences. Ten Pound Poms shares the panicky “we’ve moved to Australia by mistake!”energy of Jimmy McGovern’s Banished, although there are no summary executions and nobody ever suggests resorting to cannibalism. And, for older viewers, the sight of quietly determined women trapped in substandard housing, staring down adversity through a sheen of grimy perspiration, may stir a faint memory of Tenko.But although onlyMichelle Keegan’s character, Kate, is a medical practitioner, the show’s key inspiration isCall the Midwife: we’re floating back to the 1950s to watch characters deal with issues that pointedly echo the present. Most obviously, we’re on about immigration. The Britons have suffered deprivation in their country and made an arduous journey to a new home, wanting only to integrate and contribute, but they are abused by the authorities and rejected by prejudiced locals.Season onehad a nicely barbed plotline about an Aussie who was hostile to the Poms, then relented and seemed like a rough diamond, but ultimately turned out not to actually care at all about newly arrived residents because his real issue was with Indigenous people. The point, about the link between opponents of immigration and racism, was not subtly made but worth making nonetheless.Season two extends its scope beyond the iniquities of the Ten Pound scheme itself by looking at slum landlords elsewhere in the city. Terry (Warren Brown), a war veteran who seems to have overcome the PTSD that once drove him to seek refuge in alcohol, makes a renewed effort to provide for his family. He ends up falling into the employ of a property mogul who is generous in the company of his fellow “businessmen”, but treats his Greek-immigrant tenants atrociously. Will Terry’s goodness win out, or will money and status corrupt him? His less naive wife, Annie (Faye Marsay), meanwhile, may be given new opportunities at the clothing store where she controversially works, despite being a wife and mother.Marsay and Brown offer solid performances but the A-lister here is Keegan, who effectively stars in her own separate drama. Kate, a nurse, came to Australia on the same boat as everyone else, but isn’t bothered about limited employment prospects or termites eating her hut, because back in the UK she was a struggling single mother whose baby son was shipped to Australia by a Catholic orphanage without her consent. Her emigration is a scheme to reclaim little Michael, who is now primary-school age and has been rehoused with a nice middle-class family: the season-one cliffhanger saw her coax him into her van and drive off towards an uncertain future.Keegan thrives on those deeper emotions, and the comeback episode has a fine scene where she meets the boy’s adoptive mother (Nikki Shiels). They engage in a fraught prisoner’s dilemma negotiation, each respecting and fearing the other’s all-consuming maternal instinct, with the class divide between them adding an extra frisson.Empathic and nuanced, the encounter shows what writer Danny Brocklehurst and his cast are capable of, but regular viewers of Ten Pound Poms know the story is likely to revert to trashy, soapy strife before long. Like the sad, sweaty Poms, we’ll just have to make do.Ten Pound Poms aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionBBC OneCall The MidwifeDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

When Rupert Lowe, the MP touted by Elon Musk as a potential Reform leader, had the temerity to criticise Farage in an interview, the party’s machineryquickly moved against him.Lowecomplained to the Daily Maillast week that Reform remained a “protest party led by the Messiah” and that it was “too early to know whether Nigel will deliver the goods” by winning power.The next day,the party announcedthat Lowe had had the whip suspended over bullying complaints involving two female members of staff, and been reported to the police for violent threats against the party chair,Zia Yusuf. Lowe, who has issued a lengthy statement on X denying all the allegations, decried this as “vindictive witch-hunt, all because I asked awkward questions of Nigel”.Lowe and his allies argue that his treatment proves his point: that Reform UK isentirely under Farage’s thumb, a protest movement directed by one man rather than the professional political party he promised to turn it into. Below the surface, however, the clash represents a struggle over thedirection of the party, where Farage finds himself in the unusual position of being the voice of moderation against Lowe’s clarion call to the far right.The split between them was brought to the surface earlier this year by Musk, who hasrepeatedly expressed supportfor Reform UK, and the far-right agitator and convicted criminal Tommy Robinson.Frustrated by Farage’s refusal to welcome Robinson into the fold,Musk declared in Januarythat Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” to lead the party – and appeared to endorse Lowe to take over instead. “I have not met Rupert Lowe, but his statements online that I have read so far make a lot of sense,” Musk said then.Those statements from Lowe have grown in volume since Musk’s endorsement, which propelled the relatively unknown MP to prominence among the “alt-right” community on X. On several issues, he has tacked to the right of Farage. Last month Lowe said that while Robinson was “not right for Reform”, he deserved “to be given the credit for the things that he’s done”.Lowe has also repeatedly endorsed mass deportations of illegal immigrants, declaring on Sunday that “if that results in one million plus deportations … so be it”.Farage, by contrast, has said it is “a political impossibility to deport hundreds of thousands of people”. “If I say I support mass deportations, that’s all anybody will talk about for the next 20 years. So it’s pointless even going there,” he told GB News in September.Farage has long maintained that to adopt far-right positions or embrace figures such as Robinson is to give up any hope of wide public appeal. Since picking up 14.3% of the vote and five seatsin the last election– more than the Liberal Democrats’ 12.2% which translated to 72 seats – he has embarked on a mission to supplant the Conservatives as the main rightwing party.Lowe’s views and attacks on Farage’s leadership represent a threat to that ambition, a threat that would be dealt with by excising him from Reform. All indications so far suggest that other senior party figures – including Yusuf, the deputy leader, Richard Tice, and the chief whip, Lee Anderson – are loyal to Farage and willing to back him in this endeavour. James McMurdock, the fifth Reform MP, has yet to wade in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his protestations of a witch-hunt have the potential to cause a serious headache – they have been met with support on X by rightwing commentators such as Steven Edginton and Dan Wootton, who accused Reform of “weaponising woke HR processes”.To stay secure in his position Farage will want to ensure he retains the support of Reform UK’s 200,000-odd members – more than half of whom have joined since November, according to official party stats.While it is safe to assume these members are fans of Farage, little is known about their political views. And under the party constitutionadopted in the autumn, Reform UK members can oust their leader in a no-confidence vote if 50% write to the chair requesting one.That is a high bar – but while Farage is still king, the future of his party is no longer entirely in his hands.Explore more on these topicsReform UKRupert LoweNigel FarageFar rightElon MuskanalysisShareReuse this content"

Do some people crave the solace of the corner more than others? He finds clues to the compulsion in his upbringing – and in artGeoff DyerSun 9 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 17.39 EDTShareIt can take a surprisingly long time to become conscious of something that has been a feature of one’s life for as long as one can remember. I was 66 before I realised that I had always liked sitting in a corner. This revelation occurred in a restaurant while I was waiting for a friend. I’d got there right on time – I’ve known for more than 40 years that I have a mania for punctuality – and after being shown to a corner table I took what was obviously the best of the two seats on offer: the one in the corner. When I was growing up my mum said that if a man was out with a lady he should always walk curb-side; was there a version of this whereby the gentleman should always let the lady have the corner seat and sit with his back to the interior equivalent – the foot traffic – of the open road, with the attendant risk of being assaulted from behind by the chill blast of air conditioning? If so, that bit of chivalry had been invalidated by my friend’s texting to say she was running an incrediblesevenminutes late.As soon as I sat down I was happy. Because I was in a corner. Realising is one thing, but I also want to understand. Where does the satisfaction and pleasure of the corner come from? What does it mean? The following reflections are personal and contingent but, as Diane Arbus once said: “I do feel I have some slight corner on something about the quality of things.”The mob boss tends to favour the corner seat of a trattoria so that he can see who’s potentially coming to whack himThe first stop for any investigation of this kind isThe Poetics of Space, in which Gaston Bachelard points out that the pleasure of being in a corner has nothing to do with the expression – and sensation of – being cornered. In that situation you are under pressure, threatened; being in a corner, by contrast, is a position of safety. And while turning a corner means putting a previous phase of life behind you, a corner seat means that the only things behind you are walls and maybe cushions. You are content to stay put, with no desire to move on. The constant possibility of danger in gangster films means that the mob boss tends to favour the corner seat of a trattoria so that he can see who’s potentially coming to whack him. In the non-drama of normal restaurant-going, where the main threat is noise – music, loud voices, atrocious acoustics – the pleasure has little to do with surveilling the room. It’s a semi-uterine feeling of being partly enclosed. Booths offer a way of multiplying this feeling of enclosure, expanding it beyond actual corners to entire sides of a restaurant, but the best spot will still be the booth – more exactly, thecornerof that booth – in the corner of the room.These are shared but not universal urges. Why do some people crave the solace of the corner more than others? In my case I put it down – as I do most things – to having no brothers or sisters. Alone – and being an only child means one is instinctively on one’s own – in a restaurant, I like the way that I can sit tacitly concealed in my aloneness.The Corner Table(1886) by the American artist Irving Ramsey Wiles depicts a woman seated in the corner of a restaurant, posed and poised in a fashion familiar to any reader of Henry James or Edith Wharton, between restriction and independence. She’s on her own but it’s not clear whether she will be dining alone or if she’s waiting, as I was in the opening paragraph, for a companion. Over her right shoulder is a glimpse, in a mirror, of her view of the restaurant (a partial optical allusion to Manet’sA Bar at the Folies-Bergère?) depicting a male diner being served by a waiter in another corner, with the corner of a painting on the wall above their manly heads. A narrative connection between these paired elements is suggested but unresolved. Either way, she is self-contained, and this self-containment is protected and shared, reflected upon by – and within – the painting’s multiple angled recessions.View image in fullscreenNighthawks, 1942 by Edward Hopper.Photograph: Corbis/GettyConsider, by contrast, how exposed are the three customers in Edward Hopper’sNighthawks(1942).They’re in a brightly lit corner diner while enjoying none of the comforts of cornerhood: their backs are displayed to the street. If we are discussing the man in the far left of the picture, we are literally talking about him behind his back. Beyond the frame, out of sight to the far right, there may be a seat enabling someone to look at the other diners and out at the street. If there is, that’s where I would want to be. From there, implicitly, it might be conceptually possible to see viewers looking at the painting.My desire to be in the corner is not confined to public settings like this. The reading chair in my study is in the corner. Sitting in it, I am conscious that the open book I’m holding forms another micro-corner of sorts so that – if the book is as absorbing asThe Cornerby David Simon and Ed Burns – I’m enclosed in the corner of the corner room of a flat on the top floor of a house. The feeling is most intense after dark, when the chair is bathed in the glow of a lamp, after I’ve locked the door of the flat from the inside, with the key in the lock. No one can get in but this is less a security measure than an expression of fulfilled intent: for the rest of the night I am not venturing out again for anything or anyone.View image in fullscreenThe Red Room, Etretat, 1899 by Félix Vallotton.Photograph: Artefact/AlamyOn this particular evening, in this little nook, I’m looking through the catalogue of an exhibition devoted to the Nabis, the clique of artists from the last decade of 19th-century Paris. Given their fondness for intimate interiors I guessed that the corner would be featured in their works – and so it turns out. The painting that best expresses the psychological comfort of the corner isThe Red Room, Etreat(1899) by the Swiss-born Félix Vallotton. (Described as a “loner among friends”, Vallaton was himself painted, perched on a chair in the corner of his studio, by friend and fellow Nabi Édouard Vuillard the following year.) Vallotton’s painting shows a woman in a red armchair to one side of an unlit fire, tucked in the corner of a room with Rothko-red walls. Her eyes are closed. At her feet a child tears up a piece of paper on a patterned dull rug. It would be convenient to claim that the painting shows a mother in a state of blissful content, a feminine version of the opening of Dickens’sDombey and Son: “Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead…” Her expression, however, refuses to confirm – to conform to – this snug reading. And there is a further complication. One of the blobs of red to her left actually represents a bed squeezed into the corner – in an alcove, to be precise – so she’s not quite in the corner. But the flattened vertical colours mean that this bed is perceived less as a physical object than an abstract magnification of the psychological space and comfort – the illusion – of being in a corner. (Hence, perhaps, my saying that she was “tucked in” to the corner.) The opposite of Henry Fuseli’s rearing and unsettlingNightmare(1781), this is the nest where dreams of corner-ness sleep.Geoff Dyer’s memoir,Homework, will be published by Canongate (£20) on 29 May.

But such a creature, recognizable from medieval art to My Little Pony, is one of the less familiar elements of Death of a Unicorn, the debut feature from writer-director Alex Scharfman that premiered at theSXSWfilm festival on Saturday. The film, produced by clout powerhouse A24, traffics in well-trod territory: the prestige eat-the-rich satire with a stacked cast and a beautiful backdrop. So well-trod, in fact, that it’s a relief when the mythical beasts do arrive – if only to reveal dubious CGI and a questionable commitment to the bit.The Accountant 2 review – Ben Affleck’s autistic assassin returns for solid sequelRead moreSilly as it may sound, Scharfman treats this unicorn bit with sincere seriousness, aiming for relevance on the rapacious state of late-stage capitalism satirized in such recent hits as The Menu, Triangle of Sadness, Knives Out: Glass Onion, Parasite and Succession, among others. I know this road, you know this road, even disaffected college student Ridley (Jenna Ortega) knows this road as she and her credulous father Elliot (Paul Rudd), a corporate lawyer, drive into the Canadian Rockies for a retreat with Elliot’s billionaire boss and his family. “Philanthropy is just reputation laundering for the oligarchy,” she retorts when her father tries to extol the largesse of the Leopolds, a clan of pharmaceutical executives loosely based on America’s Sackler family.There is nothing about the Leopold family – terminally ill patriarch Odell (Richard E Grant, bringing a dash of British colonialism to this tale of American capitalism), wife Belinda (Téa Leoni) and feckless son Shep (Will Poulter) – that could surprise or perversely amuse anyone familiar with this genre. Just jobs for the actors to so, boxes of craven behavior and delusions of infallibility to check, mellifluous single notes of callous narcissism to hit. Which all the performers do well, Poulter especially, though that does not leaven a pervading sense of boredom.What is surprising, at least initially, is to see how Scharfman devises the promise of the title, which arrives abruptly in the first few minutes: Elliot, distracted by a tiff with Ridley, accidentally hits a unicorn, rendering it immobile but still alive, and the duo spattered in purple blood. Ridley, a lonely daughter without a mother, forms an instant bond with the creature rendered as a freewheeling acid trip through the cosmos with a touch of its horn. Elliot, a widower hellbent on making some cash to support his daughter, beats the unicorn to death with a tire iron, the first of many tough instances for the squeamish among us.Back at the estate – which is indeed beautiful and managed by put-upon head of staff Griff (Barry’s Anthony Carrigan) – the oligarchs strain to not say what the creature really is, nor squander its potential when it becomes clear that unicorn blood can cure everything from teenage acne to cancer. It’s a mode of writing that grows tiresome quickly. Ortega, the nominal star of the film though remarkably underused, provides the film’s sole grounding point, as Ridley intuits something darker afoot and begins to research unicorn folklore, correctly interpreting the famous medieval unicorn tapestries at the Met’s Cloisters as evidence that such hubris will only invite destruction. (If nothing else, this film will activate some latent art history nerds.)Indeed, these unicorns are not rainbows and butterflies but the all-powerful monsters of yore, capable of jump scares and very bloody impalements, among other gory violence. Scharfman has a solid handling on the trappings of the mega-wealthy, though his interstitials of deluxe service feel derivative of The Menu; less so the mechanics of a creature feature in which the unicorns range from indestructible to wary of doors. Not that the internal logic would matter, if the stakes felt compelling (you know how this will go for the rich, who are of course very bad), or if the monster madness felt inventive (it doesn’t, although the specter of a sharp-toothed horse is a strangely intriguing conceit). Death of a Unicorn clocks in at under two hours, but feels longer, its inherent silliness not matched with the necessary self-awareness, chemistry or fun.What does work, however, is a last-minute play to connect Ridley’s ineffable connection to the slain unicorn with the magical realism of grief, the way we see things, realms, creatures and spirits that may or may not be there in the aftermath of loss. There’s something weird and moving and different in that interpretation, if only for a brief few minutes, that brings a small point to the tedious lunacy of the ultra-rich that comes before. But by large, this beastly feature is exactly what you would expect it to be: fashioning itself different but in fact much like the others. A unicorn, this is not.Death of a Unicorn is showing at the SXSW film festival and will be released in cinemas on 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewA24Paul RuddRichard E GrantSXSWFestivalsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The brainchild of Gints Zilbalodis, a 30-year-old Latvian film-maker, it’s about an unnamed house cat cast adrift on a sailboat alongside a capybara and a ring-tailed lemur. The world has flooded; one disaster follows another. The animals on the boat have to help one another or die.Flowcontains no human life and not one line of actual dialogue. Despite this, it is eloquent and humane and almost unbearably tense.Animators, says Zilbalodis, are a little like cats, in that they tend to be self-sufficient, antisocial and have to be coaxed into joining a team.Flow’s production involved Zilbalodis abandoning his desk to oversee a small crew of artists. He had to learn how to delegate, collaborate and risk having his ideas challenged and shot down. The finished film, therefore, is almost a parable of its own making; a comment on all those behind-the-scenes negotiations. It’s a salute to the loners who need to pool their resources, and the endangered beasts on the margins that have to adapt to survive.Flow, though, has managed more than mere survival. It’s a phenomenon, a breakout hit; a hand-tooled, small-scale production that speaks to the multiplex and the arthouse alike. At last weekend’s Academy Awards, Zilbalodis’s labour-of-love drama scooped the Oscar for best animated feature, the first independent production to do so, beating out the likes ofInside Out 2andThe Wild Robot. The picture (which was also nominated in the best international film category) may count as a trailblazer of sorts, part of a new breed, because it was recognised on the animated Oscar shortlist alongside Adam Elliot’s mordantMemoir of a Snailand Nina Gantz’s eerie shortWander to Wonder. Each of these pictures is nuanced, distinctive and strange. Each was produced for next to no money. Independent animation used to be seen as an atomised backwater. Now it’s emerged from the shadows to trouble the mainstream.View image in fullscreenGints Zilbalodis with his Oscar last weekend. Flow won in the face of competition from Disney, Dreamworks – and Wallace & Gromit’s Aardman.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf there exists such a thing as an animation community, it lives a nomadic existence on the European film festival circuit. That’s where the artists tend to congregate, Zilbalodis says. Festivals were his film school, or possibly his watering holes. “But as a community it’s very fractured,” he adds. “People live in their own niche bubbles and don’t interact much. They definitely don’t follow any formula. If you look at the big animation studios, there is an established system, a general understanding of the way things are done. But independent animations are made by just a few people. There is no industry standard, so you can tell whatever story you like in whatever style that you like.”That variety is reflected at every festival, he adds. “One film will have a conventional narrative and the next will be abstract. One will be for young kids and the next will be very dark and adults-only. Everyone uses different tools, different software or different puppets. The possibilities are infinite.”Zilbalodis createdFlowon Blender, an open-source software that enabled him to animate the animals as CGI wireframe models and paint in his backgrounds of forested hills and drowned cities. Dutch-born Nina Gantz, by contrast, is more old-school. Her Bafta-winningWander to Wonderuses stop-motion puppetry to resuscitate the survivors of an old children’s TV show. These puppets live on in the studio after the aged presenter has died, recording forlorn updates for the fans who have long since grown up and moved on. As withFlow, it’s a film that reflects on its own existence, celebrating the dying art of physical media while eerily subverting it too.View image in fullscreen‘Eerie and old-school’: the Bafta-winning animated short Wander to Wonder.Wander to Wonderclocks in at under 14 minutes. But the fact it exists at all is a miracle, Gantz says. “There were so many disasters along the way. The puzzle of funding. One of the companies went bankrupt. The puppets weren’t done on time. There were so many moments when I almost dropped the whole thing. But I loved the world we were creating. That’s what kept me going, I think.”The film took about eight years to complete. That’s a lot of time spent on 14 minutes of puppetry and raises a crass and obvious question. Just how viable is a career in independent animation?“Not viable!” says Gantz. The very idea makes her laugh. “It’s not viable at all. You do it for the love of the craft and the film and you try not to think about all the rest. And probably you have to be a little bit insane.”I put the same question to the Australian animator Adam Elliot, who spent a similar amount of time makingMemoir of a Snail. “It’s barely viable,” he says. “I haven’t starved yet, but I’ve come close. Luckily I draw and sell my artwork as a way of keeping myself alive between productions. Also I’m a product of government funding in Australia. That means I get money to write and develop. It would be different if I were trying to make films in America. I’d have to be making family-friendly children’s entertainment.” He shrugs. “So as an auteur it’s a struggle. And it’s not getting any easier.”View image in fullscreen‘Stop motion has a magical quality’: Adam Elliot checks his creations for Memoir of a Snail at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianElliot has been around for donkey’s years.

Every one of his characters is a plasticine model, dressed up for action and manipulated gently by hand.Our budgets are what the big studios spend on cateringAdam Elliot“When I was starting out, I was told I was pursuing a dying art form,” he says. “That was 29 years ago. Computer animation had just started and was going to take over the world. And it sort of has. We’re drowning in digital culture and CGI animation. But I think the arrival of AI has brought a greater appreciation of hand-crafted art forms, whether it’s knitting or breadmaking or stop-motion animation. It’s an egalitarian art form because you can shoot a film on your phone. But stop-motion also has a magical quality that other animation doesn’t. When the audience is able to see the thumbprint on the clay, they know they’re looking at something tangible, tactile and real.”Thatpersonal touchimprints every frame ofMemoir of a Snail, a tragicomic coming-of-age tale that took top prize at the 2024 London film festival (the first stop-motion picture to do so). Animation, Elliot says, is a medium, not a genre.Flow,Memoir of a SnailandWander to Wonderare all very different movies. But their independent nature filters through to their stories. They’re more complex and less costly than most mainstream animations.Memoir of a Snailwas made for about £3.5m.Flow’s budget was £3m. Compare that with the bill for the average studio behemoth. “Inside Out 2cost $200m,” says Elliot. “You look at me withMemoirand Gints withFlow– our budgets are what those people spend on catering. So I’m trying to talk to the big studios – Netflix, Amazon, DreamWorks – and say, ‘Come on, guys, be more generous. Carve out a little slice of these budgets and invest in some independent auteurs.’” It makes economic sense: a number of big animations (Wish,Elemental) have recently sputtered at the box office. “The old formula isn’t working. Hollywood is really struggling with animation. So it needs to transition. Things have to change.”View image in fullscreen‘Stop-motion has a magical quality’: Memoir of a Snail, which won best film, animated or otherwise, at the 2024 London film festival.The creatures on the boat (the cat, the capybara and the ring-tailed lemur) have simple needs: food, shelter, dry land. The three independent animators (Zilbalodis, Gantz, Elliot) aren’t asking for a whole lot more. They’d like sound infrastructure and a better model of distribution. Extra money would allow them to develop, crew and shoot their films more quickly. But a lifetime of solitude is a hard habit to shake and too much interference risks muddying the finished film.“I know all the stories about independent film-makers who go and make something huge,” Zilbalodis says, “and more often than not they get overwhelmed. The system doesn’t allow them to express or say what they want.”A century ago, an independent animator named Walt Disney embarked on a career that would carry him from the drawing board to global dominance; from 1928’sSteamboat Willieto studios and theme parks and a company that is valued at about £165bn. So there is a precedent here and a possible path to glory, should Zilbalodis choose to take it.“You never know what’s going to happen,” he says ruefully. “But I promise youthatis never going to happen. I’m not going to build a business. I don’t know what I’d do with big success. I don’t have any hobbies. I sleep and I eat and I sit at my desk.

Its algorithms have pushed artists to make joyless, toothless musicJohn HarrisMost musicians can only make money on the platform by writing songs inoffensive enough to get on to one of its vapid playlistsSun 9 Mar 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 16.12 EDTShareIn the hands of some of its most gifted practitioners, songwriting is a kind of emotional alchemy. For the past week, I have been returning to a perfect example:Every Time the Sun Comes Upby the US singer Sharon Van Etten, which was released in 2014. Its lyrics might be fractured and fragmented, but it is an almost perfect portrait of self-doubt and downward spirals: one of those songs that captures feelings so deep that they go way beyond words.I went back to that song as I read asuperb new bookthat has both educated and profoundly depressed me. Mood Machine, by the New York-based journalist Liz Pelly, is about the music-streaming giant Spotify, and how it attracted its current615 million subscribers, making a billionaire of its Swedish co-founder and CEO, Daniel Ek. But its most compelling story centres on what Spotify has done to people’s appreciation of songs and the people who make them – much of which is down to the platform’s ubiquitous playlists.Thanks to Spotify’s algorithms, I recently found Every Time the Sun Comes Up in a personalised (or “algotorial”) playlist titled Farmers Market, versions of which have been saved by nearly 250,000 listeners. On mine, the song sits alongside such classics as the Rolling Stones’ Beast of Burden, Mazzy Star’s equally aching Fade Into You and Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, whose pathos and depth seems to have been neutralised by their new setting, summed up in the accompanying blurb: “fresh produce, reusable totes, iced coffee and all the lovely spring things”.Such is what Pelly calls “the relegation of music to something passable, just filling the air”. Playlists tend to mean that songs once full of power and emotion get recontextualised, and washed of their meaning. And at the same time, Spotify constantly boosts music that never had any of those qualities to start with: a type oflatter-day muzakthat reaches its apogee in a genre now known as “Spotifycore”. Pelly traces the birth of this “muted, mid-tempo and melancholy” sound to around 2018: the US singer Billie Eilish seems to have unwittingly kicked things off, and the result has become inescapable, thanks to the kind of Spotify playlists whose titles include the word “chill”. You know it when you hear it: it initially makes you feel as if you are in a big-budget Netflix series, before you find out that there is no discernible plot.Spotify in effect encourages musicians to produce this aural wallpaper, by showing them the data that proves this is how to make money from the platform. Such music answers some very 21st-century needs: as Pelly reminds us, it offers solace to people who are “anxious and overworked, engaged in cycles of trying to focus hard and chill hard”. It also helps them sleep, which is one of the functions Spotify capably delivers. And whether the platform’s users are awake or slumbering, Spotifycore also has a quality that makes it perfect for endless streaming: one song blurs into another, meaning that the app can be left to tick over, requiring minimum effort on the part of the user. This is the core of Ek’s business model: the idea, after all, is to keep you listening – or half-listening – for hours at a time.What does all this mean for the music itself? Those of us who are addicted to Spotify – and just to be clear, my habit extends to several hours a day, though I mostly leave its playlists untouched – know how seductive an invention it is: an almost infinite jukebox, accessible via devices that are the same size as a Twix. But using it also comes with increasingly sharp pangs of ethical discomfort, and a sense that its version of streaming has long since started transforming music in no end of unsettling ways.Though Spotify has no direct involvement in its creation, a lot of the vapid music clustered on its playlists is now made by production-line suppliers of what the company calls “perfect fit content”, or PFC – which could just as easily be made using AI. The fact that no money is paid out if a song is listened to for less than 30 seconds has come close to killing the idea of a slow-burning intro (if they were modern creations, there would be no hope for such songs as David Bowie’s Sound and Vision, or the Temptations’ Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone). The limited public outcry about the tiny rewards Spotify offers most musicians and songwriters may be connected to the fact that the average “chill” playlist is intended only as background music: as Pelly says, “it follows that a population paying so little conscious attention to music would also believe it deserving of so little remuneration”.Technology always bends and re-shapes artistic creativity: the fact that the archetypal album began life at about 40 minutes and then stretched to 70 or 80 was a story scripted by the invention of the 12in record, and its eventual superseding by compact discs. But what sets Spotify apart is something much more insidious: it goes beyond alterations of music’s forms into what we think music is there to do, and one of big tech’s most sinister powers: the way that it sidelines dissent in such a subtle way that we only realise what has happened when it is far too late.At the risk of making myself sound ancient, I had always understood the demise of music made with guitars – the best of which came with at least a hint of countercultural rebellion – as something down to that instrument’s old age. Now, I wonder whether it might also have happened because it doesn’t fit the low-volume, inoffensive aesthetics demanded by playlists with titles such as Stress Relief, Soft Office and Beach Vibes.I definitely think the large-scale decline of songs that deal in social and political commentary is partly to do with Spotify’s relentless muzak-ification: in the UK, the one high-profile artist who does that kind of stuff is the brilliant, Bruce Springsteen-esqueSam Fender, and his artistic loneliness speaks volumes. With Trump in the White House and the world in chaos, the absence of a pop-cultural response is striking: might it be connected to the tyranny of what Pelly calls “sad piano ballads with weird drums”, and Spotify’s reduction of artists to near-anonymity: people hanging on for dear life, with no voice? And beyond anything political, does that not pose a threat to music with any real substance at all?Van Etten, I am pleased to say, isplaying three concertsin the UK this coming week with her band the Attachment Theory, and returning in the summer for another run of shows. I will be there for at least one of them, soaking up her deep, powerful music in the context it was created for. My phone will be switched off, and “chill” will not be on the menu. And like just about everyone there, I will not be giving any thought to farmers’ markets, iced coffee or “reusable totes”.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

We queued up for vaccines, observed distancing lines and confidently asked unmasked passengers on public transport to cover their faces. A tyrannical virus ruled over us, and we did everything in our power to limit its ravages.Five years on from thedeclarationof the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s the masked passenger who is suspect, nobody notices the scuffed distancing lines and trust in vaccines has taken atumble. A different narrative has invaded the conversation: it wasn’t the virus that ruined our lives, but the response.This narrative was always there, but for a long time it stayed on the fringes. Now it’s becoming mainstream, turbo-charged by the recent successes of its political champions who typically gravitate towards the populist right. Public health experts have watched its advance with a gathering sense of doom. They know that how we respond to the next pandemic depends on how we understand the last, and that the next one is probably closer than most people think. Mind-bogglingly, many of them worry that Covid-19 has left us more, rather than less, vulnerable to it.The response was far from perfect, these experts say, but the purveyors of the new narrative have picked the wrong target: science. The mRNA vaccines prevented millions of deaths. The technology forbuildingnew, effective vaccines quickly came on in leaps and bounds. Masksworked. And as with every pandemic in recent history, subsequent reviews havefoundthat the advice to go early and hard with containment was correct. Did the scientists make mistakes? Of course, but they were working in conditions of high uncertainty. But they were also often ignored or countered by the politicians they advised, as well as by others in positions of influence – and yet those people aren’t the villains of this piece.Anyone who doubts the power of narrative need only look at that modern Icarus, Anthony Fauci. Five years ago, the seasoned epidemic warrior and prominent figure in the US Covid-19 response (he was chief medical adviser to the president, 2021-22) wasanointedthe country’s “most trusted coronavirus expert”, and its “scientific voice of reason”. Then the white-hot heat of public opinion melted his wings. Having accepted a pre-emptive pardon from Joe Biden, he was forced topoint outthat he had committed no crime. And though he has been subjected to frequent death threats, Donald Trump haswithdrawnhis federal security detail.Fauci’s British counterparts, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, have also received death threats. But in allowing these scientists to be treated so shabbily, we undermine ourselves in the long run. Who would take on that thankless task now, if a new pandemic struck? Fauci et al are just the visible face of the backlash. Behind the scenes, infectious disease researchersreporttheir funds are drying up, leaving them less able to predict and prevent the next pandemic. The Trump administration has sown disarray at its medical research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and ordered US withdrawal from the only global public health agency, the World Health Organization. Negotiations over a pandemic treaty, which would improve disease surveillance and vaccine access globally, have stalled.Speaking about the NIH in late 2023, Trump’s future health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr,reportedly said: “We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” Unfortunately it isn’t givingusa break, because our various crises are linked. The rate of emergence of zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – isaccelerating, due to factors including deforestation and the human-altered climate. Where viruses are concerned, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Richard Hatchett,wroterecently, “the world is on fire”.A teenage survivor of the 1918 flu could expect to never encounter a pandemic again in their lives. The same is unlikely to be true of today’s teenagers. The most imminent threat is probably posed by “bird flu”, the strains of H5N1 influenza A that are at present circulating in cows and poultry. They haven’t become transmissible between humans yet and they may never do so, but they have spread from animals to humans dozens of times on several continents, causing illness and at leastone death. If one of them were to trigger a pandemic, that pandemic would be at least as deadly as Covid-19, which isestimatedto have caused upwards of 27 million excess deaths to date.It’s difficult to know which microbe will cause the next pandemic, because for all scientists’ sophisticated modelling, they can’t predict the change in context that will nudge one from a relatively benign trajectory on to a more dangerous one. Besides studying the causes of the zoonotic threat, our best hope for protecting tomorrow’s teenagers is to make our societies more resilient. We saw this clearly at the height of the emergency, but we’veforgotten it. Remember the shortlived calls to reduce gaping inequalities, shore up our health systems and work forces, and “build back better”?Interviewing people from 70 countries in aglobal listening projectlaunched in 2021, a team led by anthropologist Heidi Larson found that many felt uncared for – their daily challenges lost in talk of case rates and “unflattened curves”. The sick-pay issue was emblematic: plenty couldn’t afford to stay at home when ill. Their desire to help others was stymied, too, by – among other things – the disastrous insistence on social distancing. This became a shorthand for physical distancing, which was essential, but it undermined efforts towards social cohesion, which is also vital in a pandemic.“In a real crisis, the state can’t look after you,” psychologist Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews told me. “It can’t put food on your table, or walk your dog. We do it for each other.” Up to 14 million Britonsparticipatedin mutual aid groups at Covid-19’s peak, and Larson’s feedback suggests that the number would have been higher had the government supported those efforts.Five years after the start of the worst health crisis in living memory, there is a national conversation waiting to be had about the roles of the individual, society and the state in such a crisis. What is my responsibility to myself and to my community, and what is the responsibility of the state towards us? At each level there is room for improvement, but we’re not addressing it. Let’s hope we can have that conversation before we’re tested again, but first the more strident – and misguided – voices have to pipe down.Laura Spinney is a science journalist and the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the WorldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let Boris Johnson guide you on this ‘very compassionate man’Catherine BennettSome of the president’s Tory fans seem to find the grim reality of the president’s actions invigorating rather than terrifyingSun 9 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShareShort of emigration, what is the best option for Britain’s dazzled Trump followers now their hero confirms he is not Europe’s ally but Vladimir Putin’s? That’s assuming what we can’t in the case ofNigel FarageMP: that they do not share the US president’swell-documentedweakness for a genocidal invader. Even his more respectable British acolytes have until recently finessed, quite successfully, their love of Trump with his long history of Putin-pleasing. No one more so than Boris Johnson, former prime minister, self-styled saviour of Ukraine and still Trump’s most dependable British idiot.To Johnson’s way of thinking, detailed in numerousDaily Mailcolumns, it is Trump-doubters who are always the ridiculous, panicking, hysterical, whingeing headless chickens. When Trump looked likely to win the US election,Johnson likened the reactionof the “western liberal intelligentsia” to “the shriek of elderly beldames leaping on the piano stool after spying a mouse in their petticoats”. The virile Johnson was more than willing to forget that business at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.With all the usual caveats, it is striking, sometimes uncanny, how often tributes to Trump by his UK supporters have echoed rhetoric in praise of an earlier political disruptor with territorial ambitions.Here is Lord Rothermere, theDaily Mailproprietor, for instance,writing in 1930that his support for Germany’s Nazi party “had shocked the old women of three countries – France, Germany, and our own”. Like the beldame-connoisseur Johnson, who urges us to disregard Trump’s thuggery – “I have always found him, personally, a model of old-fashioned courtesy and good manners” – Rothermere would assure readers disconcerted by the public shrieking that the private Hitler was “a perfect gentleman”, who “brings to Europe the blessed prospect of peace”.Anything that may to the uninitiated seem disgraceful about Trump could be proof of political sophisticationA century later, anotherDaily Mailwriter, Nadine Dorries, was one of several prominent Conservativesclaiming something similar for Trump. “I honestly believe that Trump can bring about world peace and prosperity.” By way of references, Dorries cited, like many of the president’s supporters, the strategic mastery outlined in his (ghostwritten)Art of the Deal. Have any of them actually read the chapter that details how Trump, having attempted various low ruses to dislodge residents from a newly acquired building he wished to demolish, ended up being accused of harassment? It could be of interest, anyway, to Gaza residents should Trump persist with dreams of a Palestinian-free luxury resort.Admittedly, a little alleged harassment is unlikely to weigh with women like Dorries, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss (not forgetting proud feminist Johnson) who are happy to make light of – along with the invasion of the White House,environmental savageryand assortedcriminal cases– Trump’shistory of misogyny. For them, saviour qualities that polls suggest go unrecognised by most of the British population have earned him immunity from sustained sexist behaviour, from “Grab ’em by the pussy” tocongratulating the prime minister, Keir Starmer,on his “beautiful” wife last month.In the US for Trump’s inauguration, an ecstatic Braverman said that he provides “a glimmer of hope of what is possible in the west”. Fellow guest Truss, cementing the Norfolk-Mar-a-Lago axis, hailed the incoming president for “saving western civilisation”. Starting, as we now know, withAndrew Tate.Inconveniently for Truss and other lead Trumpists includingRobert Jenrick, Jacob Rees-Mogg,Piers Morgan,Priti Patel,Andrea Jenkynsand a number ofMailandTelegraphcontributors, today’s online archive makes it trickier than in 1939 for the prominent and susceptible to pretend they were never infatuated with an amoral racist andconspiracy theorist.Added to this evidence, the speed of Trump’s transition into full Russia allyship could help extravagant claims about his political genius being more rapidly understood as deranged than those, circulating last year, that rested on total public memory loss about Trump’s political past.For the former Tory MP Rees-Mogg, for instance, Trump’s victory was “a success for democracy” and also, notwithstanding his thing for Putin, for “free speech”. The pivot towards Russia has not diminished his loyalty. “Reinvigorating democracy is also positive,” Mogg noted, finding something “creative” in Trump’s denial of military assistance to Ukraine, “the world may ultimately be a safer place”.Braverman, theproud wearer of a Maga capand perhaps the closest Trump has to a Unity Mitford (who favoured a golden swastika), considers his latest actions above all “a wake-up call for European nations”.In news sources where recent expressions of admiration for Trump must adapt togrowing public suspicion, there is no avoiding a more convoluted response. In theTelegraph, where heacclaimed Trump’s November victorywith “Trump is the last chance to save the decaying west from terminal decline”, Allister Heath now reminds readers, “the reality is nuanced”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Step by step, they should advance from simple Trump idolator to the role of senior Trump interpreter. Supposing Trump comes up with something like (to Zelenskyy) “you should never have started it”, requires a Johnson, fluent in Trumpspeak,to translate: “Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action.” What might sound wicked, according tohis latest tutorial, is spoken by a “very compassionate man”.Recent polling, inauspiciousfor Farage, suggests that Johnson’s linguistic efforts are finally paying off. When a UK legislator sings the praises of Trump, what they are actually saying is: “I am unworthy of political office.” Got it.Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But don’t worry! You don’t have to do anything silly like spring cleanSun 9 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 16.09 EDTShareI rarely have any wisdom to impart, but at this time of year I find myself itching to share one of the few snippets I have gleaned in my 50 years. So here goes.Have you found in recent days that everyone (in the northern hemisphere, anyway) seems stoked about spring – skittles and beer, carpets of crocuses, the prospect of sitting outside without having your face resurfaced by sleet – but you are not quite feeling it? Have any nascent joys of the changing seasons been crushed by a glimpse of yourself in a mirror, replaced by wondering how you got so dull and lumpy? Has your home become, seemingly overnight, a sticky nest of squalor – toothpaste dribbles on the mirror, mildewed grouting, sofa stains, dust (God, the dust)? Does nothing please you?If so, don’t panic. It’s not existential despair (legal clarification: in March 2025, I can’t guarantee that). You are experiencing what I call “UGH week”.UGH week is the point at which there is suddenly enough daylight to realise just how awful everything looks. The people who dwelt in darkness – that’s us, since November – have seen a great light and what it reveals is biblically terrible.It happens to me every year: I wake one March morning, go into the bathroom and recoil at the sight of Brian Cox (not the science one) staring back peevishly. Scratching my scaly, grey legs – irritated by five months ofburrito-ing myself in heated throws– creates a blizzard of dry skin, turning the bathroom (suddenly a biohazard zone of hair nests, muddy footprints and puddles of mystery ooze) into a repulsive snowdome.Attempting to dress, I am disheartened by everything in my giant, teetering clothes heap being stained, moth-eaten, hideous or all three. Making breakfast, I realise that the kitchen – my favourite place – has become a crime scene of sauce spatters and greasy fingerprints; a mould-coated satsuma long forgotten in the fruit bowl seems to have become sentient. Starting work, the harsh sun hits my screen, revealing a thick, gross layer of my own skin cells. Everything is dispiriting and disgusting.But it’s OK: it’s really just a trick of the light. Banish your seasonal shame – we needed that cosy layer of filth to survive the winter! – but don’t replace it with rubber gloves, or those acid-filled socks thatslough half your feet off. I know spring cleaning and grooming are traditional at this juncture, but who, this year, has the energy? With that in mind, here are five slacker’s strategies that have helped me survive decades of UGH weeks.Fix one thingPick a battle, but make sure it’s small, satisfying and, crucially, self-contained; there is a real risk that making one thing better could deepen your disgust at everything else. Moisturise your elbows, maybe, or rationalise your condiments. This year, I tackled the neglected house plants, hanging on to life by their root hairs. Everyone got a soak and a feed, the beyond-hope were quietly composted and I feel much better.Become more bearI recently watched footage of a grizzly bear, Boo,emerging from hibernation, looking as groggy and horrified by the harsh spring light as me. “He’s feeling it,” as his caregiver said.But as Fat Bear Weekteaches us, in a few short months Boo will be glossy, plump and energised without resorting to “Hiit” or “vampire facials”. (Plus, does Boo care what state he leaves his den in? He does not.) Trust the process. And internalise ursine beauty norms.£1 bunches of daffodilsSerendipitously, UGH week coincides with peak £1 daff time. There is no sordid corner that can’t be improved by the cheery sunshine of daffs. No vase? No problem: put them in jam jars – it’s charmingly bohemian. Generally, the word “bohemian” is a helpful mantra in UGH week; remind yourself that bleach is bourgeois.Go outside … and stay thereIf you never see your home, or your face, in daylight, all your UGH week problems vanish. Sit on a cafe terrace or a park bench until sunset and enjoy feeling something other than sleet on your skin.Do nothingIf you can hold your nerve for another few days, you will be off the hook entirely for ages:there is a “polar vortex” coming.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHomesOpinionHealth & wellbeingcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s the message from a new Centre for Social Justice report,Lost Boys,published last week. It surveys how boys and young men are faring in Britain and finds that in several areas there is now a reverse gender gap, with boys, particularly those from poorer backgrounds, struggling to keep up with girls.When it comes to education,girls outperform boysat GCSEs and A-levels, and the ratio of women to men at university is60:40. Boys are more than twice as likely to be excluded from school, with rates of exclusion particularly high for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is all feeding through into labour market outcomes: in the 00s, women aged 16-24 were more likely to be not in employment, education and training than young men; in recent years, that has flipped, with young men also significantly more likely to be unemployed than young women. The pay gap for young people has also become a more complex story: for 21- to 24-year-olds, median earnings are now higher for women, but this has been driven by a stark drop in earnings for non-graduate young men, with graduates still earning more than their female equivalent. What’s more, boys are more likely to be obese than girls, and rates of suicide are three and a half times higher for boys aged 15-19 than girls of the same age.None of this is to deny the many inequalities faced by females in a patriarchal society. But neither should a focus on women’s equality crowd out discussion of the problems being experienced by a minority of boys; improving their lot would do a huge amount to make life better for both sexes.But we have struggled to have a constructive conversation about the specific issues facing boys, with a tendency for all sides to slip into polarised, zero-sum framing. For some on the left, there is an implicit fear that focusing on boys might distract from the challenges facing girls; and certain sections of the right wrongly regard boys falling behind as a product of important feminist wins of recent decades.This new report is a healthy corrective, and follows similar work in the US by thinkers such as Richard Reeves, who recently set up theAmerican Institute for Boys and Men. Reeves’ diagnosis of the problem is part institutional, part cultural. We today have an education system better suited to girls, but a labour market still structured around the needs of higher achieving men. And the positive shifts we have seen in the cultural script about successful womanhood have not been accompanied by changing narratives about what it means to be a flourishing man, a vacuum that has enabled misogynist influencers such as Andrew Tate – thethird most Googled personin the world in 2023 – to seed the idea with some young men that women are to blame for their ills.Adverse childhood experiences and mental health issues tend to manifest differently in boysReadingLost Boysmade me feel as though there’s a long way to go in properly understanding what’s going on with young men’s wellbeing. Convincing hypotheses abound. Boys get conflicting messages everywhere, from the violent, aggressive pornography to which so many young people are exposed, to important societal conversations about male violence, to the harmful stereotypes found in books and toys and on clothes. Adverse childhood experiences and mental health issues tend tomanifest differently in boys– in externalising bad behaviours, rather than internalised feelings of depression or anxiety – and are seen much less sympathetically in society, playing into higher school exclusion rates and higher rates of autism and ADHD diagnoses.Men tend to be more socially isolated – data from the US highlights they havefewer close friendshipsand that young men aretwice as likely to be singlethan women. They are also much more likely tolive in the parental home for longer. And Laura Bates has documented how social media algorithms target young men withextreme misogynistic content, with increasing numbers suffering from body dysmorphia or eating disorders, andtaking steroidsto bulk up.Some of the differences between boys and girls will be driven by biology; much will be socially constructed. In terms of the violence gap between the sexes, for example, the average man is not much more violent than the average woman, but there are many more very violent men than women. That is partly a product of higher testosterone levels, but also how some boys react to negative childhood experiences, such as domestic abuse oran absent father. On the friendship gap, one ethnographic study has found that in early adolescence, friendships between girls and between boys are not that dissimilar, but in later years boys learn to become more detachedthrough “macho” culture.Nature or nurture, these differences exist, however, and while some solutions, such as improving online safety and tighterregulation of online pornographywill benefit boys and girls, the former also need solutions tailored to their needs. In the US, Reeves has called for boys to start school a year later, better vocational and technical education, and more male teachers. These are worthy of exploration, but it is striking how little we know about what might work in improving boys’ outcomes.Redressing this is vital to improving the wellbeing of all young people. Failing to do so could also have political consequences, further opening the door for the far right to play on young men’s grievances, as we have seen across Europe. In the last election, young men were twice as likely to vote for Reform as young women, with the latter twice as likely to vote Green, reflecting a growing attitudinal gap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mike Tapp was dripping with compliments for his boss as he argued that the Commons should be “united” in order to “achieve a lasting peace” in Ukraine. It’s not unusual for ambitious MPs to offer these kinds of seemingly pointless questions at PMQs: for them, they have a very important function of highlighting their loyalty to the boss they hope will promote them, and also giving that boss a bit of a breather in between more hostile interventions from across the chamber. But there was also something slightly plaintive in the request for the House to remain united, because it can’t, and won’t.Starmer has rightly been praised from across the political spectrum for the calm way he handled themeltdown in the Oval Office. His careful management of the relationship between the US and UK, and the way he convened European leaders at short notice to plan a “coalition of the willing” to protect Ukraine was indeed statesmanlike behaviour. But in the next few weeks, he is going to be brought back down to earth – and to domestic matters – with a bump. Not only will the opposition parties start asking difficult questions again, but his own side is not exactly united. Perhaps Tapp was trying to persuade his own colleagues to stick by the prime minister as much as he was pre-emptively scolding the opposition for anything other than non-stop agreement.Managing a party when in government is always like dealing with a dripping tap in a bathtub: at some point, the disappointments will mount to the extent that there is a flood. That flood might come some time after a prime minister and his cabinet have really annoyed their backbenchers. When the government cuts benefits early on in its tenure, those backbenchers might still feel bound, as Tapp suggested, to be outriders for the government rather than speak their minds in public. But that doesn’t mean they’re not angry, frustrated at having to explain to their constituents why the Labour party has removed their entitlement to disability benefits, for instance. The bathtub fills up a lot, which means that the flood will come sooner.Cutting disability benefits is not just a “for instance” hypothetical, though: it is something that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is very likely to announce in the next few weeks. The Department for Work and Pensions is about to publish itsgreen paper on welfare reformahead of the budget, with Reeves hoping to cut several billion pounds off the ballooning benefits bill. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility has forecastthat the share of the working age population in receipt of incapacity benefit will rise from 7% in 2023-24 to an all-time high of 7.9% by 2028-29.Reeves has spoken about “support to get back to work”, with the likelihood being that claimants will find their entitlement to out of work benefits squeezed and there being a greater onus on them to find a job. But she hasn’t ruled out tightening the personal independence payment (PIP), which is not linked to whether someone is in or out of work. Neither cut will sit well for a Labour party that has always struggled to feel comfortable with any kind of welfare cut, even if the public is entirely supportive.MPs have started to voice their concerns to one another in the tearoom, though the WhatsApp groups are still well behavedThe bath already has a fair volume of disappointments in it after the row over the winter fuel payment. Many Labour MPs have found it extremely hard to justify restricting that benefit to those on pension credit. Some of them are now additionally fatigued by the recent cut to international development spending, another policy area that often forms part of a Labour MP’s identity and values.A good number of left and soft-left MPs are furious about the prospect of benefit cuts, even if Reeves and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, couch those announcements in the language of reform. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, madea striking argumentlast week for a “moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work”, adding that “our current situation is unsustainable”. Labour figures are acutely aware that their party has long struggled with a reputation for fiscal incontinence and for being soft on benefits.But welfare is an important part of the Labour DNA: the party still celebrates being the creator of the modern welfare state almost as much as it does founding the NHS. Its MPs have often been drawn into politics to protect people from benefit cuts – particularly the cuts announced in the Tory austerity measures over the past 14 years – and have spent far less time thinking about the overall bill.Still, few of them will speak out in public against the cuts when they are announced, other than those who have long been outspoken, like Diane Abbott. “Privately, lots of people are raging,” says one MP, but another who is also unhappy about the spending cuts thus far and fearful of what is to come suggests that there will be “very little pushback”. More MPs have started to voice their concerns to one another in the tearoom, though the party WhatsApp groups are still largely well behaved. Most MPs (with a few daft exceptions) recognise that once you share something in a large messaging group, you might as well have sent it out by press release, and so a grumpy WhatsApp message is now seen as quite a rebellious move. Most are still very much in the frame of mind where they want the government to succeed, and are supportive of Reeves, thinking she has a near impossible job.Starmer and colleagues have been busy doing as much outreach as they can to prevent the disappointment mounting too quickly. The prime minister has been having meetings with small groups of his MPs where he discusses policy and strategy with them. He also has the promise of further unpaid jobs that keep idle backbenchers from plotting, with more MPs getting special “champion” roles covering different sectors and regions of the UK. The value of being a “national health recovery mission champion”, along with having a job title so long that you’ve little breath left to criticise the government, is that a backbencher feels busy and important, connected to the government rather than left out and at the mercy of unpopular decisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kendall herself is considered to be a well-engaged minister who likes to be present around parliament so that MPs can chat to her, but that tends not to be enough when a department is in the thick of a storm about cuts. While she gets on well with Reeves – the two are described as being “genuinely friends” – there is still a level of distrust between the Treasury and the DWP (though this is not specific to DWP: Treasury officials tend not to trust any department that spends a lot of money).That question of trust is an important one for the relationship between the parliamentary party and ministers, particularly Reeves. She has not had an easy few months and, while most of her colleagues want her to succeed, they have had to watch the “iron chancellor” operating as more of an iron monger, bending her fiscal rules in order to have a chance of meeting them. If they stop trusting that she is on the right course, then they will find it harder to keep the faith during what will inevitably be an extremely emotional and painful set of benefit cuts.Of course, the longer a government delays those cuts, the closer the bath is to overflowing and the less likely it is that those cuts will happen at all. Some of the MPs who are particularly opposed to the cuts also happen to be very annoyed with Starmer and Reeves, and quite hopeful that they may be able to remove the former. They won’t speak out because they are biding their time until that bath does overflow and there is a flood of resentment in the wider Labour party that they can then take advantage of. So don’t be deceived if the party seems relatively peaceful and united over the next few months. The tap is still dripping.Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of theSpectatorand a presenter of Radio 4’sThe Week in WestminsterExplore more on these topicsRachel ReevesOpinionLiz KendallBenefitsWelfareKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s all gone nowWill HuttonDonald Trump’s actions go against the Enlightenment values that gave rise to the constitution. His might-is-right politics have nothing to offer BritainSun 9 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 07.20 EDTShareThe founding fathers of the USA – James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin and more – were quintessential disciples of the European Enlightenment. Their intent was to embed Enlightenment values into the government and culture of the New World. America would be a republic of laws. Its constitution would ensure governance of the people, by the people, for the people. Through checked and balanced branches of government, it would expunge the possibility of monarchical discretionary power and inaugurate proper democracy.It would celebrate all liberties, from freedom of speech to freedom of worship. Their belief in science “for the benefit of mankind in general”, in Franklin’s words, would imbue the republic’s commitment to reason, the scientific method and the pursuit of truth. The dynamic economy and society that emerged, however imperfect, reflected those values. It has inspired billions and, for all its falls from grace, has been a force for good.Donald Trump’s presidency is widely deplored for everything from his unilateral imposition ofswingeing tariffsto hispublic humiliation of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and siding with Russia over the war. He is guilty of all those things, and of an impulsiveness and unpredictability as he seeks retribution, respect and, as he would put it, reciprocity. But this misses the larger point: he draws not only on a constituency that shares his views but also on a well-developed body of thought that wants a decisive rupture with those Enlightenment values and all that spring from them.There is now genuine fear in US civil society – in business, finance, academia, the media and the Republican party – that to speak out will bring cruel retribution or even personal harm: this from the apostles of “free speech”. The US has gone mute. Its Enlightenment-based constitution and the accompanying values once held to be universal are being torched in near silence. Only fealty to Making America Great Again, by repudiating its notable traditions, is permitted – at home and abroad. The profundity of this is beginning to be recognised. Canada finds itself fighting for its life. Friedrich Merz, the incoming German chancellor, says for Europe it is “five to midnight”. He is driving through an extraordinary €1tn commitment to raise German defence and infrastructure spending over the next 10 years. The EU is bracing itself for attacks on its trade and its capacity to set standards and regulations for all goods EU citizens buy – so-called non tariff barriers – that Trump plans to launch “soon”. The EU’s high product standards, he argues, discriminate against lesser-regulated US exports. Even VAT is anti-American. The EU’s very being as a self-governing, multinational organisation is under threat.Multilateral organisations like the EU and the UN, expressing the same Enlightenment values as the US constitution, are in Trump’s crosshairs. The unashamed project is to reshape the world economic and political order so it serves only the interests of the US – as if it did not already. Can Britain really be a bridge between this vision and Europe, asKeir Starmerwants? These differences are unbridgeable.The unashamed project is to reshape the world economic and political order so it serves only the interests of the USTrump’s court at Mar-a-Lago, high on power and much else, has reportedly worked on a draft contract for countries to sign that reverses the alleged rip-off of the US. Instead, they will have to agree to boost US industry by accepting one-sided trade deals and appreciating their currencies. In return, they will be offered degrees of US security. Countries are said to be colour coded green, yellow and red, depending on the degree to which they might wholly accept vassalage, bargain for a compromise or are deemed to be enemies – with China the number-one target, and also including Canada, Mexico and the EU. Nato and the World Trade Organization be damned.Stephen Miran, the new chair of the US Council of Economic Advisers, won his job as the author of an extraordinary paper –A User’s Guide to Restructuring the World Trading System. Trump can reshape the global economic and trade order, he argues, through creating targeted tariff policies aimed at countries to which the US objects. The tariff regime must be designed to maximise fear and uncertainty; last week’s imposition, thenwithdrawal, of car tariffson Mexico and Canada was a prime example. The bulk of any economic costs will be displaced on to the countries at the receiving end by forcing them to raise their currencies against the dollar. He writes approvingly ofScott Bessent, now Trump’s treasury secretary, last year publicly arguing for putting countries into varying Mar-a-Lago style buckets corresponding to their readiness to comply with Washington’s will.Self-pity at the US’s alleged victimhood pervades Trumpite thinking. Even on Miran’s own numbers, the US still accounts for the same 25% of world GDP now as it did in 1980 – a phenomenal achievement. America is as great as it ever was. Only 19% of its GDP is imports, but these are blamed entirely for the fall in manufacturing employment as if robotisation, automation and the emergence of a service-based economy were irrelevant. Many working-class Americans have certainly suffered from these changes – but that needed an enlightened domestic policy response. China has re-industrialised by electrifying and decarbonising its economy. This is dismissed as woke.Adam Smith, the great Enlightenment economist, inspired the founding fathers as much as Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Paine. He praised the invisible hand of the market and open trade as pathways to the common good of greater prosperity – but none of that is for the Trumpites. They come from the mobster, cowboy, might-is-right, make-a-deal-on-my-terms strain of US culture and society. The humbling of Zelenskyy is the tip of this anti-Enlightenment iceberg. They are the masters now, and will gladly bend the US electoral system to stay that way. As some judges stir themselves, and political dissenters start to be braver, it’s an open question if they will succeed – but going back, if at all, is likely to be only partial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His level-headedness, decency and pragmatism have been assets. But he faces an unavoidable choice: Britain cannot achieve economic growth by remaining a vassal state to the US while abjuring closer trade relations with Europe. Trump does not want Britain to grow US-competitor great tech companies, which are essential to economic growth. Nor does he want to defendUkraineand Europe. It is brutally stark.

They need proper support in order to survive and flourishSun 9 Mar 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 15.54 EDTShareAt a press conference for the Sarajevo film festival in the early 1990s, its founder, the Bosnian directorHaris Pašović, was asked why he set up such a festival during the war. His reply, he told theLos Angeles Times, was: “Why the war during the film festival?” Sarajevo under siege is an extreme example, but the point is that arts festivals matter, especially during times of crisis.Covid, austerity and sponsorship issues have left even the most successful festivals in the UK struggling. This weekShona McCarthy, the outgoing chief executive of the Edinburgh festival fringe, argued that the fringe should be given the same support as major sporting events like the Olympics. This follows warnings fromNicola Benedetti, a classical violinist and director of the fringe’s parent, the international festival, that its world-class status is threatened by funding cuts.It is a similar story for Edinburgh book festival. Like many of the UK’s biggest literary festivals, it has been hit by the loss of sponsorship from the investment management companyBaillie Gifford, over its links to companies involved in the fossil fuel industry and Israel. The Hay literary festival, dubbed “the Woodstock of the mind” by Bill Clinton in 2001, is also under serious threat.Founded in 1947 in a spirit of postwar optimism, the Edinburgh fringe is the world’s largest arts festival, selling 2.6m tickets last year. Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Eddie Izzard, Steve Coogan, Hannah Gadsby and Scotland’s own Billy Connolly all started out here. In 1966, legend has it, a play titledRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Deadby an unknown playwright was performed to an audience of one. More recently, spin-off TV hits include This is Going to Hurt, Baby Reindeer and Fleabag, whose creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has said that “the Edinburgh fringe changed my life”.The fact that the fringe, unlike most festivals, is not centrally curated or funded (each show is the responsibility of its producers) doesn’t mean that it is without costs. Chaos was always part of its let’s-put-on-a-show ethos, but it is not a sound business strategy. Today, performers can’t afford to stay in Edinburgh, punters can’t book tickets due to poor wifi, and it is difficult for everyone to get around. It is no joke.Large-scale events require infrastructure and investment. Glasgow is only hosting theCommonwealth Gamesagain next year because the Australian state of Victoria pulled out, blaming rising costs. Edinburgh’s newtourism tax, along with later trains and the use of university accommodation brought in by Ms McCarthy, will help the fringe in practical ways. But more needs to be done to save its spirit.Tony Lankester, who takes over next month,must ensure that it is not just hotels and Airbnb owners who are laughing all the way to the bank.Cultural institutions like the fringe are about more than making money and stars. In our age of disinformation, artificial intelligence and alienation, such gatherings of people, talent and ideas are more vital than ever. As the novelistElif Shafak observedafter theattack on Salman Rushdieas he walked on stage at an arts festival in New York in 2022, they are “one of our last remaining democratic spaces” where one can both speak one’s mind freely and hear someone else’s story. Let’s give them a sporting chance.Explore more on these topicsFestivalsOpinionEdinburgh international book festivalEdinburgh festivalFringe theatreNicola BenedettiHay festivalFleabageditorialsShareReuse this content"

A victory in 2029 may seem unlikely. Yet his government’s push to redraw parliamentary constituencies using post-2026 census data could tilt the electoral field in his favour.The process, known asdelimitation, ensures each member of parliament represents an equal number of voters – a principle of democratic fairness. Since 1976, however, it has been frozen to avoid penalising Indian states that curbed population growth. If delimitation proceeds, Mr Modi’s populous northern strongholds will gain seats, weakening the political clout of India’seconomicallydynamic and culturally distinct southern cone. Its five states are governed by different parties but, critically, none belong to Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Southern states have long accused Mr Modi’s government of bias in federal funding and project approvals. Last week’s gathering of the south’s political leadership in Delhi toprotestagainst his move underscores the risk of backlash.India’s north and south are worlds apart: the six largest northern states have600 millionpeople – twice the south’s population – but lag far behind. Tamil Nadu thrives on industry, education and social mobility, with only 6% in poverty compared with 23% in Bihar. A child in Kerala has better survival odds than in the US; in BJP-run Uttar Pradesh (UP), they’re worse than in Afghanistan. It makes sense to redistribute resources to alleviate poverty. But UP alone receives more federal tax revenue than all five southern states combined. Even if it grew faster than southern India, it would takedecadesto catch up in per capita income. For southern India, delimitation represents both economic and political marginalisation – being taxed more, represented less and sidelined in national policymaking.A recentpaperby Paris’s Institut Montaigne thinktank highlights how India’s north-south divide is deepening due to economic, demographic and political disparities, stirring southern discomfort. It compares the situation to the EU’s Greek debt crisis, where wealthier northern countriesresentedsubsidising the poorer southern ones. The report considers Mr Modi’s home state ofGujarat– a wealthy but highly unequal western region with slow population growth – but warns that the Hindi‑speaking north’s larger populace and lack of socioeconomic progress will deepen tensions and drag the country down.The Indian economist Jean Drèzenotesthat while the BJP lost ground in the north in 2024, it gained in the south. He argues that if seats were redistributed by population while maintaining state-wise party shares, Mr Modi’s coalition would have won 309 MPs, not 294, out of 543 – an edge in a tight race. Prof Drèze suggests Mr Modi may be pushing delimitation to lock in a lead in 2029, when rising discontent could threaten his hold on power.Southernconcernscould be addressed by freezing seat allocations for decades to allow the north to catch up. However, Mr Modi seems to prefer expanding India’s parliament to prevent any state from losing representation, while shrinking southern influence. Much hinges on the timing of India’scensus, a crucial tool for evidence-based policymaking. Already postponed due to Covid in 2021, further delays are increasingly difficult to justify – they obstruct welfare distribution, stall efforts to improve women’s parliamentary representation and appear politically motivated. If delimitation proceeds before 2029 it could reshape India’s political landscape to the BJP’s advantage – but at the cost of a growing north-south rift that threatens to fracture the Indian union.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is also an important warning: people don’t fall for scams because they’re careless, but because they’re targeted by ruthless criminals.The reality is that fraudsters, often members of organised criminal networks, are finding it far too easy to exploit weaknesses in protections for consumers. Many banks and payment firms aren’t doing enough to prevent their customers from sending money to fraudsters, while tech giants remain sluggish when it comes to removing fraudulent material, like scam ads, that can ensnare so many users.The government and regulators must get a grip by ensuring that search engines and social media firms stop scams appearing. Banks and payment firms must have strong financial incentives to shut down scammers, which is why the scam reimbursement rules that Which? campaigned for are so vital and should be strengthened.Piecemeal action isn’t enough – stronger regulation and enforcement is urgently needed. Tech firms must be held accountable with targeted duties for more of the scam ads appearing on their sites much sooner than 2026, which is currently the timetable forimplementationof the Online Safety Act’s fraudulent advertising codes.

For many art critics, Vettriano committed the ultimate sin of being popular with the sort of people who don’t usually “get” art. Or, as Frankel puts it, the sort of people who enjoy the occasional McDonald’s cheeseburger.I’ve always been wary of the notion that art is better if you have to perform mental acrobatics in order to “get” it. I have been shown “good” modern art many times, and have been told whyit is good – but I would not necessarily want it hanging in my home.Vettriano’s best paintings, on the other hand, elicit feelings in people that many apparently “good” modern artworks are simply unable to provoke. Regardless of the “conceptual edge” that Frankel finds lacking in The Singing Butler, few people would deny that it is a beautiful painting. And would you rather hang a beautiful painting on your wall, or a painting whose “conceptual edge” means absolutely nothing to anybody except the artist and a handful of critics?I imagine people will still appreciate Vettriano’s paintings in 50 years’ time – long after all memory of the “conceptually edgy” modern art that the critics would prefer we liked has faded. With the poised beauty of his paintings, Vettriano democratised art, taking it out away from the critics and placing it into the hands of everyday people. It is a sin for which many in the art world still cannot forgive him. But then maybe I just don’t “get it” like the critics do.Ross McQueenBrussels, BelgiumIt is 2025, yet the Guardian’s main comment on the death of Jack Vettriano appears to be that his work is “sexy”. Are we really still only appraising art through the male heterosexual gaze? Eddy Frankel concedes that Vettriano’s work is “pretty sexist”, a dismissive understatement if ever there was one. Vettriano’s work is retrograde and objectified women (women of a very narrow age bracket) in a way that is no longer acceptable.It is no defence to claim that something is “popular”; Donald Trump can be said to be “popular”. The distasteful aesthetic of Vettriano’s work, its ability to give you a sense of unease, which Frankel does manage to allude to by describing it as “a double cheeseburger wrapped in greasy paper”, is embedded in the obvious untruths his images peddle; the scenarios in the paintings masquerade as sexy and romantic while serving up a polished turd of thinly veiled misogyny.Tamar PayneMA painting student,Royal College of ArtI am perhaps one of the great unwashed. I always liked Jack Vettriano’s paintings and I have a room of his prints. I also have prints of Van Gogh’s and of Munch’s pictures, and a few originals I could afford by “undiscovered” artists. What the art world seems to forget is that it is possible to like all these at the same time. In the same way, I like Schubert and I like Boney M, albeit one is better for dancing to.Neil Heydon-DumbletonPathhead, MidlothianHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Arteta was asked if deep down he believes the Premier League title will again eludeArsenal.Rice strike and Raya saves help Arsenal rescue point at Manchester UnitedRead moreThe Spaniard said: “I don’t want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven’t won our game, we know the urgency and you’re obligated to win every single match. You won’t have any chance without doing that. I don’t think it’s the right moment to talk about that.”Arsenal have now dropped seven points in their past three games. Arteta was asked why. “Today the efficiency we had in the last 20 metres wasn’t good enough. We know that. To come to Old Trafford and do what we did was superb but you have to capitalise and today we didn’t and then we have to overturn a result and you know how difficult that is here.”While being interviewed on Sky Sports after the match, Arteta walked off when asked if the title race was over.Bruno Fernandes’s free-kick strike just before half‑time was cancelled out by Declan Rice’s 74th‑minute equaliser. Anthony Taylor, the ­referee, ordered Arsenal’s wall back 11.2 yards for Fernandes’s goal, more than the regulation 10, meaning ­United’s captain could flight his kick over it more easily.Arteta said: “They [his staff] just mentioned that. If Bruno is on that, football is for smart street players and if he’s done that and capitalised on that, he was more clever than us and the referee.”United’s point takes them to 34 with 10 games left. Ruben Amorim praised Fernandes’s contribution. “What I can say is we need more Brunos, that is clear,” the head coach said. “Not just the quality and the character, he makes some mistakes but in this league the availability is so important and he is so decisive with and without the ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you couldn’t see the scoreboard you could tell by those swathes of empty seats. It was a hot day after all and refreshments were still being swilled. Italy were not bothered, however. They were on the attack, parked in England’s 22 and when the fly-half Paolo Garbisi found the outside, a try, and with it the lead, looked a certainty.The ball was flung wide to Italy’s left-wing Matt Gallagher, who stepped inside off his left foot. The step was read by Marcus Smith, who threw every one of his 82kg behind the tackle. Gallagher was stopped, Italy’s momentum was lost and, soon after, England escaped with a penalty awarded at the breakdown.Seven-try England maintain Six Nations title hopes with emphatic win over ItalyRead moreEngland’s lead was four at this stage and six minutes later it was 18. Another six and it was 25 with three quickfire tries. Smith scored the first, Tom Curry the second and Ollie Sleightholme the third.England did not necessarily win this match because of Smith but the moment he was introduced ahead of schedule you suspected his say would be significant.Without his tackle, without his try, scored after a trademark hitch-kick past Ange Capuozzo, England would not have been in such ascendancy with half an hour remaining. Curry and Jamie George would not have been in a position to fling one-handed offloads, England finally feeling liberated enough to showcase the kind of attacking intent they had promised but failed to deliver hitherto in their best performance with the ball in the championship.Make no mistake about it, Smith is a square peg in a round hole at full-back. He made mistakes here, looked uncomfortable under the high ball, but his skill level is such that he is always likely to contribute. Whether Smith is happy in the role of supersub is another matter.This was the kind of day players such as him pray for when they open the curtains and peer out of the window. He was said to begutted by his omission from the starting XVand it is understood he came mighty close to joining Racing 92 before the 2023 World Cup, when George Ford and Owen Farrell were ahead of him in the pecking order. Credit the head coach, Steve Borthwick, for convincing him to stay and it helps that Smith is tied to a long‑term Harlequins deal, although there are always ways out of contracts. Ultimately what may prove significant is whether he is selected for the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia that starts in June.View image in fullscreenOllie Lawrence is consoled by Elliot Daly as he is driven off the field after his injury against Italy.Photograph: David Cliff/EPAAs was the case the last time Smith found himself named among the replacements – in Lyon last year for the defeat against France – he did not have to wait long to get on to the field. In the eighth minute Ollie Lawrence crumpled in a heap and it was immediately clear he would be taking no further part. Cue the call for Smith, a few words of encouragement from the team manager, Richard Hill, a frisson of excitement when he flashed up on the big screen, and rapturous applause when he entered the field.It was the same when the teams were read out beforehand. For Smith is Twickenham’s darling. Cross the Chertsey Road to get to the stadium and his is the first face you see.After a word of consolation for Lawrence, with whom he is close friends, he was straight into the full-back position with Elliot Daly moving to outside centre. Already Daly had impressed, creating England’s first try by seizing on a turnover and arcing his run down the left rather than putting boot to ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was out of position for Capuozzo’s try and Monty Ioane gave him a rough ride when chasing high balls. His first telling intervention was a fine pass for Sleightholme’s first try but he spent plenty of the first half watching on as Fin Smith continued his assured start in the No 10 jersey. It helped to have Fraser Dingwall at No 12, described in the week by Borthwick as a “glue player” and holding everything together in midfield nicely.That said, Italy produced the two most memorable moments of attacking brilliance in the first half and it was not until that period after Marcus Smith’s tackle that England really hit their straps. They scored three tries in 10 minutes, reached the levels of attacking polish that their supporters crave and suddenly Marcus Smith was revelling in his unfamiliar role.It did not last all that long – they did not score another point before the clock was red – but while comfortable England victories against Italy tend not to linger long in the memory, that 10-minute period, in particular Sleightholme’s second score, just may. Borthwick would do well to remember it was Marcus Smith who started it all.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamItaly rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

What she didn’t know was that Koster had also smashed her head and was unconscious.As the athletes sped around the 200m track, officials rushed out to drag the unresponsive Koster off the track like a rag doll. No wonder the crowd went silent.

I was just trying to keep up, because you don’t want to end up down as well. It was carnage.”The accident looked to have come after Koster clipped the British athlete Hannah Nuttall from behind. “I was in front of her, I heard something click behind me and just heard a scream,” Nuttall said. “Obviously it didn’t sound great.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The BBC missed the fall because it was showing the women’s high jump, but the incident was so serious that when it returned to the race, Steve Cram told viewers that it might have to be stopped because Koster was unconscious.As she was taken to hospital, the race continued with Courtney-Bryant, Nuttall and another Briton, the 18-year-old Innes FitzGerald, still in contention in the final stages.Courtney-Bryant was the first to make her move.

I came off the bend and still felt really confident going to the line. But before I knew it, my legs were just going underneath me, and she went past. I was like: ‘I’m gonna stack it, I’m gonna fall.’ But a silver medal is better than my two bronzes.” Salomé Afonso of Portugal took bronze, with Nuttall sixth and FitzGerald a creditable eighthon her senior debut.Naturally, most of the discussion after concerned Koster’s horror fall.

However, Bol powered clear for gold in a European Indoor record of 3:24.34, with Britain setting a national record of 3:24.89.There was then drama as the Dutch team were disqualified for obstruction in the takeover on the final leg. There was a 90-minute delay, an appeal and counter-appeal before it was decided the initial result should stand after it emerged that it was an error from a race official, who had put the teams in the wrong order for the changeover. It left the large Dutch crowd happy – and the British team, who ended these championships eighth in the table with seven medals, were not too disappointed.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The sense remains that Stamford Bridge regulars will take some convincing on the merits of the careful, possession-heavy nature of Marescaball. It is not exactly setting pulses racing at the moment and it was telling that the mood was far from harmonious during this win againstLeicester City.Maresca seemed to be letting out a lot of frustration when he reacted to Marc Cucurella breaking the deadlock after an hour of stodginess by gesturing angrily for fans to make more noise. The grumbling about his team’s backwards and sideways ­passing had struck a nerve. Then again Maresca could hardly ­complain if there was dissatis­faction aboutChelsea­labouring against ­opponents who look certain to return to the Championship after losing 12 of their past 13 games.Rice strike and Raya saves help Arsenal rescue point at Manchester UnitedRead moreThere was the excuse of Cole Palmer, who has gone nine games without a goal after spurning an early penalty, demanding to start despite diarrhoea ­preventing him from ­training for 48 hours. Yet Palmer’s queasy stomach was not the only reason for ­Chelsea’s attack stinking the place out at times.Maresca also pointed to Leicester switching to a back five for the first time under Ruud van ­Nistelrooy, ­saying it forced him to change his entire plan just before kick-off. Cucurella, who was supposed to be an ­auxiliary midfielder, was asked to overlap more from left-back; Maresca suggested that the shifts were too subtle for outsiders to understand.The head coach sounded impatient. Maresca, talking about his post‑goal celebrations, acknow­ledged that there were boos when Enzo Fernández played a backpass a few minutes before Cucurella scored.“It’s our style,” the Italian said. “We need our fans – I said it on my Instagram two days ago. We need them behind the ­players because the spirit they showed today was fantastic. I completely understand when there is a negative feeling but how many chances did we create in the first half?”Not many. He also said pointedly: “If you think football is just PlayStation and you win easy? No way. Every game is difficult.”There was an element of Maresca deflecting attention from a pallid display. Was it really such a shock for Leicester to put numbers behind the ball? This was no revolutionary tactic. The onus was on Chelsea to react.The saving grace was that Leicester could not make life truly uncomfortable for their former manager. They have lost their ­identity since Maresca left last summer and are six points below 17th-placed Wolves after their fifth successive blank. No wonder Van Nistelrooy, who looks on increasingly thin ice after taking seven points from a possible 45 since replacing Steve Cooper in November, later had the look of a manager who would not be surprised if this turns out to be his final outing. “We don’t know if we are running out of time,” Leicester’s manager said. “We know we have today and tomorrow.”Van Nistelrooy took satisfaction from how Leicester stifled Chelsea by denying them space to run in behind. It is an issue for Maresca’s team. Their passing was slow and the only Chelsea player who looked willing to take any risks was Robert Sánchez, a surprise starter in goal a month after losing his spot in the league to Filip Jörgensen.View image in fullscreenMads Hermansen gets down to save Cole Palmer’s first-half penalty.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesLeicester almost had a farcical lead when their right wing-back, James Justin, delivered a firm cross. Sánchez produced a flying air punch and Tosin Adarabioyo turned the ball against his own bar.

Pedro Neto had few opportunities to race through the middle. Wilfred Ndidi and Boubakary Soumaré matched Moisés Caicedo and Fernández in midfield. Jadon Sancho and ­Christopher Nkunku were quiet on the flanks.Then there was Palmer, who is no longer the mooching, casual figure who destroyed defenders for fun earlier this season. What came naturally before now feels forced. There was almost an inevitability to Mads Hermansen denying Palmer after Chelsea were awarded a penalty for Victor ­Kristiansen’s trip on Sancho in the 19th minute.Chelsea drifted into lethargy before half-time. Palmer, who had lost his perfect record from the spot, was weary. Hermansen repelled a drive from Nkunku but much of the play was in front of Leicester. ­Wesley Fofana, starting for the first time since 1 December after a hamstring injury, provided no width at right-back. Being a winger for Maresca is not easy.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Just as the groans were growing in intensity, though, up popped a full‑back to calm the noise. ­Cucurella’s low drive from 20 yards slid past Hermansen and Maresca asked the fans for more positivity.The mood remained fragile. Palmer came off earlier than usual but Leicester were too blunt to capitalise. Vardy tested Sánchez at 0-0 but an equaliser was never on the cards.

On a ­sultry night at the Dubai International ­Stadium, we got the entirely foreseeable answer. Pakistan’s tournament is India’s glory, by four wickets with six balls to spare: a triumph that felt as immaculately controlled as the months of sabre-rattling and politicking that preceded it.None of which is to diminish the acclaim due to India’s players: men of skill and men of character, men who step up and deliver under pressure. They did not devise the format in which everyone else travelled, toiled and adapted while they stayed put. They did not construct the apparatus of a global game run in the interests of one country.India v New Zealand: Champions Trophy men’s cricket final – liveRead moreIronically they are easily good enough to have won this trophy without any competitive advantage, in any conditions, on any schedule: a side that bear comparison with any to grace the white-ball game.And after a journey of 4,379 miles, from Karachi to Rawalpindi to Dubai to Lahore and back to Dubai, New Zealand finally ran out of road. They won the toss. They scrambled to a competitive total. Glenn Phillips took a stunning catch. Michael Bracewell had one of the games of his life. They got Virat Kohli out second ball. But ultimately there is little point in winning the inches when your opponent still has all the yards.As deep as it ultimately went, there has been an inexorability to India all the way through this tournament, an immaculate calmness, an ­inability to conceive the circumstances in which they might be beaten. Chasing 252, Rohit Sharma set them up with a brisk 76; KL Rahul was the consummate finisher at the end despite – in his own words – “shitting himself” as the chase tightened.But really this was a palace built on spin: the mesmerising 38 overs delivered by Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja at suffocating speed, a ­constriction that felt slow and fast all at once. After taking 69 from the 10-over powerplay, New Zealand needed until the 31st over to double their score. Only four boundaries came between the ninth and the 43rd overs.View image in fullscreenIndia’s captain, Rohit Sharma, enjoys a moment with the trophy.Photograph: Christopher Pike/APKuldeep’s first ball, a pinpoint googly to clean up Rachin Ravindra for a streaky 37, set the tone. His eighth, held back a little, tempted Kane Williamson into a leading edge. Indeed New Zealand’s first five wickets fell to full deliveries in which the batter failed to get sufficiently forward: a measure of how India’s immaculate length had pinned them back, a kind of beautiful paralysis. Daryl Mitchell’s 91-ball half-century was the slowest by a New Zealander in 11 years, and for most of his colleagues the agony was appreciably briefer.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A late flurry from Bracewell yielded 67 off the final seven overs, at which point the most economical powerplay attack in the tournament – albeit missing the injured Matt Henry – was well in the game. Instead Rohit hit the second ball of the innings for six, Will O’Rourke’s first over went for 13 and the honest hard lengths of Nathan Smith were treated with nothing but disdain. By the time Phillips claimed Shubman Gill with a ridiculous overhead grab at extra cover, India had knocked 105 off the target at roughly even time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But arguably this was also the period when the game slipped away. Phillips wheeled away for five tidy but unthreatening overs at a time when New Zealand needed wickets and India were happy to accumulate. Kyle Jamieson was inexplicably held back until the 48th over, by which time the contest was done.Shreyas Iyer and Axar chipped away, Rahul paced the acceleration perfectly and before long a partisan crowd – many of whom had booked last-minute flights to Dubai – was revelling in another display of Indian dominance. And for many India fans there will be a certain cold relish in the way events have panned out: Pakistan conquered, Pakistan upstaged, and without ever having to set foot in the place. Even the interval entertainment, Vishal Mishra, was Indian.And yes, it is considered exceptionally bad form to mention this kind of stuff. Leave politics out of sport, scream the people busy rewriting sport along the lines of politics. But perhaps one of the more underrated pieces of collateral damage here has been the excellence of this Indian team: an all-time great side who have mastered every aspect of the game and yet find themselves pursued wherever they go by rancour, resentment, the unmistakable whiff of administrative bias.Their record in the past three global white-ball tournaments?

A rise into the top 10 of the ATP rankingsand a Wimbledon semi-finalfollowed soon after.Despite two extremely positive earlier performances during the past week in the desert, Norrie remains a considerable distance from reproducing his success of old. The 29-year-old was outclassed in the third round of Indian Wells by the No 10 seed Tommy Paul, whose greater weapons and confidence in the decisive moments earned him a 6-3, 7-5 win.Lucky loser Van de Zandschulp stuns struggling Djokovic at Indian WellsRead moreAfter avery difficult season last year, where he missed three months because of an arm injury after struggling with his form for most of the time, Norrie has struggled to find his momentum again, falling to No 77 in the rankings.Still, there have recently been glimmers of hope. He reached the third round this week by playing some of his best tennis in more than a year and his second-round win against the No 24 Jiri Lehecka marked his first top-25 victory since the Australian Open last year.Although both players struggled early on, Paul eventually took control, breaking up the lengthy, attritional exchanges Norrie tried to drag him into with his greater weight of shot and determination to close down the end. Norrie fought hard until the finish, pulling himself back into the match in set two by retrieving Paul’s break with a run of 10 successive points.View image in fullscreenKatie Boulter (right) shakes hands with Elena Rybakina after losing in straight sets to the seventh seed.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesHowever, Norrie’s lack of confidence in many of the decisive moments was summed up by the final game of the match. Down 6-5, he served three double faults, including one on match point. This time, Norrie will leave Indian Wells with far more modest gains. He has made genuine progress this week, but there is a long path before him as he tries to find his way back towards the top of the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The biggest victory of Russell Henley’s career arrived as Collin Morikawa was left to ponder how on earth he failed to close out the Arnold Palmer Invitational. For much of Sunday, Morikawa had looked untouchable.Henley took to the 71st tee of the event holding the lead for the first time. He had claimed that with an astonishing chip in for an eagle on the 16th. This completed a four-shot swing in only three holes. Henley birdied the 14th as Morikawa bogeyed. After Henley’s exploits two holes later, Morikawa had no scope for recovery. Henley’s 11 under par took the Bay Hill tournament by a single stroke. He had trailed Morikawa by three after 10 fourth-round holes.Keegan Bradley surprised ‘kick their ass’ comment was broadcast on NetflixRead more“Sometimes golf is just mean like that,” said the 35-year-old in respect of what played out for Morikawa. “This game is unbelievably hard. That [winning] was just so difficult.” The understated Henley, who won for the first time since 2022, has quietly catapulted himself into elite golfing company. A Ryder Cup debut in September looks highly likely.Morikawa may take some time to process this. His non-appearance for post-round media duties said it all on that front. A harsh reality is that the Californian has not kicked on in the manner predicted when he won majors in 2020 and 2021.Canada’s Corey Conners took third at nine under, one ahead of Michael Kim. Conners has qualified for the Open at Portrush courtesy of this finish.Keegan Bradley endorsed the theory he could qualify for his own US Ryder Cup team with a stunning 64. That earned Bradley a tie for fifth.Shane Lowry, who finished one shy of Bradley’s seven-under aggregate, was left to rue a third round of 76.Rory McIlroy’s week ended with a 72 – he failed to break 70 over four days at Bay Hill – for a share of 15th. The Northern Irishman had put a new driver and fairway woods in play but reverted to the previous models before the final round. “I just went back to what was familiar and what’s comfortable,” McIlroy said.“It’s a blessing and a curse at the same time that we sort of have to go through these 12-month club cycles. I probably just didn’t give myself enough time. It’s totally different, it can look good on the Trackman and it can look good on the range at home at the Bear’s Club or on the golf course but once you get out here in these conditions that’s where it really shows itself and it just wasn’t quite ready.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France may now bestrong favourites to lift the trophyon Saturday night but three consecutive home wins with a total of 12 tries scored have finally offered tangible evidence of red rose improvement after an often frustrating winter.In isolation there was nothing particularly special about this seven-try victory against an outgunned Italy team on a beautiful Sunday afternoon but inside the camp it will be seized upon as further proof that England are genuinely on track for the sunlit uplands. Another bonus‑point victory against Wales in Cardiff will be needed to put pressure onLes Bleuswhen they face Scotland in Paris later the same day but this was the first time in 32 Tests under Steve Borthwick that England have registered more than 40 points against tier-one opponents.‘Devastated’ England wait for test results after Ollie Lawrence injuryRead moreEngland will also be pleased with the way they responded to the loss of Ollie Lawrence with an achilles injury after eight minutes. It could have thrown them off balance tactically but a composed performance from the fly‑half Fin Smith and some sharp finishing, not least from Ollie Sleightholme, who scored a brace of tries, ultimately left the visitors chasing shadows.It was also a decent day for Ollie Chessum, the player of the match, as well as Marcus Smith, who was propelled into the fray ahead of schedule after Lawrence’s abrupt departure. This has been an up-and-down season for the Harlequins playmaker but here was a fruitful outing, yielding a nice try and a healthy all‑round contribution. That said, Fin Smith’s grip on the No 10 jersey tightens by the week and the increasing number of Northampton players in the backline is assisting England’s cohesion.A basking audience also enjoyed the hosts’ more positive intent after the self-confessed“ugly” win against Scotland. Just as there was less in the way of painful box‑kicking so the weather was gloriously different. Gone were the rain that flushed France away last month and the persistent chill of recent weeks. It was so warm you half expected Ben Stokes to lead out a zinc-creamed England cricket side. Instead there was Jamie George on the occasion of his well-deserved 100th England cap.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman goes over for an England try in the first half against Italy.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt felt as near as the old tournament will come to being staged in high summer and inevitably made for a free-flowing contest from the outset. One little fumble in contact by the Italy scrum-half Stephen Varney after just three minutes was all it took to spark a sweeping counterattack which ended with a delighted Tom Willis stretching out to score 70 metres upfield.The exit of Lawrence, though, did temporarily disrupt English rhythm, forcing Elliot Daly to outside-centre and prompting an excited roar from the crowd at Smith’s early deployment at full-back. Italy took swift advantage of the reshuffle, Monty Ioane chipping the ball into plenty of space close to the English line and inviting Ange Capuozzo to complete a deft score.Had Paolo Garbisi not missed an eminently kickable penalty Italy would have been ahead and it was a relief for England supporters when a well-judged Daly grubber sat up perfectly for Tommy Freeman to score in the right corner. TheAzzurri, though, were not in the least deflated and were back level again with half an hour gone.Capuozzo is a smart and elusive player and he showed both qualities to leave George for dead in midfield and then find the supporting Ross Vintcent. The Exeter Chief is among the quickest back-row forwards in the Premiership and duly burned off the cover to complete a cracking try.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Excellent footwork from Will Stuart and an offload from Tom Curry put Marcus Smith away for a scampering try and three minutes later Curry scored himself to take England clear on the scoreboard.After that it was a question of whether England could get anywhere near the 73 points scored by France against theAzzurriin round three. George put a swivelling Sleightholme over for another well-taken try, the winger’s sixth in eight Tests, and Fin Smith, yet again, drilled over the conversion as if it were the easiest skill in the world. Tommaso Menoncello grabbed a 70th‑minute consolation for the visitors but a last-gasp Ben Earl try ensured the Italian job – no cliffhanger this one – was comprehensively completed.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamItaly rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There, working to revive a rare fragment of rainforest, he found a way to heal himselfSun 9 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareAstraight-backed, well-spoken former management consultant and ex-soldier in a wax jacket might not resemble much of a tree wizard, but the man leading me into a steep Cornish valley of gnarled, mossy oaks is called Merlin. He possesses hidden depths. And surfaces. Within minutes of meeting, as we head towards the Mother Tree – a venerable oak of special significance – Merlin Hanbury-Tenison reveals that he recently had a tattoo of the tree etched on his skin. I’m expecting him to roll up a sleeve to reveal a mini-tree outline, but he whips out his phone and shows me a picture: the 39-year-old’s entire back is covered with a spectacular full-colour painting of the oak. “It took 22 hours. I was quite sore,” he says, a little ruefully. “But I was in London afterwards, feeling quite overcome by the city and I had this moment: I’ve got the rainforest with me. Wherever I go, I feel like I’m carrying the forest and its story with me.”Merlin is keen to tell the remarkable 5,000-year story of this fragment of Atlantictemperate rainforest– a rare habitat found in wet and mild westerly coastal regions and which is under more threat than tropical rainforests. In fact, he is now the custodian of this special, nature-rich landscape filled with ferns, mosses, lichens and fungi. He is slightly more reticent about his own remarkable life. Both stories are well worth telling.Cabilla, a 250-acre hill-farm on the edge of Bodmin Moor, was bought in 1960 by his dad, the explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison. He wanted a place where he wouldn’t hear traffic and could drink from the stream. The call of a song thrush, not traffic noise, fills the valley to this day and Robin, now approaching 89, still drinks from the stream. Merlin has taken over the farm and has conjured up three big visions: he wants to expand the less-than-1% fragment of Atlantic rainforest that endures in western Britain; he hopes to demonstrate that a new kind of hill-farming is viable and employs local people; he also seeks to open up such forests to those who need them the most – the traumatised, the broken and stressed urbanites who don’t even realise they can thrive if they take time beneath an ancient tree, imbibe the smell of damp leaves and listen to the river dancing over the ferny rocks below.As Merlin writes inOur Oaken Bones, a graceful and inspiring memoir, the epiphany that trees were his life’s work was slow in coming and it arrived in a crisis. Merlin was born on his parent’s Cornish farm and loved playing with his dogs in the woods. Aged seven, he was sent to boarding school. There he dabbled in acting, starring as Russell Crowe’s son in the filmProof of Life(Crowe – “a lovely man” has offered words of praise for his first book). Then Merlin joined the army, partly because the terror attacks of 9/11 made a big impression on his 16-year-old self, but also because of a claim inFHMmagazine that “tank commander” was a job that young women rated particularly highly.I’d spent 20 years, from seven to 27, in institutions where if you cried, that was badHe undertook three tours of Afghanistan. In 2007, his armoured vehicle hit a landmine. Momentarily blinded and deafened by the explosion, he remembers sitting in the debris urgently feeling his body for puncture wounds to stop the blood loss that would rapidly prove fatal. He was covered in a thick liquid. With a sense of doom, he knew it was his own blood. He licked it from his fingers. He must have been concussed and confused: the liquid tasted like English mustard. It was English mustard, which had splattered everywhere from a jar stored in the vehicle. “I still can’t eat mustard,” he says. “Trigger is not really a term I tend to use, but it definitely pulls me into a moment that I would rather not be pulled into.”When Merlin had received some fairly cursory army trauma training, he was sceptical to be told that the full effects of a catastrophe might not manifest itself in a person for a decade. After the explosion, he was fine. He didn’t break down. He never cried. “I’d spent 20 years, from seven to 27, in institutions where if you cried, that was bad,” he says. “If you were seen to be crying, it was definitely not going to raise your social status or raise your ability to survive. And in the military, I was a leader. I was put in charge of soldiers at 19. I couldn’t be seen to cry in front of them.”When he was in the military, he met and married Lizzie, a move which spurred him to leave the army and become a management consultant in London. Then, in 2017, a decade after he was blown up, on a high-pressure project, disconcerting memories started returning. Eventually, he broke down for the first time in his life, in front of a senior management consultant. He was advised to see the doctor and take some pills; then he’d be fine. Merlin knew he was not fine. He left the project and went down to Cabilla for a break. It was not good for his career. “It’s viewed very badly, because it doesn’t look like you’re striving, fighting, thriving,” he says. Back on the farm, which has 85 acres of valley woodland and 165 acres of grazing pasture, he “spent time walking, sitting, swimming, being. Then I noticed things that needed doing – fences to mend, a gate that had fallen down and I started in an incompetent way to fix them.”Meditation didn’t really work, but he discovered that hunting roe and red deer was meditative for him. It also helped stop the deer devouring the next-generation oak trees. “I found when I’m in this valley on my own with a rifle looking for a deer that’s eating all the oak saplings, I can’t be worrying about the past. I have to be in that moment,” he says. He likens it to traditional hunter- gatherers and argues there’s not as big a gulf between this and mindfulness as most people would think.In Cabilla’s woods, Merlin felt his “body slipping into the parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ state. I hadn’t realised how much my body needed it. I hadn’t realised how much everybody needs it,” he says. As we stroll through the oaks, which are stout and low, their wintery branches coloured peppermint by lichen, Merlin is careful not to claim his experience was a nature cure.“When I talk to people about being blown up in Afghanistan, they say [of the PTSD], ‘That makes sense’, but mental health is never as simple as two plus two. It’s not ‘I was blown up and have PTSD and nature cures me.’” His PTSD was also caused by his stressful job and city lifestyle. Eventually, he quit the consultancy job and focused on his recovery. He took talking therapy and found sound therapy and eye-movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to be useful as well. He turned down antidepressants. “I’d never want to imply that people shouldn’t go with medication, but for me I wanted it to be the last thing I tried,” he says. Instead, he attended a psilocybin [magic mushroom] retreat in Amsterdam. “It was without doubt the most transformational moment of my life,” he says. “I’d never use the word ‘cure’, but it put me into a very stable state of mental health for a longer period than anything else.”While Merlin was seeking to restore his mental health, Lizzie suffered the trauma of repeated miscarriages. She came to Cabilla to recuperate, too, and they had an epiphany. “It’s a place of healing. It’s healing people and it’s a place to heal the land,” he says. In 2020, they both moved down to Cabilla and established a wellness retreat. Over the past four years, while juggling two young daughters, they’ve hosted 3,000 people. In the woods, they provide courses for NHS nurses, US special forces and business people, as well as yoga and Wim Hoff breathwork sessions for paying guests. The forest seems to attract those who need it. “We’re in the kitchen having breakfast with the girls and some druid wanders past the window. That’s Cabilla,” laughs Merlin. But his “favourite people” who come on retreat “are those who don’t think they like nature”. And he’s proud there is “at least a 60% tear rate among the people who come here, a positive natural outpouring. I cry all the time now”.View image in fullscreenTime to grow: through his charity, the Thousand Year Trust, Merlin hopes to expand ancient rainforest fragments across western Britain.Photograph: Leon Foggitt/The ObserverThe land-healing part comes through Merlin’s charity, theThousand Year Trust, which is dedicated to nurturing and expanding the Atlantic rainforest fragments not just around Bodmin Moor but across the hills and valleys of western Britain, which was cloaked in this rare and biodiverse habitat a millennia or two ago.We have reached the Mother Tree. “She’s not the biggest or the oldest, but for me there’s something about this tree. She’s a sentinel,” says Merlin. “She is holding so much on her. She is the most wonderful condensed example of a rainforest.” The oak is in early middle-age, a mere 370 years old, and her branches are already covered by ferns, lichens and clumps of moss the size of a wildcat. Like other native oaks, she could support several thousand species: fungi, beetles, birds, wasps, butterflies. One short dead stump of a branch alone hosts eight different rare lichens.Like other surviving rainforest fragments, Cabilla endured by chance, because it grew in a valley too steep and filled with granite boulders to be cleared or cultivated for farming. Peat core samples have proven there has been forest cover here for at least 3,664 years – and probably since the ice age. Perhaps the forest also survived because it was beautiful and sacred. There are six ancient stone monuments in the valley dated to 4,500 years ago.For the first time in perhaps 1,000 years, Merlin is expanding Cabilla’s woodland. Pastures have been planted with young oaks, with other areas left to naturally regenerate. Following the model established by the rewilded estate ofKnepp, Merlin will bring back grazing cattle, horses and pigs, but only once the regenerating trees are established. There is still scepticism among some local farmers and Merlin questions what he’s doing. “Is it good farmland and am I ruining it? Well, grade four agricultural grazing land is not good farmland, it’s appropriate for sheep and a few cows. Are we ruining it? I don’t think planting 100,000 trees and sequestering thousands of tonnes of carbon is ruination.”He wants to prove that people can be part of this picture, too. He wants valleys of rainforest corridors connecting fragmented remnants and low-density livestock grazing that provides high-welfare, very high-quality meat – “Cornish rainforest beef” – that can be sold directly to consumers for a good price. He hopes that this “agro-rainforestry” (“It’s not taking off as a term yet,” he laughs) will “create a blueprint for what might work for farmers in some of our western uplands”. Local landowners with 6,500 acres between them have joined a farm cluster that’s enthusiastic about restoring rainforest along Merlin’s lines.This forest is a 4,000-year-old living entity. It’s a giant mushroom with thousands of fingers pointing in the airWe head deeper into the forest. A squall approaches. Suddenly, we’re not in rainforest but hailforest. Just as abruptly, a brilliant rainbow appears, pointing to a pot of gold in the valley bottom. Is there money in Merlin’s big ideas? He crunched the conventional farm numbers and found he couldn’t make a living from sheep and cows. In 1960, the farm employed eight people. When Merlin took over, there was one seasonal farm worker. Today, Cabilla employs nine people on its retreats business, with five more working for the charity. Cabilla is also a focus for a new generation of temperate rainforest scientists. Last year, they hosted six universities and six PhD students, alongside 20 MScs – this year they hope to double that.As well as promoting a new scientific understanding of temperate rainforests, Merlin aims to inject a spiritual dimension into our thinking. Leading writers, including Robert Macfarlane, whose powerful new bookIs a River Alive?is published this spring, are urging a change to western mindsets, so that we recognise that ecosystems and habitats and rivers are living wholes, and deserve our gratitude and devotion rather than simply being exploited in the service of human wealth or wellbeing. “There’s still this barrier in people’s minds that humans aren’t part of these kinds of places and aren’t part of nature,” says Merlin. “I want to help people remember and create that societal memory that we are a rainforest people living in a rainforest island. Being here is far more natural than getting a coffee on a busy high street. Every place on the planet has special pinnacle habitats, which we should love and care for and view as living entities in themselves. This forest is a 4,000-year-old living entity. It’s a giant mushroom with thousands of fingers pointing in the air. Our purpose is to make sure that with each human generation it is slightly bigger, more biodiverse and more harmonious.”Just as the rainforest may be a living whole, so the Mother Tree possesses her own will and personality. For Merlin, she embodies Cabilla “which is why I spent 22 hours of pain having her put on me forever, much to my wife’s chagrin,” he grimaces.Time moves slowly for the Mother Tree and her neighbours. “It’s frustrating, because there will never be enough time with Cabilla. You need 500 years to watch trees evolve and grow,” he says. But with luck, Merlin and Lizzie’s daughters will see Cabilla in 80 years’ time, when today’s vision is fruiting and burgeoning and a rainforest nation is more enthusiastic than ever about its regrowing forests. At least their eldest is enthusing about her dad’s tattoo. Merlin laughs. “She says, ‘My daddy carries a rainforest on his back.’”Our Oaken Bones by Merlin Hanbury-Tenison is published on 20 March at £22, or £19.80 atguardianbookshop.comExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe ObserverRegenerationPlantsTrees and forestsMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The hurricane, which struck in September 2024, was devastating for the region’s trees.North CarolinaTree loss from hurricane leaves Asheville vulnerable to new climate shocksDamage to trees in western North Carolina from Hurricane Helene was ‘extraordinary and humbling’ but urban areas face particular problemsNina Lakhaniin Asheville with photographs byThalia JuarezSun 9 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 08.02 EDTShareThe city of Asheville and its surrounding areas have been left vulnerable to floods, fires and extreme heat afterHurricane Heleneuprooted thousands of trees that provided shade and protection from storms.Helene was catastrophic for the region’s trees – in part due to the heavy precursor rainstorm that pounded southern Appalachia for two days straight, drenching the soil before Helene hit, bringing yet more heavy rain and 60-100mph winds.The category 4 storm caused severe damage to more than 400,000 acres of forest in rural areas of westernNorth Carolinaalone, stripping entire mountainsides bare, according to the latest assessment by the US Forest Service. Almost half the forest in Mitchell county was severely damaged, as was about 30% in Ashe and Watauga and 17% in Buncombe county.‘Everything we had floated away’: Hurricane Helene survivors help each other as disinformation swirlsRead moreThe extent of the tree damage is “extraordinary and humbling”, according to Steve Norman, a research ecologist who conducted the assessment using remote sensing satellites at the Forest Service’s Southern Research Centre.The damage count does not, however, include urban areas like Asheville, a city in Buncombe county which suffered unprecedented large-scale tree failures leaving some streets and neighborhoods completely bare.Asheville is among the fastest-growing small US cities, with many drawn to the city’s art scene and claims that it was a climate haven.Yet tree cover was already declining even before Helene – the city lost 6.8% of its tree canopy between 2008 and2018, according to one study,while the population grew by 10%.Then Helene, the most powerful storm to hit southern Appalachia in decades, submerged Asheville’s River Arts District along the French Broad River, and Marshall, another artsy town, both in flood water. The river is now a silty eroded mess, with little vegetation to protect the land from future storms, flanked by piles of tree debris.View image in fullscreenTree damage is seen in Marshall, North Carolina, as the clean-up from Hurricane Helene continued in February.Yet not all trees fared the same, according to new analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian. Hard woods such as red oaks, hickories and eastern white pines accounted for 70% of the trees upended by hurricane-force winds in Asheville, while softwoods including tulip trees and maples were far less prone to failure.Trees provide essential ecosystem services in urban areas including cooling, carbon sequestration, storm water management, wildlife habitat, air pollution capture and mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing. The new research led by April Wilson, a certified master arborist, is an attempt to understand which species may suffer worst in supercharged storms fueled by human-made global heating.In the immediate weeks after Helene, Wilson conducted a survey of 300 fallen trees in 11 suburban and urban neighborhoods in the Asheville area. Eighty-three per cent had no obvious defect: these were healthy-looking trees with no root rot, hollow trunks or other major structural problems.In January, Wilson surveyed 800 randomly selected standing trees, a control group of survivors from the same neighborhoods. The analysis, conducted with Jenna Rindy, a local environmental scientist with research experience in forest biology, found that size and species had significant associations with failure.View image in fullscreenApril Wilson, a certified master arborist, stands near a Chestnut Oak tree in a northern suburb of Asheville, North Carolina.Medium to large trees – those between 16 and 36 inches in diameter - were 83% more likely to fail than smaller ones. Previous studies in other locations have shown that larger trees are more prone to failure in extreme storms than those with smaller diameters. In Asheville, smaller and extra-large trees fared best.Red oaks and eastern white pines accounted for 43% of the failures. It’s unclear why but oaks hold on to their leaves more than other trees, which increases drag – or heaviness of the canopy. Other possible explanations include root size and the impact of previous climate crisis-fueled disasters, particularly drought.Medium- to large-sized northern red oaks were the most prone to failure, the analysis found.“While we want to avoid making sweeping tree management decisions based on this singular storm, we can conclude large oak trees should be further assessed in the urban landscape – even those without detectable defects. Species with a lower likelihood of failure, including many minimal-risk native species to our area, should be considered for planting near high-value targets,” said Wilson.While catastrophic floods have hit the Asheville region in the past, the large-scale tree failures caused by Helene appear to be unprecedented.“Climate change may have made some trees more vulnerable … and now so much forest around us was destroyed or damaged. That’s a lot of lost CO2and in the city, runoff, erosion and heat issues are real,” Wilson said. The research is being submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.In one northern suburb, homeowner Sari Bellmer lost multiple trees including two large hickories and a 70-year-old red oak, which fell on top of the house, leaving the garden bare, the property exposed.Across the street, power lines and an entire row of cypress trees fell like dominoes. Four months after Helene, a small urban forest behind Bellmer’s house was being bulldozed to make way for new housing.View image in fullscreenHomeowner Sari Bellmer stands in her front yard where a 70-year-old red oak fell on top of the house during the hurricane.“We live on a ridge facing a road and felt protected by the trees, but are now totally exposed to the wind and heat,” said Bellmer, whose business in Marshall also flooded. “We need fast-growth trees to protect the soil and house, but I also want diversity and shade to compensate for the trees lost to Helene – and the new development.”At least 220 people were killed byHurricane Helene, including 104 deaths in North Carolina – mostly caused by floods and falling trees. Many trees were severely damaged or hanging dangerously and needed to be removed. But arborists interviewed by the Guardian also reported an uptick in traumatized residents removing healthy trees that could have been saved – compounding vulnerability to future rain and wind, and removing precious carbon from the soil.In all, more than 800,000 acres of forestland were damaged, and in some cases flattened entirely, throughout 17 counties in westernNorth Carolina. This includes about 20% of the state’s national forest, leaving lots of kindling-like vegetation on the ground that could fuel fires – and fewer trees to slow winds down, according to Norman, who was speaking at a public event in January before Elon Musk fired 10% – 3,400 – of US Forest Service staff.“The fire risk is a huge concern,” warned Norman,Last week the North Carolina forest servicelisted176 fires spanning more than 3,300 acres – the largest in Polk county in the western part of the state.View image in fullscreenApril Wilson, a certified master arborist, drives through a North Asheville suburb pointing to failed tulip trees.“Asheville is absolutely less climate resilient than it was before Helene but this was a wake-up call. Maybe now we will update floodplain maps, implement the 2018 climate resilience assessment and construct more green infrastructure to absorb stormwater on the land left exposed by Helene – and the development boom that’s been happening,” said Alison Ormsby, forest specialist with the non-profit Adventure Scientists and volunteer co-chair of the city’s tree protection taskforce.“We thought this was a climate refuge so this was a huge irony that shattered our sense of security,” Ormsby said.In 2018, Asheville had 44.5% city-wide tree canopy, comparable with other similar cities but this varied hugely with some neighborhoods experiencing higher temperatures due to few trees and the urban heat island effect. Since then urban development has continued apace, yet the city has not updated its tree protection ordinance in 15 years.Amid growing concern about tree loss and unsustainable development, the city last year hired Asheville’s first urban forester – and commissioned a new canopy study and public tree inventory. These important climate resilience initiatives were temporarily suspended when Helene struck.There is no tree baseline for Asheville, making it difficult to know how many had been cut down before the storm.View image in fullscreenTree damage in the Montford neighborhood of Asheville, North Carolina, on Thursday.“We used to be a green city but we had already lost so many trees to development, that Asheville was not as resilient as it could have been when Helene hit. The hurricane absolutely compounded the issue, and we are 100% more vulnerable to climate disasters – to floods, heat and all the other things that trees do for us,” said Chardin Detrich, a master arborist and member of theUrban Forestry Commissionwhich advises the city on tree planting and preservation.“We need to increase diversity of tree cover, plant better, stop cutting down trees …rethink development completely in order to increase resilience of this area moving forward. So far there’s little evidence of the city changing course.”“Asheville has a long track record of recognizing the role sustainability plays in maintaining and improving our community,” said a city spokesperson, Kim Miller. “Public engagement has clearly demonstrated residents’ deep commitment to sustainable rebuilding. Staff is actively pursuing federal and state funds to integrate mitigation strategies into recovery efforts to ensure a more resilient recovery from the disaster.”Explore more on these topicsNorth CarolinaHurricane HeleneHurricanesClimate crisisTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Labour took a 21% share and 16% went to theLiberal Democrats.The findings will fuel debate around the role of the UK’s second chamber and the means used to select its members. Campaigners have called for a ban on political donors becoming peers, and raised concerns about the “privileged access” such donations can buy.Historically, reasons have not needed to be given for political appointments, but the government has recently changed the rules so leaders of political parties must explain future nominations.Guardian analysis shows that 266 peers made a political donation in the period covered by the analysis, with 115 of these donating at least once before they entered the Lords.Analysis of Electoral Commission figures shows:A group of 20 super-donors – all male – have given more than £1m each.Nearly £48m came from donors before they joined the Lords, with 91% of that sum going to theConservatives.Donations after joining the Lords were split more evenly, with 42% given to the Conservatives, 33% to Labour and 25% to the Lib Dems.The top three donors were David Sainsbury, with £25m to Labour and the Lib Dems, and the Conservative supporters Anthony Bamford with £10m and Michael Farmer with £9m.Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “The ongoing link between political party donations and peerages is deeply damaging to trust in parliament and politics more widely. Peers play a public service role, and carrying on being a party donor is incompatible with that role. Donations from current members of the Lords should be stopped immediately.”She called for a ban on political donors becoming peers and an urgent overhaul of the appointments process, with political parties surrendering their power to select peers to a beefed-up House of Lords appointments commission.The commission, set up in 2000 to ensure transparency in the appointments process, vets nominees put forward by the prime minister. It also nominates a small number of people, typically two a year, to sit as crossbench peers unaffiliated with any political party.Cash before honoursPolitical financing within the Lords is dominated by a small group of 20 super-donors – mostly financiers and businessmen – who have given in excess of £1m to the parties they support. Their combined donations of £92m account for the vast majority of the money analysed by the Guardian.That figure includes individuals who donated large sums before being nominated. Parties have collected a total of £48m from donors who went on to join the Lords, with most of that sum coming from just 13 individuals. All but one gave to the Conservatives, and three were former treasurers of the Conservative party, responsible for leading its fundraising.The numbers suggest becoming a major donor is one established route to securing a seat in the Lords.Selling honours is a criminal offence. However, state prosecutors have advised that the law only applies if there is evidence of “an unambiguous agreement” to award a peerage in exchange for a gift. So long as any expectation remains unspoken, neither the donor nor the recipient are breaking the law.A second tier of political donors – those who give between £100,000 and £1m before joining the Lords – have also tended to support the Conservative party. There were 21 of these in the last parliament. Fifteen were Tory benefactors, four wereLabourand two donated to the Lib Dems.In general, super-donors make smaller contributions to the work of the house once inside.Large donors tend to speak less and write fewer questions once in the houseAnalysis shows that peers who gave £1m or more before joining the Lords spoke 20 times on average over the course of the last parliament. That average includes the politically active Michael Farmer, who spoke 204 times. Removing him from the calculation means the rest of this group made an average of four speeches each – fewer than one a year.Members of the £100,000 to £1m club were more likely to contribute in the chamber. They spoke 180 times each on average, compared with 188 times for peers overall.The lord giveth and the lord taketh awayMoney from those writing big cheques before entering the Lords tends to dry up once they secure their seats, the analysis shows. All but one of those who gave more than £1m before being nominated reduced their donations afterwards, when averaging them over time. The exception was the JCB diggers boss Anthony Bamford, who left the Lords last year.Charts showing eight peers’ donations before and after joining the LordsThe Guardian contacted the 13 peers who had donated more than £1m before joining the house. Rami Ranger, the chair of the consumer goods group Sun Mark, said he had not got a peerage for money and that he had “done more for Britain than many”, sharing a list of his business, political and community service achievements.Lord Farmer, a former Tory party treasurer, said he donated in order to further his political values around family life. He said: “Generally, treasurers are given peerages shortly before or when they leave office, with similar pathways in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.”View image in fullscreenStanley Fink was a Tory co-treasurer.Photograph: Chris McAndrew/UK ParliamentThe hedge fund manager Stanley Fink said his donations to the Tory party remained constant outside general elections, where he occasionally gave more. He said: “Truthfully, I received my peerage for being co-treasurer of the party,” and he had never used donations as a means of advancing policies.The businessman Michael Bishop agreed that he had not donated as much since entering the second chamber with the title Lord Glendonbrook. Regarding his speaking record, he said he had Australian and British citizenship and travelled a lot. He said he did not claim attendance allowances.Charts showing five more peers’ donations before and after joining the LordsMichael Spencer, a billionaire businessman and former Tory treasurer, noted there was no state funding of political parties in the UK. He said that although he did not often speak in the Lords, he attended and voted regularly, did not claim expenses, and continued to support the Conservative party financially from time to time.The billionaire Peter Cruddas said he had been appointed to the Lords by Boris Johnson “to support his government to get Brexit done following his election victory” and that he had a strong voting and attendance record in the chamber.View image in fullscreenDavid Sainsbury is the biggest donor currently in the Lords.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe wider group of 20 super-donors also includes peers who have given huge sums since joining. Peers such as David Sainsbury, the former supermarket group chair, whose donations since 2001 outstrip those of any other member. He was Labour’s largest individual donor (£15m), then gave to the Lib Dems (£10m) while Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader, before retiring from the second chamber in 2021.The multimillionaire former Carpetright chair Philip Harris, who became a peer in 1996, donated more than £2.4m to the Conservative party from 2001 onwards before switching sides with a £5,000 gift to Labour last year.The Domino’s Pizza entrepreneur Rumi Verjee donated just over £900,000 to the Lib Dems before being nominated by the party’s former leader Nick Clegg, and went on to give another £1.3m to the party once in the chamber.Waheed Alli, who was last year embroiled in the“passes for glasses”scandal, is also high up the list, donating almost £1m to Labour after becoming a peer.The analysis shines a light on the high value of donations handed to political parties and raises questions about the balance of influence enjoyed by individuals who are major party funders and also legislators.A spokesperson for the campaign group Transparency International said: “It’s clear some parties have an unhealthy and increasing dependency on a small number of very wealthy donors. The privileged access and potential influence money can buy, especially for those donors sitting in our legislature, reinforces the view that politics is a profession reserved for the rich, and inaccessible to ordinary people.”The figures only cover the historical donations of those peers who have sat in the Lords since the 2019 election. That means donations from former peers such as Michael Ashcroft, who has given millions to the Conservative party but who resigned in 2015, are not included in the total.Political parties have only been obliged to publish donations data since the creation of the Electoral Commission in 2001, meaning the Guardian was unable to analyse donations before that date.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debateParty fundingConservativesLabourLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, a patient’s chances of recovery are markedly improved if they undergo a thrombectomy procedure to manually remove the clot within hours of symptom onset.The problem is that there are only 24 hospitals in the UK that can provide thrombectomy treatment, and LVO is difficult to diagnose without a brain scan because many other conditions show similar symptoms.Unless a patient is lucky enough to live near a specialist centre, they will usually be assessed at a general hospital and then transferred. According to national audit data from 2022-23, it takes anaverage of three hoursor more from arriving at a first hospital to arriving at a thrombectomy centre.“Early identification of LVO strokes by ambulance clinicians could offer opportunities for fast-tracking patients to thrombectomy-capable hospitals, avoiding delays to care when taken to other non-specialist hospitals,” said Larissa Prothero, an advanced research paramedic at the East of England ambulance service NHS trust (EEAST), which is involved in thefeasibility study.GraphicThe test, which consists of two lateral flow cartridges, was developed by the Cambridge-based firmUpFront Diagnostics, and is designed to detect two molecules in the blood: The first is a clot-related protein called D-dimer. The second, called GFAP, is associated with bleeding in the brain; its absence helps to rule out a haemorrhagic stroke, where a blood vessel ruptures and bleeds.Earlier studies suggest that the kit can detect LVO within 15 minutes, withabout 90% accuracy. This is “more than double that of current methods used in the ambulance, which involve checking [symptoms]”, said Gonzalo Ladreda, UpFront’s chief executive officer.Dr Louise Flanagan, the head of research for the Stroke Association, which helps to fund the early development of theLVOne test, said: “When it comes to diagnosing a stroke, there’s a window of about four to six hours to deliver a thrombectomy or a thrombolysis [where drugs are used to dissolve the clot], but the faster the better.“Having a rapid test that can be administered by the ambulance crew would mean that that person can get the right treatment for them quicker, which is going to save brain cells and hopefully limit the disability afterwards.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked whether he expected people to believe one had not led to the other, Tice said: “I think people will believe that because there is absolutely no truth in that suggestion.”He told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “The sad reality is Rupert has been doing some great work but there have been too many instances where actually we’ve seen a different character.” On Sky News, Tice said the party’s suspension of Lowe was “not at all” Putinesque.Lowe was stripped of the Reform whip on Friday afternoonafter the party issued an extraordinary statementmaking a string of allegations against him.The statement said Lowe faced bullying allegations from two women who had worked for him, with complaints made to parliamentary authorities, and that he had separately verbally threatenedReform’s chair, Zia Yusuf, with violence, which had been reported to the police. The party said it had appointed an independent KC to investigate the bullying claims. Lowe has vehemently denied the allegations.It came the day after Lowe had given aninterview to the Daily Mailin which he complained that under Farage, Reform remained a “protest party led by the Messiah”. He also said it was “too early to know whether Nigel will deliver the goods” and become prime minister.In competing articles for the Sunday Telegraph, Lowe and Farage launched fresh broadsides. Lowedescribed the allegations against him as a “witch-hunt”and said there was a “complete inability for the Reform leadership to even accept the most mild constructive criticism”.In a lengthy statement on X on Sunday, Lowe said the two female employees who had made complaints against him only did so “once disciplinary proceedings had started against both of them for serious offences”.He said there was “no credible evidence against me of any bullying whatsoever”. Lowe also denied ever threatening Yusuf, saying they had simply had a “robust debate” in December.In another statement on X, Lowe claimed Farage was unhappy with him expressing support for mass deportations. “If you are here illegally, you should be deported. That has to be the objective. If that results in one million plus deportations being the eventual aim? Then so be it,” he wrote, adding that he had been “warned by those at the top of Reform about my position on deportations”.In the Sunday Telegraph, Lowe said he had been “entirely frozen out” of the Reform party machinery for months in a “deliberate and calculated way” and that his suspension had been “a cowardly act that undermines our entire cause”.On Sunday evening, the lawyer appointed to investigate claims against Lowe denied making statements that the MP had attributed to them.The lawyer told the BBC: “I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe and his constituency manager.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I have not expressed either ‘dismay’ or ‘shock’ at any time as to the process. Nor have I said ‘there is zero credible evidence against [Mr Lowe]’, let alone said this ‘repeatedly’.”Inhis article, Farage accused Lowe of “unloading a barrage of criticisms against our operations and its main actors” and having “managed to fall out with all his parliamentary colleagues in one way or another” through a series of “outbursts”.Farage suggested Lowe could not control his temper, citing his row with the transport minister Mike Kane after a debate in the Commons chamber in December where the serjeant-at-arms had to intervene. Farage quoted Kane telling GB News “the anger displayed towards me clearly showed a man not in charge of his own faculties”.He implied that Reform had decided to investigate the bullying complaints against Lowe before he criticised his leadership and that this might have prompted his outburst.Tice told broadcasters there was an “unfortunate trend” in Lowe’s behaviour and that the decision to suspend him demonstrated the party was acting professionally. Lowe issued a statement to the BBC in response to Tice’s interview, saying: “If these allegations were so serious, why only remove me from the party the day after I raised reasonable concerns around Reform’s leadership?”Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, said: “We’ve seenRupert Lowelast week say out loud what we all know: that Reform is essentially a protest party with no seriously thought-out policies led by, as Rupert Lowe said, a messianic leader. And how do they respond to that? They respond by essentially smearing him straight afterwards.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageRichard TiceRupert LowenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been fairly decent and Sunday was the warmest day of 2025 so far.”Conditions are expected to gradually cool this week, with spells of rain forecast across the country.Snell added: “It’ll be turning colder across all parts. The south will hang on to milder conditions on Monday, probably around 17C or 18C, but it will be cloudier.“In the north, it’ll be much cooler and bands of patchy rain will move in, and gradually move southwards.”Most of the country will feel the cooler conditions on Tuesday and it is expected to continue through most of the week.Scattered showers are expected in northern and eastern parts, with temperatures in the north reaching between 6C and 8C, and the south forecast between 8C and 9C.Snell said: “Conditions will stay in single figures and it’ll be a cold midweek, particularly when compared with this weekend.“It won’t be a washout and there will be plenty of dry spells. But it’ll be the breeze that keeps those temperatures down.”Friday into Saturday will be more of the same until temperatures start to rise again slightly moving into the weekend.Last year was the 11th year since the 1960s when temperatures of 34.8C were recorded in the UK, and six of them have been in the past decade.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

He will appear at Glasgow sheriff court on Monday. A 15-year-old has also been arrested.Amen lived with his father and sister in the west of Glasgow, which has one of the UK’s largest asylum seeker and refugee communities. He had recently been granted right to remain status by the Home Office.Leading the vigil, Jamie O’Neill, Amen’s support worker at Kingsway Community Connections, said the boy’s friends had approached him with a plan to hold a gathering. Some present wore T-shirts reading “Forever 15” and others released balloons into the clear spring sky to muted applause.View image in fullscreenMourners at the vigil in Danes Drive Park in Glasgow on Sunday afternoon.Photograph: Mike Boyd/PAO’Neill said he had first met Amen, a keen footballer who was “an unpredictable player and very light on his feet”, on the park’s pitch and that last year Amen had taken part in a campaign to save the green space after local people objected to redevelopment plans.He emphasised that the event was a moment for the community to support one another and celebrate Amen, cautioning against speculation on social media.Amen’s father and older sister attended the vigil and O’Neill read out a statement on Amen’s father’s behalf in which he expressed “heartfelt gratitude” for the support his family had received from across the city, which had brought some comfort “despite our overwhelming sadness”.“Amen was a remarkable young man who was loved by everyone that knew him. This city is our home and it is only by working together that we can make it safe,” his statement said. “His death is not only a tragedy for our family but also for the families of those responsible. This cycle of violence must end.”View image in fullscreenAmen had hoped to be a basketball player, a doctor or an engineer, his sister said.Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesAmen’s sister, 17-year-old Delina, told BBC Scotland News on Friday that he had hopes of gaining UK citizenship and becoming either a basketball player, a doctor or an engineer. She said he was a “really sweet person, so kind and so bright”.Amen was a pupil at St Thomas Aquinas Catholic secondary school in Jordanhill. Claire McInally, its headteacher, said he had shown “great promise” and that his death was a “shock to the school community”.DCI Campbell Jackson said: “Our thoughts remain with Amen’s family and friends at this very difficult time.

The Cabinet Office said it would be guided by the principle that no time should be spent on a task where digital alternatives or AI could do it better, quicker and to the same quality.Ministers planning to cut more than 10,000 civil service jobsRead more“It just cannot be right that in some parts of the state we’re still dealing with photocopiers or paper forms, when there are quicker, cheaper and better fixes,” McFadden said in a statement.The plans form part of a wider efficiency drive, with ministers planning tocut about 10,000 civil service roles, although McFadden declined to publicly to commit to a specific figure on Sunday.Alongside the exit processes, senior civil servants who were not meeting standards would be put on development plans, he said, with a view to firing them if there was no improvement within six months.McFadden told the BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the government “will be radical about this”. “We believe in good public provision, that’s why we fought the election … It is part of what we believe in that the state can provide both security and opportunity for people,” he said.“That will guide us in our actions, it’s upfront in our policies, so we will be radical about this, but it’s about getting bang for our buck in terms of the outcomes for the public, it isn’t an ideological approach to stripping back the state.”The government’s efficiency drive has alarmed unions, which have criticised ministers for suggesting civil servants are happy with substandard results.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McFadden said on Sunday that the size of the civil service had ballooned under the Tories – though this was justified partly by Brexit and Covid-19 – and that Boris Johnson had failed to cut numbers despite setting a target.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, admitted his party had let the civil service become “too big” but said Labour’s plans were “weak and anaemic” compared with what the Tories had been planning before they lost the election.Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceLabourPat McFaddennewsShareReuse this content"

It would also look to run trains to Amsterdam.It is planning a high-frequency service, which could launch by the end of the decade. The company is seeking to become the first direct rival toEurostar, which has run services across the Channel for 30 years.WW2 bomb defused on rail tracks near Paris after day of transport chaosRead moreVirgin Group said it intended to raise £300m in equity and £400m in debt, as first reported by the Financial Times.The company founded by the British billionaire Branson said it also planned to be a “cornerstone” investor, helping to provide some of the initial capital required to get the project off the ground.“The cross-Channel route is ripe for change and would benefit from competition,” a Virgin Group spokesperson said.“While Virgin is not committing to launching a service just yet, we are seeking investment from like-minded partners to invest alongside Virgin and we are delighted with the progress made so far.”Meanwhile, the Channel tunnel operator, Getlink, and London’s St Pancras railway station have agreed towork togetheron increasing the number of services between Britain and France, and opening up rail routes to Germany and Switzerland.St Pancras is looking to triple the number of passengers who can travel through at peak times.The partnership, which was announced last month, has been seen as a sign of growing momentum for increasing the frequency of rail links across the Channel between Britain and continentalEurope.In January, the rail regulator for Great Britain, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), forced London St Pancras Highspeed – the company formerly known as HS1 that runs the station –to cut the pricesit charges rail companies for using its track between St Pancras and the Channel tunnel to try to encourage new entrants.Virgin is not the only company considering the London-Paris route. The Spanish rail company Evolyn haspreviously announced plansto start a high-speed service linking the British and French capitals, which is called a “strategic and high-demand” route. Evolyn said in 2023 it had reached an agreement to buy 12 high-speed trains from the French manufacturer Alstom, with the option of acquiring four more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cold spots are defined as points where a vehicle with only 10% of its battery remaining would not be able to reach a site with at least six rapid or ultra-rapid devices.Affected roads range from the A1 north of Peterborough, to the A11 south of Norwich, and several parts of the A38 and A42 north of Birmingham.Several of the cold spots are on vital routes for holidaymakers – who are likely to be the most reliant on top-ups from rapid chargers. They include the A2 on the way to Folkestone, a popular connection to Europe via the Channel tunnel, a huge swath of the A31 and A35 between Southampton and Weymouth, and several parts of the A303 and A30 that are often filled with families on their way via Exeter to Cornwall for summer holidays.The Lake District is also badly served, with the A590 to the south of Cumbria one of the biggest cold spots. The largest cold spot is the A49 running through Hereford and Shropshire.Thenumber of public electric car chargers in the UKis rising faster than the number of electric cars, as companies race to snap up the best spots. There were 75,675 public charge points at the end of February, up by nearly a third compared with a year earlier, according to data company Zap Map.Neveretheless, the rollout has been uneven across the country, withwealthier areas favouredbecause richer drivers are more likely to own electric cars.Robin Heap, Zest’s chief executive, said that while the UK was making excellent progress overall on installing more chargers, the government should also look at addressing densely populated areas without many chargers.He said: “The reality is that most people need convenient access to charging at or near their homes or workplaces to make the switch to electric vehicles.“It is also worth considering whether public funds, such as the £950m rapid charging fund, which currently supports commercially viable motorway service areas, could be more effectively directed towards cold spots on A-roads and local charging solutions for communities that may never attract commercial investment.”Quick GuideMajor A-roads the UK classes as containing at least one EV charging  ‘cold spot’ShowA-road; major towns and cities connectedA1London, Peterborough, Doncaster, EdinburghA11London, Cambridge, NorwichA120Puckeridge, Stansted, Braintree, HarwichA19Doncaster, York, Middlesbrough, NewcastleA2London, Dartford, Rochester, Canterbury, DoverA249Maidstone, Sittingbourne, SheernessA259Folkestone, Hastings, Eastbourne, Brighton, ChichesterA27Southampton, Portsmouth, Brighton, EastbourneA30London, Basingstoke, Exeter, PenzanceA303Basingstoke, Andover, Amesbury, IlminsterA31Guildford, Farnham, Winchester, BournemouthA35Southampton, Bournemouth, Dorchester, HonitonA36Southampton, Salisbury, Bath, BristolA38Bodmin, Plymouth, Exeter, Birmingham, DerbyA40London, Oxford, Gloucester, Brecon, CarmarthenA42Kegworth, Ashby-de-la-ZouchA449Newport, Monmouth, Ross-on-Wye, Worcester, WolverhamptonA458Shrewsbury, Bridgnorth, StourbridgeA46Bath, Stroud, Cheltenham, Coventry, Leicester, LincolnA483Swansea, Ammanford, Llandrindod Wells, WrexhamA49Ross-on-Wye, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Whitchurch, WarringtonA5London, Milton Keynes, Rugby, Telford, ShrewsburyA50Warrington, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby, LeicesterA585Kirkham, FleetwoodA590Kendal, Barrow-in-FurnessA63Leeds, Selby, Kingston upon HullA64Leeds, York, ScarboroughA66Workington, Penrith, Scotch Corner, MiddlesbroughA69Carlisle, Hexham, Newcastle• List of A-roads provided by Department for Transport, February 2025Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Companies have rushed to install chargers on the UK’s motorways, because the demand for ultra-rapid speeds means customers are willing to pay higher prices. But A-roads in some parts of the country have received less attention, in part because they may not be as lucrative.There is also a problem installing chargers on some parts of the road network – even in busy areas – because of a lack of heavy-duty connections to the electricity grid at service stations that can be far from built-up areas.A Department for Transport spokesperson acknowledged there was more to be done, but said the UK was “making great progress, with over 5,250 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers available within just one mile of our strategic roads – a more than 50% increase in a year”.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsMotoringGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingTravel and transportEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, Russian and North Korean troops launched a major offensive, shortly after Donald Trump pulled the plug on military support,intelligence and satellite feedswith Kyiv.Ahead of talks this week between US and Ukrainian representatives in Saudi Arabia, the Russians are closing in on the Ukrainian-held Russian town of Sudzha. They have recaptured villages to the north – Staraya, Novaya Sorochina and Malaya Loknya – as well as other small settlements to the immediate east.There were unconfirmed reports some Ukrainian soldiers had been captured amid heavy fighting. The crucial supply road between Sudzha and Ukraine’s Sumy region is under constant Russian fire.On Monday,Volodymyr Zelenskyywill hold talks with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and on Tuesday, a delegation led by Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, will meet with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and other senior White House officials. Zelenskyy will not take part in the negotiations.The Ukrainian side is likely to propose a peace plan sketched out by Zelenskyy last week featuring a halt to drone and missiles strikes, as well as asuspension of military activity in the Black Sea.So far, however, Vladimir Putin has showed no interest in a ceasefire.On Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled anextraordinary attackby Russian sabotage and assault groups via a gas pipeline. About 100 Russian soldiers spent four days crawling through the 15km-long pipe that leads to Sudzha’s outskirts.Ukrainian airborne assault forces wiped out some of the Russians using artillery strikes soon after they emerged,video footage suggests. “Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,” Ukraine’s military said.It admitted the situation was difficult but under control, with Russia employing North Korean combat units. They include replacement soldiers sent by Pyongyang after the original 11,000-strong North Korean contingent that arrived last November suffered heavy losses.‘They brought it on themselves’: a new low in US-Ukraine relationsRead moreRussia’s ex-president Dmitry Medevdev claimed Kyiv’s forces were nearly surrounded and would soon be driven out. “The lid of the smoking cauldron is almost closed. The offensive continues,” he posted on Telegram.The US appears determined to force further concessions on Ukraine before the talks in Saudi Arabia this week. According toNBC news, Trump wants Zelenskyy to yield territory to Russia and to move towards elections.On Sunday Trump suggested that Ukraine may not be able to survive in the war against Russia even with support from the US.In an interview with Fox News while defending his decision to draw down on support to Ukraine, he said: “Well, it may not survive anyway.”Trump also said that Zelenskyy took money from the US under the Biden administration like “candy from a baby”. He repeated his claim that Zelenskyy was not “grateful” but did describe him as “smart” and “tough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their front line would collapse if I turned it off.”His threat prompted a rebuke from Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who pointed out that his government had a commercial contract with Starlink and paid $50m for Ukraine to access Musk’s satellite internet service.“The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,” Sikorski wrote back on X. Ukrainian engineers are urgently exploring alternatives.According to the FT, negotiations are taking place with four European satellite operators. Replacing Starlink terminals across a 1,000km frontline would take time, the paper noted.Musk later said on Sunday said that no matter how much he disagreed on Ukraine policy, Starlink would never turn off its terminals. “We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,” he wrote on X.More than 20 people have been killed in the last two days by Russian bombs. On Friday, several ballistic missilessmashed into a five-storey residential blockin the eastern Donetsk region, killing 11 civilians and injuring dozens, including three children.Overnight, Ukraine carried out its ownlong-range drone attacksdeep inside Russia. According to Telegram channels, oil refineries in Ryazan and Lipetsk were hit, together with an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia’s Chuvashia Republic.The depot is located more than 900km from the Ukrainian border and was targeted for the first time.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Others have suggested the remaining sewage treatment plant could be affected.In a video announcing the directive,Eli Cohen, Israel’s energy minister, saidthat Israel would use “all means available … to ensure the return of all Israeli hostages” and that Hamas would not remain in Gaza after the war.Hamas accused Israel of “cheap and unacceptable blackmail” over its decision. “We strongly condemn the occupation’s decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine and water,” Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement, adding it was “a desperate attempt to pressure our people and their resistance through cheap and unacceptable blackmail tactics”.Dread haunts Gaza as airstrikes dent hopes of renewed ceasefireRead moreIsrael is seeking to force Hamas to accept an extension until mid-April of the first phase of the ceasefire, which came into effect in mid-January but ended formally last weekend. Israel has already cut off all supplies of goods to the territory, claiming that Hamas was stealing aid and profiting from its distribution.Israel has also intensified strikes in Gaza, while military officials have briefed local and international journalists that preparations for a major offensive are under way.There are daily reports of casualties inflicted by Israeli warplanes, drones or artillery.On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out an airstrike in northern Gaza, which a spokesperson said was aimed at militants “attempting to plant an explosive device in the ground in northern Gaza” near Israeli troops.A day earlier, an airstrike in Rafah in southern Gaza targeted a drone that entered the territory from Israel and a group of suspected militants, according to the IDF.Israel wants Hamas to release more of the 58 hostages the group and its allies in Gaza are believed to be holding. Fewer than half are thought to still be alive. Hamas has rejected any extension and wants an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase, which aims to bring a permanent end to the war and was supposed to directly follow the first phase.Representatives of the group met mediators in Cairo over the weekend, emphasising the urgent need to resume humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory “without restrictions or conditions”.“We call on mediators in Egypt and Qatar, as well as the guarantors in the US administration, to ensure that [Israel] complies with the agreement … and proceeds with the second phase according to the agreed-upon terms,” the Hamas spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, told Agence France-Presse.Hamas’s key demands for the second phase include further releases of Palestinians held in Israeli jails in exchange for hostages, a complete withdrawal of Israel from Gaza, a permanent ceasefire and the lifting of the Israeli blockade.The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said it would send delegates to Doha on Monday to join talks on continuing the ceasefire in one form or another.Complicating the picture further are unprecedented direct talks between the US and Hamas aimed primarily at freeing five US citizens among the hostages still held by Hamas. Only one is thought to be still alive.1:02White House confirms US in negotiations with Hamas – videoTheUS envoy involved in the direct talks, which were revealed by US-based media last week, described on Sunday his meeting with Hamas as “very helpful” and said he was confident a hostage release deal could be reached “within weeks”. Speaking to CNN, Adam Boehler acknowledged it had been “odd” sitting face to face with leaders of a militant Islamist group that the US has listed as a terrorist organisation since 1997, but did not rule out further meetings.Boehler said he understood Israel’s “consternation” that the US had held talks with the group, but said he had been seeking to jump-start the “fragile” negotiations. “I think something could come together within weeks … I think there is a deal where they can get all of the prisoners out, not just the Americans,” he added.January’s truce paused more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza in which virtually the entire population was displaced, swaths of the territory were reduced to rubble and more than 48,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Israel’s military offensive. The war was triggered by Hamas’s surprise attack into Israel in October 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 251 hostages taken.The six-week first phase of the ceasefire led to the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others, for the release of about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.Since Israel subsequently cut off the aid flow, UN rights experts accused the government of “weaponising starvation”.Last week, Donald Trump threatened further destruction of Gaza if all remaining hostages were not released, issuing what he called a “last warning” to Hamas leaders. The US president caused outrage in February when he said the US wanted to overseethe mass displacement of Palestinians in Gazato allow the territory to be reconstructed as the “riviera of the Middle East”. On Sunday Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said that proposal was “taking shape”.Smotrich said the government was planning to establish a “migration directorate” to assist residents of Gaza who wanted to leave the territory permanently.Arab leaders have proposed an alternative plan under which Gaza’s reconstruction would be financed through a trust fund, with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority returning to govern the territory.At a weekend rally in Tel Aviv, family members of Israeli hostages demanded their government fully implement the ceasefire. “The war could resume in a week,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, told the crowd. “The war won’t bring the hostages back home. It will kill them.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Clashes erupted once again on Sunday after security forces were attacked by Assad loyalists at a power plant in Banias, Latakia.To crush the rebellion, the Syrian government called for reinforcements, with thousands of fighters converging on Syria’s coast from all over the country. Though fighters are nominally under the auspices of the new Syrian government, militias still persist, some of which have been implicated in past human rights abuses and are relatively undisciplined.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said thatmore than 1,000 peoplehad been killed in the attack, including 745 civilians, 125 members of Syrian security forces and 148 Assad loyalists.Death tolls from the two days of fighting varied wildly, with a second rights group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) saying 148 civilians were killed by Assad loyalists and 327 civilians and captured militants were killed by Syrian security forces.The Syrian government has not released figures for casualties, and the Guardian has not been able to independently verify the number of deaths.On Sunday, Syria’s transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, said the developments were within “expected challenges” and called for national unity. “We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace; we can live together,” he said in a video circulated by Arab media, speaking at a mosque in his childhood neighbourhood of Mazzah in Damascus.Later on Sunday, the Syrian presidency announced the formation of a seven-person committee, comprising judges and one lawyer, tasked with investigating the killings of civilians and security forces in north-west Syria. The committee, which was formed to “achieve civil peace and uncover the truth”, will issue a report with its findings in 30 days.The US and Russia have asked the UN security council to meet behind closed doors on Monday over the escalating violence, diplomats said on Sunday.The wide-ranging, coordinated assault was the biggest challenge to the country’s Islamist authorities, three months after opposition fighters led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppledBashar al-Assad.The Syrian government has said “individual actions” led to the killing of civilians and that the influx of fighters on the coast had led to human rights violations.An adviser to Syria’s foreign ministry estimated that 4,000 Assad loyalists were involved in the attacks. Videos showed the bodies of Syrian security officers strewn on the streets as well as bodies seemingly buried hastily in a mass grave in the coastal province of Tartus. The Guardian was unable to independently verify the contents of these videos.In his statement, Türk said: “There are reports of summary executions on a sectarian basis by unidentified perpetrators, by members of the caretaker authorities’ security forces, as well as by elements associated with the former government.”The wave of revenge killings, mostly targeting Alawites, by Syrian security forces in Syria’s coastal communities has struck fear into the Alawite community. The Syrian coast is heavily populated by the sect, from which the deposed Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites were not associated with the Assad regime.Videos showed the bodies of dozens of people in civilian clothes piled up in the town of al-Mukhtariya, where more than 40 people were killed at one time, according to the SNHR.Other videos showed fighters in security uniforms killing people point-blank, ordering men to bark like dogs and beating captives. The Guardian was not able to independently verify these videos.A man from the town of al-Sanobar, Latakia, detailed how gunmen killed at least 14 of his neighbours who were all from the Arris family, including a 75-year-old father and his three sons in front of the mother.9:25A journey through the new Syria: what is the future after Assad? – video“After they killed the father and his boys, they asked the mother to take her gold off, or they would kill her,” said the man who was close to the family but spoke under the condition of anonymity for his safety.Another person in Latakia said power and water to the area had been cut off for the past day and they had been sheltering in their house, scared of the militants on the streets. “There’s no water and no power for more than 24 hours. The factions are killing anyone who appears in front of them; the corpses are piled up in the streets. This is collective punishment,” they said.Rights groups said a real commitment to transitional justice and an inclusive government was crucial to preventing Syria from spiralling into a cycle of violence. Syria’s transitional authorities are due to announce a new government this month, which will be scrutinised closely for how representative it is of Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity after this week’s violence.Syria’s new authorities will probably face more difficulties in getting international sanctions lifted, particularly US sanctions, after the wave of violence on Syria’s coast. Damascus has been courting international powers to help its beleaguered economy by removing sanctions, which are seen as one of the main obstacles to the country’s stability.Western powers have stressed that respect for the country’s minority populations will be key to removing economic sanctions.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, condemned the attacks, which he said were committed by “radical Islamic terrorists” and called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable. “The United States stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

She ran the household errands, made sure he remained active and protected him from illnesses.Authorities in Santa Fe revealed on Friday that thecouple had died of natural causes, Hackman from heart disease and Arakawa from a rare viral infection. Arakawa died first, perhaps on 11 February, when she was last seen or heard from. Investigators said in apress conferencethat Hackman, 95, was likely unaware that his wife had died.He would have been alone in the house for days, disoriented and too frail to seek help. His pacemaker last recorded his heartbeat on 18 February, which indicates that he died about a week after his wife.Their decomposing bodies were discovered on 26 February when a maintenance worker called security after no one answered the door. Emergency responders found Arakawa, 65, on the bathroom floor near spilled pills and a medicine bottle. The pills were identified as an unspecified thyroid medication, Tylenol and the high blood pressure medication diltiazem. Her body showed signs of “mummification”, which suggests she had been dead for some time.Zinna, one of their three dogs, was found dead in a crate in a closet. Hackman’s body, wearing slippers, was found in a mudroom near a cane.New Mexico’s chief medical examiner confirmed that Arakawa had succumbed tohantavirus, a rare and often fatal illness contracted from exposure to rodent droppings. Hackman’s Alzheimer’s, combined with his declining physical state, was listed as a contributing factor in his death.“Autopsy examination and a full body postmortem CT examination demonstrated no acute findings of internal or external trauma, and showed severe heart disease including multiple surgical procedures involving the heart, evidence of prior heart attacks, and severe changes of the kidneys due to chronic high blood pressure,” said Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico’s chief medical investigator.Authorities are still waiting for the dog’s necropsy results. During the press conference on Friday, New Mexico state public health veterinarian Erin Phipps said “it is a possibility” that the dog, Zinna, died of dehydration and starvation.The exact details of that final week remain unclear. Friends and neighbors told theNew York Timesabout how the couple had increasingly withdrawn from public life, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic.Arakawa had taken mighty precautions to avoid exposing Hackman to illness. She often wore a mask in public, and surveillance footage from 11 February showed her visiting a Sprouts Farmers Market, a CVS pharmacy and a pet food store in Santa Fe before driving back to their gated community around 5.15pm.After that, she was never seen or heard from again. Investigators believe she stopped checking her emails that evening, and no further communication was recorded, authorities said on Friday.The sheriff’s office found no evidence that anyone had been caring for Hackman besides Arakawa. “There was no food in his stomach, which means he had not eaten recently,” said Jarrell.Hackman’s decline starkly contrasts with the life he had once built. The Oscar-winning actor moved to Santa Fe in the late 1980s after divorcing his first wife, and quickly fell in love with the city’s landscape and artistic community. He had already won an Oscar for his role in The French Connection in 1971 and would later earn another for 1992’s Unforgiven.“I think you can escape anywhere, but I think the beauty of the city – they just loved the area,” Mark Kreusch, a photographer, toldFox Newsafter the couple’s deaths. “Even though he was a bit reclusive, he really loved Santa Fe. It resonated with him.”Arakawa, a classical pianist from Hawaii, met Hackman while working part time at a Los Angeles fitness center. When Hackman forgot his entry card one day, Arakawa refused to let him in. That encounter led to a relationship that bloomed despite their 30-year age difference.“That part never came to mind because they seemed equal in so many ways,” a friend, Susan Contreras, told the New York Times. “She was a personality unto herself.”As time went on, Hackman’s health visibly declined.“Obviously, he was 95, so he was slowing down,” Stuart Ashman, who met Hackman in the late 90s when they served on a committee together at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, toldFox News. “And after Covid, he was more reclusive, protecting his immune system and everything else.”Two of the couple’s family friends, Daniel and Barbara Lenihan, along with their son Aaron, toldPeoplemagazine that Hackman had become “essentially home-bound” in recent times and had “stopped riding his bike through the neighborhood”.“Betsy tried to keep him kind of active and engaged,” said Aaron, adding that Hackman did puzzles and yoga via Zoom daily. “She was still trying to keep him as active and engaged and healthy as possible.”Daniel and Barbara Lenihan noted that in the “last couple of months”, the late actor “was really slipping there”.Gary Sinise, who worked with Hackman on the 1995 film The Quick and the Dead, made a similar observation.“I know once he retired to New Mexico, he was retired. He did not want to come back and get any awards or, you know, go to any Hollywood events or anything like that. He was done, and he was moving on from that part of his life,” Sinise told Fox News.Their privacy, much-valued in Santa Fe, may ultimately have contributed to their tragic deaths.Explore more on these topicsUS newsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Everything has become transactional.”After being asked about the matter repeatedly, von der Leyen said the US was still an ally, although “we have our discussion points without any question”. She said: “From the viewpoint of theEuropean Union, I think it’s a very strong wake-up call.”EU leaders last week pledged todramatically increase military spendingafter von der Leyen presented a €800bn (£670bn) plan to allow member states to take out loans and increase national debts without incurring penalties under the the bloc’s strict fiscal rules.Many member states would like to go further, however, with common borrowing to fund direct grants, rather than loans, to boost defence spending.Asked on Sunday about such proposals, von der Leyen said: “Nothing is off the table. I am open to whatever is necessary.” Such a move would require backing from Germany, which has been opposed to joint defence borrowing under the outgoing coalition government led by Olaf Scholz.The incoming centre-right chancellor, Friedrich Merz, however, has raised hopes of a change of heart in Berlin, after he made a speedy agreement with his Social Democrat coalition partners to change Germany’s constitution to embark on a spending plan for defence and infrastructure.While von der Leyen described the US repeatedly as an ally, EU officials are concerned about Trump, who has suspended US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, derided Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy andappeared tolerant ofVladimir Putin’s deadly bombardment of Ukrainian homes and civilian infrastructure.While von der Leyen spoke of support for Kyiv so Ukraine “can keep on fighting” she did not refer directly to a proposal for short-term military aid from the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. The former Estonian prime minister has called on member states to accelerate efforts to aid Ukraine in 2025, including by delivering “as soon as possible” 1.5m rounds of ammunition, air defence systems and drones among other support.After thelatest devastating attacks on Ukrainethis weekend that killed at least 14 and injured many more, Kallas stepped up her calls for the EU to increase military support “otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price”.Asked about the Kallas proposal and military aid for Ukraine in 2025, von der Leyen said “we will have to step up without any question” and referred to how Kyiv could benefit from the €800bn plan – loans and fiscal flexibilities that have yet to be finalised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One open question is whether these non-EU European countries could be involved in billion-euro defence contracts. Macron is leading a “buy European” policy, but Germany and Poland have signalled greater openness to procuring costly defence equipment from countries outside the bloc.Without giving a definitive answer, von der Leyen appeared to lean to a more open approach. Companies already had strong cross-border ties, she said. “We do not have to reinvent the wheel, we have to think about a smart mechanism, how we can use this cooperation that is already established at a high level of quality.”She stressed that the EU remained wedded to phasing out Russian gas, despite two delays to a plan on achieving this goal. “I commit very clearly to phasing out the Russian gas,” she said. “This is an absolute must.”Europe bought a record18.8m tonnes of Russian liquefied natural gasin 2024, despite a steep decline in imported pipeline gas, coal and oil.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is my decision,” the journalist wrote on X, after the radio station suspended him from air for a week.On 25 February he said on air: “Every year in France, we commemorate what happened inOradour-sur-Glane– the massacre of an entire village. But we have committed hundreds of these, in Algeria. Are we aware of this?”He was referring to the village where an SS unit returning to the front in Normandy massacred 642 residents on 10 June 1944. Leaving a chilling memorial for future generations, the village was never rebuilt.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a Peugeot 202 car in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, France.Photograph: David Forster/AlamyChallenged by the anchor over whether “we [the French] behaved like the Nazis”, Aphatie said: “The Nazis behaved like us.”On X, he acknowledged his comments had created a “debate” but said it was of great importance to understand the full story over France’s 1830-1962 presence in Algeria, saying he was “horrified” by what he had read in history books.After being suspended for a week by the channel it means that “if I come back to RTL I validate this and admit to making a mistake”.“This is a line that cannot be crossed.”His comments had prompted a flurry of complaints to audio-visual regulator Arcom, which has opened an investigation.France’s conduct in Algeria during the 1954-62 war that led to independence and previous decades remain the subject of often painful debate in both countries.Historians from both sides have over the last years documented numerous violations including arbitrary killings and detention carried out by French forces and the history still burdens French-Algerian relations to this day.The far right in France has long defended French policies in those years with Algeria War veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the National Front (FN) party and died earlier this year, drawing much support from French settlers who had to return after independence.Explore more on these topicsFranceAlgeriaSecond world warAfricaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s offer of talks won’t ease itPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorWith internal politics at their most unstable for years, the risk of escalation is risingSun 9 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTShareThe letter the US president, Donald Trump, says he sent to Iran’s leadershipoffering to reopen talkson the country’s nuclear programme comes at a point when Iranian domestic politics is at its most unstable for years.In the past month, the conservative-dominated parliament has asserted its power over the broadly reformist president elected last June by impeaching and sacking the experienced economy minister, Abdolnaser Hemmati, while Mohammad Javad Zarif, the vice-president and most prominent reformist, has also beenforced out.Both power plays were clearly made against the wishes of the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, but with the economy reeling under the pressure of US economic sanctions, the 85-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has clearly decided against rescuing Pezeshkian.The parliament, feeling it is on a roll, is now summoning a further group of 11 ministers to ask them 49 questions about their performance in what looks like an attempt to harass Pezeshkian’s government into further submission.Rumours that Pezeshkian, an emotional man who sets store by integrity, will soon resign have been rife. His departure would confirm that the deep state, or what some inIrancall the shadow government, will not tolerate a loss of power.If he does go, he has made it clear whom he would hold responsible. In a remarkably candid speech, he finally asserted himself, saying he had favoured negotiations with the west, but the supreme leader had rejected them, so “it’s over and done”.“My position has been and will remain that I believe in negotiations, but now we have to follow the parameters set by the supreme leader,” Pezeshkian said. “When the supreme leader sets a direction, we must adapt ourselves to it. In order to adapt, we must try to find a way.“From the day we took over the government, we were confronted with deficiencies in energy, water and power, and on the other hand extreme debts on payments to the agriculture sector for wheat, the health and medical sector, and retirement salaries and so on.”Similarly, he said his efforts to relieve women of the pressure to wear the hijab had been constantly challenged. On Saturday he issued a further apology over the lack of energy supplies.View image in fullscreenQatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, fears an attack on Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant would threaten water supplies.Photograph: Amer Hilabi/AFP/Getty ImagesA lot of this manoeuvring, ostensibly about economic mismanagement and poverty, is in reality a broader battle over relations with the west, with the conservatives convinced that experience shows Trump and Israel, his ally, are not just untrustworthy, but bent on regime change in Iran.Pezeshkian had argued in the election that Iran could end its confrontation with the west and still remain independent.If Trump’s letter has now set onerous conditions for talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, the conservatives will feel vindicated in saying the price Washington demands is too high. But if Tehran rejects Trump’s approach, Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites then becomes more imminent.The biggest constraint on such an attack may not be Iran’s many threats of reprisals – Israel thinks it has destroyed Tehran’s air defences – but from the arguments of the Gulf states. The level-headed prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, gave a chilling interview to Tucker Carlson warning that if Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant were attacked and radioactive material seeped into the Gulf, within three days none of the countries in the region would have drinking water. They all depend on desalination for their water supply. Not just fish but life in the region would be destroyed, he said.So far, Iran’s professional diplomats have held the line by saying they will not negotiate with America directly. This keeps open the possibility of indirect talks mediated by Russia, a variation on the wearisome form of negotiations staged in Vienna under the Biden administration that failed to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. The offer might buy Iran some time.The consensus inside Iran is that Trump’s letter is timed as a piece of psychological warfare designed to force Tehran into rejection, deepening Iranian divisions about its strategy, and taking the crisis between the west and Iran to the final, ­climactic, level.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeThe ObserverIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The actor John Kani paid tribute on X on Sunday, saying “I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend”. The mayor’s office in Cape Town said: “Athol Fugard was not just a luminary in the world of theatre; he was a teller of profound stories of hope and resilience aboutSouth Africa.”A major political dissident playwright of the 20th century, Fugard wrote more than 30 dramas including Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act (in 1972) and“Master Harold” … and the Boys(1982). Both of those drew upon the time in the 1950s when he could only find employment as a clerk in one of the courts where black South Africans were charged (and inevitably convicted) of breaches of the “pass laws”, designed to control the movements of a racially segregated population under the apartheid system. There, he witnessed hourly the dehumanisation of those who had chosen the “wrong” streets or people.Athol Fugard caught the impact of apartheid’s full-on attack on humanity | David LanRead moreFugard’s cultural and political impact was rivalled elsewhere only by the dramas ofVáclav Havelin what was then Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Havel was jailed and, when released, abandoned theatre to become the first president of the Czech Republic. Fugard – despite setting up two theatre companies in the segregated black townships and courageously refusing to play to the state-mandated “whites only” audiences – avoided prison, due to being white and therefore not a primary target of the racist government. The worst direct personal persecutions Fugard suffered were the removal of his passport and the occasional banning of plays and burning of books. He was always conscious, though, of benefiting from the immoral hierarchy his writing decried.View image in fullscreenDuty of education … Athol Fugard.Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianThe writer’s race would also have made him an impossible political leader in the new Republic of South Africa: its dissident turned president in the Havel manner wasNelson Mandela, who had a strong background presence in Fugard’s plays, especiallyThe Island(1972), set on Robben Island, the penitentiary for political prisoners where Mandela had spent some of his 27 years of incarceration.Born in 1932, Fugard was the only child of Harold, from an immigrant family of Irish descent, and Elizabeth, whose Potgieter clan were among the early Afrikaans settlers of Dutch stock. A jazz pianist turned shopkeeper, Harold moved his family in 1935 to Port Elizabeth, an urban industrial town that remained Fugard’s main home and most regular dramatic setting for the next nine decades.During his childhood, the family ran a hotel and cafe in Port Elizabeth where “Hally” (as the young Athol was known) grew up. There, as a teenager in the late 1940s, an incident occurred that would lie at the heart of his psychology and creativity. In published extracts from his notebooks, Fugard explained how Sam Semela, a black employee in the family businesses, became “the most significant – the only – friend of my boyhood years”. But, after a “rare quarrel”, Hally pulled racial rank and spat in Semela’s face.While confiding to his journal that he would never be able to “deal with the shame that overwhelmed me the second after”, Fugard made literary recompense with “Master Harold” … and the Boys, its title acknowledging a racist hierarchy between white people and their servants that is overturned by a devastatingly apologetic depiction of how the demon of superiority can rise even in the mind of someone who defines as a liberal: the spitting scene is its climax. One of the dedicatees of the published play is “Sam”, with whom Fugard had been reconciled.Public admission of this shaming story was typical of Fugard’s personal honesty, but can also be seen as an attempt to forestall any “saint” or “saviour” interpretation of his work. The contemporary pejorative term “white saviour”, with its implication of credit stolen and virtue claimed, was not yet widely used, but, once it was, Fugard faced retrospective accusation.A complication arose with the working methods of the AfricanTheatreWorkshop and Serpent Players, two multi-racial companies Fugard and his wife, Shiela (also a writer) formed either side of 1960, first in Johannesburg and then Port Elizabeth. Early Fugard plays such as No-Good Friday (1958), Nongogo (1959) and The Coat (1966) improvised scenes with actors based on their own experiences and then created a fixed text for performance.View image in fullscreenSean Taylor and Owen Sejake in The Train Driver by Athol Fugard at Hampstead theatre in 2010.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs a major Fugard scholar, Professor Dennis Walder, has pointed out, it was yet another horror of the system that the writer could only work with colleagues of colour at his home by registering them, for bureaucratic purposes, as his domestic staff.Fugard’s desire to collaborate with the wronged community, rather than writing anti-apartheid stories from an isolated study in a white area (a criticism of some contemporaries), can reasonably be seen as another compensating response to the Sam shame. But a majority black co-operative run by a white man subsequently raised issues of “appropriation” to which Fugard was alert: editions of The Island and its companion play,Sizwe Banzi Is Dead(1972), in which someone takes on the identity of a dead man in order to use his “pass book” (ID papers), have the credit “devised by Athol Fugard,John KaniandWinston Ntshona”, with royalties split three ways.The circumstances in which Fugard’s early plays were made now sound like something from dystopian fiction. The South African police would raid rehearsals, check scripts and take the names of actors; it became standard for performers to be listed in programmes and on posters under the identities of fictional characters they had previously played.The end of apartheid and Mandela’s presidency removed, from 1994, what the novelistNadine Gordimerhad called “the only subject” for white liberal writers in South Africa. Fugard, though, wrote plays that effectively reflected the country’s “truth and reconciliation” phase of attempted restorative justice.InThe Train Driver(2010), his strongest late work, the white title character seeks out the family of a black mother and child who died when they stepped in front of his train; inSorrows And Rejoicing(2001), the family of a dead, white anti-apartheid writer reflect on the evasions of his life.That Fugard continued as a dramatist even when the driving cause of his first plays was achieved was due to the incompleteness of the victory. Whereas anti-Soviet dramas now have only historical interest – as relative democracy has continued in Russia’s former bloc – the 2021revival of Fugard’s Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act, at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, remained disconcertingly relevant.While the specific evil it dramatised – the ban on interracial sex in South Africa from 1927 to 1985 – was gone, the play now served a new purpose: a metaphor for the continuing inequalities of opportunity and security suffered by people of colour around the world. The unexpected longevity of Statements continued a paradox that ran through Fugard’s career: situations that he detested as a citizen were his dramatic fuel.Parents leaving the London production of Statements could be heard explaining to appalled children that the immorality laws had existed in a Commonwealth country during the lifetime of anyone older than 36. That duty of education will keep Fugard’s plays in the theatrical canon, as will the broader lessons of Statements, “Master Harold” … and the Boys and The Island in how racism roots and grows. His 1980 novel Tsotsi, about crime in Johannesburg, was adapted as an Oscar-winning 2005 film, directed by Gavin Hood.Fugard would have been the first to acknowledge that others, such as Kani and Ntshona, were the theatrical Mandelas of free South Africa, but the man who called himself “a classic example of the impotent, white liberal” was an epitome of the good people who, inHannah Arendt’s formulation, must act if evil is not to prevail.Explore more on these topicsAthol FugardTheatreSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA) are best friends and roommates in a cheap and cheerful apartment in LA’s Baldwin Village. But then Alyssa’s feckless boyfriend spends the rent money and the women have until the end of the day to raise the cash.With its zingy colour palette and effervescent, unapologetically uneven storytelling, the film has a buoyant, almost cartoonish quality (albeit one laced with lip-smacking, sexually explicit dialogue). What elevates this raucous romp by music video director Lawrence Lamont is the crackling energy between Palmer (Nope) and singer SZA, making her acting debut here. Dreux also gets a love interest, in the shape of a mysterious hunk named Maniac (Patrick Cage). But Dreux and Alyssa, with their sparky chemistry and crisp comic sparring, is the only relationship we care about.In UK, Irish and Australian cinemasWatch a trailer for One of Them Days.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsThe ObserverSZAreviewsShareReuse this content"

This, at least, is the hope of the publishing industry this spring, as it welcomes news that sales of children’s comics and graphic novels have reached an all-time peak of almost £20m in Britain.While publishers and editors are celebrating this boom for its own sake, the popularity of these titles is also being hailed as a good omen for novels, ahead of the London Book Fair at Olympia this week. “Over the last decade we’ve seen a significant rise in sales of graphic novels for both the adult and children’s markets,” said Philip Stone, media analyst at NielsenIQ BookData, as he revealed details of the latest trends, hits and flops this weekend.“Superhero books have been a reliably big feature, probably boosted by all the screen superhero movies. A lot of manga series are doing very well again, and this may also be linked to screen versions. What we really need now is some deep-dive research into the impact of graphic and comic fiction as a gateway for young people into reading. We certainly suspect it’s true.”Among the major hits to lure the readers of the future with comic-style stories are paperback-sized titles such as theDiary of a Wimpy Kidseries by Jeff Kinney, and Jamie Smart’sBunny Vs Monkeybooks.Smart said: “As a creator, comics are one of the greatest ways to tell a story. You get to show the reader everything that’s inside your mind, how a scene looks, who the characters are, what they’re doing, all the subtleties and nuances of their behaviours, and you hold all that within the space of a single panel. Then you do it again, and again, propelling the story forwards, unfolding entire worlds in front of your audiences. And when you’re given that freedom to tell a story exactly how you imagine it, I think readers really respond to that.”The appetite for books in graphic form comes after the National Literacy Trust confirmed thedecline in children’s general reading habitslast November. It found that just one in three children and young people aged eight to 18 enjoyed reading in their free time, with enjoyment levels decreasing by 8.8 percentage points in the past year.Undaunted, Smart will attend the book fair as its first “creative” in residence this week, a sign of his industry status. He is convinced children are beguiled by books that avoid making them feel they are doing something overtly educational.“A good story well told is worth its weight in gold, and comics are no exception,” said Smart. “We’re seeing that now, especially with younger readers and reluctant readers, who are all drawn in by the bright visuals and funny characters, before becoming carried along by the stories, and then forming lifelong bonds with these books. Something quite magical is happening at the moment. It’s really exciting to see.”In truth, the demand for grown-up fiction needs little encouragement. In print it continues to drive sales across all the markets Nielsen looked at. The top-performing fiction titles were all written by women, such as Colleen Hoover’sIt Ends With Us, Rebecca Yarros’sFourth WingandIron Flame, Sally Rooney’sIntermezzo, and Freida McFadden’sThe Housemaid. Notably, the thriller writer LJ Ross has significant popularity in the north of England, becoming the second most popular fiction author in the region, ahead of everyone except McFadden.Fiction hardbacks also achieved the largest sales by value in Britain on record, with six titles selling more than 100,000 units on their own. “Fiction is a little cheaper, which may be an element,” said Stone. “It’s also offers pure escapism, which people may be seeking now.”In contrast, non-fiction is “having a tough time”, with the lowest sales figures in about 20 years. Stone ascribes this continuing slump partly to cost and partly to the internet. “There’s a lot of free content out there in the non-fiction area. We used to see personal development titles doing very well, but it’s fallen away a bit. Religious books are up, though,” he said.Last year, the first university-led research programme into the impact of comics on literacy showed that superheroes may be saving us from more than supervillains: they also seem to turn young people into enthusiastic readers. The study project, funded by Comic Art Europe and conducted by researchers at Manchester University in collaboration with the annual Lakes International Comic Art Festival, ran for two years at Abraham Moss community school in north Manchester. Fifty students took part in the comics literacy programme, while 50 others functioned as a control group.According to the school’s own measurements, the average reading age of the class involved in the comics intervention rose by 18 months in the year after the workshops started, in contrast to a rise of 11 months in the other group.The number of children who listed reading as one of their favourite leisure activities also doubled in the intervention group, while falling in the comparison group.Explore more on these topicsComics and graphic novelsThe ObserverPublishingChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

On the bill was the colourful pastoral L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, in which wit and jollity look set to gain the upper hand before Handel decides to put a dampener on things by insisting on moderation in everything.Faced with a shortage of Italian singers in 1740, the composer went full English, laying aside ideas for Messiah “to please the Town with something of a gayer Turn.” His librettist, James Harris, interwove Milton’s poem L’Allegro (The Happy Man) with the contrasting Il Penseroso (The Melancholy Man), before adding a codicil at the composer’s request in the form of Il Moderato (The Moderate Man). The result, which ends with a paraphrase on Shakespeare’s The Tempest, may feel a bit of a mashup, but it provided Handel with irresistible opportunities for turning vivid imagery into equally vivid music. Remarkably, he knocked the whole thing out in just 14 days.Cohen seized upon the score with relish, his keen dramatic instincts ensuring bright tempi while knowing just when to give his singers room to spread their wings. Arcangelo, their plush sound underpinned by chamber organ and two harpsichords, responded with crisp, spirited playing and noteworthy solo contributions. The incisive, 18-strong choir sang with imposing power.Three singers represented L’Allegro, led by Stuart Jackson whose fluid tenor, expressive diction and theatrical nous really brought Handel’s multihued music to life. Haste Thee, Nymph with its infectious laughter was a hoot, and he brought an egotistical swagger to I’ll to the Well-trod Stage Anon. Paulina Francisco’s vivacious soprano was a ray of sunshine, with Adam Plachetka’s boisterous baritone offering insistent, though slightly dour support.As Il Penseroso, Rachel Nicholls, a late replacement for Louise Alder, faced challenges with muddy diction and the voice not always ideally steady. But the night belonged to Cohen. With Arcangelo lighting up the baroque interior of St George’s Hanover Square, Handel’s own parish church, you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife.TheLondon Handel festival continues in various venues, until 10 AprilExplore more on these topicsClassical musicGeorge Frideric HandelreviewsShareReuse this content"

Outraged, he writes to Martin himself and Martin writes back.So Dave and Martin begin as pen-pals before becoming real-life pals when Dave starts visiting – and inexplicably relying on Martin’s guidance for matters of love and romance.Madeleine Brettingham’s play about a psychopath-behind-bars and a naive visitor in his thrall is written in a darkly comic vein, and contains the promise of unpicking masculine friendship as well as sending up the groupies who flock around high-profile criminals in the true crime genre.Brettingham, better known for writing TV comedies for Frankie Boyle and Mitchell and Webb among others, treats the subject of mental health and male vulnerability lightly and without enough real bite.It is tightly directed by Wiebke Green but plays out larkily and nothing quite makes sense, even within the logic of the absurdist setting (Kit Hinchliffe’s spare stage design is a wash of psychiatric white).Dave is too gullible, the story flimsy to the point of silliness, the characters too broad-brush. The barbarity of Martin’s crime is only hinted at and his manipulations of Dave are entirely unbelievable. None of it has the complexity that makes this story of masculine crisis, mental health and criminality in any way meaningful.So you are left with the funny moments, of which there are a few, and some performances entertain, too: Alex Mugnaioni, as Martin, is darkly charming and Mephistophelean. Edward Judge, as Martin’s fellow inmate, is the cliche of a smiling, simpleton and Dave, played by Ben Simpson, is so gullible that he seems childlike, but Amelia Donkor is accomplished in switching between multiple characters.“We are all psychopaths deep down,” says Martin. Are we? The play does not go any way to proving that. Where it takes hold is in the dangerous face-offs between Martin and his psychiatrist (Donkor). A mutual hostility builds and bears the potential for a darker and more serious play.Brettingham’s talent for funny writing is clear and the production has all the signs for a sharper, darker play imprisoned within this one.AtArcola theatre, London, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he’s awaiting trial, accused of kidnap, trafficking and rape. Here, one of his victims reveals how she broke freeSun 9 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareFrom the outside, TaraYogaCentre looks like a normal, welcoming yoga studio. A pleasant building in an expensive east London postcode, with another popular branch on an Oxford high street. There are positive, even gushing, Google reviews. The website is professional, with photos of smiling people stretching on matching purple yoga mats. It promises “rapid and integral transformation”, as well as “an invitation to awaken now”.When Miranda, from Oxford – who has asked to go only by her first name – was in her late 20s, she visited India to practise yoga. It was 2015 and yoga was already a booming industry in the UK. She was working as an English teacher at a London school and gravitated to yoga for the same reason that it’s recommended by health bodies from the World Health Organization to local GPs: healing, exercise and mental wellbeing.Miranda found that practising daily offered a sense of calm: “It could move a stressful day into something more manageable and the philosophical perspectives helped me to consider that things happen for a reason, to process difficult life events with more ease than before.” So she booked another course, in Thailand, focused on Tantric yoga, which encouraged her to love her body and embrace her femininity. On returning to the UK, she Googled “Tantric yoga”. Tara Yoga Centre appeared.Tara Yoga’s classes are marketed as “esoteric Tantra” – more about inner work than improving your sex life, with a focus on realising your own potential. Miranda started to attend weekly sessions. The people were friendly, intelligent, open-minded – as is Miranda when we talk on the phone; someone curious about spirituality, while also being matter-of-fact. When she was informed about a three-day Tara Yoga retreat in the spring of 2018, it instantly appealed and she packed her bags for Somerset.View image in fullscreen‘It’s an altered state or euphoria – like coming up on a drug, but because it’s natural, it feels controlled.’Photograph: Naila Ruechel/The ObserverMiranda remembers the experience. She meditated a lot, entering what she describes as “an altered state or euphoria – like coming up on a drug, but because it’s natural, it feels controlled”. She attended lectures. She saw other students undress as they gave performances and simulated Tantric massage. “That shocked me: the level of casual nudity in the dances and performances, seeing my teachers performing on stage naked.” She decided not to engage in nudity herself, at times feeling objectified by the men on the retreat. But the experience was also exhilarating. “There’s an intensity, it’s like going to a festival,” Miranda recalls. “There was a small group of us, but we were all there for the same reason and with the same intention… That can be addictive.”After the retreat, Miranda began dating one of the teachers and was drawn into the Tara Yoga “inner circle”. The teachers spoke about their guru, Gregorian Bivolaru, and his organisation, the Movement for Spiritual Integration into the Absolute (Misa). Intrigued, she went on more retreats, including one in Costinești, Romania, organised by Misa, where students of Tara Yoga and other international yoga schools came together – it was huge, with group meditation and dancing at night. At times, she thought, “This seems a bit weird”, especially the regular playing of soft porn films, but there were 6,000 other people there, so she kept the faith. (In a statement, Misa claims there is a “clear and huge difference between porn and erotic movies” that “depict elevated, pure, artistic aspects”.)“I thought, ‘Maybe these people know something I don’t or something I can’t explain’,” says Miranda. After all, it was this desire for a connection to something bigger than herself that had attracted her in the first place. And so, she threw herself in.What she did not know then was that Bivolaru was wanted by Interpol. Tara Yoga teachers had advised Miranda not to look him up online; his questionable reputation had been briefly explained to her as persecution on behalf of the Romanian government, where he was born and began teaching yoga in the 1970s before founding Misa in 1990. A few years later, she would learn that, after charges of tax evasion, sexual exploitation and human trafficking in his home country in 2016, he fled first to Sweden, then into hiding in France. And that later, after extradition and imprisonment for sex with a minor, he returned to France, still wanted by the Finnish government as the leader of an international trafficking organisation.After extradition and imprisonment for sex with a minor, Bivolaru returned to FranceBivolaru – or“Grieg” as many of his followers call him – is not the only self-styled yoga guru to have faced abuse allegations. Sri K Pattabhi Jois, an Indian guru who popularised Ashtanga vinyasa yoga, died in 2009. After his death, he was accused by dozens of students of sexual misconduct. The charismatic Indian-American guru Bikram Choudhury created a trademarked brand of hot yoga, with 650 studios worldwide at its 2010s peak. Allegations of rape and sexual assault at Choudhury’s yoga training camps led to the downfall of his empire, as detailed in the 2019 documentaryYogi, Guru, Predator. A 2021 report by the BBC, meanwhile, uncovered multiple reports of abuse at Canadian sites for the Sivananda Yoga School led by Swami Vishnudevananda. Often in these cases, sexual abuse was shrouded as the correcting of posture, an aligning of chakras or explained away in the name of Tantra.“Yoga teachings are traditionally transmitted from guru to student. So setting oneself up as a guru figure, you have a lot of authority,” explains Peter Tyldesley, CEO of the charityBritish Wheel of Yoga. “There is a need to follow a teacher’s instructions and safety depends on that person being of good character.” This is not always the case, he points out, and it doesn’t help that yoga is also an unregulated industry, meaning no qualifications are legally required for teachers. “It’s very easy to set up as a yoga teacher and that leads to all sorts of risks, like abuse or sexual exploitation, but also of injuring people if a teacher is not well trained in anatomy and physiology.” When wellness links sex to spiritual growth, this potential vulnerability to coercive control can be heightened, he adds. Consent can be blurry, abuse more prevalent.Tantra is not necessarily sexual by nature, Tyldesley explains, “Classical Tantric yoga has its roots going back as far as 1,500 years to the Indian subcontinent and was quite revolutionary.” If, as a spiritual practice, yoga was essentially a monastic pursuit, Tantric yoga was a branch of the practice that could fit into a person’s day-to-day life. “The idea was that everything you do can be part of your physical spiritual journey, preparing food or caring for children, or even sexuality.” Yet the common association between Tantra and sex was strengthened through its more recent exportation to the west. Here, “neotantra” emphasises presence in sexual encounters; harnessing and directing one’s sexual energy.At Tara, this style of yoga was positioned to Miranda as a route to feeling more love, connection and positivity, as well as a way to reach what was labelled “pure eros” – coming into your sensual power without shame. Speaking about negative things or criticising yourself and others was frowned upon. “It was a good-vibes-only kind of mentality,” Miranda explains. “Some of that comes from yogic philosophy, but it’s been exaggerated. You see it everywhere on social media – reels, memes and soundbites about positivity bordering on toxic. Tara Yoga took it to the extreme.” In hindsight, she says, “These thought patterns cause you to overlook your own boundaries, especially when it comes to trusting ourselves.” Yet the idea of letting go of your existing beliefs to become happier and more enlightened was appealing: the idea that you can manifest your way to a better life.These thought patterns cause you to overlook your own boundariesIn late 2019,still attending Tara for yoga classes, Miranda was told about its sister centre, a Tantric massage “temple” near the London yoga studio. Other teachers and senior members of the Tara Yoga community were working there, or had previously, and spoke about how good it was for their spiritual journey, encouraging Miranda to follow suit. “The temple was part of the indoctrination,” Miranda now believes, “whereby sex work is seen as spiritual; a service for the uplifting of the clients and your own spiritual growth.” Sometimes it felt “a bit seedy”, but Miranda was told, repeatedly, that the topless sacred massages she was instructed to give were healing and part of the selfless service without reward that is emphasised within Karma yoga, a justification that led her to stay for three months, working ad hoc, for below minimum wage.After her stint at the “temple”, Miranda quit her part-time teaching job and embarked on another retreat in Hungary that she had been told about at a Tara Yoga seminar, where the focus was creativity.ArtExtasia, as its website (still live) explains: “is a daring project with the goal to give art back its divine rights”. Miranda stayed for a number of months, falling out of touch with family and friends. She practised yoga and meditation daily, consumed by the teachings of Bivolaru. That is, until two Tara Yoga students informed Miranda that she had the opportunity to meet Bivolaru and undergo what was called by her peers “the initiation”. She sensed this would be sexual, but explains: “I’d been told by my teachers that this would be a spiritual turning point for me, a transformative experience.”Talking about this time is difficult for Miranda. Her voice, clear and level until now, wobbles. She was driven to Paris to meet Bivolaru in 2019, then asked to hand in her phone, credit cards and passport at a holding house, where she shared a room with dozens of other women, from various countries, who came and went. She asked herself, “What would I do if I wanted to leave?” but did not feel able to take this step. She was convinced that backing out of meeting Bivolaru would see her ostracised from the community that was now her world.After two weeks, Miranda was blindfolded and driven to another location, Bivolaru’s small, grimy Parisian apartment. Here, he opened the door in a dressing gown, older and more dishevelled than she’d imagined. For three days in a blacked-out room, she was made to wait. “There were between four and six of us. We did our yoga practice as best we could, watched DVDs and read books. We slept on a mattress on the floor that we moved during the day and on bunk beds.” Bivolaru was shouting at people, Miranda remembers, for instance, for using the wrong towel. There was, she describes, “a feeling of a low-level threat”.Over about 72 hours, other women were summoned by Bivolaru to a second bedroom. Then it was Miranda’s turn. The “initiation” involved a long sexual encounter with Bivolaru, in seven positions that were supposed to reflect the seven chakras (Tantra teaches that the chakra is seven energy points in the body). Miranda remembers feeling that she was not attracted to Bivolaru and did not want to go through with it, but told herself not to be shallow. Internally, she recited mantras to try to endure the experience. “I would say I was also pretty detached from the physical, at this point: ‘I’m here now, I have to get through this.’ There was a fair amount of dissociation going on.”Miranda remembers feeling that she was not attracted to Bivolaru and did not want to go through with itAfterwards, Miranda was taken to a house in Prague. This was described as another period of “spiritual practice”. In fact, this meant being pressured to work in webcamming. As had been the case up until now, channelling “Shakti” the female goddess, through sexuality, was positioned as empowering. “Ultimately this was used to encourage us to make them a profit through sex work.”The women there, including Miranda, were told they were in debt for their food and accommodation, as well as for their travel so far to various retreats and needed to work to pay for it, a common tactic used by traffickers to exploit their victims. Only after six months was she permitted to leave. First, she returned to Hungary and then to London in February 2020. Finally, Miranda was home, her path to “enlightenment” on pause.The term “cultof wellness”has been used to describe the false promises of the wellness industry:Take this pill and you’ll feel better, buy this class to be your best self, meditate your way to happiness. It also speaks to how wellness practices can quickly evolve from a physical or health pursuit to inflecting or even warping one’s outlook on the world.Think of the well-trodden wellness-to-anti-vaxxer pipeline, where fitness influencers were some of the most prominent voices to share Covid conspiracies online. In her bookDoppelganger, Naomi Klein investigates this link between fitness, yoga and wellness “gurus”, and misinformation. “So many of those fit and beautiful influencers stopped merely offering encouraging words to motivate our workouts and green juicing,” she writes, “and started whispering to us alarmingly about dark forces coming to poison us and eventually to gag, jab and dominate us.”Now, Miranda has come to see the Tara Yoga and Misa communities as not just part of the cult of wellness, but as a literal cult. This realisation only occurred with time and space away from Bivolaru’s followers back in London: the opportunity to be around people who questioned her experiences and hours spent watching YouTube videos on how cults work. At first, she was resistant to the idea, then began to unpick how it had happened, gradually – the familiar mechanisms of indoctrination, including thought reform and isolation. Those who questioned things in classes, says Miranda, were shamed. Misa strenuously denies this was the case. “People who actively participated and pushed boundaries were applauded,” she remembers. Most of all, each step was positioned as the next step to liberation. “The efficient way to get someone to do what you want is to make them believe they are there out of their own choice or for some higher purpose, whether that’s money for their family or their own spiritual good.”The efficient way to get someone to do what you want is to make them believe they are there out of their own choiceAs the founder and co-chair of the British Yoga Teacher’s Union, Laura Hancock has heard several stories like Miranda’s from former Tara Yoga students. (Several also share their stories on the new BBC Sounds podcastThe Bad Gurupresented by journalist Cat McShane). As a yoga teacher herself, Hancock used to rent a teaching space at Tara Yoga and remembers seeing a photograph of Bivolaru on the studio wall. She initially became involved in setting up the union because of a lack of workers’ rights and fair pay in the industry. Soon, she found many students and teachers across the industry were approaching her to report physical and emotional abuse, exploitation, sexual harassment and grooming. “It became what most people were coming to us with,” she says.As yoga teachers and volunteers, the Yoga Teacher’s Union had to upskill to deal with this outpouring, referring issues to law enforcement where possible. Yet with no official yoga regulatory body, it was unclear where to turn. They also found the police often showed little appetite in investigating, with complaints about Tara Yoga, for instance, being passed from one force to another, before going nowhere. “The responsibility or duty of care should be aligned to psychotherapy; there’s a power dynamic at play between yoga teachers and students and that’s not acknowledged,” says Hancock. “People have felt very disempowered by not having avenues to report these things. The media has done a good job of presenting the stories of survivors well. But the question is: ‘What’s next?’”The union began to urge studios to put up sexual harassment policies. The British Wheel of Yoga is in the pilot stages of a database of registered practitioners (currently, you can find yoga teachers trained to stage four through their school on its website). But what’s needed, argues Hancock, is wider reform. “People go into yoga with a heightened level of trust, assuming that a yoga class is going to be good and positive, and that there’s integrity. That’s not always the case. There’s a lot of diminishing and cognitive dissonance, because people don’t know what constitutes harassment in these spaces or don’t want to admit what’s at play.” Hancock lives just minutes away from the Tara Yoga Centre, and is angry to see that it’s still operating. “Ultimately that school should not be open.”For now, the onus remains mostly on consumers to be discerning in choosing a yoga school or teacher, a challenge in the wild west of wellness. There are signs to look out for. At a class, hands-on adjustments without prior consent should no longer be the norm, Hancock says. Be cautious of retreats or camps that deprive you of personal possessions, says Tyldesley. “If they say, ‘We ask people not to use mobile phones in the ashram to cultivate an environment of quiet, but you can use them off grounds or keep them on silent in case of family emergency’, that’s reasonable. Taking them away from you, less so.” Residential retreats should also detail their activities and policies ahead of time, “because you’re the consumer – we wouldn’t buy anything if we didn’t know what we were buying. A yoga retreat should not be at all mysterious.”In November 2023, French police raided the apartment where Miranda had met Bivolaru in the Paris suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine, arresting him on suspicion of kidnap, human trafficking, rape and “abuse of weakness”. Bivolaru is currently remanded in custody in France awaiting trial. He and his lawyers declined to comment when approached regarding these allegations. During these raids, 41 other people were arrested on a variety of charges at affiliated locations and 58 women were found to be living in cramped conditions with no privacy, according to French authorities.During these raids, 41 other people were arrested on a variety of chargesSeveral other women have joined Miranda in giving their testimonies to be used as evidence in the case against Bivolaru and Misa in France, with pre-trial investigations still ongoing. In the UK, Miranda is currently pursuing a civil claim against Tara Yoga for alleged involvement in assault, trafficking and causing personal injury. Tara Yoga declined to comment on these allegations, but a spokesperson stated that the organisation will “vigorously defend itself” in any legal proceedings and that it “unequivocally condemns all forms of abuse”.“Although tiring and re-traumatising, speaking about it to people who are experts and understand has given me another perspective,” Miranda says. “People in wellness were initially generally quite dismissive, so seeing people shocked was refreshing.” Given that women were largely the victims in her experience also feels relevant: “To continue, they [Tara Yoga and Misa] are relying on women like me to forgive, to retain our reputation, not to challenge things. I feel as if I’m overcoming that through speaking out against this abuse of power.”Misa maintains that many of the “tens of thousands” of people who have attended their classes and retreats over the past 35 years still “appreciate and respect” Bivolaru, and continue to participate in their events. All allegations, they claim, are part of a “witch-hunt” and are “based on the declarations of a handful of people who are probably motivated by personal vendettas or a need to get attention.”Miranda has not returned to a yoga class since 2020. “For a while, even doing yoga at home was triggering. That’s one of the things that makes me angriest. It’s a relationship they co-opted.” In spiritual or wellness circles, there’s a focus on forgiveness, she says, but that can be overplayed. Just as the spiritual side of yoga was co-opted, the promise of healing became a means of coercion. “What I find more healing now is the idea that justice could be done.”The Bad Guru podcast is available onBBC Sounds.Explore more on these topicsYogaThe ObserverCrimeRape and sexual assaultfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Grief at different times in your journey might look like all those things to you.Perhaps your life might call for you to find the off switch. Or if there’s not one to be found, to turn the volume up on something else in your life to drown out the noise that all this grappling with death can stir up. Fantasy football. National politics. FBoy Island.You might be relieved to get this permission to turn away. You might be doubly relieved to hear that it’s not just self-help conjecture but backed by some field-changing psychology research led by the scholars Margaret Stroebe and Henk Schut.Their theory, known as the dual-process model of coping with bereavement, is rooted in the observation that in grief we oscillate between two different modes of being: one where we are actively working through the real-life stressors of losing someone (like cleaning out our dead cousin’s dorm room), and another where we’re seeking a break from grief, even actively avoiding having to deal. As Stroebe and Schut argue, the second mode isn’t some kind of failure. It’s a critical part of how we learn to live with our loss.This likely feels intuitively true to you. Some days you’re vibrating with all the feelings and looking for better ways to find meaning with what’s happened, and some days you’re absolutely wrecked. When we can find ways to healthfully escape, oftentimes that is paradoxically where we can also find the heart of our healing. Escaping is just as much the work of grief as is weeping.For my sibling Claire (they/them), their escape came in the form of fantasy worlds. Claire was a fan of fantastical worlds long before our dad died. When other students at their Catholic school dressed up as cheerleaders and football players on Halloween, they opted for a spooky werewolf mask and didn’t take it off all day. While other kids spent summers in mesh scrimmage vests at soccer camp, Claire preferred a chain-mail overshirt worn to the local ren faire, where they learned how to shoot a bullseye with a bow and arrow, and developed a taste for mead.View image in fullscreen‘Fantasy realms offer us both a place to escape and an alternate reality to inhabit.’Illustration: Yuki Murayama/The GuardianAD, or “after our dad’s death”, fantastical worlds became an even bigger refuge for Claire. Yet Tolkien novels had finite pages, and Star Trek made only so many episodes of the original season. Fan fiction forums, where fellow lovers of far-out worlds could elaborate on characters and themes, allowed Claire a never-ending supply of their favorite escape.Whether reading, or writing, Claire was hooked. I asked Claire later if this was smutty stuff, assuming the lure was tied up in the potential erotic tension between Star Trek’s Spock and Captain Kirk. But it wasn’t that. “Writing about how my favorite characters dealt with situations that mirrored my own – whether it was my first breakup, or Dad dying, gave me a way to experiment with my own choice and response,” they told me.When Claire first played Dungeons & Dragons, the cult-classic tabletop game from the 1970s, they were pulled in by the way one game could go in an infinite number of directions. The premise is simple, the outcomes limitless. You play with a board and dice and set characters to navigate a plot narrated by the Dungeon Master, a role of container-setter and conversation engine. What Claire loved about D&D was the expansiveness of the worlds, the characters, the storylines. Anything could happen. Anything might.A game of D&D represents a shared experience with at least three other humans at the table who are all open to improvising, listening and responding. The game requires its players to lean on one another, to hold a shared image of an imagined world in their mind’s eye, and to decide how to navigate conflict together. Whether the conflict on the board was directly related to navigating a death, or simply a way to weave a social safety net more tightly between a group of players, it was through these unseen worlds that Claire found their most solid footing in grief.After hearing stories told of Claire’s fantastical favorites, our brother José and I asked to join in. Without our dad in his family role of initiating time together, it was up to us kids to find time to connect. A weird silver lining meant that instead of doing the yacht-rock activities he enjoyed– unnecessarily long walks, alphabetizing his CDs, washing his car in the driveway – we now got to take turns picking the agenda.I had moved from Los Angeles out to the Mojave desert, and my siblings came to stay with me for the weekend. But our real destination? The Lost Mines of Phandelver, a day’s walk outside the town of Phandalin, where a few good townsmen had gone missing, or so posited Claire, our Dungeon Master. We named characters, defined our skills and blew good luck breath on the litany of dice.View image in fullscreenDungeons & Dragons is a cult-classic tabletop game from the 1970s that could go in an infinite number of directions.Illustration: Yuki Murayama/The GuardianIt was the first time we were dedicating a day to play together since our dad died, and it felt radical. We opted out of the default conversations of sibling time: catching up on work and relationships, shooting the shit about movies we had seen, venting about family dynamics, all topics inevitably circling the newly gaping hole at the center of our world. Instead, we played in this imaginary world where anything was possible and nothing off limits, and it was surprisingly liberating. That weekend, we weren’t just three grieving siblings. Two of us were crusaders, an orc and a druid, attempting to rescue strangers from goblins, and one of us was a Dungeon Master, keeping score.After hours of campaigning inside, splayed on the floor amid a litter of note pads, chip bags and seltzer cans, we would move the game outside in the evening. All was quiet except for the occasional heckle of coyotes hunting cottontail in the darkness behind my house. The wind rustled the sprawl of character sheets in front of us, breezing through the inky darkness all around. We had laughed so hard together at the absurdity and ridiculousness of getting into character, bizarro accents and all. And then we were laughing about the situations we were in, why José had decided to blow up the bridge we were meant to walk over in a moment of revelry with his fireball powers.This weekend everything was possible. Casting spells to bring someone back from the brink of death, an actual option. The road ahead was as clear as a single call to adventure.That first D&D campaign blew my mind. The conversations we ended up having in the game, as our characters, felt deeper and more present than the default conversation of those days, even if the subject matter was which spell I could invoke to turn leaves into razor blades, or the number of ale casks José could carry on his back, or what the characters that Claire seamlessly morphed into as our Dungeon Master, with different accents and shifts in body language, had to tell us about our campaign.There were times since our dad died where the three of us would have opposite responses to the same situation: whether we thought our dad should be buried or cremated (he had died without ever voicing his requests); whether we should encourage our stepmom to get rid of his clothes in the closet, or sweetly smile at the lines of suit jackets that gave her comfort. While we were siblings, we were very different people, and had very distinct relationships with our dad. The uniqueness of how we knew him impacted how we each experienced his passing. We didn’t always understand each other.View image in fullscreen‘In the tenderness of grief, our inherent differences were confusing, and sometimes unintentionally hurtful.’Illustration: Yuki Murayama/The GuardianOur day-to-day selves and our alternate-reality selves had all sat down to dinner, and we were closer for itIn the tenderness of grief, our inherent differences were confusing, and sometimes unintentionally hurtful. But in this role-playing world, we were able to be explicit about our preferences. And having a diversity of skills on the team actually helped, not hindered, the quest.Once we finally snapped out of the Mines of Phandelver and drove to our neighborhood saloon for burgers and beers, I noticed that we could be with each other a little bit differently. By spending the afternoon not talking about the normal swirl we usually landed on, we were able to get to know one another in new ways. Sitting in a booth, stealing fries from each other’s plates, we had gone from three siblings to a party of six. Our day-to-day selves and our alternate-reality selves had all sat down to dinner, and we were closer for it.After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the griefRead moreGandalf gets taken out on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, at the hands of a Balrog.

Each fantastical epic has a storyline where the father figure dies. According to the mythologist Joseph Campbell, it’s almost a prerequisite to beginning a process of becoming. And in those nights together, our father dying felt less like the ending of a tragic tale, and more like the beginning of an adventure we were embarking on together, fears and flaws and freakouts and all.Fantasy realms offer us both a place to escape and an alternate reality to inhabit when our own is too intense, too boring, too heartbroken. But also, once we’re there, it can help us approach our healing from a new angle, experimenting with new neural pathways and narratives in a lower-stakes setting.Liam O’Brien of Critical Role, a livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons game played by professional voice actors who’ve turned a tabletop game into a spectator sport, has cracked this open. In the months following his mother’s passing, O’Brien spoke bravely about the way that his table became the linchpin in his grief process on X. For Liam, incorporating the themes he was grappling with into the game itself became a powerful tool in processing his grief.Heshared on X: “In the weeks following her passing, I felt pretty swallowed up by loss, but spending time with my trusted friends every week, exploring the very thing that I was haunted by … taught me volumes. Sometimes art is just entertainment. But it’s often much more.”When my siblings and I were playing Dungeons and Dragons, we felt unhinged from the rigidity of responsibilities in life, of caretaking, of hard conversations, of figuring out how to father ourselves. In our anchorlessness, we were finding a new kind of way to be present, and through our presence, be both together and be free.Carla Fernandez is a facilitator, writer and community strategist exploring circles of care and collective action.Excerpted fromRenegade Griefby Carla Fernandez.

Last year’s winner, comedian Chris McCausland, the show’s first blind celebrity, defied expectations and changed people’s attitude to his disability, while 80-year-old presenter Angela Rippon demonstrated in 2023 that age is no barrier to dancing.Over my two decades as a dance writer, I’ve tried a little of everything – ballet, ballroom, even breaking, but nothing has moved me like the Argentine tango. And I’m not talking about the version you see onStrictly– that’s the choreographed stage tango, with dancers kicking up their legs in performative tricks; few of us ever get to do that – but rather, the social dance style.​One of the theories about the word “tango” is that it comes from the Bantu African word for drum,tambor. Enslaved people were among the first to dance candombe, one of the forebears of tango, in South America. It’s a dance with a trance-like quality, which is also true of tango: atmilongas, or social dances, couples glide anticlockwise around the room in an almost meditative state.I’ve heard it said that Tango is the only dance in the world not about joyThere was a lot of European influence on tango’s development, too. In the late 1800s, a large number of young men arrived from Spain, Italy and Germany to build Argentina’s railways. They were homesick, congregating in bars, gambling houses and brothels, where they listened and danced to the mournfulbandoneón, a type of concertina that arrived with the German immigrants.Tango gave them comfort, a sense of connection, at a time when they were missing their homes and the touch of their families; its melancholic music reflects that sense of longing. And the tango embrace, theabrazo, is the same word in Spanish for a hug. In my latest novel, I wanted tango to have a starring role. The novel has a dual timeline – one strand follows the story of a young dancer who uses her ballroom partnership to work for the Resistance in occupied Paris during the Second World War.In the present day, my young protagonist, Miriam, explores the dance classes and ballrooms of New York and finds that tango, in the wake of a loss, is the dance that most speaks to her.My very first encounter with tango, two decades ago, when I was 25, was a bit of a disaster. I’d gone to watch a tango show with an Argentinian friend in Mendoza, in western Argentina. In a room full of middle-aged Chileans and Argentinians, my friend made the mistake of revealing that I was from the UK, or more specifically, Pais de Gales, Wales. The compère was overjoyed at the discovery.“This is Nicola,” he announced to the room. “She’s from Wales and she’s going to show us how to dance the tango.” A sea of expectant faces turned in my direction. I’d seen tango before, but I had yet to dance a step and I was reasonably sure I didn’t want my first lesson to take place in front of a roomful of strangers.“No puedo,” I muttered – or yelled, actually – to make myself heard above the clapping and murmurs of encouragement. The whole room looked disappointed.Clearly, I decided, I was going to need to do better. Shortly after “death by tango”, I took myself off for a lesson. By the end of that first session, I was hooked. Something about the tango moved me. I’ve heard it said that it’s the only dance in the world that’s not about joy. And even as a relatively young person I understood sorrow. My beloved father died when I was 11 and his loss left me with a lifetime of yearning ahead of me.Before long,I did what any wannabetangueradoes: I moved to Buenos Aires. I found a hostel in San Telmo. There were safer, trendier areas I could have stayed, like Palermo or Recoleta, but San Telmo had soul and I’ve always been a sucker for that. You could hear the melancholic lyrics of the tango drifting from cafés and dance schools any day of the week, but always turned up loud on Sundays when the neighbourhood filled with visitors to the antique market.As luck would have it, onTime Outmagazine, where I found a work experience placement, no one else was much fussed about tango. The editor asked if I’d like to edit the tango section, updating the listings on the latest classes and milongas. I couldn’t believe my luck and began exploring the city’s most popular venues.La Catedral on Sarmiento was where the in-crowd danced in an underground warehouse setting, while La Viruta in Palermo was more like a family wedding, with dancers of all ages circling the floor. Some milongas favoured traditional music, such as the crooning of tango icon Carlos Gardel, whose face shines from every piece of street art; others played Nuevo Tango, like the thrilling music of Astor Piazzolla, or the electronic tango of bands such as Gotan Project.​Then one night, in May 2005, everything changed for me. I was out in the city – not tangoing for once, but at supper with my uncle, who was in Buenos Aires for a conference. After our meal, I jumped into a cab back to San Telmo and the driver started to drive.He was youngish, square-faced, taciturn. It was a journey I knew – not extremely well, but well enough, and from early on I didn’t recognise the route. I checked in with him once or twice, but he said I’d recognise it soon.​I wound down the window to get some fresh air to keep my jitters under control. I didn’t want the driver to know I was anxious. I didn’t want to offend him. It was just one more block, he told me, just one more turning.​Suddenly, as we stopped at some traffic lights, I realised the meter was showing a number far higher than the price of the outward journey. And I still had no idea where we were. I went to open the door, but, in a swift movement, the driver turned, manually locked the door and pushed a small handgun into my belly.​I don’t remember exactly what happened next. Trauma muddled my memories almost immediately. But somehow I eventually managed to push my head out of the window to shout for help. He was driving erratically, trying to pull me back into the car.As we swerved, a red car on our right was so close, I remember thinking I could touch it. I must have reached out and pushed off it – perhaps it was this that softened my fall through the window. When I hit the road, my heels took the brunt of the impact. Both my ankles broke as I landed. But I was still breathing, still alive.Someone called an ambulance and I was taken to hospital. The only time I really wept was watching the tango scene inScent of a Womanon the hospital television. “No mistakes in the tango,” Al Pacino tells his partner in that famous gravelly voice of his. “If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just tango on.” Something I’d taken for granted days before – the ability to just tango on – wasn’t possible for menow.I was flown home on a stretcher, and spent the early days of my recovery at my mum’s house. Initially, I focused on physical recovery – moving from my wheelchair to crutches and then learning to walk again – but as I became physically stronger, the psychological symptoms got more out of control.I relived the accident constantly, imagining it in various permutations, and I began to panic about more ordinary things, too. I saw danger everywhere and my ability to distinguish true risk from innocuous events disintegrated. In my fears and flashbacks, I lived other versions of my attack in which I didn’t retain control, in which I didn’t get away.Progress was slow at first. I danced in trainers and leaned too heavily on my partner, then tango returned me to myselfA turning point came when I was able to return to tango. Progress was slow at first. I danced in trainers and leaned too heavily on my partner, but the more I practised, the more tango returned me to myself. It was excellent physiotherapy – the controlled weight shifts and precise footwork helped enormously with balance, while the tango walks helped with that relearned skill.Tango also taught me to trust strangers again. Typically, at a milonga, you’ll dance atanda– a set of three or four songs – with your partner, which means it’s more than one rushed track: it’s a relationship in miniature. I’ve heard it called many things – a wordless conversation, or, as Kapka Kassabova puts it in the title of her wonderful book about tango,Twelve Minutes of Love.As an improvised dance, it means you have to listen to your partner intently as a follower and, if you’re lucky, are listened to in turn. It’s perhaps unsurprising that tango is used therapeutically for a wide number of purposes, to help with everything from Parkinson’s to dementia.or as a way of warding off loneliness.In my adventures on the dancefloor I’ve met countless people who have discovered dance after life-changing events – perhaps because dance is the opposite of death. But, unlike other dances, such as salsa or samba, which cheerfully bully us into a party mood, tango allows us to feel our grief, our yearning, our sorrow. And, somehow, in accepting those emotions, in tangoing through them in the arms of another human being, it is possible to find a kind of bliss.The Paris Dancer by Nicola Rayner is published by Head of Zeus at £9.99.

Next month, she will publish a cookbook to honour her fellow inmatesRachel CookeSun 9 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareMaziar Bahari used to feel sceptical when people talked of the way that books can change lives. Such statements always seemed like so much hyperbole to him.But when Sepideh Gholian, one of Iran’s most famous political prisoners, came into his life, everything changed. “If anyone wants to know why writing matters, her book is the best example,” says Bahari, a London-based journalist, documentary maker and the founder of the news website IranWire.“In its pages, she takes us to places that are out of the hands of the interrogators and the prison wardens. Writing empowers her. It allows her to think of things that are hers alone, and which no one can ever take away from her. It shows the power of literature to liberate the mind and the soul.”On his phone, he plays me a seconds-long message from the 30-year-old, recorded on one of the mobiles that are periodically smuggled into Evin, the Tehran prison where she is held, which is best known in Britain as the place whereNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffewas incarcerated.View image in fullscreenThe Evin Prison Bakers’ Club by Sepideh Gholian.In the clip, she is smiling broadly and whispering something – a barely audible whisper that is clearly highly practiced (prisoners are often required to be silent). Bahari shakes his head. “She’s so vivid, and it’s this – her laughter – that attracts me and millions of others to her story. She is an individual in a country where the regime wants the population to be one mass under the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]. To be an individual in Iran is an act of resistance.”Gholian, who is celebrated by a generation of younger Iranian women for once having bright blue hair, was born in Dezful, Khuzestan, in the south-west of Iran. In 2018, when she was still a student, she began helping to organise support for the Haft Tappeh sugarcane complex strike (since 2015, when the factory was privatised, workers had been fighting against job losses, unpaid wages and poor working conditions).Although she was not a worker herself, Gholian reported on the strike, planned meetings and built solidarity in the community and beyond – until, during a peaceful protest, she was arrested, after which she was detained without trial for 30 days.But Gholian was undaunted. On her release, she revealed to the world what had happened to her. She had, she said, been tortured. There were beatings and floggings, and during interrogation sessions lasting into the small hours, she was subjected to sexual insults and told that her family would receive information that would lead to her murder for so-called honour.The public response to this was fierce – it was on her side – but it also brought the state broadcaster to air a documentary in which a distressed Gholian was seen “confessing” to crimes against the state. It also led to her rearrest and imprisonment. In 2023, she was again released, but almost immediately, footage of her denouncing Khamenei went viral (“you tyrant,” she said, “we’re going to put you in a grave”). A day later, she was arrested once more. She has been in prison ever since.Bahari set up IranWire in 2013, following his own run-in with the Iranian regime: in 2009, he was imprisoned for 118 days, an experience recorded in his best-selling memoirThen They Came For Me.To date, IranWire has helped to train some 6,000 citizen journalists inside Iran, and it was thanks to this network that he heard Gholian was writing a prison diary – a book IranWire published in Farsi in 2020.“After that, she knew I was someone she could trust,” he says. “So we stayed in touch as much as possible, and then she told me she had an idea for a second book, this time about cooking.” Bit by bit, the text was sent to him. Even piecemeal, it was electrifying. Next month, it will be published in English asThe Evin Prison Bakers’ Club: Surviving Iran’s Most Notorious Prison in 16 Recipes.British readers will perhaps find it strange that in a system so severe – as Gholian recounts, ill-treatment, torture and the use of solitary confinement are all routine – the possibility exists that prisoners may cook. But it seems that cracks appear all the time.“In Persian, we have a joke,” he says. “A prisoner is asked whether he wants to go to a German hell, or an Iranian hell. What’s the difference? he wants to know. Well, he’s told, in the German hell, they flog you and they pour cold water on you every day, whereas in the Iranian hell they flog you and they put your head in boiling water over a fire, and it’s much more painful.”The prisoner hardly needs to think: he chooses the Iranian hell. “When he’s asked why, he says that in Germany, everything will always work. But in Iran, one day there won’t be any water, and on another, there won’t be matches.”Corruption is rife. Bribes may be paid. High-ranking prisoners arrive with furniture and kitchen equipment, and leave it behind when they’re released. Above all, prisoners are highly resourceful. Gholian’s recipes are not only very sweet – the women crave sugar – they are also surprisingly elaborate.The book arrives garlanded with praise from Shirin Ebadi, the human rights lawyer who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, and Azar Nafisi, the author ofReading Lolita in Tehran, and it is not hard to see why.If the stories it tells are often horrifying – the most agonising concerns a woman who has to secretly abort her baby in prison – the solidarity it reveals somehow inflects the entire narrative with hope.View image in fullscreenGholian’s book includes a description of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe baking cookies for her daughter. The women were incarcerated in the same prison in Tehran.Photograph: David Parry/ShutterstockThe women come from all social, ethnic and political backgrounds. Outside the prison, their unity would not be encouraged; many of them would doubtless never even cross paths. Inside it, however, they are, as Bahari puts it, “practising for the kind of Iran they’d like to see in the future”.And sometimes, of course, a prisoner will be released. The book includes a description of Zaghari-Ratcliffe in a brown apron, baking ginger cookies for the daughter she misses so desperately. Before her release in March 2022, she and Gholian became friends. To this day, the smell of cinnamon makes Gholian think of her.But her writing has a deeper purpose, too. Each recipe is dedicated to an individual. The pumpkin pie is for Narges Mohammadi, another human rights campaigner and Nobel laureate, now serving her 10th year in prison; the date crumble is for Fatima Muthanna, a long-standing dissident whose current sentence is 15 years; the madeleines are for Marzieh Amiri, one of 50 reporters who were arrested during pro-democracy protests between September and December 2022.More significantly, still others are written for names that are less well-known, both in and outside Iran. “There’s a level of protection that anonymous prisoners do not have,” says Bahari. “One of the beautiful things she’s doing in the book is to tell the stories of women less famous than she is.”Last year, it was reported that Gholian had been on hunger strike, but Bahari says she is now doing well. “She seems to be in good spirits.”When is she likely to be released? “There is a general amnesty before the Persian New Year on 20 March. We don’t know if she’ll be part of that. If she isn’t, in theory, her release should be some time next year. But it’s all quite arbitrary, and that serves its own purpose. They want to keep people on their toes.”Last time she fell foul of the authorities straight away. If she is released, isn’t she likely simply to get herself in trouble all over again? “I really hope not,” he says.“It would be better for her if she didn’t. She is so young and so talented. She wants to be a lawyer, so she needs to study.”Bahari lifts his hands: a gesture in the direction of the wide world. “She has a whole life ahead of her. She needs to hang out with friends, to play sports, to live a normal life in Iran.” A pause, and then he checks himself.The word “normal”: in case I’m wondering, in this instance it requires inverted commas.Explore more on these topicsIranThe ObserverWomenNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeAyatollah Ali KhameneiPublishingFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Skype was a reminder of a bygone era and a source of inspiration for many. It facilitated relationships across oceans when there were few affordable means of making international calls, nothing short of a miracle for those with family members in distant parts of the world.One nostalgic Guardian reader composed a song based on the familiar Skype ring. Michael Frishkopf, a professor at the University of Albert’s department of music and the director of the Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology, created a short symphonic work with the Skype theme song in 2020. It was “originally for a film score (though it was never used in that way)”, Frishkopf wrote in an email.“Skype was always a tool for connecting out of isolation and it struck me that a lot of people probably associate it with being far from loved ones,” Frishkopf said. “That Skype ring tone, I don’t know who made it, but it has a kind of wistfulness to it. It isn’t either major or minor, it could go either way. In the same way, it could sound happy or sad which could represent the sadness of longing for someone and the joy of connecting with them. That [Skype] is fading out for good, it might cause a sense of loss for people.”Skyping (orchestral)Michael FrishkopfSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/05/Skyping_(orchestral)_-_composed_by_Michael_Frishkopf.mp300:00:0000:02:01Inspired by Frishkopf’s email, the Guardian asked readers to share their own memories of Skype. What they described in touching tributes was a piece of technology that connected parents with their children, enabled start-up founders to communicate across oceans and timezones, and even made two proposals possible.Melany Heger.Photograph: Melany HegerThe stay-at-home mom who found a new careerWhen I had a mid-career shift, I used Skype extensively as a way to contact clients. That was 2019, and I was on the verge of working again. I spent ten years as a full-time mom, you see. Before I began working online, it felt impossible to be working and stay at home for my kids. You can say that Skype opened up a world of possibilities to me.– Melany Heger, Manila, PhilippinesThe couples who dated and proposed on SkypeHolly and her husband’s wedding bandsPhotograph: HollyI proposed to my Swedish husband over Skype using sticky notes. We got married on 5-5-15, the same day Skype will end its service. It’s very sad, I especially liked it since it was from my husband’s homeland of Sweden. Skype played a big part in our lives in keeping us connected while we were dating and it will always be in my heart.– Holly, IowaDave’s Skype profile picturePhotograph: DaveI think we take for granted how revolutionary Skype was. A futurist utopia always included video calling, and that was ubiquitous by 2005 thanks to Skype. I proposed marriage through it to a long-distance girlfriend in 2008. We never got married, but our ill-fated engagement felt glorious for the weeks after, and memories of our multi-hour sessions still give me a sense of melancholy as strong as any other moments of lost young love.– Dave, MichiganMy husband and I would never be married if we hadn’t had Skype. We met in 2004 when he was on a year abroad from Colorado School of Mines to the University of Leeds. By the time I moved to the States and we got married in November 2009, we had racked up countless Skype hours at all times of the day and night. Skype allowed us to have a long distance relationship that would not have seemed possible if we were just a few years older. Skype also allowed me to see and chat with my parents after I had moved.Nowadays my children (11 and seven) cannot imagine a life without FaceTiming their grandparents, but so much of that is owed to mom and dad’s early years of Skype dating!– Jessica, ColoradoThe faraway relatives who Skyped family back homeView image in fullscreenLauraPhotograph: LauraIn 2004, I moved across the world to attend university in the United States. Phone calls were too expensive, so I would spend hours on Skype chatting with my family and friends back home. When we went around the dinner table saying what we were grateful for my first American Thanksgiving, Skype was my answer. Homesickness was my malady, Skype was my medicine.– Laura, Los AngelesMy great-grandmother said the most important invention during her lifetime was the ability to fly internationally, delighting in the fact that she could journey from Australia by plane for her one and only ‘grand European tour’ in the 1960s, once all her children had grown. For my grandmother, who sadly passed in 2010, it was the invention of Skype. She had spent many years corresponding via a much-cherished weekly letter and annual phone call when her only sister moved to London and then New York during the 60s and 70s. So, you can imagine her delight when I made a similar move abroad in the 2000s that we could still see each other and talk via a video call during her final years. I cherish the memory of those Skype calls as much as the letters she wrote me.– Felix, MexicoWhen first arriving on these Japanese shores, calls to the US were prohibitively expensive. I used to write aerograms (light paper that could be folded into an envelope) to my parents. Then I had two children who dispersed, one to Tokyo, one to the US. We Skype regularly, though we also use Google Chat. As an expat, I have found Skype invaluable. It can be used as a verb – “Let’s Skype!” – and fulfills a sense of joy found on Christmas morning.

We think we can switch to Zoom but it’s more awkward for her to use.– Alice, HampshireThroughout his numerous 12-15 month military deployments that dotted my childhood, Skype (and later Skype-to-Go) was the most reliable way to have any sort of contact with my dad in between receiving hand written letters.– Veronica, MichiganThe teachers who used Skype to reach their studentsI have been teaching Qur’an on Skype for the last nine years. I think there is no better app for teaching, especially because of the clarity of the voice in terms of teaching by sharing the page.– Ghulam Asghar Awan, PakistanDuring the pandemic, I did online teaching via Skype. One of my students was a single child, alone at home. She was around 10 when I first taught her. Now when all school was online, she was obviously very happy to have a teacher just for herself. She didn’t learn much, because she interrupted me all the time, just wanting to talk to somebody. Bella, you still have a very special place in my heart! I’ll never forget you!– Friedrich Helmke, BrazilThe friends who connected via SkypeView image in fullscreenMatthew (left) and Harald (right)Photograph: MatthewThe person with whom I used Skype the most and used it last was my friend Harald. I live in Wisconsin and work at the university in Madison. Harald was from Germany but did a postdoctoral fellowship in Madison in the early 2000s. We became friends while he was here, and interestingly, we grew much closer after he moved back to Germany. We would get together before or after conferences and do bike trips together, and we visited each other many times over the years.Harald’s preferred way of communicating when we were on opposite sides of the world was by Skype. He’d use it as a verb. “Let’s Skype next Tuesday,” he’d say to me. I would often tease him as new platforms became popular that he was wedded to this outdated mode of communication. He died about two years ago, and I miss him terribly. And anytime I hear about Skype I think of him.– Matthew, WisconsinThe startup founders who met every evening on SkypeView image in fullscreenOurResearch co-founders, Heather Piwowar and Jason PriemPhotograph: Heather PiwowarOur startup, which has helped hundreds of thousands of people access scientific research, only exists because of Skype. We wrote the seeds of the project at an all-night hackathon in 2011, in person, but the two of us lived in different countries and three time zones apart – would this thing fizzle or bloom? Over the next few years we talked on Skype every evening to improve the product, get funded, incorporate and grow. Skype saw our grit, tears and laughter. The result wasUnpaywall,OpenAlex, improved open science, and wonderful memories. Thank you, Skype.– Heather Piwowar, Vancouver, CanadaThe man who begrudgingly gives Skype creditSkype was the first of the video calling services. That said, it was absolutely rubbish, and I dropped it like a stone as soon as anything close to a viable alternative arrived. It’s bloated, resource-hogging, unintuitive interface lives on in Teams and is vastly improved upon by services like Discord. I’m thankful for it breaking new ground, but am more thankful we’ve gone a lot further from where we started.– Seth, Cambridge, UKExplore more on these topicsSkypeMicrosoftInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is Stephen A Smith the way back to the White House?The charismatic sports news host has become an unlikely force in a party that needs critical friends and fresh ideasDavid Smithin WashingtonSun 9 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 11.02 EDTShareThe View, one of the US’s most popular daytime television programmes, was a vital campaign stop last year for Joe Biden andKamala Harris. This week, it played host to a cable sports channel personality who might be nurturing political ambitions of his own.Stephen A Smith wasasked by co-host Alyssa Farah Griffinwhat he makes of hypothetical polls that show him among the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.“I make of it that citizens, particularly on the left, are desperate,” Smith said in characteristically forthright style. “And I mean it when I say it: I think I can beat them all.”Despite – or because of – his lack of political experience, Smith isemerging as an unlikely forcein a Democratic party badly in need of critical friends, fresh ideas and blunt truth-telling. The idea of him running for the White House remains wildly speculative – but speaks volumes about a shift in the US media ecosystem and a blurring of the lines between culture, entertainment and politics.The 57-year-old, born Stephen Anthony Smith in the Bronx in New York, began his career in print journalism, writing for newspapers such as the Philadelphia Inquirer, then made his name as a broadcaster, especially on ESPN. Smith is now the co-host of First Take, where he shares provocative opinions on basketball and other topics.His fans includeKurt Bardella, a media relations consultant and Democratic strategist who watches First Take “religiously”. Bardella said: “He is out there with passion and charisma and he provokes emotion and conversation and debate. He has become the singular most influential person in all of sports.He is out there with passion and charisma and he provokes emotion and conversation and debateKurt Bardella, Democratic strategist“We live in a time where our politics is shaped and informed by culture more than at any time in our history. There’s that old adage that politics is just culture downstream, and Stephen A is a good embodiment of that.”Smith’s star continues to rise. It emerged this week that he had agreed toa new ESPN contractworth at least $100m for five years. He will continue on First Take but reduce other sports-related obligations, increasing his opportunities for political commentary: in recent months he has appeared on Fox News, NewsNation and HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher.The Stephen A Smith Show, which streams onYouTubeandiHeart, has featured interviews withHakeem Jeffries, the House of Representatives Democratic minority leader; rightwing personalityCandace Owens; andAndrew Cuomo, in his first interview since announcing his candidacy for New York mayorThe political chatter around Smith is also a symptom of the demoralisation in the leaderless Democratic party following last November’s defeat in elections for the White House, House and Senate. This week, for example, Democrats struggled to find a coherent response toTrump’s addressto a joint session of Congress.After nominating Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in past elections, some in the party hunger for a fighter in the mould of Trump, an outsider not beholden to the traditional political establishment. And witnessing the rise of podcasters such as Joe Rogan and an entire “Maga” media ecosystem, they crave a liberal alternative.In Smith, they see a bracing energy. He voted for Harris but has been outspoken in criticisingDemocratsfor failing to connect with voters and for prioritising niche issues – which in his view includes the transgender community – and failing to address the concerns of a broader electorate.In January, appearing alongside the Democratic representative Ro Khanna on Real Time with Bill Maher, heoffered a blistering diagnosisof why Democrats lost to Trump: “The man was impeached twice, he was convicted on 34 felony counts and the American people still said: ‘He’s closer to normal than what we see on the left.’”Smith added: “What voter can look at the Democrat party and say: ‘There’s a voice for us, somebody who speaks for us, that goes up on Capitol Hill and fights the fights that we want them fighting on our behalf’?”His gift for storytelling and communicating impresses Bardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser forRepublicanson the House oversight committee. Bardella said: “His style of speaking, the directness, the boldness, the bombastic at times kind of PT Barnum-esque quality that he brings to the conversation is exactly what Democrats are lacking and exactly what made Donald Trump the showman such an appealing character to begin with when he arrived on the stage.His boldness is exactly what Democrats are lacking. Democrats would be wise to study what makes him so successfulKurt Bardella“Rather than just dismiss it or make fun of it or ignore it, Democrats would be wise to study what makes him so successful because there is nobody in the Democratic party that is as relevant a voice on a day-to-day basis as Stephen A Smith.”It was striking that a January poll by McLaughlin & Associates for the 2028 Democratic nomination decided toinclude him in a surveythat put Kamala Harris at 33%, Pete Buttigieg at 9%, Gavin Newsom at 7%, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 6%, Josh Shapiro at 3%, Tim Walz at 3% and Smith at 2%.Still, many Democrats would think twice before gambling on an outsider such as Smith or the billionaire businessman Mark Cuban. Lack of experience could be a liability in the eyes of some voters. Smith’s controversial statements and “yelling” style could alienate certain segments of the electorate. The perception of Smith as a celebrity candidate could undermine his credibility.Bill Whalen, a former media consultant for politicians including the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said Smith’s eloquence and in-your-face style could be appealing to voters in this political moment: “But the question is, what does Stephen A Smith believe in at the end of the day? He’s been very vocal criticising the Democratic party. What positions does he hold? What does he believe in?“The fact is, if you’re going to run for a party’s nomination in America, there are about a half a dozen or so issues in which you need to be on the right side. Otherwise, you’re not going to go very far. Where is Stephen A Smith on abortion? Where is he on DEI? Where is he on quotas and affirmative action? Where is he on crime? Where is he on spending?“The list goes on. You just don’t know, so my advice to any Democrat looking at this is: before you become a Stephen A Smith supporter, give him a questionnaire and have him fill it out and see what the answers are.”Whether Smith, who has a recurring guest-acting role on the ABC soap opera General Hospital, would want to take on a gruelling election campaign is far from certain.He has expressed ambivalence on the topic buttold the Daily Maillast month that “if the American people came to me and looked at me and said ‘Yo, man, we want you to run for office’, and I had a legitimate shot to win the presidency of the United States, I’m not gonna lie. I’ll think about that.”But on Friday, Smith’s agent, Mark Shapiro, sought to quell the rumours,insisting at a conferencein Boston: “He will not run for president. He’s going to continue to entertain those conversations, but he will not run for president.”Still, the buzz reveals a bigger picture about Democratic soul-searching in the aftermath of election defeat. Trump proved effective at exploiting the new media ecology of podcasts, TikTok and other platforms in portraying the party as elitist, out of touch and obsessed with “woke” issues. Some Democrats are now recalibrating – for example, by removing gender pronouns from their social media accounts.Who are some people who have ways of thinking and communicating that don’t sound like every politician?David Litt, former speechwriter for Barack ObamaDavid Litt, an author and former speechwriter for Barack Obama, said: “Democrats, for most of my lifetime, which is 38 years at this point, sort of assumed we are dominant in the culture, whether or not we’re dominant politically. One of the things we learned from this most recent election is, that may not be the case and either things are more even than we thought or, I would even argue, the right, at least during the election season, took an advantage in the culture.“It’s important that Democrats are saying our ‘political voices’ may not come from the world of politics, particularly at a moment when people are deeply sceptical of politicians. Who are some people who have ways of thinking and communicating that don’t sound like every politician out there? That search and that openness is going to end up being pretty useful and pretty important one way or the other.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsUS politicsRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The House was silent. The prime minister then added a tribute to a 22-year-old British Royal Marine, also killed on 6 March, but in 2007 in Helmand province.They were poignant moments, on what is normally a raucous and crudely partisan occasion in the political week. Across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Starmer told MPs, 642 individuals had died “fighting for Britain alongside our allies”. Many more had been wounded. “We will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice,” Starmer said.But the prime minister’s tributes were not just for the families of the lost soldiers. Nor were they just for British ears. They were also intended to be heard loud and clear in the US, inside Donald Trump’s administration, most notably by vice president JD Vance, who the day before had appeared to disrespect British troops by saying that a US stake in Ukraine’s economy was a “better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”.View image in fullscreenCrowds gather outside the US embassy in Kyiv to protest at the administration’s change of tack on Ukraine.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesLess than a week after Starmer’s tactile “love in” with Donald Trump in the White House, views on how to react to the new US administration had evolved, not just here, but acrossEurope.Trump and Vance’s wild, erratic and at times insulting comments about European governments, had left politicians on this side of the Atlantic facing two dawning realities: first, that they had, somehow, to find ways to push back against Trump and Vance without stoking tensions to even more dangerous levels. And second that for the long-term they had to formulate a real plan for a world in which the US would no longer be the cornerstone of western security.As one European diplomat put it: “It has become clear that Trump is not saying what he is saying just to shake us up, but he is saying it because he means it.”Amid the turbulence, Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyywas in Brussels on Thursday attending an EU summit called to address the security crisis. To the sound of spontaneous clapping, EU leaders rose to their feet to shake his hand, offering backslaps and air kisses. While Zelensky was there Trump’s Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg gave a brutal justification of his country’s decision to freeze military aid: “The best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two by four across the nose. You get their attention.”Signs that Europe was undergoing a historic shift could be heard everywhere, from the rhetoric of French PresidentEmmanuel Macron, to the hugely ambitious ideas for collective defence being voiced by the European Commission, to the announcement on Friday by the Polish prime minister Donald Tusk for all men in his country to undergo military training.But it was inGermanythat the change was seismic. After months campaigning in defence of his country’s strict “debt brake”, incoming chancellor Friedrich Merz struck a deal with his likely coalition partners, the SPD, to raise hundreds of billions of euros for defence and infrastructure. Strict rules on debt underpinned post-war Germany’s entire economic structure. But now needs must.“Given the threat to our freedom and to peace on our continent, the mantra for our defence has to be – whatever it takes,” Merz said.Macron, who has made the case for Europe’s “strategic autonomy” since coming to office in 2017 could feel a sense of vindication.“Our wish is to be a power of peace and balance,” he told reporters after the EU’s emergency summit. “To arm ourselves to avoid the war of tomorrow.”He described the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, as an “imperialist who seeks to rewrite history”.“Europe is stepping up,” one of Macron’s allies in the European Parliament, Valérie Hayer, who leads the liberal Renew group, told theObserver.“EU countries must now keep the new pace and fulfil the commitments they have made, namely common defence spending and shared nuclear deterrence,” she added, in reference to Macron’s proposal to discuss extending France’s nuclear umbrella to other European countries.Germany’s newspapers recognised the enormity of the moment for a country that for so long, after the second world war, shied away from direct military participation.“At this historic turning point, Germany cannot duck away,” said Marina Kormbaki, writing in Der Spiegel. “The federal government must bring the Europeans together, encourage and guide them to ensure their own security. It must set a good example, must finally shape the Bundeswehr into a powerful army, with investment in material and personnel. Only then will other states follow suit. Only then will Russia’s Vladimir Putin take Europe seriously.”Later this month the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will fill in details of her defence funding plan, when she presents a long-awaited white paper.The EU executive is raiding every cupboard to find money for defence: fiscal rules will be relaxed to allow member states to increase deficits and debt to fund military purchases, a measure that could raise €650bn if every country did the maximum possible.EU development funds could also be reassigned to defence, if governments chose. Member states will be able to get loans from a €150bn fund, borrowed money secured by unused money in the EU budget.With pro-Putin Hungary trying to stand in the EU’s way, Brussels is increasingly exploring how it can advance support forUkrainevia “coalitions of the willing” rather than unanimity among members of the bloc.Any doubts European leaders had about Trump’s intentions towards Ukraine have now been brutally dispelled. Downing St still insists that it is in constant discussion with the Trump administration about the United States offering a permanent security guarantee if a peace deal is signed.But there are no obvious signs of progress. Twenty four later after suspending aid to the country, US intelligence sharing was curtailed.Next the Trump administration ordered the US technology company Maxar to stop sharing its satellite images with Ukraine of Russian positions on the battlefield.View image in fullscreenA block of flats in Dobropillia was struck by Russian missiles this weekend, killing 11 civilians.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesThese punitive measures left Ukrainians reeling. The alert systems that warned civilians of incoming missiles and the take-off of Russian bomber planes no longer worked effectively. Russia took grim advantage of this new situation by launching a big air strike on Friday against Ukraine’s energy grid and private homes. Trump was indifferent to the carnage that he had enabled. It was “what anybody would do”, he said.Hours after the US intelligence freeze, the Kremlin launched a major attack on Ukraine’s armed forces in the Kursk region, where Kyiv has for seven months held a small area inside western Russia. North Korean and Russian troops broke through, south of the Ukrainian-held Russian town of Sudhza. An unknown number of Ukrainian soldiers were killed.About 10,000 Ukrainian troops inside Kursk oblast are at risk of encirclement. Over the next few days – as Ukrainian and US officials meet in Saudi Arabia – Volodymyr Zelenskyy will face a tough decision. He had hoped to use the territory as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Russia. Together with Ukraine’s commander in chief Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zelenskyy can either order a pull-out or hope that a massacre can somehow be avoided. Speaking to theObserver, Ukrainian servicemen said they had little choice but to fight on.“What Trump says is wrong. It’s nonsense. He doesn’t seem to understand that the orcs (Russian soldiers) come here to kill us,” one said, adding: “The Russians bomb us every night. They murder our women and children. We need weapons so we can fight back. This war is good against evil. We hope Europe and the world will help us.”Since their acrimonious meeting in the White House, Zelenskyy and his team have tried to fix relations with Trump. Last week Zelenskyy sketched out how a ceasefire might work: a “truce” in the sky, which would see both sides stop drone and missile attacks, and a pause in military operations in the Black Sea. There was no mention of a European peace keeping force or security guarantees – the issue that infuriated Trump, when Zelenskyy raised it in the Oval Office.Putin, however, seems uninterested in peace. His advisers say Russia is not willing to compromise on any of its demands. They include the takeover of four Ukrainian regions, including areas Russia does not control; Ukraine’s non-Nato “neutrality”; and the removal of Zelenskyy’s government.All the time suspicion grows that the White House appears to be a partner in Russia’s anti-Zelenskyy campaign as Europe’s leaders desperately seek ways to respond as the certainties of the 80-year-old transatlantic alliance crumble before their eyes.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverEuropeKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Several held their faces in their hands. “I think the best way I can describe it is sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,” he continued. “You got their attention, and it’s very significant, obviously, because of the support that we give.”The collapse in US-Ukraine relations since theWhite House summit between Trump and Zelenskyyhas been precipitous. Those around Trump viewed as the strongest supporters of Ukraine – includingsecretary of state Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, and Kellogg – have become vocal sceptics of continued US support or been sidelined entirely.“We know that [the Maga wing] are just waiting for something they can use to pounce,” said a former senior US diplomat. “And I think that’s where you get the posturing by Rubio, Kellogg and also Waltz, which disturbs people who understand America’s interest in preventing a Putin win inUkraine.”It has been matched by a rise in the people around Trump who hold vocally Eurosceptic views: Elon Musk,Tucker Carlson, andJD Vance, the vice-president who seized his moment in the Oval Office and provoked a greater conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy.Vance has made several key interventions meant to sow divisions withEurope. He appears to have planned ahead of time. His team briefed European media before he spoke up during Trump’s meeting with Keir Starmer to complain about “infringements on free speech” in the UK. And when Zelenskyy disregarded advice from Kellogg, Republican senators, and others, not to clash with Trump during the White House meeting, Vance once again poured petrol on the fire.“First Zelenskyy needs to keep silent in public about concerns with Trump’s policy moves, even though those concerns are justified,” the former senior official said. “It would be good for him to send a team to the meeting in Riyadh which is not at his level. I think he needs to sign the mineral agreement in any form that theTrump administrationwants.”Fiona Hill, a former White House official during Trump’s first term, said the speculation on the part of many European officials was that “this was set up by Vance … that he wanted to sideline the Rubios, the Waltzes, the Kelloggs.”These were supposed to be the adults in the room for this administration. Rubio was confirmed 99-0 by senators who believed he would help keep Trump’s foreign policy on track. Waltz was expected to be a centrist ally as national security adviser. And Kellogg, while sceptical of piecemeal support for Kyiv, was seen as a firm supporter of Ukraine.View image in fullscreenThe collapse in relations between the US and Ukraine has been precipitous since the disastrous Oval Office meeting.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockInstead, they have followed Trump into putting pressure on Ukraine. Rubio last week said: “Frankly, it’s a proxy war between nuclear powers – the United States, helping Ukraine, andRussia– and it needs to come to an end.”That was a vision closely aligned with the Kremlin’s. Dmitry Peskov reacted positively to Rubio’s words, saying: “We can and want to agree with it, and we agree with it. That’s the way it is. We have said this repeatedly. We have said that this is actually a conflict between Russia and the collective west. And the main country of the collective west is the United States of America.”That’s not the only way in which the US is adopting Russia’s views on the war. In his speech, Kellogg broke ground in describing how Trump sees the conflict: the US wants to position itself as a neutral arbiter between Russia and Ukraine, and Trump recognises that the US needs to “reset relations with Russia” to secure US national security. “The continued isolation and lack of engagement with the Russians as the war in Ukraine continues is no longer a viable strategy,” he said.That portrayal is a radical realignment of US policy interests in the conflict. For three years, Washington has providedconsiderable financial and military support to Kyivto allow it to stay in the fight. But under a new Trump administration, those who supported the previous policy have quickly pivoted to back Trump as he seeks to end the war by putting pressure on Ukraine.“Kellogg has some people around him who do know what they’re doing,” said Hill, who worked with him during the first Trump term. “He’s 80 years old. He fought in Vietnam. He knows his stuff. He’s no fan of Russia. He’s a total cold warrior. He’s trying to thread the needle there but he also works for the commander in chief, so he’s trying to interpret, in the best way that he can, what’s going on here? And he will not stray away from what Trump does or says, that’s why he is still there.”Yet Kellogg was left off the list for a key summit betweenUkrainian and US officials this week in Saudi Arabiain an attempt to repair the relationship. Waltz, Rubio, and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are set to travel for talks with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak and his team. The path forward is unclear – although both pro-Ukraine Americans and European officials believe that there is no alternative to US support in the conflict.European officials are hopeful that Zelenskyy and the Trump officials can manage to hold a meeting that won’t erupt into open conflict. That may lead to a quick renewal of intelligence support, which European officials have not lost hope for.But there are broader discussions about whether or not the US remains a viable longterm partner for Ukraine. For now, the Ukrainian side has few options except to make amends.Explore more on these topicsUkraineThe ObserverVolodymyr ZelenskyyTrump administrationJD VanceRussiaMarco RubioEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, and Richard Hudson, the chair of the GOP’s fundraising body,decidedthe embarrassment had to end, and they told Republicans to stop holding the public events.But while that might save some Republican politicians from public humiliation, it could also deprive Americans of opportunities to interact with their elected officials, experts said, and prevent people from letting their representatives they are not happy with the increasingly divisive direction of the Trump administration.Packed Pacs: how billionaires in the US are bankrolling Republicans at the state levelRead more“It’s certainly a unique view of representation that representatives should hear only from constituents who agree with them,” said Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University Bloomington.“But it’s entirely in keeping with the recent direction of the Republican party: to become more and more extreme because they listen only to their far-right base.”Johnson and Hudson’s edict came after several Republican town halls were interrupted in recent weeks. Scott Fitzgerald, a four-year congressman, faced an angry crowd at an event in West Bend, Wisconsin, in late February. Fitzgerald was repeatedly booed as he defended the role of Elon Musk, in particular.Apparently misjudging his audience, Fitzgerald said Musk is “getting rid of the DEI”, to loud jeers, before receiving a similar reaction when he praised “the fraud and abuse that has been discovered” by the department of government efficiency.Avideo from TMJ4showed attendees carrying signs including “Presidents are not kings” and “No cuts to Medicaid”. Glenn Grothman, also from Wisconsin, received similar treatment at a town hall a couple of days later, being loudly booed as he claimed that “across the board [Trump] has done some very good things”, including birthright citizenship and – using the same phrasing as Fitzgerald – “getting rid of the DEI”.Marshall fared even worse. He left a public meeting after 40 minutes, the 64-year-old senatortelling a hostile audience: “If you’re rude, which you’re being, I’m going to leave,” as he defended Trump’s extraordinary row with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a day earlier.That was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back, as Johnson and Hudson rushed to their party members’ aid. While some Republicans, including Fitzgerald, havesuggestedthey may buck party leadership, plenty will likely be relieved to use the screen provided by their leadership. But there are concerns about how this will affect Americans’ democratic rights, especially as the cancelling of town halls comes after Trump began to deny highly regarded news organizations access to the White House.“President Trump’s insistence on choosing which reporters get to travel with him and attend press conferences is in keeping with [this] effort,” Hershey said.“I think the people who wrote the constitution would argue that this is exactly the kind of behavior the American revolution was fought to stop.”She added: “Town halls are not the only way that constituents can express their views to representatives. But they are a meaningful way: not every citizen can access Zoom, and expressing our views in person is an important way of conveying a depth of feeling that isn’t as easily expressed in a letter, an email, or a visit to a representative’s staff member.”In issuing his town hall order,in a closed-door meeting, Hudson compared the atmosphere to town halls during Trump’s first term in 2017. Then Republican town halls repeatedly turned contentious as the Trump-led party sought to strip down the Affordable Care Act. There is a neat earlier precedent in the anger that erupted at Democrats’ town halls in 2012, as the Tea Party movement, seen as precursor to Trump’s Make America great again movement, disrupted Democrats’ public events in protest against the Affordable Care Act, which,according tothe department of the treasury, has helped nearly 50m Americans access health care.Daniel B Markovits, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Columbia, haspublished researchon congressional town halls with fellow academic Andrew J Clarke. Markovits said that while there is no legal obligation for members of congress to hold town halls, people could lose out if Republicans follow through with their threat to limit in-district appearances.“A huge amount of what members of Congress do is non-partisan case work. It could be like: ‘There’s a problem with my social security check’, or: ‘I have trouble with whatever government agency,’” Markovits said.“A lot of this is done through staff, but sometimes it happens at town hall. So in common times, a lot of town hall questions are: ‘Here’s this problem, I want your help. I want you to interfere on my behalf.’ Or: ‘There’s a road broken in town.’ So there’s a lot of very clearly non-partisan business that happens at these things.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A poll in 2013foundthat Congress was less popular than hemorrhoids, cockroaches and toenail fungus, and there is little to suggest the law-making body has gone up in people’s estimations since then. That could become worse if politicians are seen as becoming more out of touch with their constituents – something a lack of public interaction could exacerbate.“There’s a lot of research saying that voters live in a bubble, which I think is true. But I think we shouldn’t understate the extent to which politicians can live in a bubble too,” Markowits said.“And there’s some good work showing that politicians don’t have the best understanding of their constituents’ beliefs. So I think one of the things you might see if these [town halls] stop happening, you might expect members of Congress to overstate, maybe even more than they already do, the extent to which their voters are agreeing with them.”Trump and Johnson have claimed, without evidence, that “paid troublemakers” are responsible for their members’ poor reception at town halls, something Democrats, including Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, have denied.“We don’t need paid protestors,” Jeffries said ina poston BlueSky. “The American people are with us.”Some local Democratic parties have encouraged members to attend town halls and air concerns, while Indivisible, a progressive activist organization formed during Trump’s first term, has listed events and sought to highlight some of the more contentious aspects of both the Trump presidency and the Democratic response.The organization, and others, are now planning to hold “empty chair town halls” in Republican districts – where they invite members of Congress to attend public forums, and hold a discussion anyway if they do not.“People who choose to go into public service, and have as your job that you are paid to represent other people, part of that job is talking to those people that you represent. And if you don’t like to do that, that’s okay. You can go become a lobbyist, you can go and do something else. Nobody is forcing you to represent other human beings in the United States Congress,” said Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible.“But if you want to have that job, you’ve got two choices. You can show up and defend your positions, or you can hide and we’ll make sure people know you’re a coward.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Putin has also invited Trump to visit Moscow, which if accepted would be the first visit by an American president to Russia since 2009.12 February – rules out Nato membership for UkraineOn the same day as the Putin-Trump call, US defence secretary Pete Hegsethruled out Nato membershipfor Ukraine.View image in fullscreenThe Nato meeting in Brussels in February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesHegseth, speaking at a summit in Brussels, said it was “unrealistic” forUkraineto expect to return to its pre-2014 borders, and insisted that any peace agreement would have to be secured by “capable European and non-European troops”, whom he stressed would not come from the US.14 February – ignores Ukraine war to attack European allies in Munich speechEuropean leaders were stunned when US vice-president JD Vancelaunched a blistering ideological attackon Washington’s allies and questioned whether the US and Europe any longer had a shared agenda.View image in fullscreenJD Vance in Munich.Photograph: Johannes Simon/Getty ImagesVance had been expected to address the critical question of the Ukraine war in his speech at this year’s Munich security conference, but instead he barely mentioned the conflict and instead argued that the true threat to Europe came not from Russia or China, but from what he called a retreat from its “most fundamental values” of protecting free speech.18 February – holds talks to agree on improving diplomatic relationsTop US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia tohold their most extensive high-level talkssince Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, during which they agreed to work towards ending the war and improving US-Russian diplomatic and economic ties.The talks in Riyadh, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, marked a tectonic shift in Washington’s approach to Moscow and a dramatic break with Joe Biden’s efforts to isolate Russia.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio shakes hands with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh.Photograph: SPA/AFP/Getty ImagesNo Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting.19 February – blames Kyiv for starting the war, calls for elections in UkraineTrumpappeared to blame Kyiv for Moscow’s invasionand said he was “disappointed” that Zelenskyy complained about being left out of US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia.Trump also pressured Zelenskyy to hold elections – echoing one of Moscow’s key demands. Under Ukraine’s constitution,elections are suspendedwhile martial law is in force.Later that day, Trump escalated his attacks on Zelenskyy bycalling him a “dictator”warning that he “better move fast” or he “won’t have a country left”.View image in fullscreenTrump on Air Force One.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images24 February – votes with Russia in the UN resolutionsIn a dramatic shift in transatlantic relations, the US split with its European allies and sided with Russiain votes at the United Nationsto mark the third anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The US joined Russia, Belarus and North Korea in voting against a European-drafted UN general assembly resolution condemning Russia’s actions and supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It was the first time since the Russian invasion that the US voted against a resolution backed by Ukraine.View image in fullscreenAmbassador Dorothy Camille Shea, chargé d’affaires ad interim of the United States.Photograph: Michael M Santiago/Getty ImagesThe US then drafted and voted for a resolution in the UN security council which called for a “swift end to the conflict”, but contained no criticism of Russia. The Kremlin praised Washington for its “much more balanced” stance and backed the resolution.28 February – publicly berates Zelenskyy in the Oval OfficeIn an Oval Office meeting that will surely remembered asone of the greatest diplomatic disasters in modern history,Trump and Vance teamed up to openly berate and humiliate Zelenskyy in front of the world’s cameras.Zelenskyy had travelled to Washington to discuss a minerals deal with the US that was meant to pave the way towards a ceasefire with Russia. Instead, the meeting devolved into acrimony and chaos and a joint press conference to announce the deal was cancelled.3:20'Make a deal or we are out': the worst of Trump and Zelenskyy’s clash – videoRussian officialsreacted with gleeto the extraordinary scenes.1 March – retreats from fight against Russian cyber threatsThe Guardian reportedthat the Trump administration has publicly and privately signaled that it does not believe Russia represents a cyber threat against US national security or critical infrastructure, marking a radical departure from longstanding intelligence assessments.Analysts at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been instructed not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.3 and 5 March: suspends US military aid and intelligence sharing to UkraineShortly after the Oval Office blow-up, the Trump administrationsuspended delivery of all US military aidandstopped sharing intelligencewith Ukraine, part of a pressure campaign to force Kyiv to cooperate with the White House’s plans to negotiate a peace deal with Russia.US national security adviser Mike Waltz confirmed the US had “taken a step back” and was reviewing “all aspects” of its relationship with Ukraine.

They don’t have the cards.” He added that he has “always had a good relationship” with Putin.Asked if the Russian leader was taking advantage of the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, Trump replied: “I think he’s doing what anyone else would do.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpRussiaUS foreign policyUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

There is little middle ground inthe bitter lobbying battle over zonal pricing, the proposal that Great Britain’s electricity market should be split into regions with prices set by local supply and demand. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, must decide in the next few months, in time for this summer’s auction for new wind and solar projects.One camp – led by Greg Jackson, the politically plugged-in founder of OctopusEnergy, the UK’s biggest retail energy supplier – argues that customers’ bills will “skyrocket” unless zonal pricing is adopted. It points to the wasted money spent paying windfarms to shut down when, for example, it is blowing a gale in Shetland and the local grid is overloaded with more power than can be transported south.Constraint costs were about £1bn last year, according to figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso). The figure covers payments to windfarms to stop generating plus the cost of requiring other generators to fire up on the other side on a bottleneck. The cost all ends up on bills – indeed, constraint payments equated to 2.4% of consumers’ total electricity bills last year.Flexible zonal pricing would fix the problem – or prevent it getting worse, advocates argue. More generating capacity would be built nearer to where it is needed. Demand would move nearer to supply. Overall costs would fall because price signals would force the system to run more efficiently. Fewer pylons might be required. They paint a happy picture of windyScotlandas a place of low bills and a background purr of AI datacentres running on cheap energy.The bulk of the rest of the industry – to judge by the 55 signatories of a letter to the government last month – thinks the zonal vision is dreamy nonsense. It would “do nothing” to reduce bills, is “completely at odds with the government’s clean power mission” and should be ruled out “at the earliest opportunity”, wrote those developers, generators and investors.Windfarms need to be where it is windy, and London is not awash with open spaces for large solar installations, runs this line of thinking. There would be a “postcode lottery” for consumers on bills. And latency issues in telecoms connections may mean Scotland never becomes an AI paradise.Then there is the objectors’ argument about pure money: if zonal pricing is seen as a riskier proposition, any imagined savings could evaporate via higher financing costs. The sprint to clean power by 2030, as Miliband characterises it, involves a £200bn investment programme from the private sector over five years.“You would be asking people to invest £40bn a year into a market that they no longer understand how it works,” says Keith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower. “You are at risk of slowing down investment or people pricing that risk into the [renewables] auction.”The quarrel is accompanied by a war of big numbers and long reports by consultants. Octopus quotes savings for consumers of at least £55bn on the way to 2050, citinga report it commissioned from FTI Consulting. In the other direction, Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive of SSE,points to LCP Delta’s conclusionthat adding a single percentage point to the cost of capital would increase the cost of the energy transition by about £50bn.Who will win this scrap? At the moment, the outcome looks to be genuinely up in the air. There is “civil war” among officials at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero on the issue, says one insider. One can make a few observations, however.First, the current market structure will not last. “The amount you have to pay windfarms to get constrained off – the amount that we end up with a system that is inefficient – if we do absolutely nothing, I think means it is not economically credible for British consumers to leave it as it is,” said Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, the energy regulator,on the Montel News podcastlast month.The choice, then, is between zonal pricing or a rejig of the current national market to try to make it more efficient, probably by forcing changes to internal transmission charges and established balancing mechanisms.Either way, the goal will be to avoid the danger of shambolic events – for example, bill payers paying UK windfarms to turn off their turbines while power is simultaneously imported via an interconnector from Norway.Second, Ofgem has made up its mind. “We’ve had a robust debate within Ofgem … and we have come to the view that zonal pricing is the best way forward,” Brearley said. If Miliband were to reject that view, he would be refusing the advice of the independent regulator – albeit Brearley revealed that Ofgem’s board was not unanimous in its thinking.Third, if he backs zonal pricing, Miliband should worry about the backlash. The companies may not be bluffing about higher financing costs and reduced risk appetites.Last year’srenewables auctionresulted in contracts for difference, or CfDs (essentially a guaranteed price for output), of roughly £59 per megawatt hour (expressed in 2012 prices under the government’s weird accounting system) for new offshore wind projects. Energy analysts’ guess had been £62-£64 per MWh this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionA £70-plus outcome if developers are genuinely in “too much uncertainty” mode would be politically embarrassing. Miliband would be sanctioning a roughly 20% year-on-year increase at a moment when he is trying to hold the line that more renewables will mean cheaper bills by 2030.Fourth, to soothe developers’ fears, the government could spell out exactly what it meant whenit said last autumnthat existing windfarms with CfDs, and those bidding into AR7, would be “insulated from zonal price risk” if a zonal system is adopted.Owners of windfarms say the wording is too vague. It would be hard for the government to justify across-the-board compensation. Some windfarms – including a portion with old-style renewables obligations certificates, the pre-CfD subsidy scheme – have enjoyed lucrative returns. But clarity might help.Fifth, there’s always the option of kicking the can down the road. After all, the £70bn upgrade to the transmission network, part of the overall £200bn clean power programme, is partly designed to ensure constraint costs don’t spiral upwards.Anderson of ScottishPower says he is not against zonal pricing in principle but the debate should happen once the new network infrastructure is built and constraint bottlenecks can be reassessed. “Why do it when we are in the largest investment programme we have tried to do in the UK?,” he argues. “Don’t do it in one fat lump that scares the bejesus out of everybody.”The counterargument is: if you truly believe the flexibility of zonal pricing is essential to make a renewables-heavy intermittent system function efficiently, you should do it as soon as possible, especially if advocates are correct in saying reform would limit constraint costs if transmission upgrades do not arrive on time. Remember that even Neso says the government’s 2030 target for clean power will push the limits of what is feasibly deliverable.There are, then, no easy, risk-free options. The dry-sounding “review of electricity market arrangements” started three years ago under the previous government and sounded at the time like a subject only for energy boffins.Instead, as constraint costs have risen with the renewables rollout, the idea of zonal pricing has become a critical policy decision. It affects not only the UK’s electricity system and consumers’ bills but also industrial policy. Miliband is entering a minefield.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergy billsWind powerConsumer affairsRenewable energyHousehold billsEnergyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Frank Bennett reflects on the impact of discovering that a police spy had stolen his dead brother’s identity to infiltrate two leftwing organisations, and to deceive a woman into a sexual relationshipThe Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed is available now on ITVXThis episode first aired on 9 December 2020.In 2018,Frank Bennett’s sister Honor received a hand-delivered letter from a public inquiry about their 18-year-old brother Michael Hartley, who had been reported missing at sea, believed dead, 50 years before. For a moment, they thought Michael had been found, but in fact, the letter revealed that their dead brother’s identity had been stolen by a police officer who had penetrated two leftwing organisations. Using this false identity, the police spy had deceived a woman into a sexual relationship and had been prosecuted during his deployment. Frank talks toAnushka Asthanaabout his childhood and the impact his brother’s death had on him and his family. Knowing that, years on, his brother’s name had been used by police has had a huge impact on his mental health, he says. Frank describes the police’s behaviour as “disgusting”.Anushka also talks to Guardian investigative editorPaul Lewisand Guardian investigative reporterRob Evansabout their decade-long investigation with activists to uncover the activities of theSpecial Demonstration Squad (SDS). Over four decades,at least 139 police officerswere given fake identities to closely monitor the inner workings ofmore than 1,000 political groups. Some of those identities had been stolen from dead children to lend credibility to their aliases – and some officers,in a macabre ritual, even visited the graves of the children whose identities they were using.The work of activists and the Guardian has resulted in a judge-led public inquiry on a statutory level with other significant inquiries, such as Lord Saville’sinvestigation into Bloody Sundayand the Chilcot examinationof the Iraq invasion.If you have been affected by this podcast, the Samaritans are available for counselling on 116 123.Archive: Channel 4 News; BBC; YouTube; Independent; ITNIllustration: Sébastien Thibault/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsUK newsToday in FocusPoliceMetropolitan police"

But then restore the context – the modest front gardens, the satellite dishes and telephone wires – and we’re in a housing estate in Cardiff in summer 2020 under a glowering grey sky. To the side a flower girl, finger in mouth, fixes the photographer (whose shadow we glimpse at the bottom alongside that of his flash) with an interrogative scowl.Bruno had been living in Wales for a decade at this point but he shoots the scene – and others in his wonderful seriesTa-ra– with an outsider’s eye, picking out heightened moments in everyday settings. The series, which won the 2022 Mallorca prize for contemporary photography and was later published as a book by Ediciones Anómalas, was shot over the course of 10 years, focusing mainly on working-class urban areas around south Wales. These communities reminded Bruno of where he grew up in Argentina. “People were outside all the time and there were lots of things going on in the street,” he says approvingly of one deprived neighbourhood in Newport. At the same time, he was acutely aware of the damage wrought there by years of Tory austerity and the fallout from Brexit.In this particular instance, he had tagged along with the official photographer at a Traveller wedding in Tremorfa, in Cardiff, and spent the day taking pictures off to the side with his medium-format camera. He’d never shot a wedding before; the other images in Ta-ra tend to be far more muted, prioritising a washed-out sense of dislocation. “At one point they wanted to get a picture in the neighbour’s front garden,” he recalls. “I took two pictures of the bride and bridesmaids, who were looking at the other photographer. Then the little girl appeared and made eye contact with me and it all fell into place.”Ta-ra is at Galerie VU in Paris until 11 April, then tours the UK later this year.Sebastián Bruno’s The Dynamicis at the National Museum Cardiff until 30 MarchExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureArtWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is my decision,” the journalist wrote on X, after the radio station suspended him from air for a week.On 25 February he said on air: “Every year in France, we commemorate what happened inOradour-sur-Glane– the massacre of an entire village. But we have committed hundreds of these, in Algeria. Are we aware of this?”He was referring to the village where an SS unit returning to the front in Normandy massacred 642 residents on 10 June 1944. Leaving a chilling memorial for future generations, the village was never rebuilt.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a Peugeot 202 car in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, France.Photograph: David Forster/AlamyChallenged by the anchor over whether “we [the French] behaved like the Nazis”, Aphatie said: “The Nazis behaved like us.”On X, he acknowledged his comments had created a “debate” but said it was of great importance to understand the full story over France’s 1830-1962 presence in Algeria, saying he was “horrified” by what he had read in history books.After being suspended for a week by the channel it means that “if I come back to RTL I validate this and admit to making a mistake”.“This is a line that cannot be crossed.”His comments had prompted a flurry of complaints to audio-visual regulator Arcom, which has opened an investigation.France’s conduct in Algeria during the 1954-62 war that led to independence and previous decades remain the subject of often painful debate in both countries.Historians from both sides have over the last years documented numerous violations including arbitrary killings and detention carried out by French forces and the history still burdens French-Algerian relations to this day.The far right in France has long defended French policies in those years with Algeria War veteran Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the National Front (FN) party and died earlier this year, drawing much support from French settlers who had to return after independence.Explore more on these topicsFranceAlgeriaSecond world warAfricaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The actor John Kani paid tribute on X on Sunday, saying “I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend”. The mayor’s office in Cape Town said: “Athol Fugard was not just a luminary in the world of theatre; he was a teller of profound stories of hope and resilience aboutSouth Africa.”A major political dissident playwright of the 20th century, Fugard wrote more than 30 dramas including Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act (in 1972) and“Master Harold” … and the Boys(1982). Both of those drew upon the time in the 1950s when he could only find employment as a clerk in one of the courts where black South Africans were charged (and inevitably convicted) of breaches of the “pass laws”, designed to control the movements of a racially segregated population under the apartheid system. There, he witnessed hourly the dehumanisation of those who had chosen the “wrong” streets or people.Athol Fugard caught the impact of apartheid’s full-on attack on humanity | David LanRead moreFugard’s cultural and political impact was rivalled elsewhere only by the dramas ofVáclav Havelin what was then Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Havel was jailed and, when released, abandoned theatre to become the first president of the Czech Republic. Fugard – despite setting up two theatre companies in the segregated black townships and courageously refusing to play to the state-mandated “whites only” audiences – avoided prison, due to being white and therefore not a primary target of the racist government. The worst direct personal persecutions Fugard suffered were the removal of his passport and the occasional banning of plays and burning of books. He was always conscious, though, of benefiting from the immoral hierarchy his writing decried.View image in fullscreenDuty of education … Athol Fugard.Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianThe writer’s race would also have made him an impossible political leader in the new Republic of South Africa: its dissident turned president in the Havel manner wasNelson Mandela, who had a strong background presence in Fugard’s plays, especiallyThe Island(1972), set on Robben Island, the penitentiary for political prisoners where Mandela had spent some of his 27 years of incarceration.Born in 1932, Fugard was the only child of Harold, from an immigrant family of Irish descent, and Elizabeth, whose Potgieter clan were among the early Afrikaans settlers of Dutch stock. A jazz pianist turned shopkeeper, Harold moved his family in 1935 to Port Elizabeth, an urban industrial town that remained Fugard’s main home and most regular dramatic setting for the next nine decades.During his childhood, the family ran a hotel and cafe in Port Elizabeth where “Hally” (as the young Athol was known) grew up. There, as a teenager in the late 1940s, an incident occurred that would lie at the heart of his psychology and creativity. In published extracts from his notebooks, Fugard explained how Sam Semela, a black employee in the family businesses, became “the most significant – the only – friend of my boyhood years”. But, after a “rare quarrel”, Hally pulled racial rank and spat in Semela’s face.While confiding to his journal that he would never be able to “deal with the shame that overwhelmed me the second after”, Fugard made literary recompense with “Master Harold” … and the Boys, its title acknowledging a racist hierarchy between white people and their servants that is overturned by a devastatingly apologetic depiction of how the demon of superiority can rise even in the mind of someone who defines as a liberal: the spitting scene is its climax. One of the dedicatees of the published play is “Sam”, with whom Fugard had been reconciled.Public admission of this shaming story was typical of Fugard’s personal honesty, but can also be seen as an attempt to forestall any “saint” or “saviour” interpretation of his work. The contemporary pejorative term “white saviour”, with its implication of credit stolen and virtue claimed, was not yet widely used, but, once it was, Fugard faced retrospective accusation.A complication arose with the working methods of the AfricanTheatreWorkshop and Serpent Players, two multi-racial companies Fugard and his wife, Shiela (also a writer) formed either side of 1960, first in Johannesburg and then Port Elizabeth. Early Fugard plays such as No-Good Friday (1958), Nongogo (1959) and The Coat (1966) improvised scenes with actors based on their own experiences and then created a fixed text for performance.View image in fullscreenSean Taylor and Owen Sejake in The Train Driver by Athol Fugard at Hampstead theatre in 2010.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs a major Fugard scholar, Professor Dennis Walder, has pointed out, it was yet another horror of the system that the writer could only work with colleagues of colour at his home by registering them, for bureaucratic purposes, as his domestic staff.Fugard’s desire to collaborate with the wronged community, rather than writing anti-apartheid stories from an isolated study in a white area (a criticism of some contemporaries), can reasonably be seen as another compensating response to the Sam shame. But a majority black co-operative run by a white man subsequently raised issues of “appropriation” to which Fugard was alert: editions of The Island and its companion play,Sizwe Banzi Is Dead(1972), in which someone takes on the identity of a dead man in order to use his “pass book” (ID papers), have the credit “devised by Athol Fugard,John KaniandWinston Ntshona”, with royalties split three ways.The circumstances in which Fugard’s early plays were made now sound like something from dystopian fiction. The South African police would raid rehearsals, check scripts and take the names of actors; it became standard for performers to be listed in programmes and on posters under the identities of fictional characters they had previously played.The end of apartheid and Mandela’s presidency removed, from 1994, what the novelistNadine Gordimerhad called “the only subject” for white liberal writers in South Africa. Fugard, though, wrote plays that effectively reflected the country’s “truth and reconciliation” phase of attempted restorative justice.InThe Train Driver(2010), his strongest late work, the white title character seeks out the family of a black mother and child who died when they stepped in front of his train; inSorrows And Rejoicing(2001), the family of a dead, white anti-apartheid writer reflect on the evasions of his life.That Fugard continued as a dramatist even when the driving cause of his first plays was achieved was due to the incompleteness of the victory. Whereas anti-Soviet dramas now have only historical interest – as relative democracy has continued in Russia’s former bloc – the 2021revival of Fugard’s Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act, at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, remained disconcertingly relevant.While the specific evil it dramatised – the ban on interracial sex in South Africa from 1927 to 1985 – was gone, the play now served a new purpose: a metaphor for the continuing inequalities of opportunity and security suffered by people of colour around the world. The unexpected longevity of Statements continued a paradox that ran through Fugard’s career: situations that he detested as a citizen were his dramatic fuel.Parents leaving the London production of Statements could be heard explaining to appalled children that the immorality laws had existed in a Commonwealth country during the lifetime of anyone older than 36. That duty of education will keep Fugard’s plays in the theatrical canon, as will the broader lessons of Statements, “Master Harold” … and the Boys and The Island in how racism roots and grows. His 1980 novel Tsotsi, about crime in Johannesburg, was adapted as an Oscar-winning 2005 film, directed by Gavin Hood.Fugard would have been the first to acknowledge that others, such as Kani and Ntshona, were the theatrical Mandelas of free South Africa, but the man who called himself “a classic example of the impotent, white liberal” was an epitome of the good people who, inHannah Arendt’s formulation, must act if evil is not to prevail.Explore more on these topicsAthol FugardTheatreSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania were also on the list. But perpetrators also included militias and other non-state actors.Telecommunication and internet service providers who shut services based on government orders are also complicit in violating people’s rights, said Felicia Anthonio, the #KeepItOn campaign manager at Access Now, citing theUN guiding principles on business and human rights.The details showed that most of the shutdowns were imposed as a response to conflicts, protests and political instability. There were also restrictions during elections.The trend was replicated across the world with more internet shutdowns and in more countries: 296 shutdowns across 54 countries, compared with 283 shutdowns in 39 countries the previous year.Access Now said the figures were the worst since it started keeping records in 2016 and that the rise reflected “a world where internet access is consistently weaponised, restricted, and precarious”.“Behind each of the 1,754 shutdowns since 2016 is a story of people and communities cut off from the world and each other, often during political upheaval, unrest, violence and war,” the report said.At least five shutdowns in Africa had been imposed for more than a year by the end of 2024, according to Access Now. As of early 2025, the social network Meta was still restricted in Uganda, despite authorities engaging with its representatives. On the Equatorial Guinean island of Annobon, internet and cell serviceshave been cut offsince an August 2024 protest over environmental concerns and isolation from the rest of the country.The increase in shutdowns led the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to pass a landmark resolution in March 2024 to help reverse the trend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is difficult for us to tell if the resolution is yielding results already, but we did see authorities in countries likeMauritiusand South Sudan [in January 2025] backtrack or reverse shutdown orders.”Explore more on these topicsInternetAfricaHuman rightsComorosGuinea-BissauMauritiusBurundinewsShareReuse this content"

Last week Donald Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carveout for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada’s fragile economy in a recession.“America is notCanada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney told supporters, laying bare the existential crisis that has outraged Canadians, riven the longstanding relationship with the US, and promises to be the overarching theme in his tenure as prime minister.View image in fullscreenBefore the announcement, Trudeau said he was ‘damn proud’ of his government’s legacy.Photograph: Blair Gable/ReutersCarney said that while Canada had not asked for the fight: “We will win.”Before the announcement, the outgoing prime minister,Justin Trudeau, electrified the crowd by telling Liberals he was “damn proud” of his government’s legacy.But he warned of dangerous time for the country. “This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,” he told supporters.He also drew on the “elbows up” rallying cry to intense applause – a phrase from ice hockey legend Gordie Howe popularised in recent weeks after threats from Trump to annex Canada.It is unclear when Carney, who was governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, will assume office. Trudeau and the new Liberal leader are expected to hold conversations in the coming days to determine the outgoing prime minister’s final day in office.With 85.9% of the vote, Carney beat the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, the former government house leader Karina Gould and the former member of parliament Frank Baylis.Carney has followed anunusual path to power: he will be only the second prime minister in Canadian history without a seat in the House of Commons. While no rule bars this, convention suggests Carney will need to quickly announce plans to run for a federal seat.He will also be the first Liberal prime minister from western Canada, a valuable identity in a country that is politically divided along geographical lines.Carney spent much of his campaign pitching himself as an outsider, despite years-long ties to the Liberal party, including serving as an economic adviser to Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister.His definitive victory, foreshadowed by fundraising success and a spate of key endorsements from senior cabinet members with vast organising networks, could energise the incumbent Liberals.In recent weeks, theparty has reversed its political freefall,sharply rebounding to such a degree that a previously expected Conservative majority in the next general election looks increasingly unlikely.Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead moreThe shift in the polls has been so dramatic that pollsters have struggled to find any historical precedent.In a leaked memo, the leftwing federal New Democratic party recently warned its members Carney would probably call a snap election within days of winning the leadership race, capitalising on his rising popularity and depriving the opposition parties the rich political optics of bringing down the Liberal government through a vote of non-confidence to force an election.The move in the polls is, in part, explained by repeated threats by Trump to annex Canada. In polling, Carney is widely viewed as the most trusted federal leader to navigate the current trade crisis because of his extensive economic background.“My government will keep the tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,” said Carney.Carney also attacked the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, the current frontrunner if an election were held soon, calling him a “career politician” who was running a deeply divisive campaign. “Division doesn’t win in a tariff war,” Carney said.But in recent weeks, several fumbles have underlined the challenges in moving from the corporate world to politics.Carney has waffled over his role at the investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, when it moved its headquarters from Toronto to New York – a politically sensitive issue given recent pressure from the US on businesses to uproot and move south.His attempts to clarify the issue prompted the Globe and Mail’s editorial board to praise him as a “fast learner in the art of prevarication and hairsplitting”.He has promised to put his substantial assets,believed to be valuedat more than C$30m (£16m), into a blind trust immediately.Speaking before the new leader was announced, former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Trump had united Canadians “like never before” and jokingly called on him to receive the country’s highest honours as thanks.“From one old guy to another old guy. Stop this nonsense. Canada will never join the United States,” he said to raucous cheers.“No one will starve us into submission because Canada is and will remain the best country in the world.

Yoon climbed into a black van headed to his presidential residence in the capital.In a statement distributed by his lawyers, Yoon said that he “appreciates the courage and decision by the Seoul central district court to correct illegality”, in an apparent reference to legal disputes over his arrest. He said he also thanked his supporters and asked those who were on hunger strike against his impeachment to end it.Has South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?Read moreOn Saturday, about 55,000 Yoon supporters rallied in Seoul’s main districts, while 32,500 people demonstrated against him near the constitutional court, Yonhap news agency reported, citing unofficial police estimates.The public, however, remains largely anti-Yoon, with 60% of respondents saying he should be removed from office and 35% opposing removal, according to a Gallup Korea poll on Friday.Yoon was arrestedand indicted by prosecutors in January over his3 December martial law decree, which plunged the country into political turmoil. The liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly separately voted to impeach him, leading to his suspension from office.2:02How the South Korean president's martial law declaration unfolded – videoThe constitutional court has been deliberating whether to formally dismiss or reinstate Yoon. If the court upholds his impeachment, a national election will be held to find his successor within two months.The Seoul central district court said on Friday it accepted Yoon’s request to be released from prison, citing the need to address questions over the legality of the investigations of the president. Yoon’s lawyers have accused the investigative agency that detained him before his formal arrest of lacking legal authority to investigate rebellion charges.The Seoul court also said the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted.Yoon’s release came after prosecutors decided not to appeal against the decision by the Seoul court. South Korean law allows prosecutors to continue to hold a suspect while pursuing an appeal, even after his or her arrest is cancelled by a court.The main liberal opposition Democratic party, which led Yoon’s 14 December impeachment, lashed out at the prosecutors’ decision, calling them “henchmen” of Yoon, a former prosecutor general. Party spokesperson Cho Seung-rae urged the constitutional court to dismiss Yoon as soon as possible to avoid further public unrest and anxiety.Investigators have alleged Yoon’s martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he is convicted of that offence, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions but that does not cover grave charges like rebellion and treason.Yoon has said he did not intend to maintain martial law for long as he only attempted to inform the public of the danger of the Democratic party, which obstructed his agenda and impeached many senior officials and prosecutors. In his martial law announcement, Yoon called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces”.South Korea’s conservative-liberal divide is severe and rallies either supporting or denouncing Yoon’s impeachment have divided Seoul streets. Experts say whatever decision the constitutional court makes, the division is certain to worsen.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It discussed “social cohesion measures”, includinga $25m packageannounced in October 2023 to strengthen resilience and improve support to Australian Palestinian, Muslim and other communities in Australia after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent war waged by Israel in Gaza. A total of $52.8m had been approved for social cohesion measures relating to the conflict, according to the document.On the perception of the government at that time, the Department of Home Affairs told the minister that Palestinian and Muslim communities were “feeling extremely angry, hurt, and betrayed by the perceived one-sided government messaging and lack of support for Palestinians in Gaza, and for Australian communities”.The department said community members were traumatised by the conflict, distressed about the welfare of those in Gaza, and felt that “statements from senior leaders are undoing previous progress on improving social cohesion”.Communities had called for “more balanced statements from the government” amid fear about increasedIslamophobiaand hate speech, the department advised, and the response to the funding announcement had been lukewarm.Albanese and Coalition continue to back two-state solution despite Trump’s vow to ‘take over’ Gaza StripRead moreThe brief stated that Jewish communities were appreciative of the funding announcements but were concerned the package’s funding would not be accessible to all Jewish Australian communities, and feared for their safety and instances of antisemitism.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA total of $7m of the package to support Palestinian and Muslim communities was set aside for media organisations, with AAP and SBS given $3m in funding to combat misinformation and disinformation about the war. This fundingwas scrutinised in mid-2024in Senate estimates, and Palestinian groups expressed frustration at the partial reallocation, given another $25m in funding had gone directly to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.The 2023 briefing document cited the “significant media interest” in the conflict and its impacts in Australia, and stated that the funding rationale was based on community concern about “misleading, divisive and insensitive” coverage.“There is significant media interest in the Hamas-Israel conflict, including how its impacts are being felt and played out in the domestic setting and government’s response,” the department stated. “Communities have reported that statements from public leaders have polarised public debate, exacerbated tensions, and decreased impacted communities’ sense of belonging.”Home Affairs was cognisant of the potential issues involved in Australia’s security department becoming involved in media factchecking through funding, noting that the department “could be criticised for impinging on the editorial independence of” both AAP and SBS and be perceived as “censoring public debate and discussion or political opinions”.The department had previously faced criticism from the right, including politicians such asLiberal Alex Antic, formaking over 500 requeststo social media companies to take down misinformation and disinformation related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Its advice highlighted that the grant guidelines under the funding package highlighted both agencies’ editorial independence, and the department “will not and cannot seek to influence editorial decisions”.When asked about the department’s decision to divert some funding to media organisations, rather then entirely to the community directly, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia: “There are serious challenges at the moment in making sure the government supports communities through an extraordinarily difficult time. I’m focused on that and I’m continuing to consult with the relevant groups.”In the past 18 months, the opposition has criticised the Albanese governmentover its response to rising incidents of antisemitism in Australia. It has accused Labor of failing to offer appropriate support to Israelin the region, including after Australia split with the USin a December vote at the UNthat called on the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelAntisemitismIslamophobiaAustralian security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

The second truck, while trying to avoid the first, tipped over on to its side. The two vehicles did not hit each other.NSW police superintendent Scott Tanner said four soldiers were still “trapped” inside the vehicles when he arrived on the scene.One truck had left the road and had overturned in a paddock, while the other was blocking the entire road.“Tregeagle Road is a small country road, not very wide,” he said.“It was a very hectic scene when we arrived. We had patients of varying injuries up and down the roadway and four persons trapped.”All of the soldiers were wearing seatbelts, Tanner said.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe ADF was deployed to Lismore to help the community brace for the impact of Alfred and expected flooding after days of torrential rainfall. The city was hit by unprecedented flooding in 2022: this year the city has been left without power or water for 72 hours but levee banks on the Wilsons River have held – so far.The prime minister,Anthony Albanese, said there were 32 soldiers onboard the two trucks: 13 were injured, six seriously. By Sunday 12 remained in Lismore Base hospital, two in a serious condition. NSW police said everyone had been wearing seatbelts.“Everyone at the scene did their best to look after their mates,” Albanese said on Sunday morning.“For the extraordinary members of the Australian defence force there are no easy days, every day could bring danger, every day carries risk and yet they step up and face them for us, the Australian people.“These men and women are heroes who were on their way to help people in need. They were doing this at a time when some of their own families were bearing the brunt of Alfred.”The two army trucks had been configured to carry troops – 16 were in each vehicle at the time of the crashes – and the soldiers were undertaking route-clearance work to keep roads across the region open.In 2023 anADF defence strategic reviewargued that the military was “not structured or appropriately equipped to act as a domestic disaster recovery agency concurrently with its core function, in any sustainable way”. The government conceded that the ADF being consistently called upon to assist with natural disaster response and recovery “comes at a cost to force preparedness, readiness and combat effectiveness”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are grateful for the opportunity. And that will continue to be the case.“We very much thank them for their service, and our thoughts are very much with those who have been injured. In this moment, we are reminded about the selflessness of those who wear our nation’s uniform, and we are deeply grateful to them.”The NSW premier,Chris Minns, praised the efforts of soldiers, and said he hoped the accident did not diminish the ADF’s willingness to contribute to disaster preparedness and relief.“When it comes to the involvement of the ADF in civil matters, particularly natural disasters, we are full praise for the dedication and selflessness of ADF personnel.”Minns said he wanted to see more, not less, defence involvement in disaster response.“Notwithstanding the accident last night, this is incredibly important when it comes to community confidence, the skills and expertise of the ADF, and I would hate to see it dampen the federal government’s involvement in these natural disasters: the bottom line is we need you, you do an incredible job, and we are very grateful for it.”The cause of the accident is being investigated.Explore more on these topicsTropical Cyclone AlfredAustralian militaryAnthony AlbaneseRichard MarlesChris MinnsNew South WalesEmergency servicesnewsShareReuse this content"

Merz is hoping for the backing of the Social Democrats and the Greens, with whom the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority is still possible in the existing parliament, which remains in place until 25 March.However, Merz acknowledged on Sunday he still had work to do in order to win over the Greens to his plans, whose support is needed if a two-thirds majority is to be reached. The Greens have signalled their strong objection to the fact that hardly any reference has been made to climate protection in Merz’s proposals.Merz said in the Deutschlandfunk interview that “intensive” talks would take place with the Green party next week. “We will integrate climate protection measures [in the investment proposals],” he said.Merz’s CDU/CSU came first in a federal election last month and is seeking to form a “mini-grand” coalition with the Social Democrats. The two parties announced on Saturday they had completed a round of “sounding talks” to establish whether there was sufficient common ground between them before the start of formal negotiations. Official talks could begin in the coming week.Major sticking points are expected to be migration and security, with Merz having ridden on a pre-election ticket of considerably toughening up on rules over who can enter Germany and under what circumstances they could stay.The new government is under huge pressure to take the wind out of the sails of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland, which soared to second place in the election, with almost 21%, promising among other policies a mass “remigration” of criminal foreigners and migrants with no legal right to stay in Germany, should it come to power.Addressing concerns that his plans to tighten migration regulations would put Germany at odds with its neighbours, Merz said he intended to be fully compliant with EU rules and would seek pan-European consensus. “We want European solidarity … but Germany also of course has a right to defend its own security and order,” he said.Merz has said he has hopes of forming a coalition by Easter, on 20 April.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzNuclear weaponsFranceForeign policyDefence policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The crucial supply road between Sudzha and Ukraine’s Sumy region is under constant Russian fire.On Monday,Volodymyr Zelenskyywill hold talks with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and on Tuesday, a delegation led by Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, will meet with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and other senior White House officials. Zelenskyy will not take part in the negotiations.The Ukrainian side is likely to propose a peace plan sketched out by Zelenskyy last week featuring a halt to drone and missiles strikes, as well as asuspension of military activity in the Black Sea.So far, however, Vladimir Putin has showed no interest in a ceasefire.On Sunday, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled anextraordinary attackby Russian sabotage and assault groups via a gas pipeline. About 100 Russian soldiers spent four days crawling through the 15km-long pipe that leads to Sudzha’s outskirts.Ukrainian airborne assault forces wiped out some of the Russians using artillery strikes soon after they emerged,video footage suggests. “Russian special forces are being detected, blocked and destroyed. Enemy losses in the Sudzha area are very heavy,” Ukraine’s military said.It admitted the situation was difficult but under control, with Russia employing North Korean combat units. They include replacement soldiers sent by Pyongyang after the original 11,000-strong North Korean contingent that arrived last November suffered heavy losses.‘They brought it on themselves’: a new low in US-Ukraine relationsRead moreRussia’s ex-president Dmitry Medevdev claimed Kyiv’s forces were nearly surrounded and would soon be driven out. “The lid of the smoking cauldron is almost closed. The offensive continues,” he posted on Telegram.The US appears determined to force further concessions on Ukraine before the talks in Saudi Arabia this week. According toNBC news, Trump wants Zelenskyy to yield territory to Russia and to move towards elections.On Sunday Trump suggested that Ukraine may not be able to survive in the war against Russia even with support from the US.In an interview with Fox News while defending his decision to draw down on support to Ukraine, he said: “Well, it may not survive anyway.”Trump also said that Zelenskyy took money from the US under the Biden administration like “candy from a baby”. He repeated his claim that Zelenskyy was not “grateful” but did describe him as “smart” and “tough”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Posting on X, he wrote: “My Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their front line would collapse if I turned it off.”His threat prompted a rebuke from Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, who pointed out that his government had a commercial contract with Starlink and paid $50m for Ukraine to access Musk’s satellite internet service.“The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,” Sikorski wrote back on X. Ukrainian engineers are urgently exploring alternatives.According to the FT, negotiations are taking place with four European satellite operators. Replacing Starlink terminals across a 1,000km frontline would take time, the paper noted.Musk later said on Sunday said that no matter how much he disagreed on Ukraine policy, Starlink would never turn off its terminals. “We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip,” he wrote on X.More than 20 people have been killed in the last two days by Russian bombs. On Friday, several ballistic missilessmashed into a five-storey residential blockin the eastern Donetsk region, killing 11 civilians and injuring dozens, including three children.Overnight, Ukraine carried out its ownlong-range drone attacksdeep inside Russia. According to Telegram channels, oil refineries in Ryazan and Lipetsk were hit, together with an oil depot in Cheboksary in Russia’s Chuvashia Republic.The depot is located more than 900km from the Ukrainian border and was targeted for the first time.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

The Pompidou’s Chagalls, Giacomettis and myriad other treasures will be relocated to other sites in Paris and museums elsewhere inFranceand around the world.View image in fullscreenVisitors stroll through the Pompidou Centre on Saturday. Workshops, performances and DJ sets were staged for the occasion.Photograph: Anna Kurth/AFP/Getty ImagesThe refit of the nearly 50-year-old building, constructed in the heart ofParisby architects Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, is expected to cost an estimated €262ms and will require the entire centre – including its huge library and music research unit – to be closed from late September.The building, famous for its facade adorned with colourful pipes and ventilation shafts, will be given a top-to-toe renovation, with everything from its technology and accessibility to its energy efficiency due to be reconditioned. Most crucial is the removal of asbestos present everywhere from the museum’s ceilings to its pipes, a task so huge a complete demolition had been proposed.View image in fullscreenVisitors look at Bildnis der Journalistin Sylvia von Harden by Otto Dix inside the Pompidou Centre.Photograph: Anna Kurth/AFP/Getty ImagesOnce complete, the cultural colossus, named after Georges Pompidou, France’s conservative president between 1969 and 1974, is to be reopened with a new exhibition space, offering what museum bosses have called a “multidisciplinary perspective” with new spaces for children and young people, as well as an enlarged library.Art lovers have until 9pm on Monday to take a final stroll through the permanent collection. However, Laurent Le Bon, art historian and the museum’s head, said those who missed the deadline would have plenty of other chances to see the Pompidou’s works. Calling the renovation a “an unprecedented opportunity to reinvent the Centre Pompidou”, he has said: “We will use the time we have well.”View image in fullscreenA visitor takes a photograph of Dimanche by Marc Chagall inside the permanent collection at the Pompidou Centre.Photograph: Anna Kurth/AFP/Getty ImagesSome of the works will be brought out of storage for an exhibition in Paris’ Grand Palais – which itself was reopened last summer after a major renovation..French visitors and foreign tourists were among those to take advantage of the last weekend, for which entrance was free, with workshops, art performances and DJ sets contributing to a lively atmosphere.View image in fullscreenVisitors ride an escalator at the Pompidou Centre.

Her Portuguese friend Luis Fraga said he was a regular visitor to the museum and was keen to lap up and “enjoy as much as possible” the artworks “before they are no longer here”.The Pompidou Centre, which attracted more than 3 million visitors last year, is one of the most popular museums in the world, ranking in Paris behind only the Louvre (8 million) and the Musée d’Orsay (3.7 million) in terms of popularity.View image in fullscreenVisitors admire the view from a terrace at the Pompidou Centre.Photograph: Anna Kurth/AFP/Getty ImagesIts closure comes weeks after major renovation work was announced at theLouvreamid heavy criticism that the museum had become overcrowded and unmanageable. For that project, estimated to cost €700-800m, which involves creating a new, more accessible entrance and putting the Mona Lisa in a separate room with its own means of access, the museum will not be closed, though some individual rooms will be, temporarily. It is due to be completed in 2031.Those who consider the Pompidou’s planned closure to be lengthy may take solace when looking to Berlin, where visitors wanting to visit the Pergamon Museum, which houses a collection of ancient Greek and Roman art as well as the Pergamon Altar, will have to wait up to 20 years for extensive renovation works to be completed.

Everything has become transactional.”After being asked about the matter repeatedly, von der Leyen said the US was still an ally, although “we have our discussion points without any question”. She said: “From the viewpoint of theEuropean Union, I think it’s a very strong wake-up call.”EU leaders last week pledged todramatically increase military spendingafter von der Leyen presented a €800bn (£670bn) plan to allow member states to take out loans and increase national debts without incurring penalties under the the bloc’s strict fiscal rules.Many member states would like to go further, however, with common borrowing to fund direct grants, rather than loans, to boost defence spending.Asked on Sunday about such proposals, von der Leyen said: “Nothing is off the table. I am open to whatever is necessary.” Such a move would require backing from Germany, which has been opposed to joint defence borrowing under the outgoing coalition government led by Olaf Scholz.The incoming centre-right chancellor, Friedrich Merz, however, has raised hopes of a change of heart in Berlin, after he made a speedy agreement with his Social Democrat coalition partners to change Germany’s constitution to embark on a spending plan for defence and infrastructure.While von der Leyen described the US repeatedly as an ally, EU officials are concerned about Trump, who has suspended US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, derided Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy andappeared tolerant ofVladimir Putin’s deadly bombardment of Ukrainian homes and civilian infrastructure.While von der Leyen spoke of support for Kyiv so Ukraine “can keep on fighting” she did not refer directly to a proposal for short-term military aid from the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas. The former Estonian prime minister has called on member states to accelerate efforts to aid Ukraine in 2025, including by delivering “as soon as possible” 1.5m rounds of ammunition, air defence systems and drones among other support.After thelatest devastating attacks on Ukrainethis weekend that killed at least 14 and injured many more, Kallas stepped up her calls for the EU to increase military support “otherwise, even more Ukrainian civilians will pay the highest price”.Asked about the Kallas proposal and military aid for Ukraine in 2025, von der Leyen said “we will have to step up without any question” and referred to how Kyiv could benefit from the €800bn plan – loans and fiscal flexibilities that have yet to be finalised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe EU has supplied €52bn military aid to Ukraine, on a par with the US, according to the commission.Von der Leyen said her €800bn plan could be “the foundation of a European defence union” and raised the possibility of “team[ing] up with other like-minded countries such as the UK or Norway or Canada”. One open question is whether these non-EU European countries could be involved in billion-euro defence contracts. Macron is leading a “buy European” policy, but Germany and Poland have signalled greater openness to procuring costly defence equipment from countries outside the bloc.Without giving a definitive answer, von der Leyen appeared to lean to a more open approach. Companies already had strong cross-border ties, she said. “We do not have to reinvent the wheel, we have to think about a smart mechanism, how we can use this cooperation that is already established at a high level of quality.”She stressed that the EU remained wedded to phasing out Russian gas, despite two delays to a plan on achieving this goal. “I commit very clearly to phasing out the Russian gas,” she said. “This is an absolute must.”Europe bought a record18.8m tonnes of Russian liquefied natural gasin 2024, despite a steep decline in imported pipeline gas, coal and oil.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionUrsula von der LeyenEuropean CommissionEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Clashes erupted once again on Sunday after security forces were attacked by Assad loyalists at a power plant in Banias, Latakia.To crush the rebellion, the Syrian government called for reinforcements, with thousands of fighters converging on Syria’s coast from all over the country. Though fighters are nominally under the auspices of the new Syrian government, militias still persist, some of which have been implicated in past human rights abuses and are relatively undisciplined.The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said thatmore than 1,000 peoplehad been killed in the attack, including 745 civilians, 125 members of Syrian security forces and 148 Assad loyalists.Death tolls from the two days of fighting varied wildly, with a second rights group, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) saying 148 civilians were killed by Assad loyalists and 327 civilians and captured militants were killed by Syrian security forces.The Syrian government has not released figures for casualties, and the Guardian has not been able to independently verify the number of deaths.On Sunday, Syria’s transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, said the developments were within “expected challenges” and called for national unity. “We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace; we can live together,” he said in a video circulated by Arab media, speaking at a mosque in his childhood neighbourhood of Mazzah in Damascus.Later on Sunday, the Syrian presidency announced the formation of a seven-person committee, comprising judges and one lawyer, tasked with investigating the killings of civilians and security forces in north-west Syria. The committee, which was formed to “achieve civil peace and uncover the truth”, will issue a report with its findings in 30 days.The US and Russia have asked the UN security council to meet behind closed doors on Monday over the escalating violence, diplomats said on Sunday.The wide-ranging, coordinated assault was the biggest challenge to the country’s Islamist authorities, three months after opposition fighters led by the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppledBashar al-Assad.The Syrian government has said “individual actions” led to the killing of civilians and that the influx of fighters on the coast had led to human rights violations.An adviser to Syria’s foreign ministry estimated that 4,000 Assad loyalists were involved in the attacks. Videos showed the bodies of Syrian security officers strewn on the streets as well as bodies seemingly buried hastily in a mass grave in the coastal province of Tartus. The Guardian was unable to independently verify the contents of these videos.In his statement, Türk said: “There are reports of summary executions on a sectarian basis by unidentified perpetrators, by members of the caretaker authorities’ security forces, as well as by elements associated with the former government.”The wave of revenge killings, mostly targeting Alawites, by Syrian security forces in Syria’s coastal communities has struck fear into the Alawite community. The Syrian coast is heavily populated by the sect, from which the deposed Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites were not associated with the Assad regime.Videos showed the bodies of dozens of people in civilian clothes piled up in the town of al-Mukhtariya, where more than 40 people were killed at one time, according to the SNHR.Other videos showed fighters in security uniforms killing people point-blank, ordering men to bark like dogs and beating captives. The Guardian was not able to independently verify these videos.A man from the town of al-Sanobar, Latakia, detailed how gunmen killed at least 14 of his neighbours who were all from the Arris family, including a 75-year-old father and his three sons in front of the mother.9:25A journey through the new Syria: what is the future after Assad? – video“After they killed the father and his boys, they asked the mother to take her gold off, or they would kill her,” said the man who was close to the family but spoke under the condition of anonymity for his safety.Another person in Latakia said power and water to the area had been cut off for the past day and they had been sheltering in their house, scared of the militants on the streets. “There’s no water and no power for more than 24 hours. The factions are killing anyone who appears in front of them; the corpses are piled up in the streets. This is collective punishment,” they said.Rights groups said a real commitment to transitional justice and an inclusive government was crucial to preventing Syria from spiralling into a cycle of violence. Syria’s transitional authorities are due to announce a new government this month, which will be scrutinised closely for how representative it is of Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity after this week’s violence.Syria’s new authorities will probably face more difficulties in getting international sanctions lifted, particularly US sanctions, after the wave of violence on Syria’s coast. Damascus has been courting international powers to help its beleaguered economy by removing sanctions, which are seen as one of the main obstacles to the country’s stability.Western powers have stressed that respect for the country’s minority populations will be key to removing economic sanctions.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, condemned the attacks, which he said were committed by “radical Islamic terrorists” and called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable. “The United States stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite and Kurdish communities, and offers its condolences to the victims and their families,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

Others have suggested the remaining sewage treatment plant could be affected.In a video announcing the directive,Eli Cohen, Israel’s energy minister, saidthat Israel would use “all means available … to ensure the return of all Israeli hostages” and that Hamas would not remain in Gaza after the war.Hamas accused Israel of “cheap and unacceptable blackmail” over its decision. “We strongly condemn the occupation’s decision to cut off electricity to Gaza, after depriving it of food, medicine and water,” Izzat al-Rishq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement, adding it was “a desperate attempt to pressure our people and their resistance through cheap and unacceptable blackmail tactics”.Dread haunts Gaza as airstrikes dent hopes of renewed ceasefireRead moreIsrael is seeking to force Hamas to accept an extension until mid-April of the first phase of the ceasefire, which came into effect in mid-January but ended formally last weekend. Israel has already cut off all supplies of goods to the territory, claiming that Hamas was stealing aid and profiting from its distribution.Israel has also intensified strikes in Gaza, while military officials have briefed local and international journalists that preparations for a major offensive are under way.There are daily reports of casualties inflicted by Israeli warplanes, drones or artillery.On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out an airstrike in northern Gaza, which a spokesperson said was aimed at militants “attempting to plant an explosive device in the ground in northern Gaza” near Israeli troops.A day earlier, an airstrike in Rafah in southern Gaza targeted a drone that entered the territory from Israel and a group of suspected militants, according to the IDF.Israel wants Hamas to release more of the 58 hostages the group and its allies in Gaza are believed to be holding. Fewer than half are thought to still be alive. Hamas has rejected any extension and wants an immediate start to negotiations on the ceasefire’s second phase, which aims to bring a permanent end to the war and was supposed to directly follow the first phase.Representatives of the group met mediators in Cairo over the weekend, emphasising the urgent need to resume humanitarian aid deliveries to the territory “without restrictions or conditions”.“We call on mediators in Egypt and Qatar, as well as the guarantors in the US administration, to ensure that [Israel] complies with the agreement … and proceeds with the second phase according to the agreed-upon terms,” the Hamas spokesperson, Hazem Qassem, told Agence France-Presse.Hamas’s key demands for the second phase include further releases of Palestinians held in Israeli jails in exchange for hostages, a complete withdrawal of Israel from Gaza, a permanent ceasefire and the lifting of the Israeli blockade.The office of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, said it would send delegates to Doha on Monday to join talks on continuing the ceasefire in one form or another.Complicating the picture further are unprecedented direct talks between the US and Hamas aimed primarily at freeing five US citizens among the hostages still held by Hamas. Only one is thought to be still alive.1:02White House confirms US in negotiations with Hamas – videoTheUS envoy involved in the direct talks, which were revealed by US-based media last week, described on Sunday his meeting with Hamas as “very helpful” and said he was confident a hostage release deal could be reached “within weeks”. Speaking to CNN, Adam Boehler acknowledged it had been “odd” sitting face to face with leaders of a militant Islamist group that the US has listed as a terrorist organisation since 1997, but did not rule out further meetings.Boehler said he understood Israel’s “consternation” that the US had held talks with the group, but said he had been seeking to jump-start the “fragile” negotiations. “I think something could come together within weeks … I think there is a deal where they can get all of the prisoners out, not just the Americans,” he added.January’s truce paused more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza in which virtually the entire population was displaced, swaths of the territory were reduced to rubble and more than 48,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Israel’s military offensive. The war was triggered by Hamas’s surprise attack into Israel in October 2023, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 251 hostages taken.The six-week first phase of the ceasefire led to the exchange of 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others, for the release of about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It also allowed much-needed food, shelter and medical assistance to re-enter Gaza.Since Israel subsequently cut off the aid flow, UN rights experts accused the government of “weaponising starvation”.Last week, Donald Trump threatened further destruction of Gaza if all remaining hostages were not released, issuing what he called a “last warning” to Hamas leaders. The US president caused outrage in February when he said the US wanted to overseethe mass displacement of Palestinians in Gazato allow the territory to be reconstructed as the “riviera of the Middle East”. On Sunday Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said that proposal was “taking shape”.Smotrich said the government was planning to establish a “migration directorate” to assist residents of Gaza who wanted to leave the territory permanently.Arab leaders have proposed an alternative plan under which Gaza’s reconstruction would be financed through a trust fund, with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority returning to govern the territory.At a weekend rally in Tel Aviv, family members of Israeli hostages demanded their government fully implement the ceasefire. “The war could resume in a week,” Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, told the crowd. “The war won’t bring the hostages back home. It will kill them.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Informed by the attorney that Khalil, who graduated last December, was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.The arrest comes asDonald Trumpvows to deport foreign students and imprison “agitators” involved in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza.The administration has placed particular scrutiny on Columbia, announcing Friday that itwould be cutting$400m in grants and contracts because of what the government describes as the elite school’s failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.The authorities declined to tell Khalil’s wife, who is eight months pregnant, why he was being detained, Greer said. Khalil has since been transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.“We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,” Greer told the AP. “This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.”A spokesperson for Columbia said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property. The spokesperson declined to say if the school had received a warrant for Khalil’s arrest.Messages seeking comment were left with the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Ice.Khalil had become one of the most visible faces of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia. As students erected tents on campus last spring, Khalil was picked to serve as a negotiator on behalf of students and met frequently with university administrators.When classes resumed in September, he told the Associated Press that the protests would continue: “As long as Columbia continues to invest and to benefit from Israeli apartheid, the students will continue to resist.”An immigration court can revoke a green card but government departments do not have that power.Last week it wasreported by Axiosthat Secretary of State Marco Rubio intends to revoke visas from foreign nationals who are deemed to support Hamas or other terrorist groups, using artificial intelligence (AI) to pick out individuals.Khalilwas amongseveral investigated by a newly-created university disciplinary committee – the Office of Institutional Equity – looking into students at the institution who have expressed criticism ofIsrael, according to records shared with the AP.In recent weeks, the committee has sent notices to dozens of students for activities ranging from sharing social media posts in support of Palestinian people to joining “unauthorized” protests.“I have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,” Khalil said last week.After refusing to sign a non-disclosure agreement, Khalil said the university threatened to block him from graduating. But when he appealed the decision through a lawyer, they eventually backed down, Khalil said.“They just want to show Congress and rightwing politicians that they’re doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,” Khalil said. “It’s mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.”Columbia studentskick-startedthe tent encampment protests at their Manhattan campus last spring, with the ideacatching onat dozens of campuses across the US. At Columbia and many other colleges, their academic administrationscalled inthe relevant local police department and hundreds of students were arrested.“Targeting a student activist is an affront to the rights of Mahmoud Khalil and his family. This blatantly unconstitutional act sends a deplorable message that freedom of speech is no longer protected in America. Furthermore, Khalil and all people living in the United States are afforded due process. A green card can only be revoked by an immigration judge, showing once again that theTrump administrationis willing to ignore the law in order to instill fear and further its racist agenda,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of New York Immigration, Coalition said in a statement on Sunday afternoon.“DHS must immediately release Khalil,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS universitiesProtestUS politicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazanewsShareReuse this content"

Death tolls from the two days of fighting have varied wildly, with some estimates putting the final death toll even higher.Fightingbegan on Thursdayafter fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime ambushed security forces in Jableh, in the coastal Latakia province.A map showing the location of Latakia province in SyriaThe wide-ranging, coordinated assault was the biggest challenge to the country’s Islamist authorities so far, and came three months after opposition fighters led by Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham toppled the Syrian presidentBashar al-Assad.To crush the rebellion, the Syrian government called for re-enforcements, with thousands of fighters converging on Syria’s coast from all over the country. Though fighters are nominally under the auspices of the new Syrian government, militias still persist, some of which have been implicated in past human rights abuses and are relatively undisciplined.View image in fullscreenA Syrian army soldier searching for supporters of the former Assad regime in Latakia.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe Syrian government has insisted that “individual actions” led to the killing of civilians and said the massive influx of fighters on the coast led to human rights violations.On Sunday, Syria’s transitional president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, said the developments were within “expected challenges” and called for national unity.“We have to preserve national unity and domestic peace, we can live together,” he said in a video circulated by Arab media, speaking at a mosque in his childhood neighbourhood of Mazzah in Damascus.“Rest assured about Syria, this country has the characteristics for survival … What is currently happening in Syria is within the expected challenges.”In a speech on Friday, Sharaa had said that “anyone who harms civilians will face severe punishment”.Videos showed the bodies of dozens of people in civilian clothes piled up in the town of al-Mukhtariya, where more than 40 people were killed at one time, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. Other videos showed fighters wearing security uniforms executing people point blank, ordering men to bark like dogs and beating captives. The Guardian was not able to independently verify these videos.Forgotten by the west, Syria’s IS prisons are under threat as militant group mobilisesRead moreThe Syrian coast is heavily populated by the minority Islamic Alawite sect, from which the deposed Syrian president hailed, though most Alawites were not associated with the Assad regime.Syria’s new authorities promised Alawites that they would be safe under their rule and that there would be no revenge killings. Government security forces’ killings of hundreds of mainly Alawite civilians this week, however, have sent waves of fear through the religious minority community.A man from the town of Snobar, Latakia, detailed how gunmen killed at least 14 of his neighbours who were all from the Arris family, including the execution of a 75-year-old father and his three sons in front of the family’s mother.“After they killed the father and his boys, they asked the mother to take her gold off, or they would kill her,” said the man who was close to the family but spoke under the condition of anonymity for his safety.Another resident of Latakia said that power and water to the area had been cut off for the past day, and that they had been sheltering in their house, scared of the militants on the streets.“There’s no water and no power for more than 24 hours, the factions are killing anyone who appears in front of them, the corpses are piled up in the streets. This is collective punishment,” the Latakia resident said.The UN envoy for Syria, Gier Pedersen, on Friday urged civilians to be protected, while France condemned what it said was violence targeting “civilians because of their faith”. The French foreign ministry also urged Syria’s authorities to make sure that “independent investigations can shed light on these crimes and that the perpetrators are sentenced”.Rights groups said that a real commitment to transitional justice and an inclusive government was key to preventing Syria from spiralling into a cycle of violence. Syria’s transitional authorities are set to announce a new government this month, which will be scrutinised closely for being representative of Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity after this week’s violence.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump’s offer of talks won’t ease itPatrick WintourDiplomatic editorWith internal politics at their most unstable for years, the risk of escalation is risingSun 9 Mar 2025 01.00 ESTShareThe letter the US president, Donald Trump, says he sent to Iran’s leadershipoffering to reopen talkson the country’s nuclear programme comes at a point when Iranian domestic politics is at its most unstable for years.In the past month, the conservative-dominated parliament has asserted its power over the broadly reformist president elected last June by impeaching and sacking the experienced economy minister, Abdolnaser Hemmati, while Mohammad Javad Zarif, the vice-president and most prominent reformist, has also beenforced out.Both power plays were clearly made against the wishes of the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, but with the economy reeling under the pressure of US economic sanctions, the 85-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has clearly decided against rescuing Pezeshkian.The parliament, feeling it is on a roll, is now summoning a further group of 11 ministers to ask them 49 questions about their performance in what looks like an attempt to harass Pezeshkian’s government into further submission.Rumours that Pezeshkian, an emotional man who sets store by integrity, will soon resign have been rife. His departure would confirm that the deep state, or what some inIrancall the shadow government, will not tolerate a loss of power.If he does go, he has made it clear whom he would hold responsible. In a remarkably candid speech, he finally asserted himself, saying he had favoured negotiations with the west, but the supreme leader had rejected them, so “it’s over and done”.“My position has been and will remain that I believe in negotiations, but now we have to follow the parameters set by the supreme leader,” Pezeshkian said. “When the supreme leader sets a direction, we must adapt ourselves to it. In order to adapt, we must try to find a way.“From the day we took over the government, we were confronted with deficiencies in energy, water and power, and on the other hand extreme debts on payments to the agriculture sector for wheat, the health and medical sector, and retirement salaries and so on.”Similarly, he said his efforts to relieve women of the pressure to wear the hijab had been constantly challenged. On Saturday he issued a further apology over the lack of energy supplies.View image in fullscreenQatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, fears an attack on Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant would threaten water supplies.Photograph: Amer Hilabi/AFP/Getty ImagesA lot of this manoeuvring, ostensibly about economic mismanagement and poverty, is in reality a broader battle over relations with the west, with the conservatives convinced that experience shows Trump and Israel, his ally, are not just untrustworthy, but bent on regime change in Iran.Pezeshkian had argued in the election that Iran could end its confrontation with the west and still remain independent.If Trump’s letter has now set onerous conditions for talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, the conservatives will feel vindicated in saying the price Washington demands is too high. But if Tehran rejects Trump’s approach, Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites then becomes more imminent.The biggest constraint on such an attack may not be Iran’s many threats of reprisals – Israel thinks it has destroyed Tehran’s air defences – but from the arguments of the Gulf states. The level-headed prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, gave a chilling interview to Tucker Carlson warning that if Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant were attacked and radioactive material seeped into the Gulf, within three days none of the countries in the region would have drinking water. They all depend on desalination for their water supply. Not just fish but life in the region would be destroyed, he said.So far, Iran’s professional diplomats have held the line by saying they will not negotiate with America directly. This keeps open the possibility of indirect talks mediated by Russia, a variation on the wearisome form of negotiations staged in Vienna under the Biden administration that failed to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. The offer might buy Iran some time.The consensus inside Iran is that Trump’s letter is timed as a piece of psychological warfare designed to force Tehran into rejection, deepening Iranian divisions about its strategy, and taking the crisis between the west and Iran to the final, ­climactic, level.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeThe ObserverIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The company, which has been a major polluter of the Unesco world heritage site, recentlyconceded defeat in its legal efforts to block the public from accessing data related to how much sewage it was dumping into the lake.United Utilities had argued that information on how much phosphorus was being detected at a main sewage treatment works on Windermere did not fall into publicly accessible environmental information.On top of legal discharges made by the company into the important habitat, various investigationshave found it also illegally dumped millions of litres of raw sewageinto the watercourse.Reed and the water minister, Emma Hardy, will be in Windermere on Monday as part of a “Things Can Only Get Cleaner” tour, to see where investment in water infrastructure will underpin the building of new homes, create jobs and bolster local economies.Reed said: “Windermere is a stunningly beautiful national treasure – but it’s being choked by unacceptable levels of sewage pollution.”He added that the government was “committed to cleaning up this iconic lake” as part of its Plan for Change scheme to upgrade the crumbling water infrastructure and increase economic growth using more than £100bn of private investment.The government was also working “to stop all sewage going into the lake and restore it to its natural beauty”, Reed added.Local groups and organisations have set up a feasibility study to look into what is needed to eliminate sewage discharges into Windermere and draw on successful examples and innovation from around the world.The study has been set up by a coalition that includes United Utilities, the Environment Agency, Ofwat, Save Windermere, Love Windermere, the Lake District national park authority and Westmorland and Furness council.A £200 investment from United Utilities will go towards upgrading 10 wastewater treatment works at Windermere and reducing spills from four storm overflows discharging into the lake to two a year by 2030. Upgrades to the remaining two storm overflows are due from around 2030-35.The private sector money will go towards sewage pipes, water treatment works and nine reservoirs, supporting 1.5 m new homes, 150 large infrastructure projects and power industries such as gigafactories and datacentres.Money from water company fines and penalties has been ringfenced to deliver local water projects, and schemes to clean up waterways are to get up to £11m.Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery, rare species and cultural heritage attract seven million visitors a year, generating £750m for the local economy.Explore more on these topicsPollutionLake DistrictUnited UtilitiesWater industryRiversWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

We’re clear there are no more emergency measures to do. We just need to make sure we use all of the operational levers we have,” he said.Prisons across England and Wales were 100 spaces away from reaching full capacity last August after more than 1,280 arrests during riots sparked by misinformation about the murders of three girls in Southport.The “operational levers” being pulled by ministers this year to try to avoid a repeat scenario include hundreds of “rapid deployment cells”, makeshift secure rooms that will be set up in the grounds of existing prisons. Another 350 cells that have been in a state of disrepair are being fixed up for use, sources said.View image in fullscreenHM Prison Highpoint is a category C men's prison in the village of Stradishall in Suffolk.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianMinister were forced to introduce emergency measures to hold those arrested, charged and convicted last summer. It is understood that the Ministry of Justice’s latest preparations are not a result of any specific intelligence warning of riots.The riots took place between 30 July and 7 August following false claims circulated by far-right activists that the perpetrator of theSouthport attackwas a Muslim and an asylum seeker.Ministers were forced to activate Operation Early Dawn, when defendants were held in police custody and only brought to court if prison places were first confirmed as available.More than 500 new prison places were made available under emergency measures to hold arrested rioters at Stocken prison in Rutland and the newly repurposed HMP Cookham Wood, a former young offender institution in Borstal, Kent.Before the riots, the government had already implemented emergency measures to help ease short-term capacity pressures on prisons. More than 3,000 prisoners have been released on licence after serving 40% of their sentence, rather than the usual 50%.A Whitehall source said the cells being installed this year will be needed regardless of any sudden increases in demand because of the overcrowding crisis inherited by Labour.Lord Timpson, a surprise private sector recruit to Keir Starmer’s ministerial team, spoke to the Guardian at the launch of a 700-place expansion of HMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, which will make it the largest prison in the UK.View image in fullscreenCells and recreational facilities at HM Prison Highpoint.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianNew “house blocks” built over the next two years will include workshops and educational facilities to teach prisoners skills that could help them secure a job on release.As chief executive of the eponymous shoe repair chain Timpsons, Timpson has been responsible for training and employing hundreds of former prisoners, which he believes is vital to reducing demand for more prisons.“One of the ways we’re going to combat this ever-increasing demand on prison places is when people leave, they don’t come back. When 80% of offending is reoffending, something is not working. We have to get people ready to leave,” Timpson said.Many of Highpoint’s 1,300 inmates – men convicted of non-violent offences such as drug-related crimes, burglary and theft – should be retrained and spend more time serving community orders, Timpson said.Inmates at the prison can apply for employment and retraining including railway maintenance, electronic recycling and clothes recycling schemes. Some of the courses can offer a guaranteed job once they are freed.Despite being incarcerated at one of the UK’s best resourced prisons, Highpoint inmates face waiting lists of over 100 for some courses, they told the Guardian.One Highpoint prisoner said: “There are courses here, there is work here, but you can’t get on the vocational courses. So unless you are lucky, or know the right people, you don’t get training before you get out.”A reportby the prisons watchdog last year found that too few Highpoint prisoners were attending purposeful activity or receiving adequate education or training.Other inmates said there was little point being behind bars facing lengthy sentences unless they learn new skills.View image in fullscreenInmate Ross Payton says: ‘I don’t see the point in just sitting in my cell, not doing anything.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianRoss Payton, 33, from Harlow, Essex, who has served four years of a 24-year sentence for supplying drugs and guns, said: “I have changed since being here – I do not want to ever come back to prison – but I don’t see the point in just sitting in my cell, not doing anything.”Timpson acknowledged that there are too few vocational opportunities in prison, a problem exacerbated by the rise in the number of prisoners.“The prison population has increased – a lot of the cells here will be double cells now – but the number of courses and workshops haven’t doubled,” he said.Expanding courses and workshop options will require more public money – but the Ministry of Justice’s budget is vulnerable to cuts at the spring statement on 26 March because the department is “unprotected”, Timpson said.“We’re an unprotected department and, like all the other unprotected departments, we need to put our case forward to the chancellor for the spending review. I come from a commercial background and am very interested in the money and finances but it’s out of my hands,” he said.Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary,disclosed last monththat prisoners may be given the chance to earn their freedom through “good behaviour credits” after examining a similar scheme in Texas.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationJames TimpsonUK criminal justiceSouthport attackCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been fairly decent and Sunday was the warmest day of 2025 so far.”Conditions are expected to gradually cool this week, with spells of rain forecast across the country.Snell added: “It’ll be turning colder across all parts. The south will hang on to milder conditions on Monday, probably around 17C or 18C, but it will be cloudier.“In the north, it’ll be much cooler and bands of patchy rain will move in, and gradually move southwards.”Most of the country will feel the cooler conditions on Tuesday and it is expected to continue through most of the week.Scattered showers are expected in northern and eastern parts, with temperatures in the north reaching between 6C and 8C, and the south forecast between 8C and 9C.Snell said: “Conditions will stay in single figures and it’ll be a cold midweek, particularly when compared with this weekend.“It won’t be a washout and there will be plenty of dry spells. But it’ll be the breeze that keeps those temperatures down.”Friday into Saturday will be more of the same until temperatures start to rise again slightly moving into the weekend.Last year was the 11th year since the 1960s when temperatures of 34.8C were recorded in the UK, and six of them have been in the past decade.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

She ran the household errands, made sure he remained active and protected him from illnesses.Authorities in Santa Fe revealed on Friday that thecouple had died of natural causes, Hackman from heart disease and Arakawa from a rare viral infection. Arakawa died first, perhaps on 11 February, when she was last seen or heard from. Investigators said in apress conferencethat Hackman, 95, was likely unaware that his wife had died.He would have been alone in the house for days, disoriented and too frail to seek help. His pacemaker last recorded his heartbeat on 18 February, which indicates that he died about a week after his wife.Their decomposing bodies were discovered on 26 February when a maintenance worker called security after no one answered the door. Emergency responders found Arakawa, 65, on the bathroom floor near spilled pills and a medicine bottle. The pills were identified as an unspecified thyroid medication, Tylenol and the high blood pressure medication diltiazem. Her body showed signs of “mummification”, which suggests she had been dead for some time.Zinna, one of their three dogs, was found dead in a crate in a closet. Hackman’s body, wearing slippers, was found in a mudroom near a cane.New Mexico’s chief medical examiner confirmed that Arakawa had succumbed tohantavirus, a rare and often fatal illness contracted from exposure to rodent droppings. Hackman’s Alzheimer’s, combined with his declining physical state, was listed as a contributing factor in his death.“Autopsy examination and a full body postmortem CT examination demonstrated no acute findings of internal or external trauma, and showed severe heart disease including multiple surgical procedures involving the heart, evidence of prior heart attacks, and severe changes of the kidneys due to chronic high blood pressure,” said Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico’s chief medical investigator.Authorities are still waiting for the dog’s necropsy results. During the press conference on Friday, New Mexico state public health veterinarian Erin Phipps said “it is a possibility” that the dog, Zinna, died of dehydration and starvation.The exact details of that final week remain unclear. Friends and neighbors told theNew York Timesabout how the couple had increasingly withdrawn from public life, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic.Arakawa had taken mighty precautions to avoid exposing Hackman to illness. She often wore a mask in public, and surveillance footage from 11 February showed her visiting a Sprouts Farmers Market, a CVS pharmacy and a pet food store in Santa Fe before driving back to their gated community around 5.15pm.After that, she was never seen or heard from again. Investigators believe she stopped checking her emails that evening, and no further communication was recorded, authorities said on Friday.The sheriff’s office found no evidence that anyone had been caring for Hackman besides Arakawa. “There was no food in his stomach, which means he had not eaten recently,” said Jarrell.Hackman’s decline starkly contrasts with the life he had once built. The Oscar-winning actor moved to Santa Fe in the late 1980s after divorcing his first wife, and quickly fell in love with the city’s landscape and artistic community. He had already won an Oscar for his role in The French Connection in 1971 and would later earn another for 1992’s Unforgiven.“I think you can escape anywhere, but I think the beauty of the city – they just loved the area,” Mark Kreusch, a photographer, toldFox Newsafter the couple’s deaths. “Even though he was a bit reclusive, he really loved Santa Fe. It resonated with him.”Arakawa, a classical pianist from Hawaii, met Hackman while working part time at a Los Angeles fitness center. When Hackman forgot his entry card one day, Arakawa refused to let him in. That encounter led to a relationship that bloomed despite their 30-year age difference.“That part never came to mind because they seemed equal in so many ways,” a friend, Susan Contreras, told the New York Times. “She was a personality unto herself.”As time went on, Hackman’s health visibly declined.“Obviously, he was 95, so he was slowing down,” Stuart Ashman, who met Hackman in the late 90s when they served on a committee together at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, toldFox News. “And after Covid, he was more reclusive, protecting his immune system and everything else.”Two of the couple’s family friends, Daniel and Barbara Lenihan, along with their son Aaron, toldPeoplemagazine that Hackman had become “essentially home-bound” in recent times and had “stopped riding his bike through the neighborhood”.“Betsy tried to keep him kind of active and engaged,” said Aaron, adding that Hackman did puzzles and yoga via Zoom daily. “She was still trying to keep him as active and engaged and healthy as possible.”Daniel and Barbara Lenihan noted that in the “last couple of months”, the late actor “was really slipping there”.Gary Sinise, who worked with Hackman on the 1995 film The Quick and the Dead, made a similar observation.“I know once he retired to New Mexico, he was retired. He did not want to come back and get any awards or, you know, go to any Hollywood events or anything like that. He was done, and he was moving on from that part of his life,” Sinise told Fox News.Their privacy, much-valued in Santa Fe, may ultimately have contributed to their tragic deaths.Explore more on these topicsUS newsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Madison Sheahan, secretary of the Louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries and Noem’s former aide when she was governor of South Dakota, has been tapped to be the agency’s deputy director.The leadership changes come after Ice’s acting director Caleb Vitello was reassigned on February 21 for failing to meet anti-immigration expectations, Reuters reported. Two other top immigration enforcement officials were reassigned February 11.The Trump administration deported 37,660 people during the president’s first month back in office, DHS data first reported by Reuters last month show, far less than the monthly average of 57,000 people removed from the US in the last full year of Joe Biden’s administration.Arrest rateswere higherthan usual in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, a Guardian analysis showed, but arrests and detentions do not always translate into removals and, at the same time, the numbers of people crossing the US-Mexico border without authorization has dropped dramatically since last summer, first under new Biden restrictions and now further under Trump.Noem said on Friday that the agency planned to prosecute two “leakers of information”.On Sunday, she said these two people “were leaking our enforcement operations that we had planned and were going to conduct in several cities and exposed vulnerabilities”. She said they could face up to 10 years in federal prison.

But when asked in an interview with the Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures “are you expecting a recession this year?” he demurred.“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,” Trump said.1:41‘I hate to predict things’: Trump downplays US recession fears amid trade tariffs – videoWhen asked whether he thought his tariffs on US imports would fuel inflation, he said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”He downplayed recent stock marketvolatilitythat followed hisducking and weavingover tariff policy on exports from Canada, Mexico and China and similar threats to other countries, despite his usual fixation with market performance in relation to the politics of the day and an appetite to claim credit when stocks rise on his watch.“You have to do what’s right,” he said.Last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested that theUS economyis on course to contract in the first quarter, triggering fears a recession could hit the world’s largest economy if weakness persisted and fueling stock market jitters.In 2018 Trumppostedon Twitter, now X, that “trade wars are good, and easy to win”, a view that isnot widelyshared by financial and economic experts.On Sunday, however, he was cautious overall after boasting throughout his election campaign of the swift gains his policies would bring for the US economy and ordinary Americans’ finances.Fox News Sunday Morning Futures anchor Maria Bartiromo introduced the topic of recession by telling Trump “look, I know you inherited a mess”, even though most experts agree that predecessor Joe Biden, a Democrat, left the Republican president a stable economy where inflation, although painfully high for a long time, was continuing to come down and international trading conditions for the US were steady.Meanwhile, also on Sunday morning, NBC’s Meet the Press TV politics show was interviewing US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.He pushed back on concerns that the prospect of Trump’s global tariffs would cause a recession in the US. “Absolutely not,” he said. “There’s going to be no recession in America.”Lutnickadded: “Anybody who bets against Donald Trump, it’s like the same people who thought Donald Trump wasn’t going to win a year ago … you are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America … I would never bet on recession, no chance.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS economyTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The flames were spreading across large swaths of the narrow strip of barrier land that stretches for more than 100 miles east from New York City out towards the Atlantic Ocean.A huge fire in Long Island’s Pine Barrens region prompted road closures and evacuations of a military base.As of Sunday morning, three of the fires had been contained, while one was still burning in the hamlet of Westhampton, according to Michael Martino, a spokesperson for Suffolk county executive Ed Romaine.Local fire crews, as well as the air national guard, worked through the night, containing roughly 80% of the blaze, according to Martino.He said the Suffolk county police department’s arson squad had initiated an investigation into the blaze, though there was no immediate evidence to suggest arson.At least two commercial structures had been damaged. One firefighter was flown to a hospital to be treated for burns to the face on Saturday.Massive clouds of smoke billowed and flames towered over the Sunrise highway that leads to the Hamptons, the string of historic seaside communities flanked by magnificent sandy beaches with rolling waves and dotted with summer mansions of the rich and famous.According to the National Weather Service, wind gusts of up to 30mph were expected on Sunday, making it more difficult to extinguish parts that were still burning.“Our biggest problem is the wind,” Romaine said at an earlier news conference. “It is driving this fire.”Roughly 15 miles west, officials were monitoring a small brush fire along Sunrise highway early on Sunday, Brookhaven town supervisor Daniel Panico said.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS politicsWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

Skype was a reminder of a bygone era and a source of inspiration for many. It facilitated relationships across oceans when there were few affordable means of making international calls, nothing short of a miracle for those with family members in distant parts of the world.One nostalgic Guardian reader composed a song based on the familiar Skype ring. Michael Frishkopf, a professor at the University of Albert’s department of music and the director of the Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology, created a short symphonic work with the Skype theme song in 2020. It was “originally for a film score (though it was never used in that way)”, Frishkopf wrote in an email.“Skype was always a tool for connecting out of isolation and it struck me that a lot of people probably associate it with being far from loved ones,” Frishkopf said. “That Skype ring tone, I don’t know who made it, but it has a kind of wistfulness to it. It isn’t either major or minor, it could go either way. In the same way, it could sound happy or sad which could represent the sadness of longing for someone and the joy of connecting with them. That [Skype] is fading out for good, it might cause a sense of loss for people.”Skyping (orchestral)Michael FrishkopfSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/05/Skyping_(orchestral)_-_composed_by_Michael_Frishkopf.mp300:00:0000:02:01Inspired by Frishkopf’s email, the Guardian asked readers to share their own memories of Skype. What they described in touching tributes was a piece of technology that connected parents with their children, enabled start-up founders to communicate across oceans and timezones, and even made two proposals possible.Melany Heger.Photograph: Melany HegerThe stay-at-home mom who found a new careerWhen I had a mid-career shift, I used Skype extensively as a way to contact clients. That was 2019, and I was on the verge of working again. I spent ten years as a full-time mom, you see. Before I began working online, it felt impossible to be working and stay at home for my kids. You can say that Skype opened up a world of possibilities to me.– Melany Heger, Manila, PhilippinesThe couples who dated and proposed on SkypeHolly and her husband’s wedding bandsPhotograph: HollyI proposed to my Swedish husband over Skype using sticky notes. We got married on 5-5-15, the same day Skype will end its service. It’s very sad, I especially liked it since it was from my husband’s homeland of Sweden. Skype played a big part in our lives in keeping us connected while we were dating and it will always be in my heart.– Holly, IowaDave’s Skype profile picturePhotograph: DaveI think we take for granted how revolutionary Skype was. A futurist utopia always included video calling, and that was ubiquitous by 2005 thanks to Skype. I proposed marriage through it to a long-distance girlfriend in 2008. We never got married, but our ill-fated engagement felt glorious for the weeks after, and memories of our multi-hour sessions still give me a sense of melancholy as strong as any other moments of lost young love.– Dave, MichiganMy husband and I would never be married if we hadn’t had Skype. We met in 2004 when he was on a year abroad from Colorado School of Mines to the University of Leeds. By the time I moved to the States and we got married in November 2009, we had racked up countless Skype hours at all times of the day and night. Skype allowed us to have a long distance relationship that would not have seemed possible if we were just a few years older. Skype also allowed me to see and chat with my parents after I had moved.Nowadays my children (11 and seven) cannot imagine a life without FaceTiming their grandparents, but so much of that is owed to mom and dad’s early years of Skype dating!– Jessica, ColoradoThe faraway relatives who Skyped family back homeView image in fullscreenLauraPhotograph: LauraIn 2004, I moved across the world to attend university in the United States.

When we went around the dinner table saying what we were grateful for my first American Thanksgiving, Skype was my answer. Homesickness was my malady, Skype was my medicine.– Laura, Los AngelesMy great-grandmother said the most important invention during her lifetime was the ability to fly internationally, delighting in the fact that she could journey from Australia by plane for her one and only ‘grand European tour’ in the 1960s, once all her children had grown. For my grandmother, who sadly passed in 2010, it was the invention of Skype. She had spent many years corresponding via a much-cherished weekly letter and annual phone call when her only sister moved to London and then New York during the 60s and 70s. So, you can imagine her delight when I made a similar move abroad in the 2000s that we could still see each other and talk via a video call during her final years. I cherish the memory of those Skype calls as much as the letters she wrote me.– Felix, MexicoWhen first arriving on these Japanese shores, calls to the US were prohibitively expensive. I used to write aerograms (light paper that could be folded into an envelope) to my parents. Then I had two children who dispersed, one to Tokyo, one to the US. We Skype regularly, though we also use Google Chat. As an expat, I have found Skype invaluable. It can be used as a verb – “Let’s Skype!” – and fulfills a sense of joy found on Christmas morning.

We think we can switch to Zoom but it’s more awkward for her to use.– Alice, HampshireThroughout his numerous 12-15 month military deployments that dotted my childhood, Skype (and later Skype-to-Go) was the most reliable way to have any sort of contact with my dad in between receiving hand written letters.– Veronica, MichiganThe teachers who used Skype to reach their studentsI have been teaching Qur’an on Skype for the last nine years. I think there is no better app for teaching, especially because of the clarity of the voice in terms of teaching by sharing the page.– Ghulam Asghar Awan, PakistanDuring the pandemic, I did online teaching via Skype. One of my students was a single child, alone at home. She was around 10 when I first taught her. Now when all school was online, she was obviously very happy to have a teacher just for herself. She didn’t learn much, because she interrupted me all the time, just wanting to talk to somebody. Bella, you still have a very special place in my heart! I’ll never forget you!– Friedrich Helmke, BrazilThe friends who connected via SkypeView image in fullscreenMatthew (left) and Harald (right)Photograph: MatthewThe person with whom I used Skype the most and used it last was my friend Harald. I live in Wisconsin and work at the university in Madison. Harald was from Germany but did a postdoctoral fellowship in Madison in the early 2000s. We became friends while he was here, and interestingly, we grew much closer after he moved back to Germany. We would get together before or after conferences and do bike trips together, and we visited each other many times over the years.Harald’s preferred way of communicating when we were on opposite sides of the world was by Skype. He’d use it as a verb. “Let’s Skype next Tuesday,” he’d say to me. I would often tease him as new platforms became popular that he was wedded to this outdated mode of communication. He died about two years ago, and I miss him terribly. And anytime I hear about Skype I think of him.– Matthew, WisconsinThe startup founders who met every evening on SkypeView image in fullscreenOurResearch co-founders, Heather Piwowar and Jason PriemPhotograph: Heather PiwowarOur startup, which has helped hundreds of thousands of people access scientific research, only exists because of Skype. We wrote the seeds of the project at an all-night hackathon in 2011, in person, but the two of us lived in different countries and three time zones apart – would this thing fizzle or bloom? Over the next few years we talked on Skype every evening to improve the product, get funded, incorporate and grow. Skype saw our grit, tears and laughter. The result wasUnpaywall,OpenAlex, improved open science, and wonderful memories. Thank you, Skype.– Heather Piwowar, Vancouver, CanadaThe man who begrudgingly gives Skype creditSkype was the first of the video calling services. That said, it was absolutely rubbish, and I dropped it like a stone as soon as anything close to a viable alternative arrived. It’s bloated, resource-hogging, unintuitive interface lives on in Teams and is vastly improved upon by services like Discord. I’m thankful for it breaking new ground, but am more thankful we’ve gone a lot further from where we started.– Seth, Cambridge, UKExplore more on these topicsSkypeMicrosoftInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania were also on the list. But perpetrators also included militias and other non-state actors.Telecommunication and internet service providers who shut services based on government orders are also complicit in violating people’s rights, said Felicia Anthonio, the #KeepItOn campaign manager at Access Now, citing theUN guiding principles on business and human rights.The details showed that most of the shutdowns were imposed as a response to conflicts, protests and political instability. There were also restrictions during elections.The trend was replicated across the world with more internet shutdowns and in more countries: 296 shutdowns across 54 countries, compared with 283 shutdowns in 39 countries the previous year.Access Now said the figures were the worst since it started keeping records in 2016 and that the rise reflected “a world where internet access is consistently weaponised, restricted, and precarious”.“Behind each of the 1,754 shutdowns since 2016 is a story of people and communities cut off from the world and each other, often during political upheaval, unrest, violence and war,” the report said.At least five shutdowns in Africa had been imposed for more than a year by the end of 2024, according to Access Now. As of early 2025, the social network Meta was still restricted in Uganda, despite authorities engaging with its representatives. On the Equatorial Guinean island of Annobon, internet and cell serviceshave been cut offsince an August 2024 protest over environmental concerns and isolation from the rest of the country.The increase in shutdowns led the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to pass a landmark resolution in March 2024 to help reverse the trend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is difficult for us to tell if the resolution is yielding results already, but we did see authorities in countries likeMauritiusand South Sudan [in January 2025] backtrack or reverse shutdown orders.”Explore more on these topicsInternetAfricaHuman rightsComorosGuinea-BissauMauritiusBurundinewsShareReuse this content"

Arteta was asked if deep down he believes the Premier League title will again eludeArsenal.Rice strike and Raya saves help Arsenal rescue point at Manchester UnitedRead moreThe Spaniard said: “I don’t want to say that, but today the frustration is that we haven’t won our game, we know the urgency and you’re obligated to win every single match. You won’t have any chance without doing that. I don’t think it’s the right moment to talk about that.”Arsenal have now dropped seven points in their past three games. Arteta was asked why. “Today the efficiency we had in the last 20 metres wasn’t good enough. We know that. To come to Old Trafford and do what we did was superb but you have to capitalise and today we didn’t and then we have to overturn a result and you know how difficult that is here.”While being interviewed on Sky Sports after the match, Arteta walked off when asked if the title race was over.Bruno Fernandes’s free-kick strike just before half‑time was cancelled out by Declan Rice’s 74th‑minute equaliser. Anthony Taylor, the ­referee, ordered Arsenal’s wall back 11.2 yards for Fernandes’s goal, more than the regulation 10, meaning ­United’s captain could flight his kick over it more easily.Arteta said: “They [his staff] just mentioned that. If Bruno is on that, football is for smart street players and if he’s done that and capitalised on that, he was more clever than us and the referee.”United’s point takes them to 34 with 10 games left. Ruben Amorim praised Fernandes’s contribution. “What I can say is we need more Brunos, that is clear,” the head coach said. “Not just the quality and the character, he makes some mistakes but in this league the availability is so important and he is so decisive with and without the ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a statement posted to social media at the time, the All-Pro pass rusher said his career goal “has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have a requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.”From nepotism to staggeringly bad contracts: the NFL’s most hopeless franchisesRead moreHowever, the Browns said they were determined to keep Garrett and have backed up that statement with the contract extension. The deal is likely to raise the bar for other non-quarterbacks seeking new deals, including Bengals All-Pro wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase and Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons. Cincinnati have already stated plans to make Chase the highest-paid non-QB in the league.The Browns selected Garrett with the No 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft and he has delivered on his potential, developing into a hugely disruptive force at defensive end and is now the Browns’ all-time leader in sacks. He is also a four-time first-team All Pro, a six-time Pro Bowler and was named defensive player of the year in 2023. Last season he had 14 sacks and 22 tackles for loss.However, the Browns have mostly failed to surround him with a capable team. In the eight seasons since Garrett was drafted, the Browns have reached the playoffs just twice, never progressing beyond the divisional round. In his first season the Browns lost all 16 of their games; In 2024, they went 3-14. They have also struggled since awarding quarterback Deshaun Watson a record contract after landing him in a trade with the Houston Texans. Watson’s tenure has beentroubled by poor play, controversies overallegations of sexual assaultanda series of injuries.Elsewhere on Sunday, the Buffalo Bills announced the long-anticipated decision to release Von Miller, parting ways with the aging edge rusher whose contract proved too expensive for his dwindling playing time and production.The move allows the Bills to free up about $8.4m in salary cap space, which comes close to matching how much the team was projected to be over the limit before the NFL’s new year begins on Wednesday. Nevertheless, a portion of Miller’s contract will remain on Buffalo’s books this year and is projected to count more than $15m against the cap.The Bills posted a picture of Miller with the words “Thank You Von” in making the announcement on their X accountExplore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I will enjoy it and soak up all this emotion.”Shiffrin needed to win on Sunday to earn 100 race points and stay in contention for a ninth career season-long slalom title. She missed four slalom races while recovering from her physical andpsychological injuries sustained in November.“I’m still trying to get the repetition back. I just have to keep practicing it,” she said.With Olympic slalom champion Petra Vlhova skipping the entire season to recover from a knee injury, the door opened for a new World Cup title winner.The World Cup season-ending last slalom is at Sun Valley, Idaho, on 27 March with four skiers ahead of Shiffrin and within 100 points of the lead to lift the crystal globe trophy.Title-chasing contenders Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, the world championships gold medalist last month, were below their best form on Sunday and placed 10th and 11th, respectively.The 21-year-old Ljutic leads Rast in the slalom standings by 41 points and will win the title with a top-three result at Sun Valley. Liensberger, the 2021 champion, and Rast’s Swiss teammate Wendy Holdener could also win.Shiffrin said she plans to train in Europe before the trip across seven time zones to Idaho.“There’s certainly some travel challenges.

To return a record-breaking eighth title with Ferrari, who have not won the drivers’ title since 2007, would be a feat to rank among the greatest of them all. Watching him try will be as gripping asMcLarentrying to steal his thunder.For Hamilton this is the culmination of a journey that began as a child playing video games as Michael Schumacher and dreaming of driving for the Scuderia. The Briton played his own part in the McLaren story with his first title and then spent 12 years with Mercedes, claiming six more championships with the team where he was expected to see out his career.Hamilton has always defied expectation and the change has done him the power of good. He is a driver renewed, still in mighty physical form, psychologically as strong as ever and talking of driving on for some time to come. Indeed, he is motivated such as he has not seemed in several years and has hurled himself into his new challenge with abandon. Can he win? Since joiningFerrarihe has given his all to the new venture.F1 testing: what we learned from our first look at the class of 2025 in BahrainRead moreThe pleasure he takes in wearing the scarlet of Ferrari is palpable. He has described catching a first glimpse of himself in his new race suit in a bathroom mirror and stopping to take in its significance. He barely slept the night before his first test run in a Ferrari at Fiorano.During pre-season, he took his motorhome to Maranello and parked it outside the farmhouse that was once Enzo Ferrari’s office to avoid wasting precious time on travel. He walked the length and breadth of the vast facility, shaking hands with every one of the 1,500 staff and invited his engineers back to his temporary home for dinner.“I want people to know that I’m willing to go above and beyond to be able to blend in and to ­contribute to my fullest potential,” he said. “Everyone here dreams of winning with Ferrari, every single person. The energy that I’m receiving from the team, there’s magic here.”Hamilton and Ferrari are not relying on F1 alchemy alone. His chances look better than ever. Ferrari were second to McLaren by 14 points last year and ­finished with a car on the up. The SF25 is an evolution of that ride and should suit Hamilton better than the recalcitrant Mercedes.View image in fullscreenLando Norris’s McLaren looked to be the strongest in testing, building on finishing 2024 as constructors’ champions.Photograph: Michael Potts/ShutterstockThe regulation changes of 2022 did not fall in Hamilton’s favour. The low ride heights curtailed one of his strengths, being late on the brakes, but he still enjoys a strong turn-in to slow corners, controlling the rotation of the car as it moves from slow to high speed. The Ferrari has a level of ­oversteer that overcomes this which will suit Hamilton and his teammate, Charles Leclerc, who will prove a formidable challenge.Adjusting to the new team will be a task in itself, not least in plotting with his new race engineer, Riccardo Adami, to come up with a phrase to supplant the “hammer-time” exhortation of Peter Bonnington at Mercedes.The team are in rude health under Fred Vasseur, who ran Hamilton in his ART team in GP2 in 2006 and has delivered a no-nonsense sense of direction at the Scuderia, controlling the rollercoaster of the blame culture that came with it, exemplified by the calm way the team dealt with the misstep when a new floor set them back mid-campaign last season.He has also used outside talent in the form of the former Mercedes designer Loïc Serra, promoted to technical director of the chassis, and Jérôme d’Ambrosio, the former driver and also Mercedes alumnus as deputy ­principal, crucially both of whom Hamilton knows well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their car looked to be the strongest in testing, building on finishing 2024 as constructors’ champions. Quick in race simulations and on a single lap, if a little twitchy in the rear, it is reliable and will be rapid out of the blocks, the opening salvo they need after recent campaigns took too long to come up to speed. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have played down any advantage, but it is hard not to read quiet satisfaction behind the poker faces.They look to have a nose in front but will not be alone. Alongside Ferrari, Mercedes should be in the mix too, with optimism they have delivered a more predictable and ­stable car than last season and one with a decent touch of pace.Quick GuideF1 2025: teams, drivers and scheduleShowMcLarenLando Norris (GB), Oscar Piastri (Aus)FerrariLewis Hamilton (GB), Charles Leclerc (Mon)Red BullMax Verstappen (Neth), Liam Lawson (NZ)MercedesGeorge Russell (GB), Andrea Antonelli (It)Aston MartinFernando Alonso (Sp), Lance Stroll (Can)AlpinePierre Gasly (Fr), Jack Doohan (Aus)HaasEsteban Ocon (Fr), Oliver Bearman (GB)Racing BullsYuki Tsunoda (Jpn), Isack Hadjar (Fr)WilliamsAlex Albon (Thai), Carlos Sainz (Sp)SauberNico Hülkenberg (Ger), Gabriel Bortoleto (Bra)Race scheduleAustralian Grand Prix16 MarchChinese GP*23 MarchJapanese GP6AprilBahrain GP13 AprilSaudi Arabian GP20 AprilMiami GP*4 MayEmilia-RomagnaGP18 MayMonaco GP25 MaySpanish GP1 JuneCanadian GP15 JuneAustrian GP29 JuneBritish GP6 JulyBelgian GP*27 JulyHungarian GP3 AugustDutch GP31 AugustItalian GP7 SeptemberAzerbaijan GP21 SeptemberSingapore GP5 OctoberUnited States GP*19 OctoberMexico City GP26 OctoberSão Paulo GP*9 NovemberLas Vegas GP22 NovemberQatar GP*30 NovemberAbu Dhabi GP7 December*Includes sprint raceWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Equally, Red Bull and Max Verstappen will be expecting to vie for the lead from the off, though perhaps with some work to do as they look to solve the balance and understeer issue that plagued them for the ­second half of last season but from which the Dutchman still emerged with his fourth title.

He also said Worthy and his lawyers were fully cooperating with the investigation.Records showed that Worthy had been arrested Friday by deputies and held in the county jail on a charge of assault on a family or household member in which their breath was impeded, or choking in common terms. The online court listing for the case was updated to “dismissed/declined” later Saturday.Raiders reportedly nab QB Geno Smith from Seahawks for third-round pickRead moreWilliamson County includes parts of Austin, where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.In a statement, Worthy’s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, said their client was innocent of the charge against him. They said the allegation was made by a female who had been living in Worthy’s home, and that she had been asked to leave the home multiple times over the last two weeks “upon discovery of her infidelity”.“She has refused to vacate the residence and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr Worthy,” the lawyers’ statement said. “The complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr. Worthy’s face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of. Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant.”The Chiefs told the Associated Press on Saturday that they were aware of the situation and still gathering information.Under Texas law, impeding breathing means “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the person’s throat or neck or by blocking the person’s nose or mouth”.Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year’s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at theNFLcombine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs’ go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.The Chiefs came to rely on Worthy in part because of a season-ending injury to wide receiver Rashee Rice, who was coming off a brilliant rookie season of his own. Rice caught 24 passes for 288 yards and two TDs in four games before getting hurt.Rice and another driver, Theodore Knox, were involved in a high-speed car crash in March 2024 that triggered a chain reaction on a highway in Dallas, close to where he had played college football at SMU. Rice is currently facing at least two civil lawsuits along with numerous criminal charges for his role in the wreck.Rice turned himself in following the crash, and his attorney, Texas senator Royce West, said that the wide receiver admitted that he was driving the Lamborghini involved. Rice also posted on social media that he took responsibility for his role in the crash.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Barça, who will face Atlético next Sunday, have a game in hand after their match against Osasuna on Saturday was postponed due to thesudden death of their team doctor.Real dominated proceedings and took a two-goal lead with quickfire strikes, as Mbappé finished a counter in the 30th minute and Vinícius extended their advantage with a fine individual goal four minutes later. Rayo reduced the deficit in added time before the break with a tremendous shot from the edge of the area by Pedro Díaz, which hit the crossbar before bouncing over the goalline and then out again, with the VAR replay awarding the goal after it was not given by the referee.Getafe’s Mauro Arambarri scored a last-gasp quickfire double to upset 10-man Atlético 2-1. Alexander Sørloth came off the bench to convert a penalty in the 75th minute for Atlético after a long VAR review spotted a handball which left the home team fuming. Seconds after Guillermo Cuadra flashed a straight red to Atletico’s Angel Correa for a studs-up tackle in the 88th minute, however, Arambarri stroked home a rebound from close range and, two minutes into added time, he deflected Diego Rico’s shot past Jan Oblak and into the net.View image in fullscreenAdemola Lookman celebrates scoring Atalanta's fourth goal in the 4-0 win at Juventus.Photograph: Valerio Pennicino/Getty ImagesNapoliearned a deserved 2-1 win overFiorentinaat the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Sunday, to move back on to the shoulders of the Serie A leaders, Inter.

The sense remains that Stamford Bridge regulars will take some convincing on the merits of the careful, possession-heavy nature of Marescaball. It is not exactly setting pulses racing at the moment and it was telling that the mood was far from harmonious during this win againstLeicester City.Maresca seemed to be letting out a lot of frustration when he reacted to Marc Cucurella breaking the deadlock after an hour of stodginess by gesturing angrily for fans to make more noise. The grumbling about his team’s backwards and sideways ­passing had struck a nerve. Then again Maresca could hardly ­complain if there was dissatis­faction aboutChelsea­labouring against ­opponents who look certain to return to the Championship after losing 12 of their past 13 games.Rice strike and Raya saves help Arsenal rescue point at Manchester UnitedRead moreThere was the excuse of Cole Palmer, who has gone nine games without a goal after spurning an early penalty, demanding to start despite diarrhoea ­preventing him from ­training for 48 hours. Yet Palmer’s queasy stomach was not the only reason for ­Chelsea’s attack stinking the place out at times.Maresca also pointed to Leicester switching to a back five for the first time under Ruud van ­Nistelrooy, ­saying it forced him to change his entire plan just before kick-off. Cucurella, who was supposed to be an ­auxiliary midfielder, was asked to overlap more from left-back; Maresca suggested that the shifts were too subtle for outsiders to understand.The head coach sounded impatient. Maresca, talking about his post‑goal celebrations, acknow­ledged that there were boos when Enzo Fernández played a backpass a few minutes before Cucurella scored.“It’s our style,” the Italian said. “We need our fans – I said it on my Instagram two days ago. We need them behind the ­players because the spirit they showed today was fantastic. I completely understand when there is a negative feeling but how many chances did we create in the first half?”Not many. He also said pointedly: “If you think football is just PlayStation and you win easy? No way. Every game is difficult.”There was an element of Maresca deflecting attention from a pallid display. Was it really such a shock for Leicester to put numbers behind the ball? This was no revolutionary tactic. The onus was on Chelsea to react.The saving grace was that Leicester could not make life truly uncomfortable for their former manager. They have lost their ­identity since Maresca left last summer and are six points below 17th-placed Wolves after their fifth successive blank. No wonder Van Nistelrooy, who looks on increasingly thin ice after taking seven points from a possible 45 since replacing Steve Cooper in November, later had the look of a manager who would not be surprised if this turns out to be his final outing. “We don’t know if we are running out of time,” Leicester’s manager said. “We know we have today and tomorrow.”Van Nistelrooy took satisfaction from how Leicester stifled Chelsea by denying them space to run in behind. It is an issue for Maresca’s team. Their passing was slow and the only Chelsea player who looked willing to take any risks was Robert Sánchez, a surprise starter in goal a month after losing his spot in the league to Filip Jörgensen.View image in fullscreenMads Hermansen gets down to save Cole Palmer’s first-half penalty.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty ImagesLeicester almost had a farcical lead when their right wing-back, James Justin, delivered a firm cross.

Pedro Neto had few opportunities to race through the middle. Wilfred Ndidi and Boubakary Soumaré matched Moisés Caicedo and Fernández in midfield. Jadon Sancho and ­Christopher Nkunku were quiet on the flanks.Then there was Palmer, who is no longer the mooching, casual figure who destroyed defenders for fun earlier this season. What came naturally before now feels forced. There was almost an inevitability to Mads Hermansen denying Palmer after Chelsea were awarded a penalty for Victor ­Kristiansen’s trip on Sancho in the 19th minute.Chelsea drifted into lethargy before half-time. Palmer, who had lost his perfect record from the spot, was weary. Hermansen repelled a drive from Nkunku but much of the play was in front of Leicester. ­Wesley Fofana, starting for the first time since 1 December after a hamstring injury, provided no width at right-back.

Credit their character for coming back into the game. Credit them for battling their way to a point that never really seemed plausible until Son Heung-min converted an 84th‑minute penalty. But let nobody get carried away: this was a game that raised more questions for Spurs than it answered. It was not a performance that should reassure anybody.The daffodils were out in front of the flats on the Seven Sisters Road. There was some warmth in the sun. Fans uncertainly cast off their thick winter coats. Finally, Tottenham’s injury crisis is beginning to ease. At last Ange Postecoglou has had some time to work with his squad. Spurs had won league games on three successive weekends. Even witha 1-0 defeat against Manchester Cityin their previous league game, it might have been possible to believe that winter is over, that renewal has begun.Tottenham v Bournemouth: Premier League – liveRead moreThen came Thursday anda miserable performance at AZ Alkmaarin the Europa League. That it was only 1-0 at least offers some hope for the second leg on Thursday – and that Postecoglou can maintain his much‑vaunted run of always winning a trophy in his second year at a club, but on that the entire season hangs. And nobody can be too bullish after another weirdly sloppy home display.“It was a chaotic game for sure,” Postecoglou said. “We added to the chaos a little bit. Just with the ball we were careless with our passing and that allowed the game to be played on the termsBournemouthwould like. There was not a lot of control from our perspective, which is not ideal from the way we want to play. We looked nervous, we looked anxious but the positive is the lads showed a really strong mindset. To be fair, that’s what’s been missing this year. There’s a lot of games that have just petered out, and if we’d turned round a few of those one-goal defeats we’d be in a lot better position in the table.”View image in fullscreenEvanilson dinks the ball over Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario to put Bournemouth into a 2-0 lead.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesThe vast majority of Spurs’ problems would disappear if they could stop giving the ball away needlessly in their own half. That at least was not the source of Bournemouth’s 42nd‑minute opener, although that the ball was given away in the opposition half is perhaps not a consequential variation on the theme. Milos Kerkez intercepted Pedro Porro’s pass, surged forwards and crossed deep for Marcus Tavernier to score with a controlled volley at the back post.Although apenalty shootout victory took them past Wolvesinto the sixth round of the FA Cup last week, Bournemouth have been a little out of sorts recently, losing three of their previous four league games, a run that had dropped them into the mass of sides just outside the expected Champions League qualification slots. “Big teams find ways to win,” a frustrated Andoni Iraola said. “We need to be more efficient.” With 10 games to go, everybody in the top half has a realistic chance of a top‑five finish – a broad grouping that, notably, does not include Tottenham.That’s why frustration is mounting at theTottenham HotspurStadium, the greatest lower midtable arena in the world. Without Dejan Kulusevski, they look desperately short of creativity. Postecoglou picked a functional midfield of Yves Bissouma, Pape Matar Sarr and Rodrigo Bentancur but if the intention was to add an extra curtain of protection, it didn’t work and left Spurs entirely reliant on their wingers for creativity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although Son had a shot deflected against the base of a post and Sarr dragged inexplicably wide after neat work from Maddison, Justin Kluivert had already had one goal ruled out for offside when a shift of body weight took Kevin Danso out of the game as he slipped in Evanilson to dink Bournemouth’s second past Guglielmo Vicario.When Sarr did eventually score two minutes later, it was a mis‑hit cross that looped in off the far post. Bergvall had hit a post seconds earlier and Kluivert then hit a post from another breakaway as the game collapsed into a reckless openness. Nobody embodied that more than Kepa Arrizabalaga, whose lunge at Son when there was little immediate danger conceded the penalty that brought the equaliser.Perhaps to an extent that is simply the nature of Angeball, but picking up the scraps from chaos doesn’t seem a plan likely to create consistently positive results. The problem is that Spurs are consistent at the moment, just not in a good way: they have now taken six points from nine home league gamessince winning 4-0 at Manchester Cityin November. Is that enough to keep Postecoglou in the job next season? Perhaps not in isolation, which is why Thursday is such a big day for the club.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A 78th-minute winner – a rebounded own goal off the unfortunate Daphne van Domselaar – sent the Reds through to the semi-finals for the first time since the 2016-17 season.Amber Whiteley, the interim manager, hailed her side’s performance after adisruptive 10 dayssince thedeparture of Matt Beard.Arsenal v Liverpool: Women’s FA Cup quarter-final – liveRead more“I am so pleased for everyone today,” Whiteley said. “They’ve put in so much the last couple of weeks. [There was a] big change. We’ve changed the system. They’ve had to take on a lot of information in a short space of time and the way that they’ve implemented it last week and today … they’ve just been outstanding.“I thought we were brilliant from start to finish. We were so well organised. Off the ball, we really limited their chances in front of goal. I think Rachael Laws only made one save. I think we threatened them. We had good opportunities and I think we deserve to be in the hat for the next round.”Whiteley was able to name an unchanged lineup from the 1-0 league win against Crystal Palace the previous week and the consistency in personnel served them well. The Arsenal manager, Renée Slegers, made three changes with the introduction of Beth Mead, Caitlin Foord and Kyra Cooney-Cross. The Gunners were unable to call on Chloe Kelly with the England international being cup-tied.Liverpool’s gameplan and intense press proved disruptive from the first whistle with Arsenal struggling to get any foothold in the game. The visitors’ application in closing down the central midfield spaces was so successful that the hosts failed to register a shot on target in the first half.View image in fullscreenAmber Whiteley has replaced Matt Beard as interim manager and described Liverpool’s players as ‘outstanding’.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersWhiteley’s side looked promising when they had the opportunity to go forward. Olivia Smith proved a handful throughout with her pace stretching the Arsenal defence. She produced the first attempt of the match in a quiet and scrappy opening period as both sides traded possession.Chances were few and far between throughout the first half and a series of fouls caused more disruption to the play. Marie Höbinger was perhaps lucky to remain on the pitch when she clattered into Mead having already received a booking.The best opportunity fell to the visitors just before the break when Sophie Román Haug easily intercepted a clearing pass from Van Domselaar. The Norway forward, however, fired her attempt straight back at the goalkeeper, the only shot on target before the whistle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Second-half goals from Khadija Shaw and Jess Park ended Villa’s resistance at the Joie Stadium. Meanwhile, Liverpool’s reward for stunning Arsenal is a daunting trip to face quadruple-chasing Chelsea, who were 1-0 winners in their quarter-final against Crystal Palace yesterday. Palace defended strongly but Lauren James grabbed the only goal in the 64th minute. The semi-finals will be played on 12 and 13 April.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Slegers made a half-time change to try to breathe energy into her side with Frida Maanum entering for a wounded Mead. For a brief spell, she looked to have made an impact, providing Arsenal with a creative outlet and forcing Rachael Laws into a couple of saves. The hosts were far from their best, however, and soon Liverpool wrestled back control.As the clock ticked down and extra time loomed, they took their opportunity when it came. The ball came to Román Haug, who controlled perfectly in the box. Her instinctive half-volley looked to have agonisingly hit the post but a stroke of good fortune meant the rebounded ball hit the back of Van Domselaar before heading into the net. The Dutch keeper had her head in her hands but there was little she could have done.A roll of the dice from Slegers brought a series of late changes, including sending the defender Amanda Ilestedt up front, but to little effect. Jubilant scenes ensued among the visitors after a difficult few weeks. A semi-final at Chelsea awaits them in April, an opportunity for a place in their first FA Cup final since 1996.Explore more on these topicsWomen's FA CupArsenal WomenLiverpool FC WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The substitute Adam Idah sealed the victory in stoppage time asCelticremained on course for a domestic treble.Celtic’s Champions League strides have made them a serious entity again | Ewan MurrayRead moreHibs arrived at Celtic Park with 7,000 travelling fans and a team on the back of a 15-match unbeaten run which included a league win over Celtic two weeks ago. They had a good chance to take the lead through Kieron Bowie but Kasper Schmeichel made a strong save and it proved the visitors’ only effort on target.Celtic had made a flying start and the Hibs goalkeeper, Jordan Smith, stopped Callum McGregor’s long-range drive before Nectar Triantis headed Jota’s corner off the line. The visitors weathered that early storm and almost netted out of the blue when Nicky Cadden’s throw-in put Bowie in the clear. Schmeichel stood up well to parry the former Fulham forward’s shot away at his near post.Hibernian then lost Cadden to what looked like a hamstring injury and Maeda had a good chance to score just before his opener when Reo Hatate’s ball over the top sent him clear. Rocky Bushiri’s shoulder charge knocked the striker off-balance and his shot went off target.Maeda didn’t miss his next opportunity, which came from Jeffrey Schlupp’s low cross. Smith made a one-handed stop from Nicolas Kühn’s first-time strike and Maeda connected with the rebound before the ball touched the ground, volleying home from close range to break the deadlock.View image in fullscreenSeven thousand Hibernian fans made the trip to Glasgow but went away disappointed.Photograph: Alan Rennie/ShutterstockHatate soon had a 25-yard strike tipped over as Celtic ended the half as they had started it, but the noisy away support retained hope while the score remained 1-0. Smith saved from Jota after a typical run inside from the winger and Jack Iredale nicked the ball off Kühn’s feet as the German ran in on goal.Maeda then slid in to meet Alistair Johnston’s low cross but put the ball wide from close range and Schlupp shot just past the upright from 20 yards. Hibs’ efforts to force extra-time with an equaliser were not helped by Chris Cadden pulling up with a muscle strain.With David Gray having already made five substitutions, the former Motherwell player was forced to struggle on. Celtic went for the kill, and Idah slotted home from fellow substitute Luke McCowan’s cutback. There was still time for Smith to make saves from McCowan and Maeda, but the result was beyond doubt.Brendan Rodgers extended his perfect run in the Scottish Cup to 20 ties with this victory, as his team joined Aberdeen, Hearts and either Livingston or St Johnstone in Monday’s semi-final draw.Explore more on these topicsScottish CupCelticHibernianmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They boast the best home record in the Championship this calendar year and Bishop’s strike ensured Leeds became their latest victims.Leeds thought they should have had an early penalty when Matt Ritchie kicked through the back of Dan James’s legs but the only shot of note of the first half-hour was a heavily deflected effort from Freddie Potts.Portsmouth were grateful for a double save by Schmid in the 39th minute. Solomon turned and hit through a crowded penalty box to force the Austrian into a diving stop to the right and Schmid denied Joël Piroe’s point-blank follow up from the rebound with his feet.Piroe had a second golden chance of the match within five minutes of the second half getting under way. James and Solomon combined before the latter rounded Schmid to pull back to Piroe. But the striker lacked composure from seven yards and blasted over the bar.Portsmouth began to dominate as Josh Murphy twice had shots deflected just wide and Bishop could not divert a pacy low cross in.View image in fullscreenPortsmouth’s Colby Bishop scored his sixth goal of the season to beat the Championship leaders Leeds.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockThe home side’s pressure paid off in the 61st minute when Connor Ogilvie’s ball down the left channel picked out Bishop, who split the two centre backs before clipping a shot over Illan Meslier and in off the far post to score his sixth goal of the season.Portsmouth were in command now and almost doubled their lead as Andre Dozzell unleashed a 25-yard thunderbolt which Meslier parried away and Ogilvie nodded a header just wide.Schimd came to Portsmouth’s rescue again after Junior Firpo had bundled his way into the box and was one-on-one with the keeper who saved with his feet again. Firpo then nodded against the crossbar moments later as it began to look as though it was not going to be Leeds’ day in front of goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Schmid, who was named player of the match, secured the points for the hosts at the death when he acrobatically tipped over Sam Byram’s header.The Leeds manager, Daniel Farke, was left frustrated by his side’s missed opportunities. “I can’t complain about the performance but I know we can be more effective,” he said. “It was one of those days where we created so many good chances but we couldn’t put any of them to bed.”“We expected a tough away game as no team has won more points in 2025 in home games, so we knew it would be tight. They were able to be effective today and for that we have to say congratulations. They are able to celebrate today and we have to accept it.”Pompey’s head coach, John Mousinho, said the victory “feels like the best game of the season.

What she didn’t know was that Koster had also smashed her head and was unconscious.As the athletes sped around the 200m track, officials rushed out to drag the unresponsive Koster off the track like a rag doll.

However, Bol powered clear for gold in a European Indoor record of 3:24.34, with Britain setting a national record of 3:24.89.There was then drama as the Dutch team were disqualified for obstruction in the takeover on the final leg. There was a 90-minute delay, an appeal and counter-appeal before it was decided the initial result should stand after it emerged that it was an error from a race official, who had put the teams in the wrong order for the changeover. It left the large Dutch crowd happy – and the British team, who ended these championships eighth in the table with seven medals, were not too disappointed.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

He reached the third round this week by playing some of his best tennis in more than a year and his second-round win against the No 24 Jiri Lehecka marked his first top-25 victory since the Australian Open last year.Although both players struggled early on, Paul eventually took control, breaking up the lengthy, attritional exchanges Norrie tried to drag him into with his greater weight of shot and determination to close down the end.

United have lost £300m in the past three years and will operate with a severely constricted budget in the summer transfer market, while the fans are watching a poor side under themanagement of Ruben Amorim. With a point United climbed one place to 14th, 21 points behind opponents who not so long ago were close rivals.Manchester United v Arsenal: Premier League – liveRead moreThe protest started at the Tollgate pub at about 3.15pm and supporters were asked by the 1958 fan group, a main driver in the action, to wear black to mark the club “slowly dying”. They marched the mile to Old Traffordalong Talbot Road, Warwick Road and Sir Matt Busby Way, arriving 20 minutes later, the route to the stadium blocked off to traffic by a sizeable police presence.Some protesters held placards that read “death by 1,00 cuts” in reference to Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting measures. These are headed by up to 450 redundancies, including a high proportion of the 80-strong scouting department, and theclosing of the club canteen, ending free lunches for staff. Those on the march chanted for the Glazers to sell the club and accused Ratcliffe of being no better an owner. “Your debt not ours,” they sang. Red flares were let off, alongside yellow and green ones, the colours of Newton Heath, the club’s original name before it became Manchester United in 1902.“We are so much in debt, a debt-ridden football club,” said Steve Crompton, from the 1958 fan group. “These fans won’t put up with the way the football club are treating us. This club is on its knees, the Glazers have put us there and Ratcliffe isn’t helping. This is to both of them.“It’s absolutely everything: we’ve got ticket prices, we’ve got them getting rid of concessions. These fans are angry, they hate what’s happening to our football club.

Rupture of the cruciate ligaments. This is the beginning of a new challenge, I’ll see you in a few months on the field.”Galthié’s gamble with lopsided bench pays off for France as Ireland unravel | Andy BullRead moreThe 28-year-old scrum-half limped off at the Aviva Stadium after the Ireland second‑rower Tadhg Beirne fell on his leg at the base of a ruck in the first half. The match referee, Angus Gardner, chose not to sanction the Irishman, believing it was an accident and opting not to refer the decision to the television match official.Fabien Galthié was not convinced andexpressed his frustration after the game, calling the incident “reprehensible”. “There is a suspicion of a quite serious knee injury to Antoine,” the France head coach said. “He is suffering and we are suffering with him.“We are angry and we want an explanation; so, we have cited two players [Beirne and Calvin Nash, who received a yellow card for a high tackle on Pierre‑Louis Barassi].”Both Irish players have avoided disciplinary action, however. Nash’s head-on-head collision with Barassi ended the French midfielder’s game after a failed head injury assessment. With France’s bench stacked with seven forwards and only one back – the scrum-half Maxime Lucu, who replaced Dupont – Galthié was forced to play the replacement flanker Oscar Jégou in midfield.Simon Easterby, Ireland’s interim head coach while Andy Farrell is seconded to the British & Irish Lions, defended his players after the defeat. “I think it’s just a rugby incident. Tadhg cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit off the back of it.

The biggest victory of Russell Henley’s career arrived as Collin Morikawa was left to ponder how on earth he failed to close out the Arnold Palmer Invitational. For much of Sunday, Morikawa had looked untouchable.Henley took to the 71st tee of the event holding the lead for the first time. He had claimed that with an astonishing chip in for an eagle on the 16th. This completed a four-shot swing in only three holes. Henley birdied the 14th as Morikawa bogeyed. After Henley’s exploits two holes later, Morikawa had no scope for recovery. Henley’s 11 under par took the Bay Hill tournament by a single stroke. He had trailed Morikawa by three after 10 fourth-round holes.Keegan Bradley surprised ‘kick their ass’ comment was broadcast on NetflixRead more“Sometimes golf is just mean like that,” said the 35-year-old in respect of what played out for Morikawa. “This game is unbelievably hard. That [winning] was just so difficult.” The understated Henley, who won for the first time since 2022, has quietly catapulted himself into elite golfing company. A Ryder Cup debut in September looks highly likely.Morikawa may take some time to process this. His non-appearance for post-round media duties said it all on that front. A harsh reality is that the Californian has not kicked on in the manner predicted when he won majors in 2020 and 2021.Canada’s Corey Conners took third at nine under, one ahead of Michael Kim. Conners has qualified for the Open at Portrush courtesy of this finish.Keegan Bradley endorsed the theory he could qualify for his own US Ryder Cup team with a stunning 64. That earned Bradley a tie for fifth.Shane Lowry, who finished one shy of Bradley’s seven-under aggregate, was left to rue a third round of 76.Rory McIlroy’s week ended with a 72 – he failed to break 70 over four days at Bay Hill – for a share of 15th. The Northern Irishman had put a new driver and fairway woods in play but reverted to the previous models before the final round. “I just went back to what was familiar and what’s comfortable,” McIlroy said.“It’s a blessing and a curse at the same time that we sort of have to go through these 12-month club cycles. I probably just didn’t give myself enough time. It’s totally different, it can look good on the Trackman and it can look good on the range at home at the Bear’s Club or on the golf course but once you get out here in these conditions that’s where it really shows itself and it just wasn’t quite ready.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How ‘AI agents’ will change the internet (and shopping lists)Autonomous digital assistants are being developed that can carry out tasks on behalf of the user – including ordering the groceries. But if you don’t keep an eye on them, dinner might not be quite what you expect …Victoria TurkSun 9 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 17.40 EDTShareI’m watching artificial intelligence order my groceries. Armed with my shopping list, it types each item into the search bar of a supermarket website, then uses its cursor to click. Watching what appears to be a digital ghost do this usually mundane task is strangely transfixing. “Are you sure it’s not just a person in India?” my husband asks, peering over my shoulder.I’m trying outOperator, a new AI “agent” from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Made available to UK users last month, it has a similar text interface and conversational tone to ChatGPT, but rather than just answering questions, it can actuallydothings – provided they involve navigating a web browser.Hot on the heels of large language models, AI agents have been trumpeted as the next big thing, and you can see the appeal: a digital assistant that can complete practical tasks is more compelling than one that can just talk back. Similar to OpenAI’s offering, Anthropic introduced “computer use” capabilities to its Claude chatbot towards the end of last year. Perplexity and Google have also released “agentic” features into their AI assistants, with further companies developing agents aimed at specific tasks such as coding or research.There’s debate over what exactly counts as an AI agent, but the general idea is that they need to be able to take actions with some degree of autonomy. “As soon as something is starting to execute actions outside of the chat window, then it’s gone from being a chatbot to an agent,” says Margaret Mitchell, the chief ethics scientist at AI company Hugging Face.Dohmke envisions a future when everyone has their own personal Jarvis, the talking AI in Iron ManIt’s early days. Most commercially available agents come with a disclaimer that they’re still experimental – OpenAI describes Operator as a “research preview” – and you can find plenty of examples online of them making amusing mistakes, such as spending$31 on a dozen eggsor trying todeliver groceries back to the shopthey bought them from. Depending on who you ask, agents are just the next overhyped tech toy or the dawn of an AI future that could shake up the workforce, reshape the internet and change how we live.“In principle, they would be amazing, because they could automate a lot of drudgery,” says Gary Marcus, a scientist and sceptic of large language models. “But I don’t think they will work reliably any time soon, and it’s partly an investment in hype.”I sign up for Operator to see for myself. With no food in the house, grocery shopping seems like a good first task. I type my request and it asks if I have a preferred shop or brand. I tell it to go with whichever is cheapest. A window appears showing a web browser and I see it search “UK online grocery delivery”. A mouse cursor selects the first result: Ocado. It starts searching for my requested items and filters the results by price. It selects products and clicks “Add to trolley”.I’m impressed with Operator’s initiative; it doesn’t pepper me with questions, instead making an executive decision when given only a brief item description, such as “salmon” or “chicken”. When it searches for eggs, it successfully scrolls past several non-egg items that appear as special offers. My list asks for “a few different vegetables”: it selects a head of broccoli, then asks if I’d like anything else specific. I tell it to choose two more and it goes for carrots and leeks – probably what I’d have picked myself. Emboldened, I tell it to add “a sweet treat” and watch as it literally types “sweet treat” into the search bar. I’m not sure why it chooses 70% chocolate – certainly not the cheapest option – but I tell it I don’t like dark chocolate and it swaps it for a Galaxy bar.View image in fullscreenThomas Dohmke, head of Github, which is developing on an autonomous coding assistant called Project Padawan.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyWe hit a snag when Operator realises that Ocado has a minimum spend, so I add more items to the list. Then it comes to logging in, and the agent prompts me to intervene: while users can take over the browser at any point, OpenAI says Operator is designed to request this “when inputting sensitive information into the browser, such as login credentials or payment information”. Although Operator usually takes constant screenshots in order to “see” what it’s doing, OpenAI says it does not do this when a user takes control.At the checkout, I test the waters by asking Operator to complete payment. I take back the reins, however, when it responds by asking for my card details. I’ve already given OpenAI my payment information (Operator requires a ChatGPT Pro account, which costs $200 a month) but I feel uncomfortable sharing this directly with an AI. Order placed, I await my delivery the following day. But that doesn’t solve dinner. I give Operator a new task: can it order me a cheeseburger and chips from a local, highly rated restaurant? It asks for my postcode, then loads the Deliveroo website and searches “cheeseburger”. Again, there’s a pause when I have to log in, but as Deliveroo already has my card details stored, Operator can proceed directly to payment.The restaurant it selects is local, and it is highly rated – as a fish and chip shop. I end up with a passable cheeseburger and a large bag of chippy-style chips. Not exactly what I’d envisioned but notwrong, either. I’m mortified, however, when I realise Operator skipped over tipping the delivery rider. I sheepishly take my food and add a generous tip after the fact.Of course, watching Operator in action rather defeats the time-saving point of using an AI agent for online tasks. Instead, you can leave it to work in the background while you focus on other tabs. While drafting this piece, I make another request: can it book me a gel manicure at a local salon?Operator struggles more with this task. It goes to beauty booking platform Fresha but, when it prompts me to log in, I see it has chosen an appointment a week too late and more than an hour’s drive away from my home in east London. I point out these issues and it finds a slot for the right date but in Leicester Square – still a distance away. Only then does it ask my location, and I realise it must not have retained this knowledge between tasks. By this point, I could have already made my own booking. Operator eventually suggests a suitable appointment, but I abandon the task and chalk it up as a win for Team Human.View image in fullscreenAI shopping assistants will pause and require human input when it comes to logging in to supermarket websites or making online payments.Photograph: Marco Marca/Getty ImagesIt’s clear that this first generation of AI agents has limitations. Having to stop and log in requires a fair amount of human oversight, though Operator stores cookies to allow users to stay logged into websites on subsequent visits (OpenAI says it requires closer supervision on “particularly sensitive” sites, such as email clients or financial services). The results, while usually accurate, aren’t always what I have in mind. When my groceries arrive, I find that Operator has ordered smoked salmon rather than fillets and has doubled up on yoghurt, possibly because of a special offer. It interpreted “some fish cakes” to mean three packs (I intended just one) and was only saved the indignity of buying chocolate milk instead of plain as the product was out of stock. To be fair to the bot, I had the opportunity to review the order, and I would have got better results if I’d been more specific in my prompts (“a pack of two raw salmon fillets”) – but these extra steps would also detract from the effort saved.Despite current flaws, my experience with Operator feels like a glimpse of something to come. As such systems improve, and reduce in cost, I could easily see them becoming embedded in everyday life. You might already write your shopping list on an app; why wouldn’t it also place the order? Agents are also infiltrating workflows beyond the realm of a personal assistant. OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman,has predictedthat AI agents could “join the workforce” this year.Software developers are among the early adopters; coding platform GitHubrecently added agentic capabilitiesto its AI Copilot tool. GitHub’s CEO, Thomas Dohmke, says developers are used to some level of automated assistance; the difference with AI agents is the level of autonomy. “Instead of you just asking a question and it gives you an answer, you give it a problem and then it iterates on that problem together with the code that it has access to,” he says.GitHub is already working on an agent with greater autonomy, which it calls Project Padawan (aStar Warsterm referring to a Jedi apprentice). This would allow an AI agent to work asynchronously rather than requiring constant oversight; a developer could have teams of agents reporting to them, producing code for their review. Dohmke says he doesn’t believe developers’ jobs are at risk, as their skills will find increasing demand. “I’d argue the amount of work that AI has added to most developers’ backlog is higher than the amount of work it has taken over,” he says. Agents could also make coding tasks, such as building an app, more accessible to non-technical people.View image in fullscreenMargaret Mitchell of the AI company Hugging Face warns against the development of completely autonomous agents.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesOutside software development, Dohmke envisions a future when everyone has their own personal Jarvis, the talking AI inIron Man. Your agent will learn your habits and become customised to your tastes, making it more useful. He’d use his to book holidays for his family.The more autonomy agents have, however, the greater risks they pose. Mitchell, from Hugging Face,co-authored a paperwarning against the development of fully autonomous agents. “Fully autonomous means that human control has been fully ceded,” she says. Rather than working within set boundaries, a fully autonomous agent could gain access to things you don’t realise or behave in unexpected ways, especially if it can write its own code. It’s not a big deal if an AI agent gets your takeout order wrong, but what if it starts sharing your personal information with scam websites or posting horrific social media content under your name? High-risk workplaces could introduce particularly hazardous scenarios: what if it can access a missile command system?Mitchell hopes technologists, legislators and policymakers will incentivise guardrails to mitigate such incidents. For now, she foresees agentic capabilities becoming more refined for specific tasks. Soon, she says, we’ll see agents interacting with agents – your agent could work with mine to set up a meeting, for example.This proliferation of agents could reshape the internet. Currently, a lot of information online is specialised for human language, but if AIs are increasingly interacting with websites, this could change. “We’re going to see more and more information available through the internet that is not directly human language, but is the information that would be necessary for an agent to be able to act on it,” Mitchell says.Dohmke echoes this idea. He believes that the concept of the homepage will lose importance, and interfaces will be designed with AI agents in mind. Brands may start competing for AI attention over human eyeballs.One day, agents may even escape the confines of the computer. We could see AI agents embodied in robots, which would open up a world of physical tasks for them to help with. “My prediction is that we’re going to see agents that can do our laundry for us and do our dishes and make us breakfast,” says Mitchell. “Just don’t give them access to weapons.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverComputingRetail industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Skype was a reminder of a bygone era and a source of inspiration for many. It facilitated relationships across oceans when there were few affordable means of making international calls, nothing short of a miracle for those with family members in distant parts of the world.One nostalgic Guardian reader composed a song based on the familiar Skype ring. Michael Frishkopf, a professor at the University of Albert’s department of music and the director of the Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology, created a short symphonic work with the Skype theme song in 2020. It was “originally for a film score (though it was never used in that way)”, Frishkopf wrote in an email.“Skype was always a tool for connecting out of isolation and it struck me that a lot of people probably associate it with being far from loved ones,” Frishkopf said. “That Skype ring tone, I don’t know who made it, but it has a kind of wistfulness to it. It isn’t either major or minor, it could go either way. In the same way, it could sound happy or sad which could represent the sadness of longing for someone and the joy of connecting with them. That [Skype] is fading out for good, it might cause a sense of loss for people.”Skyping (orchestral)Michael FrishkopfSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/03/05/Skyping_(orchestral)_-_composed_by_Michael_Frishkopf.mp300:00:0000:02:01Inspired by Frishkopf’s email, the Guardian asked readers to share their own memories of Skype. What they described in touching tributes was a piece of technology that connected parents with their children, enabled start-up founders to communicate across oceans and timezones, and even made two proposals possible.Melany Heger.Photograph: Melany HegerThe stay-at-home mom who found a new careerWhen I had a mid-career shift, I used Skype extensively as a way to contact clients. That was 2019, and I was on the verge of working again. I spent ten years as a full-time mom, you see. Before I began working online, it felt impossible to be working and stay at home for my kids. You can say that Skype opened up a world of possibilities to me.– Melany Heger, Manila, PhilippinesThe couples who dated and proposed on SkypeHolly and her husband’s wedding bandsPhotograph: HollyI proposed to my Swedish husband over Skype using sticky notes. We got married on 5-5-15, the same day Skype will end its service. It’s very sad, I especially liked it since it was from my husband’s homeland of Sweden. Skype played a big part in our lives in keeping us connected while we were dating and it will always be in my heart.– Holly, IowaDave’s Skype profile picturePhotograph: DaveI think we take for granted how revolutionary Skype was. A futurist utopia always included video calling, and that was ubiquitous by 2005 thanks to Skype. I proposed marriage through it to a long-distance girlfriend in 2008. We never got married, but our ill-fated engagement felt glorious for the weeks after, and memories of our multi-hour sessions still give me a sense of melancholy as strong as any other moments of lost young love.– Dave, MichiganMy husband and I would never be married if we hadn’t had Skype. We met in 2004 when he was on a year abroad from Colorado School of Mines to the University of Leeds. By the time I moved to the States and we got married in November 2009, we had racked up countless Skype hours at all times of the day and night. Skype allowed us to have a long distance relationship that would not have seemed possible if we were just a few years older. Skype also allowed me to see and chat with my parents after I had moved.Nowadays my children (11 and seven) cannot imagine a life without FaceTiming their grandparents, but so much of that is owed to mom and dad’s early years of Skype dating!– Jessica, ColoradoThe faraway relatives who Skyped family back homeView image in fullscreenLauraPhotograph: LauraIn 2004, I moved across the world to attend university in the United States. Phone calls were too expensive, so I would spend hours on Skype chatting with my family and friends back home. When we went around the dinner table saying what we were grateful for my first American Thanksgiving, Skype was my answer. Homesickness was my malady, Skype was my medicine.– Laura, Los AngelesMy great-grandmother said the most important invention during her lifetime was the ability to fly internationally, delighting in the fact that she could journey from Australia by plane for her one and only ‘grand European tour’ in the 1960s, once all her children had grown. For my grandmother, who sadly passed in 2010, it was the invention of Skype. She had spent many years corresponding via a much-cherished weekly letter and annual phone call when her only sister moved to London and then New York during the 60s and 70s. So, you can imagine her delight when I made a similar move abroad in the 2000s that we could still see each other and talk via a video call during her final years. I cherish the memory of those Skype calls as much as the letters she wrote me.– Felix, MexicoWhen first arriving on these Japanese shores, calls to the US were prohibitively expensive. I used to write aerograms (light paper that could be folded into an envelope) to my parents. Then I had two children who dispersed, one to Tokyo, one to the US. We Skype regularly, though we also use Google Chat. As an expat, I have found Skype invaluable. It can be used as a verb – “Let’s Skype!” – and fulfills a sense of joy found on Christmas morning.

I think there is no better app for teaching, especially because of the clarity of the voice in terms of teaching by sharing the page.– Ghulam Asghar Awan, PakistanDuring the pandemic, I did online teaching via Skype. One of my students was a single child, alone at home. She was around 10 when I first taught her. Now when all school was online, she was obviously very happy to have a teacher just for herself. She didn’t learn much, because she interrupted me all the time, just wanting to talk to somebody. Bella, you still have a very special place in my heart! I’ll never forget you!– Friedrich Helmke, BrazilThe friends who connected via SkypeView image in fullscreenMatthew (left) and Harald (right)Photograph: MatthewThe person with whom I used Skype the most and used it last was my friend Harald. I live in Wisconsin and work at the university in Madison. Harald was from Germany but did a postdoctoral fellowship in Madison in the early 2000s. We became friends while he was here, and interestingly, we grew much closer after he moved back to Germany. We would get together before or after conferences and do bike trips together, and we visited each other many times over the years.Harald’s preferred way of communicating when we were on opposite sides of the world was by Skype. He’d use it as a verb. “Let’s Skype next Tuesday,” he’d say to me. I would often tease him as new platforms became popular that he was wedded to this outdated mode of communication. He died about two years ago, and I miss him terribly. And anytime I hear about Skype I think of him.– Matthew, WisconsinThe startup founders who met every evening on SkypeView image in fullscreenOurResearch co-founders, Heather Piwowar and Jason PriemPhotograph: Heather PiwowarOur startup, which has helped hundreds of thousands of people access scientific research, only exists because of Skype. We wrote the seeds of the project at an all-night hackathon in 2011, in person, but the two of us lived in different countries and three time zones apart – would this thing fizzle or bloom? Over the next few years we talked on Skype every evening to improve the product, get funded, incorporate and grow. Skype saw our grit, tears and laughter. The result wasUnpaywall,OpenAlex, improved open science, and wonderful memories. Thank you, Skype.– Heather Piwowar, Vancouver, CanadaThe man who begrudgingly gives Skype creditSkype was the first of the video calling services. That said, it was absolutely rubbish, and I dropped it like a stone as soon as anything close to a viable alternative arrived. It’s bloated, resource-hogging, unintuitive interface lives on in Teams and is vastly improved upon by services like Discord. I’m thankful for it breaking new ground, but am more thankful we’ve gone a lot further from where we started.– Seth, Cambridge, UKExplore more on these topicsSkypeMicrosoftInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania were also on the list. But perpetrators also included militias and other non-state actors.Telecommunication and internet service providers who shut services based on government orders are also complicit in violating people’s rights, said Felicia Anthonio, the #KeepItOn campaign manager at Access Now, citing theUN guiding principles on business and human rights.The details showed that most of the shutdowns were imposed as a response to conflicts, protests and political instability. There were also restrictions during elections.The trend was replicated across the world with more internet shutdowns and in more countries: 296 shutdowns across 54 countries, compared with 283 shutdowns in 39 countries the previous year.Access Now said the figures were the worst since it started keeping records in 2016 and that the rise reflected “a world where internet access is consistently weaponised, restricted, and precarious”.“Behind each of the 1,754 shutdowns since 2016 is a story of people and communities cut off from the world and each other, often during political upheaval, unrest, violence and war,” the report said.At least five shutdowns in Africa had been imposed for more than a year by the end of 2024, according to Access Now. As of early 2025, the social network Meta was still restricted in Uganda, despite authorities engaging with its representatives. On the Equatorial Guinean island of Annobon, internet and cell serviceshave been cut offsince an August 2024 protest over environmental concerns and isolation from the rest of the country.The increase in shutdowns led the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to pass a landmark resolution in March 2024 to help reverse the trend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is difficult for us to tell if the resolution is yielding results already, but we did see authorities in countries likeMauritiusand South Sudan [in January 2025] backtrack or reverse shutdown orders.”Explore more on these topicsInternetAfricaHuman rightsComorosGuinea-BissauMauritiusBurundinewsShareReuse this content"

Now watching your friend strip another blonde with perky tits. She’s not more than 22. I have seen your tits so many times in the recording. You are late 20s now? Declining youth and saggy boobs… There is so much to learn when one just follows you around. Have you left Sri Lanka or just hiding from me? Tell me please. I will come and get you.Ciao”Hannah was 23, not long out of university, and had just landed her dream job. She was an intern with a new jewellery brand called Alighieri, and although she was being paid little more than expenses, she had been thrown into the deep end and was loving it, not least because she got to go to London fashion week.“It had always been my dream to go,” she says. And now she was there “as a professional”, as she puts it. It felt like her first big break. She was the company’s first employee and was given the task of hanging out in the “designer showrooms”, London fashion week’s marketplace – a melting pot of teenage models, fashion insiders and hangers-on. Her job was to try to find the elusive white whale that every new brand was desperately chasing: buyers.The golden goose was a cash-rich foreign buyer. And as luck would have it, Hannah found one. Or maybe not luck. Although Hannah was young and in a new environment, she is also a natural extrovert: sunny, open, chatty. She’d bumped into an acquaintance, the friend of a friend, and he introduced her to his friend: a well-groomed Hong Kong national called Kin Hung.“It was just a huge relief,” she says, “to have proved myself.” Kin seemed to be the real deal, a big wheel with major contacts in the Asian fashion market.They posed for a selfie together and Hannah gave Kin her contact details. And that was where it all began. Though for the longest time, Hannah wasn’t sure what “it” was. Kin had VIP passes and could get into any show, magic up tables at any restaurant. For two years, he was her friend and “mentor”. Later, without even realising how it happened, Hannah slowly found herself in a bizarre constructed reality – a fly in a spider’s web of false narratives.One of the fake accounts, ‘Premium Escorts’, purported to be selling her sexual servicesThe short version of the story is that for much of her 20s, Hannah had a stalker. Or maybe stalkers. Someone who’d gathered information on her – photos, details of her private life, jobs, family, locations – and bombarded her with abuse, threats and worse. Someone who watched her and hacked her bank account and her phone account. Her mobile phone was repeatedly cut off: she’d find herself somewhere and not be able to get home, not able to call anyone. It happened not just once but seven, or eight times.And not justherphone: her dad’s was targeted too. A photo of her mother’s front door was emailed to her, legal threats were sent to her brother’s home, new email accounts in her name were set up to impersonate her. One of these, “Premium Escorts”, purported to be selling her sexual services. She was threatened with lawsuits and criminal action. WhatsApp groups were created by a fake Hannah in which she confessed criminal activity to friends and family. She also received threats of violence and rape.View image in fullscreenHannah in the BBC Sounds recording studios during the making of the Stalked podcast.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah Mossman MooreAt first, she tried to deal with it alone. Eventually, she went to the police, handing over folders of evidence, pages and pages of printouts. When they finally took action, they went to arrest a suspect, found he wasn’t home and gave up. Later, the police wrote to Hannah and told her they’d closed the case. “Evidential difficulties,” they said. The stalking continued.It’s now a decade on; Hannah is older and only just starting to understand what happened to her, not least because her story is now a10-part BBC podcast,Stalked. What seems even more unbelievable, as I write these words, is that I knew Hannah all the while this was going on. To some degree, the podcast is my way of making amends.We set out to do what the police failed to even try to do: solve the crime. And thanks to the tenacity ofStalked’s producers, Georgia Catt and Rob Byrne, we believe we are nearer to solving it. The motivation for doing so, at least in my case, is because of the guilt of not realising what was going on underneath my nose, even though this whole story was in many ways on my investigative patch.Hannah, I should explain, is my ex Dave’s daughter, and although we’d split up many years earlier, they’d both remained in my life. We celebrate birthdays and milestones together. Dave is the honorary co-parent of my dog. The three of us share endless silly animal videos in our WhatsApp chat.This was like a human version of Cambridge Analytica: a malign influence in her life who was harvesting, profiling, surveilling and targeting herAt the peak of Hannah’s nightmare, I’d been deep in the throes of my investigation aboutCambridge Analytica,Facebookand the weaponisation of social media. I was overwhelmed, wrestling with a massive story and my own frayed nerves and security concerns, unaware that Hannah was dealing with what, in hindsight, seems like a human version of Cambridge Analytica: a malign influence in her life who was harvesting, profiling, surveilling and targeting her.So much of my work of the past decade has been about Silicon Valley surveillance. It’s the underlying business model of all social media platforms: they track us – even if we’re not on them – to monetise us. The whole thrust of the Cambridge Analytica story was how personal information collected for one purpose – a personality quiz – could be repurposed for another:electing Donald Trump. Yet I was oblivious to how a similar thing was happening to Hannah. How someone had her personal data – lots of it – and was twisting it and weaponising it against her.It wasn’t until the second lockdown – the dreary, endless, dark, cold winter lockdown that began in England in November 2020 – when I went with Hannah for a long, looping walk around my part of north London, that it finally started to come into focus.View image in fullscreenHannah and Carole Cadwalladr on holiday in the south of France in 2017.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah Mossman MooreAt this point, Hannah was 28, living with her dad and attempting to set up her own jewellery business while hustling to make money: moonlighting as a barista and trying, like we all were, to get through a pandemic without losing her mind. We were walking uphill through my local park when, offhandedly, Hannah mentioned something about “Swami”. I said: “Swami?” – and she sort of shrugged despairingly. “You know, Swami – he was one of the hackers, supposedly. You know, the whole online reputation management thing.”She was right: Ididknow about Swami and the hackers and the online reputation management thing. It had happened after a terrifying incident with Kin in Florida in which, two years after Hannah had known him, he’d allegedly become aggressive and controlling and tried to prevent her leaving. His behaviour in person and texts between them show that she was terrified and begged to leave. He claimed that his out-of-character conduct was because he’d been hacked. What happened next was deeply confusing. An entire cast of characters starting communicating with her, multiple different people, all abusive in different ways. Kin claimed these were “the hackers” who had “jumped” to her.Hannah had a stalker in the way that some people have a health condition; something such as lupus – uncommon, mysterious, little understood. It was a permanent feature of her life that occasionally flared into crisis but which most of the time she tried to ignore, minimise, pretend wasn’t happening. That day, when there was nothing else to do but walk endlessly, I made her stop. “Just go back to the beginning,” I said. “And tell me the whole story.”What tumbled out in fits and starts over hours was unbelievable. It began with meeting Kin, the charming, helpful man. And somehow gradually escalated into a sophisticated campaign designed to ruin her life. It had, in part, succeeded.At one point, Hannah pulled out her phone. “Look,” she said. There was email after email of pornographic material. Some were addressed to “Hooker Hani” and fixated on the idea that she was a sex worker “with a body like an over-fucked buffalo”. Some were soliciting reports of the putative clients who’d supposedly used her sexual services. Mixed in were photos of Hannah as a young student. “I don’t even know where those photos are from,” she said. There were details of her life, of her locations. Even while we were talking, another arrived. By the end of the walk, four new ones had landed in her inbox.In the jumbled relaying of the story, Hannah introduced a new character: Alice. “It’s what also happened to Alice,” she said. “Who’s Alice?” I asked. Was this another harasser? “Alice Ruggles,” she said. Hannah explained that Alice had taken her place at her school in Leicester when Hannah’s mother had accepted a teaching post abroad. “I never knew her but she became best friends with all my best friends.” Alice had a stalker too. “And she’d also tried and tried to get the police to help.” That help never came and she’s no longer around to tell the rest of her story.In 2016, Alice’s stalker murdered her.Ifelt a profound sense of hopelessness when Hannah finally opened up to me. The next weekend, she came around to my flat with bundles of documents. There were at least nine different characters communicating with her and between themselves. It was wildly confusing, the kind of investigation that needed time and focus and a team, and in early 2021 I had none of these. Instead, I had my own issues: adefamation lawsuitthat ate my time and, even more so, my spirit.But what I landed on was an idea. I’d been blown away by a BBC podcast series calledThe Missing Cryptoqueen. It combined an investigation, public service journalism and vivid storytelling in a way I hadn’t heard before, and Georgia Catt was the producing genius behind it. I emailed her.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål Hansen/The ObserverShe sent an upbeat response, which I forwarded to Hannah, although I worried that I was getting her hopes up. Two weeks later, Hannah called me. “You’re never going to believe this.” What? “It’s stopped!” What’s stopped? “The emails. Everything. It’s all just stopped dead.” A coincidence? Or had someone been in her emails? We still don’t know the answer to that. A relentless campaign that had been going on for four years suddenly went silent.If the police want to find out who’s doing it, it’s possible because the digital evidence is there. They can’t be bothered, in my viewRachel Horman-Brown, solicitorStalking is the only crime where victims are meant to obtain evidence for themselves, says Rachel Horman-Brown, a solicitor who specialises in stalking. “If you report a burglary, you don’t have to present fingerprints to the police. It just doesn’t happen for any other crime. And the thing is, stalking nowadays in virtually every case will involve an online element, which means there’s a digital footprint, which means that it is provable. If they want to find out who’s doing it, it’s possible because the evidence is there. They can’t be bothered, in my view.”Catt and co-producer Byrne systemised all the evidence and then found a team of forensic linguists who work for the FBI and who dusted for metaphorical fingerprints in the copious written materials. It’s the same technique that was used to identify the Unabomber, and Robert Leonard, professor of linguistics at Hofstra University in New York, was able to pull out endless similarities between the apparently different styles of the various messages, suggestive of “evidence of common ownership”, meaning they were written by the same person or persons.Another data expert, Jonathan Sebire, who works for Premier League clubs identifying and managing threats against footballers, examined the data trail, which revealed a pattern linked to Kin’s movements. A psychologist of stalking, Alan Underwood, assessed the messages and the same driving psychology behind them all: “an intimacy seeker”.In last week’s episode (number six), after carefully evaluating all the evidence with the BBC’s lawyers, we named the man who we have reasonable grounds to believe is the perpetrator behind it all. The man who the evidence suggests to us is every single one of these characters, who sent the rape threats and is the person behind the Premium Escorts account: Kin Hung. The charming, friendly, helpful man who Hannah met at London fashion week when she was 23. Kin denies this and adamantly denies ever stalking Hannah.“True crime” has a mixed reputation, muckraking over salacious murders from decades ago, butStalkedis something different. Most victims of stalking and harassment do not receive any sort of help and – only in rare instances – justice. No woman should have to rely on a ragtag team of journalists for answers but that’s where we are.Four years on, it no longer seems like such a coincidence that two girls from the same class at the same school would both have stalkers. Or that neither of them had been able to get the help they needed from the police. One in five women will experience stalking,according to the Office for National Statistics, and one in 11 men. It would be more unusual for a single class of schoolgirls to grow up andnotto have a stalker. In the vast majority of cases, the perpetrators are never caught:only 6.6% of casesreported to the police in the year ending March 2022 resulted in a charge. Just 1.4% in a conviction.View image in fullscreenHannah as a child with her mother in Worthing, West Sussex, in 1995.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah Mossman MooreWhat we realised while making the podcast is that stalking is an epidemic. It’s mostly invisible. It ruins lives. And it’s rapidly growing, partly because there are now so many tools available to assist a would-be stalker. Most cases of stalking now involve a cyber element, and surveilling, profiling and targeting someone via legal and illegal means is both easy and common.If it’s happened to you or someone you know, the first thing to realise is that you’re not alone. And the second is that there’s nothing you could have done differently. It’s not your fault. It’s that feeling of blame and shame that took Hannah so long to shake. But there was nothing she could have done.What I’ve come to understand is that part of the reason I hadn’t realised the extent of what was going on or how badly it affected Hannah is that so much of what was happening to her was private, mediated by technology, targeted directly to her phone. And that Hannah also used technology to mask the truth. During one of the peaks of the malicious activity, she ran away to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, posting photos on her Instagram account of sunsets, cocktails, glasses of green juice.Hannah always said “my stalker” with ironic air quotes. One of her biggest eye-rolls was towards anyone she felt was acting like a victim. It was – her words – an “ick”. It wasn’t that she was unsympathetic towards others; she just had a horror of being one herself. Hannah dreamed of being an accomplished businesswoman: having her own company, being successful, independent – the exact opposite of a victim.But Hannahwasa victim. It was just something that she’d refused to acknowledge to anybody – especially herself. Even as her life unravelled and she retreated from her friends: “I didn’t know what to say to them,” she said and moved back home with her dad. “I think she’s just relieved to be here,” he told me. She felt “such shame and embarrassment”.It’s been a long and arduous process to unpick everything. Hannah has had to expose herself, hand over the passwords to her accounts, let Catt and Byrne and the lawyers trawl through her private life. We know Hannah was stalked and “hacked”, whether through technological or social methods. But we have no certainty over who or how. We don’t know whether Kin is behind it all. We do believe, however, Kin is involved; the evidence is too compelling to feel otherwise. He has responded robustly through his London lawyers: Kin denies all accusations and adamantly denies ever stalking or harassing Hannah, rejecting the allegations as “false and without foundation”.The first use case of all new technology is to weaponise it: to surveil, target, control. Anestimated 96% of deepfake video is nonconsensual pornography. A not insignificant percentage of that is directed at children, girls.Eight years ago, I went withChristopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, to an electronics shop in Tottenham Court Road in central London, where in an upstairs room, behind a closed door, we looked at undercover filming equipment. A few months ago, I went back with Georgia and Hannah, and a salesman showed us his current range of products, which had advanced beyond recognition: spyware in all shapes and forms – all of it legal to buy.Surveillance technology that was once the preserve of nation states is now available to anyone for a few poundsA simple white phone charger, identical to any number you’ll find in your own home, was the one that I found myself marvelling at. It turned out to be a voice-activated recorder. When a conversation starts, it records, and when it ends, it automatically messages you a sound file. Technology that was once the preserve of nation states is now available to anyone for a few pounds.And then there’s your personal data.Silicon Valley is itself a surveillance tool. It’s what its entire economy is built on. Your personally identifiable data has been vacuumed up by shady middlemen. It’s more difficult here, but in the US, private investigators use it to deliver detailed and incredibly intrusive intelligence reports in a matter of minutes.Regardless of the who and the why of it all, the effects on Hannah were profound. We laugh now about the list of numbers that I have for Hannah in my phone: Hannah – Android, Hannah – New 2017, Hannah LA, Hannah New Moby, Hannah New Number, Hannah – New 2018, Hannah (new) 2019, Hannah USA…But it’s a record of a woman being hunted, in flight. For a period, she didn’t have any phone at all.View image in fullscreenHannah with her father.Photograph: Courtesy of Hannah Mossman MooreMaking the podcast – being listened to and believed, having the support and opinion of experts – has been a life-changing experience for Hannah. She’s regained control of her life, her narrative. It’s been a huge privilege to see, and we’re both acutely conscious of how most women don’t have that opportunity. The most affecting moment in the series is when Hannah goes to meet Alice Ruggles’s parents. It’s so profoundly sad. Alice’s calls to the police were released, and her polite, don’t-want-to-make-a-fuss tone is the hardest thing to hear. “I know this sounds crazy,” Hannah tells Sue, Alice’s mother, “but I never wanted to inconvenience him.” Sue replies: “That’s exactly what Alice said. Exactly the same.”The Metropolitan police asked Hannah for a meeting last month and apologised to her for the handling of her case. Mistakes were made, they said. They no longer issue “first harassment warnings”, which have been widely accepted to be valueless. In a statement, Commander Kevin Southworth said: “We recognise the service the victim received between 2018 and 2020 fell short of what is expected… Since 2022, we have significantly improved our response to stalking and in the last year have investigated more cases of this nature than ever before.”I learned things, too, through the making of the podcast. It had never occurred to me that there was any overlap between Hannah’s experience and my own. Hannah’s privacy and peace of mind had been relentlessly shredded. She’d been targeted and abused in private: a torrent of messages, threats, intimidation and confusion sent direct to her phone. She’d been sexually shamed and exposed. She’d retreated into herself and isolated herself from friends and family. She felt despair and hopelessness.The thing is that I could have written that list about myself.Observerreaders may know something of the very public online abuse I received through the years of myBrexitinvestigation.Hannah was shamed for being young, attractive, sexually desirable. She was a slut – “Hooker Hani”. “Her vagina has more STDs than a toilet bowl has germs,” the perpetrator wrote to her then boyfriend. I was shamed for being the opposite: older, childless, a “mad cat woman”, or what, in previous centuries, used to be called a witch.It’s a measure of how effective these strategies are that although Hannah and I are very close, neither of us knew at the time what the other was going through. So much is internalised. The silencing is real.The first victims of all new technology are women. But they’re never the last. If you want to understand what’s coming down the line in the future, you need to look at what’s already happening to women now. This use of technology to surveil, target, shame, bully, coercively control; it’s the same technology that is now being deployed by Trump and, especially, Elon Musk against people they consider enemies. Musk more than anyone understands that data is power. We’re all prey now.The first five episodes ofStalkedare available onBBC SoundsExplore more on these topicsSexual harassmentObservedWomenCrimeData protectionViolence against women and girlsPoliceSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

By Friday, the chat was of the“Merz spurt”.The decision by Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor-in-waiting, to cut a deal on ditching Germany’s debt brake – still to be confirmed by the outgoing parliament – marked a seismic shift.The EU country most associated with strict fiscal discipline is now contemplating what could in principle be unlimited borrowing to fund Europe’s defence.Lifting the brake, widely regarded by experts as an unnecessarily tight constraint on public spending in an economy sorely in need of stimulus,cheered European markets.Bond yields rose, as investors contemplated the extra borrowing Germany is now expected to undertake; but so did the euro and European stocks, on the assumption the move would be positive for growth.Merz’s abrupt about-turn, after arguing for spending restraint during the recent election campaign, is part of a dramaticEU-wide push to “ReArm Europe”– a slogan it was depressing and disorientating to see on official communications last week, in the EU’s trademark blue and yellow branding.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, suggested as much as €800bn (£671bn) could ultimately be mobilised to create a bulwark against Russia, as the US withdraws.In other words, Donald Trump’s isolationist turn has had a dramatic galvanising effect on the EU, smashing through its cumbersome decision-making structures.View image in fullscreenUrsula von der Leyen suggested that as much as €800bn could ultimately be mobilised to create a bulwark against Russia, as the US withdraws.Photograph: Omar Havana/APThe German decision is the right one – although Merz’s insistence on trying to pass it in the outgoing parliament is hardly democratic best-practice.As US markets turned sour last week against the backdrop ofTrump’s chaotic trade policy, it may have been tempting for the Europeans to feel a touch of schadenfreude – an appropriately German word.Yet while EU countries have rapidly drawn up plans to deal with the new, less cooperative US in the security sphere, they must also brace themselves for the impact of Trump’s other great project – smashing up the global trading system and rebuilding it in the US’s favour.The barely credible fact that Trump had slapped 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, countries with which he negotiated a free trade agreement in his first term, almost got lost in the maelstrom of history-making news last week.As Canadian liquor stores stripped their shelves of American bourbon, and US carmakers warned that prices could rocket, the president offered a temporary carve-out, andthen a broader reprieve.But the administration remains strongly wedded to the idea of tariffs. Trump even argued on Saturday that the prospect of a trade war with Canada and Mexico would spice up next year’s football World Cup, which the the two countries are jointly hosting with the US. “Tension is a good thing … It makes it much more exciting,” he said.It is usually a mistake to try to read too much logic into Trump’s approach, which owes as much to personal gripes and grudges as to theory. But he and his henchmen do seem determined to ditch the rules-based world trading system, in favour of something much more Hobbesian.Just as the administration is using the language of liberty and free speech to clothe its attacks on many aspects of US public life, the aim of the tariffs policy is apparently to enforce “fairness”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see it with these gigantic trade deficits that we run.”The next wave of import taxes is due to be imposed on steel, aluminium and derivative products – everything from vehicle parts to kitchen sinks – this Wednesday, andanalysts at Global Trade Alertestimate that more than $20bn (£15.5bn) of EU exports will be affected.When it comes to the “reciprocal” tariffs Trump has threatened to impose on 2 April, with higher rates for countries the US deems to be trading unfairly, the EU appears to be firmly in his sights.Trump described the bloc in a typically bellicose statement on Friday as a “terrible abuser” of the current system.Recentanalysis by Aslak Bergat the Centre for European Reform, suggested a 20% tariff on all EU exports would lead to a decline in exports to the US of $200bn a year. “Given the weakness of the European economy, this would certainly cause a recession,” he said.The EU has a toolkit of retaliatory instruments ready to go, including the ability to slap tariffs on US products, as it did in response to steel tariffs in Trump’s first term. These are understandably aimed at bringing Trump to the negotiating table, but in the interim they will just add to the chaos.The UK appears to be out of the US president’s eyeline for the moment, after Keir Starmer’s trip to Washington, and Britain does not have the trade surplus in goods that Trump tends to read as a sign of some underlying inequity.But the US may still zero in on other UK policies, such as the digital services tax, expected to raise £800m this year from tech companies – and as the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has made clear, Britain would not be immune to a global slowdown triggered by rising tariffs.The most important news this last week was that Trump 2.0 has made Europe a much more dangerous place, but it would be a mistake to lose sight of the wrecking ball he continues to wield over the global trading system. The next few weeks and months look likely to be, as some headlines had it last week, “tariffying”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEconomics viewpointInternational tradeEuropean UnionEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

In Donald Trump’s court, flattery is the only spoken language. He does not need an executive order to enforce it. Fear is the other side of the coin. Loyalty must be blind. Obedience is safety. Cronyism secures status. His whim is dogma. Criticism is heresy. Debate is apostasy. Expertise is bias. Objectivity is a hoax. Truth is just your opinion. Lies are defended to the death as articles of faith. New ones are manufactured on an industrial scale by his press office for social influencers to spread. Denying facts proves fealty. The rule of law is partisan. Russia is our trusted ally. Britain and France are “random counties”. Retribution is policy.The deeper the submission to madness, the greater his supremacy. The subjugation is more thorough if the things people are forced to accept are irrational or, better, the reverse of what they had believed. When previously held beliefs are abandoned to conform to their opposite, like the secretary of state Marco Rubio’s formerly adamant support of Ukraine, which went to his core as the son of refugees from Castro’s Cuba, the more Trump’s dominance is demonstrated. Rubio has gone full circle, from his family fleeing one kind of tyranny to Trump sneering at him as “Little Marco” to ambitious embrace of his tormentor. He finds himself as a supplicant to Trump complaining about Elon Musk’s mindless wreckage of the state department. Formally the ranking constitutional officer of the cabinet, Rubio is below Musk in Trump’s hierarchy.Each of the concentric rings of Trump’s court require different nuances of servility. At mid-level, the ethos is to mimic the irrational impulses of the ruler in order to be seen as his willing helper. In 1934, a middle-rank German minister explained that “it is the duty of everybody to try to work towards the Führer along the lines he would wish.” “Working toward the Fuhrer” –auf den Führer hinarbeiten– became the governing style, or else.At the cabinet level, Rubio’s renunciation is an essential conversion to prove subservient allegiance to theFuhrerprinzip. “The higher one rose in the hierarchy, the more servile one became,” wrote Albert Speer, Hitler’s war manufacturing minister, in his memoir. At the height of power, in the innermost circle, at the leader’s right hand, sitsJD Vance, who taunts and threatens on the leader’s behalf, demanding obsequious “respect” while slyly deploying his sycophancy to goad the leader.Upon passing through the gates of Trump’s White House, Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, entered into a domain that would have been intimately familiar to him. It would have been reminiscent of the claustrophobic despotism in Ukraine under communism. It would have been a reminder of what was called “the Family” of kleptocratic oligarchs, lackeys and political operatives surrounding the Putin-backed Ukrainian ruler Viktor Yanukovych before he fled the country during the popular uprising of 2014 – a gangster culture that included the US consultant Paul Manafort, also Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, whom he would pardon for a host of criminal felonies.Not even Elon Musk systematically shredding the federal government approached the historic scale of Trump’s crime against UkraineA western world shocked at Trump’s orchestrated humiliation of Zelenskyy should have seen the staged event as the culmination of hundreds of similar transgressions since he became president again. The difference between the rest of his rampage and his denigration of Zelensky was only in its momentousness. But not evenElon Musksystematically shredding the federal government approached the historic scale of Trump’s crime against Ukraine, which reduced the United States through a few insults to the lowest ebb of its international power and prestige since a century ago, when, in a spasm of partisan isolationism, the Senate rejected joining the League of Nations after the first world war. But, for the appalled and disoriented Europeans who must pick up the pieces as they adjust to the reality of an American president discarding them in order to forge a grand alliance with Russia, the revealing signs of Trump’s malignancy have been present in a never-ending series of less than world historical but dramatically squalid scandals.“I wouldn’t believe Donald Trump if his tongue were notarized,” New York mayor Ed Koch once quipped. Now, Trump tried to erase the infamy of being a figure of ridicule in New York by planting his hooks into the current mayor, Eric Adams. A predator recognizes vulnerability. After ordering the Department of Justice to drop its corruption charges against Adams, Trump’s precipitate action prompted the resignation of the acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, Danielle Sassoon, whostatedthat it was “a quid pro quo” in exchange for supporting the Trump administration’s “enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed”, and which was followed by the resignations of seven prosecutors from the justice department’s public integrity unit, who refused to participate in the deal.Trump’s repetitive compulsion to create disorder allows him to present himself as its would-be masterWith Adams under his heel, Trump next crushed the Republican Senate through the confirmation process of his unqualified collection of quacks for his cabinet. Intimidation and smears did the work of cowing the august senators. Then, through his installation of his largest donor, Elon Musk, as his self-advertised “Dark Maga” overlord, Trump launched the massacre of the entire federal government. Off with their heads everywhere. The purges have no trials. Tick off the execution list of Project 2025. Let the courts slowly try to catch up to the devastation.Trump’s repetitive compulsion to create disorder allows him to present himself as its would-be master. He can’t temper his impulses. His bedlam provides his only arena for self-validation. He must always fabricate scenes for the exaltation of himself through the humiliation of others to confirm that he is strong. Musk magnifies his abuse.In two speeches, one by the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and the other by the vice-president, JD Vance, theTrump administrationshifted the ground under Ukraine and the western allies to Russian advantage. On 12 February, at the Ukraine Contact Group in Brussels, Hegseth conceded conditions to Russia before any negotiations had begun. He stated the return of occupied territory “unrealistic”, opposed Nato membership and rejected US participation in a security force. Two days later, on 14 February, Vance delivered a second shock, reciting the talking points of the far-right parties in Europe in a virtual endorsement a week before the German election of the neo-Nazi Alternative for Germany Party.Some Republicans appear to have a good idea about the agents of influence floating around the Trump administration. Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, said after Hegseth’s speech, “I don’t know who wrote the speech – it is the kind of thingTucker Carlsoncould have written, and Carlson is a fool.” The former Fox News talkshow host, now with his own podcast, has deep ties to the regimes of Putin and Orbán of Hungary. A fount of Russian disinformation, he is at the center of a circle that includes Donald Trump Jr and JD Vance, bonded as lost boys, abandoned in childhood, and who persuaded Trump to name Vance as his running mate. Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, a pro-Russian echo chamber, now the national director of intelligence, were brought into their orbit.Tucker Carlson’s son, Buckley Carlson, is Vance’s deputy press director.Jack Posobiec, a far-right conspiracy monger of Pizzagate and white supremacist, was invited to travel with Hegseth, to whom he is close, and has traveled with the secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent, on his trip in February to Ukraine to meet with Zelensky.In 2017, according to areportof the Atlantic Council, Posobiec was a key player in aiding the Russian “coordinated attempt to undermine Emmanuel Macron’s candidacy, with a disinformation campaign consisting of rumors, fake news, and even forged documents; a hack targeting the computers of his campaign staff; and, finally, a leak – 15 gigabytes of stolen data, including 21,075 emails, released on Friday, May 5, 2017 – just two days before the second and final round of the presidential election”.In 2024, Posobiec addressed the Conservative Political Action Committee: “Welcome to theend of democracy. We are here to overthrow it completely. We didn’t get all the way there on January 6, but we will endeavor to get rid of it.”Making nice with Trump has never proved to be a winning strategy. If Zelensky had bent to shine Trump’s shoes under his desk, he would still have been in a trap. Obsequious gestures to neutralize Trump have been repeatedly tried and failed. If anyone could cajole Trump, it would have been David Rubenstein, the billionaire founder of the Carlyle Group who built his firm with a bipartisan board. Rubenstein has been a pillar of the Washington community, who cherishes the constitution and has lent the National Archives his copy of the original Bill of Rights, personally paid for the restoration of the Washington Monument, and is a patron of the arts, the longtime chair of the Kennedy Center. He recently bought the Baltimore Orioles. Rubenstein wined and dined Donald and Melania Trump, attempted to ingratiate himself and bring them into his charmed circle. Rubenstein’s civilizing mission ran aground.Rubenstein presented Trump with a golden opportunity to gain the kind of acceptance he had sought for a lifetime. He has nursed his injury over rejection by the great and the good in New York, where his crudity, vulgarity and narrow greed constantly undermined his social ambitions. He was also a spectacular failure in the New York real estate market. But Trump still harbored resentment from the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors, when two of the recipients, choreographer Carmen de Lavallade and legendary TV producer Norman Lear, declined to attend a reception at the White House. Trump never appeared at any of the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term. He never came to a single of the thousands of the wide variety of cultural events there, not one. He was not boycotting; he had no interest in theater, music, dance, anything. He is a void.Trump cares less for a diplomatic approach than for acting out his endless drama of victimization and self-promotionOn 12 February, Trump unceremoniously fired its entire board, claimed that the national centerpiece of the performing arts in the capital was “woke” and a “disgrace,” denounced Rubenstein, who does “not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture”, and announced as his replacement “an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!” Rubenstein was privately stunned and surprised at his shabby treatment. But Trump cared less for Rubenstein’s diplomatic approach than for acting out his endless drama of victimization and self-promotion.Trump’s interim director inserted at the Kennedy Center, Ric Grenell, a rightwing activist who was universallydespisedin Germany when he was ambassador there in the first Trump term, declared that to “make the arts great again” the Kennedy Center wouldstagea biblical pageant about the birth of Jesus. Trump named Melania’s former modeling agent, Paolo Zampolli, to the board. He held forth to an Italian newspaper,Il Foglio, about Zelenskyy: “He should rebuild Gaza with all the money he stole.”Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy was preceded two days, earlier on 26 February, by his first cabinet meeting that rehearsed scenes of belittlement, disparagement and deprecation. It was a shamcabinet meetingwithout any proper presentations by the secretaries of their departmental work, a scene of collective submission. (I had been present in many cabinet meetings during the Clinton administration, where informative review and discussion were the regular order.) Trump’s meeting was a made-for-TV more-than-hour-long reality show with the cabinet as props, two among the 21 Fox News personalities appointed to administration posts.At his cabinet meeting, Trump began by calling on Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development, the only Black person in his cabinet, a former journeyman professional football player, briefly a far-right Texas state legislator and a motivational speaker. “Thank you God for President Trump,” prayed Turner. “So Scott Turner’s a terrific young guy,” said Trump. Turner is 53 years old. “He is heading up HUD and he’s going to make us all very proud, right?” Turner did not speak again in the meeting.Trump introduced Musk, who took control of the meeting, declaring the country would “go bankrupt” if he were not allowed to destroy the government untrammeled. He stood above the cabinet secretaries, wearing all black, a T-shirt reading “Tech Support”, a black Maga cap, and condescended: “And President Trump has put together, I think, the best cabinet ever, literally.” The questions came from the reporters in the room. The nervous cabinet members sat silently, worried about not one but two overlords. Musk was asked questions about his demand that federal employees justify their work every week and wondered how many “you’re looking to cut, total”. Musk gave no answer. Trump intervened: “We’re bloated, we’re sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job. We have a lot of people that don’t exist. You look at social security as an example. You have so many people in social security where if you believe it, they’re 200 years old.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thank you very much. Pulitzer prize.” JD Vance mocked them with a sarcastic rhetorical question: “Sir, how many peacekeepers are you going to send … ” Trump joined in: “What will you do? How will it be?” Vance continued his mocking merriment. “How will you dress them?” The cabinet members nervously tittered. Vance was the king’s goad and jester. Trump called to one reporter, “Lawrence. Look at Lawrence. This guy’s making a fortune. He never had it so good. He never had it so good. Lawrence, say we did a great job, please. OK? Say it was unbelievable.” The tone for the meeting for Zelenskyy was already on display.That day, Trump banned the traditional press pool chosen by the correspondents that cover the White House. From then on, the pool covering him would be selected by Trump’s press office. The Associated Press and Reuters would continue to be banished altogether for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, following Trump’s order. Those news organizations had failed to meet the threshold of submission.Both Emmanuel Macron andKeir Starmer, one after another, arrived in advance of Zelenskyy to butter up Trump without losing their dignity. They treated him with delicacy as a borderline personality. Yet both corrected Trump’s central falsehood that the US had given $350bn to Ukraine while the Europeans gave loans of $100bn for which they were repaid, when in fact the US expended $120bn, most of which went to US weapons manufacturers, and Europe spent $250bn and had not been repaid a euro. Macron touched Trump’s sleeve as he corrected him. Starmer gestured in that direction but never made the physical contact. Trump was undeterred in lying about it afterward.Starmer presented the coup de grace, a handwritten invitation for a state visit from King Charles III to Donald I, royalty to faux royalty. Trump carefully opened the envelope and held up the letter. “Beautiful man, wonderful man,” he said. But there was trouble brewing in paradise when the vision of another man,Vladimir Putin, crossed his mind. His attitude passed from the ecstasy of Charles’s letter to the agony of “the Russia hoax”. “We had to go through the Russian hoax together,” Trump said. “That was not a good thing. It’s not fair. That was a rigged deal and had nothing to do with Russia. It was a rigged deal with inside the country and they had to put up with that too. They put up with a lot. It wasn’t just us. They had to put up with it with a phoney story that was made up. I’ve known him for a long time now.”Trump’s blurted non sequitur after non sequitur was the beginning of his self-revelatory statements about his relationship with Putin, whose actual nature he has devoted decades to covering up. Trump said he had known Putin for “a long time”. How long he did not say. The “phoney story”, which was a true one about Russia’s extensive efforts to interfere in the US election on Trump’s behalf involving hundreds of contacts between Russian agents and the Trump campaign, was stressful not only for Trump but, according to Trump, also for Putin. They went through the “hoax”, the incomplete investigations, “together”. The Mueller report concluded with a referral of 10 obstructions of justice committed by Trump to block its inquiry, but they were never prosecuted. The Senate intelligence committee report contained alengthy sectionon Trump’s sexual escapades in Russia creating “compromising information” that could be used by the Russians and “posing a potential counterintelligence threat”. Babbling away about his sympathy for Putin, Trump did not understand that he was engaging in an oblique confession. “Russia, if you’re listening … ”After Trump was shut out of the New York banks, Donald Trump Jrremarked, in 2008, “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” Trump’s architect Alan Lapidus stated in 2018: “He could not get anybody in the United States to lend him anything. It was all coming out of Russia. His involvement with Russia was deeper than he’s acknowledged.”Trump turned to Deutsche Bank, the only financial institution willing to do business with him. The bank served as aconduitfor Russian money-laundering operations and in 2017 was fined $630m by American and British financial regulators for a $10bn scheme. In 2008, the bank sued Trump for non-payment for $40m on a $640m loan, and Trump counter-sued. Contrary to all normal practices, they settled and continued to do business. But after the January 6 insurrection even Deutsche Bankcut tieswith him. His debt to the bank was more than $300m.Trump’s plot to switch sides, punish Zelenskyy, ditch the allies and partner with Putin was hatched before Zelenskyy flew to the US grudgingly to sign a deal for raw earth mineral rights in his country. Trump’s initial exorbitant insistence on $500bn may have been a ploy to get Zelenskyy to reject the deal out of hand. No rational leader could agree to such terms. Though the details of the next contract are not publicly known, Zelenskyy’s acceptance and willingness to negotiate might have come as a surprise. Terminating military and intelligence support forUkrainerequired a different pretext. If one pretext doesn’t work, another could be contrived, even a flimsy one.After Putin invaded Ukraine, Trump called him a “genius”. He has always admired the Russian strongman as a model. He has been hostile to Zelenskyy personally since Trump’s “perfect phone call” to him in July 2019 to blackmail him into providing false dirt about Joe Biden in exchange for releasing already congressionally authorized missiles: “I would like you to do us a favor, though.” Trump’s attempt at coercion led to his first impeachment.On 18 February, Trump launched into a tirade of old Russian talking points, that Zelenskyy was a “dictator”. You never should have started it,” Trump said about the war. And, he added, “I don’t think he’s very important to be at meetings.” Zelenskyy’s response that Trump’s remarks were “disinformation” helped set the stage for the meeting on 28 February.The meeting was a wide lens on Trump’s small mind, incapable of grasping any ideas and their practical applications, like alliances, coalitions, national sovereignty or the western world. His ignorance of history is fairly complete. He sees the world like a map of Manhattan real estate that his apologists project as the revival of Great Power politics. He’ll take the West Side Highway development. Putin can get an East River stake. Trump is insistent that Ukraine owes the US money. He sees the country is a vulnerable debtor – “you don’t have the cards.” He may be influenced by his losses and liability stemming from the E Jean Carroll sexual assault and New York state financial fraud cases, where he accrued enormous penalties.Trump once again voiced his identification with Putin. “Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phoney witch-hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia … You ever hear of that deal?”JD Vance triggered the implosion with his charge that Zelenskyy was “disrespectful”. He scolded Zelenskyy for not “thanking the president”. He accused him of bringing observers to Ukraine for “a propaganda tour”. Vance’s demand for “respect” was a knowing self-abasement to awaken Trump to Zelenskyy’s absence of sycophancy. Vance’s ultimatum that Zelenskyy degrade himself revealed his own posture. But Vance is the corrective to Mike Pence, who failed at the critical moment on January 6 (“Hang Mike Pence!”). Vance ingratiated using Zelenskyy to manipulate Trump.Zelenskyy fell into the trap, trying to explain the rudiments of 20th-century history, that the geographic isolation of the US could not protect it. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” Trump snapped. “You don’t have the cards right now.” Zelenskyy replied, “I’m not playing cards right now.” Trump repeated a common Russian talking point: “You’re gambling with world war three.” Vance jumped in: “Have you said thank you once?” “A lot of times. Even today,” said Zelenskyy. In fact, he offered thanks six times in the conversation, with a “God bless you”.Trump kept talking about “the cards”. He brought up how he had given Zelenskyy missiles. He clearly wanted Zelenskyy to exonerate him for the high crime of his first impeachment. “You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards with us.” And the confrontation wound down. “This is going to be great television. I will say that,” said Trump.So the fate of Ukraine and the western alliance turned on the issue of flattery. Despite Trump’s obliviousness to history, the scene recalled Edward Gibbon’s comment in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: “The emperors, secure from contradiction, were abandoned to the intoxication of unlimited power, which their flatterers encouraged with the vilest servility.”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of EarthThis article was amended on 9 March 2025 to correct a mistitling of Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationVolodymyr ZelenskyyKeir StarmerMarco RubioVladimir PutinElon MuskcommentShareReuse this content"

I feel the same: it’s as though we’ve entered hospice careSun 9 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 06.02 EDTShareTraveling abroad for the first time since November, I saw pity in the eyes of strangers when they heard my American accent. Pity, empathy, and utter confusion, as if to convey “What the hell is happening to your country?” with a mere glance or a quiet sigh.Believe me, I’m American and I’m just as confused as you are.There was no adulation for the US on this trip, a far cry from the standard enthusiastic response to hearing I’m from California. In nearly five weeks, I didn’t hear a single “Oh, I’d love to go to America” or “I have a cousin in Boston I’d like to visit.”From taxi drivers to baristas, commuters in the tube or customers at Costa, strangers expressed their condolences, as if the US has entered hospice care – slowly losing its faculties, its freedom, its rights, and its voice. Shutting down until it surrenders to a higher power as the soul exits its body, and we’re left alone to mourn the loss – helpless, sad, shocked, and in a state of disbelief.“How do you feel about Trump?” my Uber driver asked me en route to Heathrow, sussing out my political stance before regaling me with the latest laundry list of lunacy from the US.The five stages of grief flash through my disillusioned American brain – I rounded denial a few weeks ago and now I’m toggling between anger and depression. I’ll never choose acceptance, and is there any bargaining with crazy?I do my best to avoid being labeled as an ‘ugly American’. But it seems the ugliest of all Americans has trumped even the most hideous stereotypes“Ugh, don’t remind me. I have to go back home today,” I muttered, slumping down in my seat after releasing a Herculean sigh.“America seems so angry,” he continued. “All the guns, the mass shootings, and now Trump and his henchmen. How is everyone coping?” he asked.It’s a good question. “I’ve heard everything from bingeing on chocolate, cheap wine, Cheetos, and Netflix to taking up knitting or mahjong, or adopting a cat. Anything to preserve our sanity.”“My family escaped Kosovo in the late 90s,” he said. “We lived in a one-room flat in Glasgow and my brother still lives there, but my mother died back home in the war.”My heart plunged into my stomach. “I’m so sorry,” I said. “Here I am prattling on about how ‘bad’ things are in the United States and I’m not going home to a war, famine, or mass displacement … ”His eyes searched to meet mine in the rear-view mirror as we pulled up to the departure gate.“This is true. Not yet, anyway … but the seed has been planted in your country and so, we are afraid for you.”Yes, a very orange seed.His voice was consoling.I was struck by his compassionate tone, his need to make sense of the chaos from across the pond, and his genuine concern for not just me, but for America as a whole – something I’d never experienced before in such abundance while traveling. From Inverness to London, I found solace in the voices of strangers who wanted to talk about what’s going on (most of whom were far more versed in US politics than the average American).“Do you think the UK would adopt me?” I asked.He let out a gentle chuckle, pulled out my suitcase from the boot, and reached out to shake my hand.“Take care of yourself,” he whispered. “Keep your family and friends close and be kind to your neighbors.”This kind of human connection when you’re far from home is incredibly comforting, not just for a solo menopausal traveler prone to bouts of tears and emotional outbursts, but for an American headed back to the US; and for the first time, feeling more terrified about the next four years than of flying.I’ve always been slightly embarrassed as an American abroad, cringing at the sight (and sound) of fellow citizens behaving badly, and I often contemplate saying I’m Canadian. I do my best to blend in, to respect the culture, and most of all to read the room – anything to avoid being labeled as an “ugly American” (arrogant, crude, self-absorbed, and ignorant).But it seems that in the second coming of Trump, the ugliest of all Americans has trumped even the most hideous stereotypes. Because, really, what could be uglier?Shanti L Nelson is a writer and photographerExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

He, and America, are the enemy nowSun 9 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 14.44 EDTShareI’d say writing comedy about the ever-shifting opinions of Donald Trump, the Speedy Gonzales of on-the-hoof policymaking, is like playing pin the tail on the donkey, but it’s unfair on donkeys. No donkey eversexually assaulted someone in a department store changing cubicle.It’s 4.30pm on Wednesday and I’m done. Last week I filed this column on Thursday, and then on Friday DJ Trump and JD Vancebeat up Volodymyr Zelenskyy live on TV in the Oval Officeto try to grab his minerals, as brazenly as Trump might grab a pussy, like a performatively cruel Tweedledum and Tweedledee inSopranossuits.Teenage thugs caught on a security camera roughing up a petrol station attendant and tipping the contents of the till into an Adidas bag have more dignity and honour than Trump and Vance in that now immortal moment. At least they spend the money on drugs and put cash back into the local economy. The postwar order as we understand it melted before our eyes, and the funny “jokes” I had already submitted were suddenly so 24 hours ago, as DJ and JD microwaved the Cornetto™® of hope.Since I sat down to write this at six this morning, Greenland, which seemed to have disappeared from Trump’s gadfly mind for a week or two, has wandered back into his line of fire, the adjudicated abuser having told congress nine hours ago now that he will seize the rapidly thawing mineral-rich territory “one way or another”. Who is writing Trump’s lines? 1940s Batman comics have better dialogue. And less two-dimensional sidekicks.“I have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,” the convicted fraudster declared. “We strongly support your right to determine your own future. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We will keep you safe. We will make you rich.” In Inuit folklore, the evil spirit Idlirvirissong looks like a clown with a funny nose, but if you laugh at its dance it will slice you open, put your intestines on a plate, and feed them to its dogs.Qimitiaka nexessaqtaqpaka!Ring any bells, Inuits? I don’t thinkDonald Trumpwould bother with the plate.Our ‘nuclear deterrent’ is dependent on the cooperation of a man who thinks the Chinese invented global warmingThe Inuit probably need to check out Trump’s treatment of Indigenous Americans before they spill their guts for the orange Idlirvirissong’s beads and baubles. Back on the mainland, Navajo people have reportedlybeen swept up in immigration raids, due to being kinda foreign lookin’, and Trump’s attempt tooverturn birthright citizenshipmuddies the waters of First Nation nationality. Greenland is called Kalaallit Nunaat in the native language, meaning Island of the People. I predict that within seconds of the purchase, Google maps will have renamed it, after Trump’s favourite snack, as Island of the McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish-People™®.The ghostwritten self-help manual author’s support for self-determination for the Greenland Inuit runs counter to his belief in the self-determination of the people of Ukraine, who he thinks should live as Tolkienesque mineral-mining dwarf-slaves at the behest of whichever evil warlock has the most powerful magical eye. But, as we are rapidly realising, pointing out the bathroom document archivist’s inconsistencies, or placing any value on anything he promises from one day to the next, is pointless. The Budapest Memorandum of 1994, signed by Russia and the US, forbids the use of both military force or economic coercion against Ukraine. Ah well. Money talks! Budapest walks!Face it. America is now our enemy. JD Vance is desperate to destabilise Europe, supposedly because of our fear of “freedom of speech”, but perhaps because steps towards internet safety might prevent profiteering American techlords pumping falsehoods and filth into our waters, and saying it’sillegal to pray in Scotland. And Trump’s vision of the future sees a global turkey carved up between Russia, China and the US, while the rest of us fight over the giblets. Our Trident missiles require American tech to service them. Our “deterrent” is dependent on the ongoing cooperation of a man who thinks the Chinese invented global warming and that Keir Starmer rules Ireland. But that isn’t the worst part of it.Sometime in the spring of 2020, as the breathless euphoria of lockdown’s early days slowly mutated into existential despair, I lay on my back long into the night, in the garden we were lucky enough to be able to go into, and stared at the stars in the now much clearer sky. Suddenly I saw a long caravan of lights moving at regular speed in a twinkling but sinister convoy across the static stars.Was it a coordinated Russian air force attack? Or the second wave of an extraterrestrial invasion, our planet already weakened by their alien virus? No, the internet told me, it was a chain of 60 “Starlink” communication satellites of 7,000 that ostentatiously orbit the Earth, all owned by someone calledElon Musk. Until that moment I had been blissfully unaware of the ketamine-gobbling cap goblin’s existence.Two weeks ago, when Ukraine continued to resist Trump’s attempts to commandeer its minerals, Musk reportedlythreatened to shut off the country’s access to Starlink, which would have crippled its military defences. We are beholden to American tech companies in every aspect of our lives, via Google, Amazon, PayPal, Facebook, and multiple social media platforms. Musk has shown their Trump loyalist owners will use them as weapons of war against those who disagree with him. It’s sick to sacrifice the soft diplomacy of foreign aid to spend on flash tanks while continuing to expose our tech flanks.Starmer thinks he can keep both an antagonistic Trump and our natural EU allies in play, and perhaps he can. To be fair, at the Edinburgh fringe in the 1980s, I saw a man swing a massive claw hammer from a hole in his penis while swallowing a fluorescent light tube at the same time.Stewart Lee toursStewart Leevsthe Man-Wulfthis year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionElon MuskKeir StarmerStewart LeecommentShareReuse this content"

Let Boris Johnson guide you on this ‘very compassionate man’Catherine BennettSome of the president’s Tory fans seem to find the grim reality of the president’s actions invigorating rather than terrifyingSun 9 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShareShort of emigration, what is the best option for Britain’s dazzled Trump followers now their hero confirms he is not Europe’s ally but Vladimir Putin’s? That’s assuming what we can’t in the case ofNigel FarageMP: that they do not share the US president’swell-documentedweakness for a genocidal invader. Even his more respectable British acolytes have until recently finessed, quite successfully, their love of Trump with his long history of Putin-pleasing. No one more so than Boris Johnson, former prime minister, self-styled saviour of Ukraine and still Trump’s most dependable British idiot.To Johnson’s way of thinking, detailed in numerousDaily Mailcolumns, it is Trump-doubters who are always the ridiculous, panicking, hysterical, whingeing headless chickens. When Trump looked likely to win the US election,Johnson likened the reactionof the “western liberal intelligentsia” to “the shriek of elderly beldames leaping on the piano stool after spying a mouse in their petticoats”. The virile Johnson was more than willing to forget that business at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.With all the usual caveats, it is striking, sometimes uncanny, how often tributes to Trump by his UK supporters have echoed rhetoric in praise of an earlier political disruptor with territorial ambitions.Here is Lord Rothermere, theDaily Mailproprietor, for instance,writing in 1930that his support for Germany’s Nazi party “had shocked the old women of three countries – France, Germany, and our own”. Like the beldame-connoisseur Johnson, who urges us to disregard Trump’s thuggery – “I have always found him, personally, a model of old-fashioned courtesy and good manners” – Rothermere would assure readers disconcerted by the public shrieking that the private Hitler was “a perfect gentleman”, who “brings to Europe the blessed prospect of peace”.Anything that may to the uninitiated seem disgraceful about Trump could be proof of political sophisticationA century later, anotherDaily Mailwriter, Nadine Dorries, was one of several prominent Conservativesclaiming something similar for Trump. “I honestly believe that Trump can bring about world peace and prosperity.” By way of references, Dorries cited, like many of the president’s supporters, the strategic mastery outlined in his (ghostwritten)Art of the Deal. Have any of them actually read the chapter that details how Trump, having attempted various low ruses to dislodge residents from a newly acquired building he wished to demolish, ended up being accused of harassment? It could be of interest, anyway, to Gaza residents should Trump persist with dreams of a Palestinian-free luxury resort.Admittedly, a little alleged harassment is unlikely to weigh with women like Dorries, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss (not forgetting proud feminist Johnson) who are happy to make light of – along with the invasion of the White House,environmental savageryand assortedcriminal cases– Trump’shistory of misogyny. For them, saviour qualities that polls suggest go unrecognised by most of the British population have earned him immunity from sustained sexist behaviour, from “Grab ’em by the pussy” tocongratulating the prime minister, Keir Starmer,on his “beautiful” wife last month.In the US for Trump’s inauguration, an ecstatic Braverman said that he provides “a glimmer of hope of what is possible in the west”. Fellow guest Truss, cementing the Norfolk-Mar-a-Lago axis, hailed the incoming president for “saving western civilisation”. Starting, as we now know, withAndrew Tate.Inconveniently for Truss and other lead Trumpists includingRobert Jenrick, Jacob Rees-Mogg,Piers Morgan,Priti Patel,Andrea Jenkynsand a number ofMailandTelegraphcontributors, today’s online archive makes it trickier than in 1939 for the prominent and susceptible to pretend they were never infatuated with an amoral racist andconspiracy theorist.Added to this evidence, the speed of Trump’s transition into full Russia allyship could help extravagant claims about his political genius being more rapidly understood as deranged than those, circulating last year, that rested on total public memory loss about Trump’s political past.For the former Tory MP Rees-Mogg, for instance, Trump’s victory was “a success for democracy” and also, notwithstanding his thing for Putin, for “free speech”. The pivot towards Russia has not diminished his loyalty. “Reinvigorating democracy is also positive,” Mogg noted, finding something “creative” in Trump’s denial of military assistance to Ukraine, “the world may ultimately be a safer place”.Braverman, theproud wearer of a Maga capand perhaps the closest Trump has to a Unity Mitford (who favoured a golden swastika), considers his latest actions above all “a wake-up call for European nations”.In news sources where recent expressions of admiration for Trump must adapt togrowing public suspicion, there is no avoiding a more convoluted response. In theTelegraph, where heacclaimed Trump’s November victorywith “Trump is the last chance to save the decaying west from terminal decline”, Allister Heath now reminds readers, “the reality is nuanced”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Step by step, they should advance from simple Trump idolator to the role of senior Trump interpreter. Supposing Trump comes up with something like (to Zelenskyy) “you should never have started it”, requires a Johnson, fluent in Trumpspeak,to translate: “Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action.” What might sound wicked, according tohis latest tutorial, is spoken by a “very compassionate man”.Recent polling, inauspiciousfor Farage, suggests that Johnson’s linguistic efforts are finally paying off. When a UK legislator sings the praises of Trump, what they are actually saying is: “I am unworthy of political office.” Got it.Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s all gone nowWill HuttonDonald Trump’s actions go against the Enlightenment values that gave rise to the constitution. His might-is-right politics have nothing to offer BritainSun 9 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 07.20 EDTShareThe founding fathers of the USA – James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin and more – were quintessential disciples of the European Enlightenment. Their intent was to embed Enlightenment values into the government and culture of the New World. America would be a republic of laws. Its constitution would ensure governance of the people, by the people, for the people. Through checked and balanced branches of government, it would expunge the possibility of monarchical discretionary power and inaugurate proper democracy.It would celebrate all liberties, from freedom of speech to freedom of worship. Their belief in science “for the benefit of mankind in general”, in Franklin’s words, would imbue the republic’s commitment to reason, the scientific method and the pursuit of truth. The dynamic economy and society that emerged, however imperfect, reflected those values. It has inspired billions and, for all its falls from grace, has been a force for good.Donald Trump’s presidency is widely deplored for everything from his unilateral imposition ofswingeing tariffsto hispublic humiliation of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and siding with Russia over the war. He is guilty of all those things, and of an impulsiveness and unpredictability as he seeks retribution, respect and, as he would put it, reciprocity. But this misses the larger point: he draws not only on a constituency that shares his views but also on a well-developed body of thought that wants a decisive rupture with those Enlightenment values and all that spring from them.There is now genuine fear in US civil society – in business, finance, academia, the media and the Republican party – that to speak out will bring cruel retribution or even personal harm: this from the apostles of “free speech”. The US has gone mute. Its Enlightenment-based constitution and the accompanying values once held to be universal are being torched in near silence. Only fealty to Making America Great Again, by repudiating its notable traditions, is permitted – at home and abroad. The profundity of this is beginning to be recognised. Canada finds itself fighting for its life. Friedrich Merz, the incoming German chancellor, says for Europe it is “five to midnight”. He is driving through an extraordinary €1tn commitment to raise German defence and infrastructure spending over the next 10 years. The EU is bracing itself for attacks on its trade and its capacity to set standards and regulations for all goods EU citizens buy – so-called non tariff barriers – that Trump plans to launch “soon”. The EU’s high product standards, he argues, discriminate against lesser-regulated US exports. Even VAT is anti-American. The EU’s very being as a self-governing, multinational organisation is under threat.Multilateral organisations like the EU and the UN, expressing the same Enlightenment values as the US constitution, are in Trump’s crosshairs. The unashamed project is to reshape the world economic and political order so it serves only the interests of the US – as if it did not already. Can Britain really be a bridge between this vision and Europe, asKeir Starmerwants? These differences are unbridgeable.The unashamed project is to reshape the world economic and political order so it serves only the interests of the USTrump’s court at Mar-a-Lago, high on power and much else, has reportedly worked on a draft contract for countries to sign that reverses the alleged rip-off of the US. Instead, they will have to agree to boost US industry by accepting one-sided trade deals and appreciating their currencies. In return, they will be offered degrees of US security. Countries are said to be colour coded green, yellow and red, depending on the degree to which they might wholly accept vassalage, bargain for a compromise or are deemed to be enemies – with China the number-one target, and also including Canada, Mexico and the EU. Nato and the World Trade Organization be damned.Stephen Miran, the new chair of the US Council of Economic Advisers, won his job as the author of an extraordinary paper –A User’s Guide to Restructuring the World Trading System. Trump can reshape the global economic and trade order, he argues, through creating targeted tariff policies aimed at countries to which the US objects. The tariff regime must be designed to maximise fear and uncertainty; last week’s imposition, thenwithdrawal, of car tariffson Mexico and Canada was a prime example. The bulk of any economic costs will be displaced on to the countries at the receiving end by forcing them to raise their currencies against the dollar. He writes approvingly ofScott Bessent, now Trump’s treasury secretary, last year publicly arguing for putting countries into varying Mar-a-Lago style buckets corresponding to their readiness to comply with Washington’s will.Self-pity at the US’s alleged victimhood pervades Trumpite thinking. Even on Miran’s own numbers, the US still accounts for the same 25% of world GDP now as it did in 1980 – a phenomenal achievement. America is as great as it ever was. Only 19% of its GDP is imports, but these are blamed entirely for the fall in manufacturing employment as if robotisation, automation and the emergence of a service-based economy were irrelevant. Many working-class Americans have certainly suffered from these changes – but that needed an enlightened domestic policy response. China has re-industrialised by electrifying and decarbonising its economy. This is dismissed as woke.Adam Smith, the great Enlightenment economist, inspired the founding fathers as much as Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Paine. He praised the invisible hand of the market and open trade as pathways to the common good of greater prosperity – but none of that is for the Trumpites. They come from the mobster, cowboy, might-is-right, make-a-deal-on-my-terms strain of US culture and society. The humbling of Zelenskyy is the tip of this anti-Enlightenment iceberg. They are the masters now, and will gladly bend the US electoral system to stay that way. As some judges stir themselves, and political dissenters start to be braver, it’s an open question if they will succeed – but going back, if at all, is likely to be only partial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His level-headedness, decency and pragmatism have been assets. But he faces an unavoidable choice: Britain cannot achieve economic growth by remaining a vassal state to the US while abjuring closer trade relations with Europe. Trump does not want Britain to grow US-competitor great tech companies, which are essential to economic growth. Nor does he want to defendUkraineand Europe. It is brutally stark. The UK must make common cause with Europe to defend not only our economic and defence interests but, more importantly, our values.

The answer is that if it is understood how Trump perceives himself, the US and others in the world, then there is a consistency about his utterances and policies.He sees himself as global deal-maker and, in effect, a replacement for the United Nations. The statements he has made, and continues to make, about Gaza, Greenland, Panama and Canada should be taken literally. In Trump’s reckoning of the order of the world there are not so much as sovereign states, nations with economies and citizens, but properties with tenants that can be purchased – or, in the case of Gaza, tenants who can be “asked” to leave. In the case of Ukraine, he deals with the significant other potential property dealer, Russia, and that explains his treatment ofVolodymyr Zelenskyy.Dr George HudsonWorcesterAs an American, I feel that it may be too late for us. Either out of ignorance or anger, half of us voted this man into power. All Americans now have to live with the terrifying consequences of living under the thumb of a capricious, revengeful individual and those who bow down to him or use him for their own purposes.But Europeans do not have to appease Trump. Appeasement did not work with Hitler. It will not work now. Europe once was able to rely on the United States. Today, the world, including Americans, will have to rely on Europe to keep alive the ideals of the declaration of independence, the constitution, the Gettysburg address and Martin Luther King’s speech. I hope the British government will rescind the invitation of the king.Miriam BartesMiami, FloridaAndrew Rawnsley rightly deplores the slashing of the international aid budget (“In this dangerous age, Britain needs to exert soft power as well as the hard stuff”, Comment).But please don’t pit the needs of people in poverty overseas against those of people in poverty in this country by suggesting that we could be less generous towards social security spending.Social security has suffered massive cuts over the past decade and this has been a prime factor in the increase in and deepening of poverty. Rawnsley rightly concludes that we are an affluent country that can afford to wield both hard and soft power. We can also afford to provide a decent social security system. If the French government can be considering taxing the wealthy more in the face of current security demands, why can’t we?BaronessLister of BurtersettHouse of LordsAssisted dying safeguardsWe write in support of Kim Leadbeater’s proposal for a judge-led assisted dying commission to appoint a panel of multidisciplinary specialists to examine and approve each individual request for assistance to die.We believe this makes the bill the safest and strongest of its kind in the world, and a marked improvement on the status quo in this country, which fails to offer meaningful upfront protections.When MPs voted to support the principle of assisted dying last year, questions were raised around the role of the High Court in assessing cases and the practicability of the proposal. Having considered those arguments,Leadbeater has alighted on the most critical question: how to apply the right sets of eyes to cases to ensure objective external scrutiny and guard against any misuse. The proposal of multidisciplinary panels, each chaired by a judge or KC, assisted by the expertise of psychiatrists and social workers, is sensible and practical. Indeed, similar panels have been proven to work well already in Spain. The focus on retired judges, frequently deployed on to public inquiries or as highly skilled mediators, should settle any concerns about potential impact on the courts system.It is welcome that with parliament having conclusively backed the principle of assisted dying, Leadbeater and others are strengthening the legislation further. The proposal of an assisted dying commission represents an important step on that journey, bringing end-of-life decisions out of the shadows and greatly increasing the support and protection available for terminally ill people who want this choice.With this bill, MPs have an opportunity to bring about a sea-change in protections for dying people, and replace the meagre provisions of our current law with a stronger, safer settlement.

Its algorithms have pushed artists to make joyless, toothless musicJohn HarrisMost musicians can only make money on the platform by writing songs inoffensive enough to get on to one of its vapid playlistsSun 9 Mar 2025 12.38 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 16.12 EDTShareIn the hands of some of its most gifted practitioners, songwriting is a kind of emotional alchemy. For the past week, I have been returning to a perfect example:Every Time the Sun Comes Upby the US singer Sharon Van Etten, which was released in 2014. Its lyrics might be fractured and fragmented, but it is an almost perfect portrait of self-doubt and downward spirals: one of those songs that captures feelings so deep that they go way beyond words.I went back to that song as I read asuperb new bookthat has both educated and profoundly depressed me. Mood Machine, by the New York-based journalist Liz Pelly, is about the music-streaming giant Spotify, and how it attracted its current615 million subscribers, making a billionaire of its Swedish co-founder and CEO, Daniel Ek. But its most compelling story centres on what Spotify has done to people’s appreciation of songs and the people who make them – much of which is down to the platform’s ubiquitous playlists.Thanks to Spotify’s algorithms, I recently found Every Time the Sun Comes Up in a personalised (or “algotorial”) playlist titled Farmers Market, versions of which have been saved by nearly 250,000 listeners. On mine, the song sits alongside such classics as the Rolling Stones’ Beast of Burden, Mazzy Star’s equally aching Fade Into You and Dreams by Fleetwood Mac, whose pathos and depth seems to have been neutralised by their new setting, summed up in the accompanying blurb: “fresh produce, reusable totes, iced coffee and all the lovely spring things”.Such is what Pelly calls “the relegation of music to something passable, just filling the air”. Playlists tend to mean that songs once full of power and emotion get recontextualised, and washed of their meaning. And at the same time, Spotify constantly boosts music that never had any of those qualities to start with: a type oflatter-day muzakthat reaches its apogee in a genre now known as “Spotifycore”. Pelly traces the birth of this “muted, mid-tempo and melancholy” sound to around 2018: the US singer Billie Eilish seems to have unwittingly kicked things off, and the result has become inescapable, thanks to the kind of Spotify playlists whose titles include the word “chill”. You know it when you hear it: it initially makes you feel as if you are in a big-budget Netflix series, before you find out that there is no discernible plot.Spotify in effect encourages musicians to produce this aural wallpaper, by showing them the data that proves this is how to make money from the platform. Such music answers some very 21st-century needs: as Pelly reminds us, it offers solace to people who are “anxious and overworked, engaged in cycles of trying to focus hard and chill hard”. It also helps them sleep, which is one of the functions Spotify capably delivers. And whether the platform’s users are awake or slumbering, Spotifycore also has a quality that makes it perfect for endless streaming: one song blurs into another, meaning that the app can be left to tick over, requiring minimum effort on the part of the user. This is the core of Ek’s business model: the idea, after all, is to keep you listening – or half-listening – for hours at a time.What does all this mean for the music itself? Those of us who are addicted to Spotify – and just to be clear, my habit extends to several hours a day, though I mostly leave its playlists untouched – know how seductive an invention it is: an almost infinite jukebox, accessible via devices that are the same size as a Twix. But using it also comes with increasingly sharp pangs of ethical discomfort, and a sense that its version of streaming has long since started transforming music in no end of unsettling ways.Though Spotify has no direct involvement in its creation, a lot of the vapid music clustered on its playlists is now made by production-line suppliers of what the company calls “perfect fit content”, or PFC – which could just as easily be made using AI. The fact that no money is paid out if a song is listened to for less than 30 seconds has come close to killing the idea of a slow-burning intro (if they were modern creations, there would be no hope for such songs as David Bowie’s Sound and Vision, or the Temptations’ Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone). The limited public outcry about the tiny rewards Spotify offers most musicians and songwriters may be connected to the fact that the average “chill” playlist is intended only as background music: as Pelly says, “it follows that a population paying so little conscious attention to music would also believe it deserving of so little remuneration”.Technology always bends and re-shapes artistic creativity: the fact that the archetypal album began life at about 40 minutes and then stretched to 70 or 80 was a story scripted by the invention of the 12in record, and its eventual superseding by compact discs. But what sets Spotify apart is something much more insidious: it goes beyond alterations of music’s forms into what we think music is there to do, and one of big tech’s most sinister powers: the way that it sidelines dissent in such a subtle way that we only realise what has happened when it is far too late.At the risk of making myself sound ancient, I had always understood the demise of music made with guitars – the best of which came with at least a hint of countercultural rebellion – as something down to that instrument’s old age. Now, I wonder whether it might also have happened because it doesn’t fit the low-volume, inoffensive aesthetics demanded by playlists with titles such as Stress Relief, Soft Office and Beach Vibes.I definitely think the large-scale decline of songs that deal in social and political commentary is partly to do with Spotify’s relentless muzak-ification: in the UK, the one high-profile artist who does that kind of stuff is the brilliant, Bruce Springsteen-esqueSam Fender, and his artistic loneliness speaks volumes. With Trump in the White House and the world in chaos, the absence of a pop-cultural response is striking: might it be connected to the tyranny of what Pelly calls “sad piano ballads with weird drums”, and Spotify’s reduction of artists to near-anonymity: people hanging on for dear life, with no voice? And beyond anything political, does that not pose a threat to music with any real substance at all?Van Etten, I am pleased to say, isplaying three concertsin the UK this coming week with her band the Attachment Theory, and returning in the summer for another run of shows. I will be there for at least one of them, soaking up her deep, powerful music in the context it was created for. My phone will be switched off, and “chill” will not be on the menu. And like just about everyone there, I will not be giving any thought to farmers’ markets, iced coffee or “reusable totes”.John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

It was during the Bahá’í Fast, in the quiet hours before sunrise, when I woke in darkness to eat. During those still moments, I felt something unexpected: clarity. The hunger I had feared was not an enemy but a teacher. It stripped away the excess, revealing a heightened awareness, a quiet strength. Fasting was not about deprivation, but about making space – literally and symbolically.Religious fasting has always carried a critique of the status quo. It challenges the idea that fulfilment is found in the material world. It asks us to consider the nature of our attachments and reassess what we truly need. It’s no accident that many of history’s great thinkers – Mahatma Gandhi, Simone Weil, and Nelson Mandela – used fasting not just as a spiritual discipline but as a means for stripping away illusion and encountering a deeper truth.In 2025, for the first time in decades, three major religious traditions – Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá’í Faith – will observe their sacred fasting periods at the same time. Lent,Ramadan, and the Bahá’í Fast will coincide, aligning billions of people in a collective act of self-discipline, spiritual reflection, and renewal. This rare intersection is more than a mere calendar anomaly. It’s an opportunity to reconsider the role of faith in our modern world, a moment to ask whether religion – so often dismissed as outdated – still holds something essential for our human experience.When I bought this handcrafted artwork in Iran, I didn’t expected it to teach me such a valuable lesson | Ali HammoudRead moreDespite the predictions of its demise, religion remains a powerful driver of human behaviour, shaping societies in ways that cannot be ignored. While some see religion as an agent of division, it is worth considering how it continues to provide meaning, ethical direction, and asense of belonging in an era of uncertainty.The overlapping fasts of 2025 invite us to move beyond the narrow debates that often dominate discussions about religion. Instead of asking whether faith is relevant, we might ask: What is it about religious practice that endures? Why do billions of people still find in it a source of strength and purpose? The answers may not be simple, but are worth exploring. The reality is that religion, at its best, calls people to something higher – towards self-discipline, care for others and the pursuit of justice.We live in a time of information overload, constant distraction and an ever-accelerating demand for more – more entertainment, consumptionand productivity. It makes sense then that there is something deeply human about setting aside excess,and choosing to slow down.Even though we are more connected than ever before, many feel increasingly isolated. We have more choices, more abundanceand more convenience, yetanxietyanddissatisfactioncontinue to rise. Perhaps this is why fasting still speaks to something essential. In the act of letting go – of food, habits and distractions – there is a possibility of rediscovering something we have lost.Fasting is not just a personal or spiritual exercise–it is also a profoundly social one. Across traditions, fasting is tied to a deepened awareness of justice, a call to compassion and a recognition of human interconnectedness. During Ramadan, charitable giving increases as Muslims are encouraged to act in solidarity with the poor. In Christianity, Lent is traditionally associated with almsgiving and acts of service, while the Bahá’í Faith teaches that fasting should be accompanied by reflection on justice and service to humanity.I have seen first-hand how fasting changes our relationship with the world around us. When I was pregnant with my first child, I discussed with a group of friends, who were also either pregnant or breastfeeding, how we were going to observe the fast without giving up food. We turned our focus to our relationship with technology. For 19 days, instead of scrolling on our phones, we committed to grabbing a prayer book instead. We all reflected that those weeks felt different – deeper, less hurried. There was a slowness to it that felt unfamiliar yet profoundly necessary. The experience taught me that fasting is not just about what we give up, but about what we gain in return.In an era of widening inequality, wheremillions suffer from malnutritionwhile otherswaste food on an industrial scale, fasting is an urgent reminder of the ethical dimensions of consumption. It reminds us that meaning is not found in unchecked indulgence but in conscious living – to step outside ourselves and to reflect on the needs of others.The year will no doubt continue to face its share of challenges: political upheaval, environmental crises and social unrest. But in the quiet discipline of setting aside comfort for something greater, there is a reminder that we are not merely passive participants in history. We have the ability to shape our inner lives, to choose a different way of being.At a time when the forces of division appear stronger than ever, this convergence offers a counterpoint. The rituals of fasting, undertaken in different ways across these traditions, serve as a reminder that restraint, reflection and a deliberate turning inward are not relics of the past. They are, perhaps, more necessary now than ever. The act of abstaining from food and drink, willingly setting aside material comfort, is an ancient practice that remains profoundly relevant. It stands as a quiet resistance to the world’s relentless pace, to the culture of overconsumption and distraction that defines so much of modern life.In this shared season of restraint and renewal, there is an opportunity to pause – to reconsider, realign and remember what truly sustains us.Dr Kat Eghdamian is a human rights expert, writer, and adviser on religion, ethics and social justice.

A tyrannical virus ruled over us, and we did everything in our power to limit its ravages.Five years on from thedeclarationof the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s the masked passenger who is suspect, nobody notices the scuffed distancing lines and trust in vaccines has taken atumble. A different narrative has invaded the conversation: it wasn’t the virus that ruined our lives, but the response.This narrative was always there, but for a long time it stayed on the fringes. Now it’s becoming mainstream, turbo-charged by the recent successes of its political champions who typically gravitate towards the populist right. Public health experts have watched its advance with a gathering sense of doom. They know that how we respond to the next pandemic depends on how we understand the last, and that the next one is probably closer than most people think. Mind-bogglingly, many of them worry that Covid-19 has left us more, rather than less, vulnerable to it.The response was far from perfect, these experts say, but the purveyors of the new narrative have picked the wrong target: science. The mRNA vaccines prevented millions of deaths. The technology forbuildingnew, effective vaccines quickly came on in leaps and bounds. Masksworked. And as with every pandemic in recent history, subsequent reviews havefoundthat the advice to go early and hard with containment was correct. Did the scientists make mistakes? Of course, but they were working in conditions of high uncertainty. But they were also often ignored or countered by the politicians they advised, as well as by others in positions of influence – and yet those people aren’t the villains of this piece.Anyone who doubts the power of narrative need only look at that modern Icarus, Anthony Fauci. Five years ago, the seasoned epidemic warrior and prominent figure in the US Covid-19 response (he was chief medical adviser to the president, 2021-22) wasanointedthe country’s “most trusted coronavirus expert”, and its “scientific voice of reason”. Then the white-hot heat of public opinion melted his wings. Having accepted a pre-emptive pardon from Joe Biden, he was forced topoint outthat he had committed no crime. And though he has been subjected to frequent death threats, Donald Trump haswithdrawnhis federal security detail.Fauci’s British counterparts, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, have also received death threats. But in allowing these scientists to be treated so shabbily, we undermine ourselves in the long run. Who would take on that thankless task now, if a new pandemic struck? Fauci et al are just the visible face of the backlash. Behind the scenes, infectious disease researchersreporttheir funds are drying up, leaving them less able to predict and prevent the next pandemic. The Trump administration has sown disarray at its medical research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and ordered US withdrawal from the only global public health agency, the World Health Organization. Negotiations over a pandemic treaty, which would improve disease surveillance and vaccine access globally, have stalled.Speaking about the NIH in late 2023, Trump’s future health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr,reportedly said: “We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” Unfortunately it isn’t givingusa break, because our various crises are linked. The rate of emergence of zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – isaccelerating, due to factors including deforestation and the human-altered climate. Where viruses are concerned, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Richard Hatchett,wroterecently, “the world is on fire”.A teenage survivor of the 1918 flu could expect to never encounter a pandemic again in their lives. The same is unlikely to be true of today’s teenagers. The most imminent threat is probably posed by “bird flu”, the strains of H5N1 influenza A that are at present circulating in cows and poultry. They haven’t become transmissible between humans yet and they may never do so, but they have spread from animals to humans dozens of times on several continents, causing illness and at leastone death. If one of them were to trigger a pandemic, that pandemic would be at least as deadly as Covid-19, which isestimatedto have caused upwards of 27 million excess deaths to date.It’s difficult to know which microbe will cause the next pandemic, because for all scientists’ sophisticated modelling, they can’t predict the change in context that will nudge one from a relatively benign trajectory on to a more dangerous one. Besides studying the causes of the zoonotic threat, our best hope for protecting tomorrow’s teenagers is to make our societies more resilient. We saw this clearly at the height of the emergency, but we’veforgotten it. Remember the shortlived calls to reduce gaping inequalities, shore up our health systems and work forces, and “build back better”?Interviewing people from 70 countries in aglobal listening projectlaunched in 2021, a team led by anthropologist Heidi Larson found that many felt uncared for – their daily challenges lost in talk of case rates and “unflattened curves”. The sick-pay issue was emblematic: plenty couldn’t afford to stay at home when ill. Their desire to help others was stymied, too, by – among other things – the disastrous insistence on social distancing. This became a shorthand for physical distancing, which was essential, but it undermined efforts towards social cohesion, which is also vital in a pandemic.“In a real crisis, the state can’t look after you,” psychologist Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews told me. “It can’t put food on your table, or walk your dog. We do it for each other.” Up to 14 million Britonsparticipatedin mutual aid groups at Covid-19’s peak, and Larson’s feedback suggests that the number would have been higher had the government supported those efforts.Five years after the start of the worst health crisis in living memory, there is a national conversation waiting to be had about the roles of the individual, society and the state in such a crisis. What is my responsibility to myself and to my community, and what is the responsibility of the state towards us? At each level there is room for improvement, but we’re not addressing it. Let’s hope we can have that conversation before we’re tested again, but first the more strident – and misguided – voices have to pipe down.Laura Spinney is a science journalist and the author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the WorldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The truth is, it provides a rare glimpse of hopeSun 9 Mar 2025 04.30 EDTShareIn 2009, Tony Blair visited Masafer Yatta, a collection of hamlets in the PalestinianWest Bank. He had come to see a school that had gained attention for having been rebuilt in defiance of Israeli attempts to tear down the village. After he returned home, Israel cancelled the demolition order for the school. “This,” Basel Adra says, “is a story about power.”Adra is one of the directors ofNo Other Land, a documentary about the experience of living through, and attempting to defy, Israel’s attempts to erase Masafer Yatta to create an IDF “firing zone”. Last week,it won an Oscar. In the 1980s, Israeli authorities designated part of the area as “Firing Zone 918”, a closed military area. In 1999, the government issued eviction orders against Palestinians in the area for “illegally living in a firing zone”. Two decades of court battles ended in 2022 when Israel’s supreme court ruled the villagerscould be expelled.The documentary is a collaboration between Adra and three other co-directors: Israeli journalist and activist Yuval Abraham, whose growing, tense friendship with Adra forms a key thread in the film; Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian farmer and photographer; and Rachel Szor, an Israeli cinematographer.Shot mainly between 2019 and 2023, it is a film about power. The power of Israel to assail Palestinian lives; the lack of power of Palestinians trying to resist. Even Blair’s tepid intervention was temporary. In 2022, the IDF forced children and teachers out of the school, moments before bulldozers flattened it.Though this part of the story is not told in the film, documents unearthed in the state archives reveal that the IDF “firing zone” was deliberately created as a pretext for ethnically cleansing the area to create a“buffer zone” between Jews and Palestinians. To force the villagers to accept defeat, soldiers confiscate vehicles, pour concrete into wells, cut water pipes, support armed settlers attacking residents. When one young Palestinian, Harun Abu Aram, protests about soldiers seizing a generator, he is shot at point-blank range. Paralysed from the neck down, denied proper treatment and, like many residents whose homes have been bulldozed, forced to live in a cave, Abu Aram died shortly before the filming was completed. The soldier who shot him knew he was being filmed. With power comes impunity.The Oscar win has provoked a furious, and often poisonous, debate. Supporters of Israel have damned the documentary as “antisemitic”. Israel’s culture minister Miki Zohar condemned its“defamation of Israel”. Others have dismissed it as “a carefully crafted piece of demagoguery” and congratulated “Hamas for its Oscar win”.To describeNo Other Landas “antisemitic” is to degrade the very meaning of the term, turning it, in the words of Kenneth Stern, one of the drafters of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism,in response to an earlier debate,into “a blunt instrument tolabel anyone an antisemite”, wielded by those who “seek out binary good/bad, black and white thinking”. It’s a means of silencing pro-Palestinian voices and of dismissing attempts to expose Israeli treatment of Palestinian people.The debasement of the debate over No Other Land comes partly from confusing a desire for simple narratives of ‘good and evil’WhenNo Other Landtriumphed at theBerlin film festival last year, there was much condemnation ofits supposed antisemitism. The German culture minister, Claudia Roth, was criticisedfor applauding its success; in response, her office claimed she had applauded only “the Jewish-Israeli journalist and film-maker Yuval Abraham”, not Adra. So normalised has anti-Palestinian racism become in certain circles that the sheer bigotry of this argument seemed to pass Roth by.On the other side of the debate, some pro-Palestinian voices have dismissedNo Other Landas Israeli propaganda and Abraham as a “liberal Zionist” who “hops on the back of Palestinian pain and rides that wave ashe makes a name for himself, and money”, engaging “in egregious publicity stunts to… soothe theirown rotten conscience”. The BDS movement – which campaigns for the boycott of Israeli goods and culture –has called for the film to be shunned, seemingly because Abraham is not pure enough in his condemnation of Israel. Such claims are not just profoundly unserious but undermine possibilities of building solidarity across the Israel/Palestine divide. Certainly, there are inevitably deep tensions when Palestinians and Israelis seek to collaborate, tensions created by the gross inequalities and imbalance of power that shape relations across the divide. Abraham possesses rights and freedoms denied to Adra, who is continually surveilled, harassed and restricted in his movements.Abraham spoke of these tensions and inequalities in his speeches at the Oscars and in Berlin. They are explored inNo Other Land, too. In one scene, Abraham bemoans the lack of views for one of his articles about the demolitions. “You want everything to happen quickly,” Adra responds, “as if you came to solve everything in 10 days and then go back home. This has been going on for decades. Get used to failing.”Yet, for all the tension, Palestinians at the sharp end of Israeli rule have no doubts about the importance of figures such as Abraham. The writer Samah Salaime visited Masafer Yatta to gauge reactions to the call for a boycott. To a person, all were supportive, indeed proud, of Abraham. “Yuval,” one local activist told her, “is far more Palestinian than most of these online commentators attacking him… He is Jewish and Israeli, but he understands exactly what’s happening here just as I do,and he chose to stand with us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For many supporters of Palestinian rights, the butchery of Hamas has come to be viewed as “resistance”, a claim that only demeans the Palestinian struggle for freedom.In a shared land that can survive only if the rights and dignities of both Jews and Palestinians are recognised, the significance ofNo Other Landis not just that it exposes the realities of Palestinian lives but also that it provides a small glimpse of how solidarity can be forged.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Mike Tapp was dripping with compliments for his boss as he argued that the Commons should be “united” in order to “achieve a lasting peace” in Ukraine. It’s not unusual for ambitious MPs to offer these kinds of seemingly pointless questions at PMQs: for them, they have a very important function of highlighting their loyalty to the boss they hope will promote them, and also giving that boss a bit of a breather in between more hostile interventions from across the chamber. But there was also something slightly plaintive in the request for the House to remain united, because it can’t, and won’t.Starmer has rightly been praised from across the political spectrum for the calm way he handled themeltdown in the Oval Office. His careful management of the relationship between the US and UK, and the way he convened European leaders at short notice to plan a “coalition of the willing” to protect Ukraine was indeed statesmanlike behaviour. But in the next few weeks, he is going to be brought back down to earth – and to domestic matters – with a bump. Not only will the opposition parties start asking difficult questions again, but his own side is not exactly united. Perhaps Tapp was trying to persuade his own colleagues to stick by the prime minister as much as he was pre-emptively scolding the opposition for anything other than non-stop agreement.Managing a party when in government is always like dealing with a dripping tap in a bathtub: at some point, the disappointments will mount to the extent that there is a flood. That flood might come some time after a prime minister and his cabinet have really annoyed their backbenchers. When the government cuts benefits early on in its tenure, those backbenchers might still feel bound, as Tapp suggested, to be outriders for the government rather than speak their minds in public. But that doesn’t mean they’re not angry, frustrated at having to explain to their constituents why the Labour party has removed their entitlement to disability benefits, for instance. The bathtub fills up a lot, which means that the flood will come sooner.Cutting disability benefits is not just a “for instance” hypothetical, though: it is something that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is very likely to announce in the next few weeks. The Department for Work and Pensions is about to publish itsgreen paper on welfare reformahead of the budget, with Reeves hoping to cut several billion pounds off the ballooning benefits bill. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility has forecastthat the share of the working age population in receipt of incapacity benefit will rise from 7% in 2023-24 to an all-time high of 7.9% by 2028-29.Reeves has spoken about “support to get back to work”, with the likelihood being that claimants will find their entitlement to out of work benefits squeezed and there being a greater onus on them to find a job. But she hasn’t ruled out tightening the personal independence payment (PIP), which is not linked to whether someone is in or out of work. Neither cut will sit well for a Labour party that has always struggled to feel comfortable with any kind of welfare cut, even if the public is entirely supportive.MPs have started to voice their concerns to one another in the tearoom, though the WhatsApp groups are still well behavedThe bath already has a fair volume of disappointments in it after the row over the winter fuel payment. Many Labour MPs have found it extremely hard to justify restricting that benefit to those on pension credit. Some of them are now additionally fatigued by the recent cut to international development spending, another policy area that often forms part of a Labour MP’s identity and values.A good number of left and soft-left MPs are furious about the prospect of benefit cuts, even if Reeves and Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, couch those announcements in the language of reform. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, madea striking argumentlast week for a “moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work”, adding that “our current situation is unsustainable”. Labour figures are acutely aware that their party has long struggled with a reputation for fiscal incontinence and for being soft on benefits.But welfare is an important part of the Labour DNA: the party still celebrates being the creator of the modern welfare state almost as much as it does founding the NHS. Its MPs have often been drawn into politics to protect people from benefit cuts – particularly the cuts announced in the Tory austerity measures over the past 14 years – and have spent far less time thinking about the overall bill.Still, few of them will speak out in public against the cuts when they are announced, other than those who have long been outspoken, like Diane Abbott. “Privately, lots of people are raging,” says one MP, but another who is also unhappy about the spending cuts thus far and fearful of what is to come suggests that there will be “very little pushback”. More MPs have started to voice their concerns to one another in the tearoom, though the party WhatsApp groups are still largely well behaved. Most MPs (with a few daft exceptions) recognise that once you share something in a large messaging group, you might as well have sent it out by press release, and so a grumpy WhatsApp message is now seen as quite a rebellious move. Most are still very much in the frame of mind where they want the government to succeed, and are supportive of Reeves, thinking she has a near impossible job.Starmer and colleagues have been busy doing as much outreach as they can to prevent the disappointment mounting too quickly. The prime minister has been having meetings with small groups of his MPs where he discusses policy and strategy with them. He also has the promise of further unpaid jobs that keep idle backbenchers from plotting, with more MPs getting special “champion” roles covering different sectors and regions of the UK. The value of being a “national health recovery mission champion”, along with having a job title so long that you’ve little breath left to criticise the government, is that a backbencher feels busy and important, connected to the government rather than left out and at the mercy of unpopular decisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere has not yet been a specific outreach programme on cuts and reform by Kendall and her colleagues to MPs, but, as the green paper comes out and the detail of the cuts emerges, that will have to change. Kendall herself is considered to be a well-engaged minister who likes to be present around parliament so that MPs can chat to her, but that tends not to be enough when a department is in the thick of a storm about cuts. While she gets on well with Reeves – the two are described as being “genuinely friends” – there is still a level of distrust between the Treasury and the DWP (though this is not specific to DWP: Treasury officials tend not to trust any department that spends a lot of money).That question of trust is an important one for the relationship between the parliamentary party and ministers, particularly Reeves. She has not had an easy few months and, while most of her colleagues want her to succeed, they have had to watch the “iron chancellor” operating as more of an iron monger, bending her fiscal rules in order to have a chance of meeting them. If they stop trusting that she is on the right course, then they will find it harder to keep the faith during what will inevitably be an extremely emotional and painful set of benefit cuts.Of course, the longer a government delays those cuts, the closer the bath is to overflowing and the less likely it is that those cuts will happen at all. Some of the MPs who are particularly opposed to the cuts also happen to be very annoyed with Starmer and Reeves, and quite hopeful that they may be able to remove the former. They won’t speak out because they are biding their time until that bath does overflow and there is a flood of resentment in the wider Labour party that they can then take advantage of. So don’t be deceived if the party seems relatively peaceful and united over the next few months. The tap is still dripping.Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of theSpectatorand a presenter of Radio 4’sThe Week in WestminsterExplore more on these topicsRachel ReevesOpinionLiz KendallBenefitsWelfareKeir StarmerShabana MahmoodcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s the message from a new Centre for Social Justice report,Lost Boys,published last week. It surveys how boys and young men are faring in Britain and finds that in several areas there is now a reverse gender gap, with boys, particularly those from poorer backgrounds, struggling to keep up with girls.When it comes to education,girls outperform boysat GCSEs and A-levels, and the ratio of women to men at university is60:40. Boys are more than twice as likely to be excluded from school, with rates of exclusion particularly high for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is all feeding through into labour market outcomes: in the 00s, women aged 16-24 were more likely to be not in employment, education and training than young men; in recent years, that has flipped, with young men also significantly more likely to be unemployed than young women. The pay gap for young people has also become a more complex story: for 21- to 24-year-olds, median earnings are now higher for women, but this has been driven by a stark drop in earnings for non-graduate young men, with graduates still earning more than their female equivalent. What’s more, boys are more likely to be obese than girls, and rates of suicide are three and a half times higher for boys aged 15-19 than girls of the same age.None of this is to deny the many inequalities faced by females in a patriarchal society. But neither should a focus on women’s equality crowd out discussion of the problems being experienced by a minority of boys; improving their lot would do a huge amount to make life better for both sexes.But we have struggled to have a constructive conversation about the specific issues facing boys, with a tendency for all sides to slip into polarised, zero-sum framing. For some on the left, there is an implicit fear that focusing on boys might distract from the challenges facing girls; and certain sections of the right wrongly regard boys falling behind as a product of important feminist wins of recent decades.This new report is a healthy corrective, and follows similar work in the US by thinkers such as Richard Reeves, who recently set up theAmerican Institute for Boys and Men. Reeves’ diagnosis of the problem is part institutional, part cultural. We today have an education system better suited to girls, but a labour market still structured around the needs of higher achieving men. And the positive shifts we have seen in the cultural script about successful womanhood have not been accompanied by changing narratives about what it means to be a flourishing man, a vacuum that has enabled misogynist influencers such as Andrew Tate – thethird most Googled personin the world in 2023 – to seed the idea with some young men that women are to blame for their ills.Adverse childhood experiences and mental health issues tend to manifest differently in boysReadingLost Boysmade me feel as though there’s a long way to go in properly understanding what’s going on with young men’s wellbeing. Convincing hypotheses abound. Boys get conflicting messages everywhere, from the violent, aggressive pornography to which so many young people are exposed, to important societal conversations about male violence, to the harmful stereotypes found in books and toys and on clothes. Adverse childhood experiences and mental health issues tend tomanifest differently in boys– in externalising bad behaviours, rather than internalised feelings of depression or anxiety – and are seen much less sympathetically in society, playing into higher school exclusion rates and higher rates of autism and ADHD diagnoses.Men tend to be more socially isolated – data from the US highlights they havefewer close friendshipsand that young men aretwice as likely to be singlethan women. They are also much more likely tolive in the parental home for longer. And Laura Bates has documented how social media algorithms target young men withextreme misogynistic content, with increasing numbers suffering from body dysmorphia or eating disorders, andtaking steroidsto bulk up.Some of the differences between boys and girls will be driven by biology; much will be socially constructed. In terms of the violence gap between the sexes, for example, the average man is not much more violent than the average woman, but there are many more very violent men than women. That is partly a product of higher testosterone levels, but also how some boys react to negative childhood experiences, such as domestic abuse oran absent father. On the friendship gap, one ethnographic study has found that in early adolescence, friendships between girls and between boys are not that dissimilar, but in later years boys learn to become more detachedthrough “macho” culture.Nature or nurture, these differences exist, however, and while some solutions, such as improving online safety and tighterregulation of online pornographywill benefit boys and girls, the former also need solutions tailored to their needs. In the US, Reeves has called for boys to start school a year later, better vocational and technical education, and more male teachers. These are worthy of exploration, but it is striking how little we know about what might work in improving boys’ outcomes.Redressing this is vital to improving the wellbeing of all young people. Failing to do so could also have political consequences, further opening the door for the far right to play on young men’s grievances, as we have seen across Europe. In the last election, young men were twice as likely to vote for Reform as young women, with the latter twice as likely to vote Green, reflecting a growing attitudinal gap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A victory in 2029 may seem unlikely. Yet his government’s push to redraw parliamentary constituencies using post-2026 census data could tilt the electoral field in his favour.The process, known asdelimitation, ensures each member of parliament represents an equal number of voters – a principle of democratic fairness. Since 1976, however, it has been frozen to avoid penalising Indian states that curbed population growth. If delimitation proceeds, Mr Modi’s populous northern strongholds will gain seats, weakening the political clout of India’seconomicallydynamic and culturally distinct southern cone. Its five states are governed by different parties but, critically, none belong to Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Southern states have long accused Mr Modi’s government of bias in federal funding and project approvals. Last week’s gathering of the south’s political leadership in Delhi toprotestagainst his move underscores the risk of backlash.India’s north and south are worlds apart: the six largest northern states have600 millionpeople – twice the south’s population – but lag far behind. Tamil Nadu thrives on industry, education and social mobility, with only 6% in poverty compared with 23% in Bihar. A child in Kerala has better survival odds than in the US; in BJP-run Uttar Pradesh (UP), they’re worse than in Afghanistan. It makes sense to redistribute resources to alleviate poverty. But UP alone receives more federal tax revenue than all five southern states combined. Even if it grew faster than southern India, it would takedecadesto catch up in per capita income. For southern India, delimitation represents both economic and political marginalisation – being taxed more, represented less and sidelined in national policymaking.A recentpaperby Paris’s Institut Montaigne thinktank highlights how India’s north-south divide is deepening due to economic, demographic and political disparities, stirring southern discomfort. It compares the situation to the EU’s Greek debt crisis, where wealthier northern countriesresentedsubsidising the poorer southern ones. The report considers Mr Modi’s home state ofGujarat– a wealthy but highly unequal western region with slow population growth – but warns that the Hindi‑speaking north’s larger populace and lack of socioeconomic progress will deepen tensions and drag the country down.The Indian economist Jean Drèzenotesthat while the BJP lost ground in the north in 2024, it gained in the south. He argues that if seats were redistributed by population while maintaining state-wise party shares, Mr Modi’s coalition would have won 309 MPs, not 294, out of 543 – an edge in a tight race. Prof Drèze suggests Mr Modi may be pushing delimitation to lock in a lead in 2029, when rising discontent could threaten his hold on power.Southernconcernscould be addressed by freezing seat allocations for decades to allow the north to catch up. However, Mr Modi seems to prefer expanding India’s parliament to prevent any state from losing representation, while shrinking southern influence. Much hinges on the timing of India’scensus, a crucial tool for evidence-based policymaking. Already postponed due to Covid in 2021, further delays are increasingly difficult to justify – they obstruct welfare distribution, stall efforts to improve women’s parliamentary representation and appear politically motivated. If delimitation proceeds before 2029 it could reshape India’s political landscape to the BJP’s advantage – but at the cost of a growing north-south rift that threatens to fracture the Indian union.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The actor John Kani paid tribute on X on Sunday, saying “I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend”. The mayor’s office in Cape Town said: “Athol Fugard was not just a luminary in the world of theatre; he was a teller of profound stories of hope and resilience aboutSouth Africa.”A major political dissident playwright of the 20th century, Fugard wrote more than 30 dramas including Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act (in 1972) and“Master Harold” … and the Boys(1982). Both of those drew upon the time in the 1950s when he could only find employment as a clerk in one of the courts where black South Africans were charged (and inevitably convicted) of breaches of the “pass laws”, designed to control the movements of a racially segregated population under the apartheid system. There, he witnessed hourly the dehumanisation of those who had chosen the “wrong” streets or people.Athol Fugard caught the impact of apartheid’s full-on attack on humanity | David LanRead moreFugard’s cultural and political impact was rivalled elsewhere only by the dramas ofVáclav Havelin what was then Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia. Havel was jailed and, when released, abandoned theatre to become the first president of the Czech Republic. Fugard – despite setting up two theatre companies in the segregated black townships and courageously refusing to play to the state-mandated “whites only” audiences – avoided prison, due to being white and therefore not a primary target of the racist government. The worst direct personal persecutions Fugard suffered were the removal of his passport and the occasional banning of plays and burning of books. He was always conscious, though, of benefiting from the immoral hierarchy his writing decried.View image in fullscreenDuty of education … Athol Fugard.Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/The GuardianThe writer’s race would also have made him an impossible political leader in the new Republic of South Africa: its dissident turned president in the Havel manner wasNelson Mandela, who had a strong background presence in Fugard’s plays, especiallyThe Island(1972), set on Robben Island, the penitentiary for political prisoners where Mandela had spent some of his 27 years of incarceration.Born in 1932, Fugard was the only child of Harold, from an immigrant family of Irish descent, and Elizabeth, whose Potgieter clan were among the early Afrikaans settlers of Dutch stock. A jazz pianist turned shopkeeper, Harold moved his family in 1935 to Port Elizabeth, an urban industrial town that remained Fugard’s main home and most regular dramatic setting for the next nine decades.During his childhood, the family ran a hotel and cafe in Port Elizabeth where “Hally” (as the young Athol was known) grew up. There, as a teenager in the late 1940s, an incident occurred that would lie at the heart of his psychology and creativity. In published extracts from his notebooks, Fugard explained how Sam Semela, a black employee in the family businesses, became “the most significant – the only – friend of my boyhood years”. But, after a “rare quarrel”, Hally pulled racial rank and spat in Semela’s face.While confiding to his journal that he would never be able to “deal with the shame that overwhelmed me the second after”, Fugard made literary recompense with “Master Harold” … and the Boys, its title acknowledging a racist hierarchy between white people and their servants that is overturned by a devastatingly apologetic depiction of how the demon of superiority can rise even in the mind of someone who defines as a liberal: the spitting scene is its climax. One of the dedicatees of the published play is “Sam”, with whom Fugard had been reconciled.Public admission of this shaming story was typical of Fugard’s personal honesty, but can also be seen as an attempt to forestall any “saint” or “saviour” interpretation of his work. The contemporary pejorative term “white saviour”, with its implication of credit stolen and virtue claimed, was not yet widely used, but, once it was, Fugard faced retrospective accusation.A complication arose with the working methods of the AfricanTheatreWorkshop and Serpent Players, two multi-racial companies Fugard and his wife, Shiela (also a writer) formed either side of 1960, first in Johannesburg and then Port Elizabeth. Early Fugard plays such as No-Good Friday (1958), Nongogo (1959) and The Coat (1966) improvised scenes with actors based on their own experiences and then created a fixed text for performance.View image in fullscreenSean Taylor and Owen Sejake in The Train Driver by Athol Fugard at Hampstead theatre in 2010.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAs a major Fugard scholar, Professor Dennis Walder, has pointed out, it was yet another horror of the system that the writer could only work with colleagues of colour at his home by registering them, for bureaucratic purposes, as his domestic staff.Fugard’s desire to collaborate with the wronged community, rather than writing anti-apartheid stories from an isolated study in a white area (a criticism of some contemporaries), can reasonably be seen as another compensating response to the Sam shame. But a majority black co-operative run by a white man subsequently raised issues of “appropriation” to which Fugard was alert: editions of The Island and its companion play,Sizwe Banzi Is Dead(1972), in which someone takes on the identity of a dead man in order to use his “pass book” (ID papers), have the credit “devised by Athol Fugard,John KaniandWinston Ntshona”, with royalties split three ways.The circumstances in which Fugard’s early plays were made now sound like something from dystopian fiction. The South African police would raid rehearsals, check scripts and take the names of actors; it became standard for performers to be listed in programmes and on posters under the identities of fictional characters they had previously played.The end of apartheid and Mandela’s presidency removed, from 1994, what the novelistNadine Gordimerhad called “the only subject” for white liberal writers in South Africa. Fugard, though, wrote plays that effectively reflected the country’s “truth and reconciliation” phase of attempted restorative justice.InThe Train Driver(2010), his strongest late work, the white title character seeks out the family of a black mother and child who died when they stepped in front of his train; inSorrows And Rejoicing(2001), the family of a dead, white anti-apartheid writer reflect on the evasions of his life.That Fugard continued as a dramatist even when the driving cause of his first plays was achieved was due to the incompleteness of the victory. Whereas anti-Soviet dramas now have only historical interest – as relative democracy has continued in Russia’s former bloc – the 2021revival of Fugard’s Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act, at the Orange Tree theatre in Richmond, remained disconcertingly relevant.While the specific evil it dramatised – the ban on interracial sex in South Africa from 1927 to 1985 – was gone, the play now served a new purpose: a metaphor for the continuing inequalities of opportunity and security suffered by people of colour around the world. The unexpected longevity of Statements continued a paradox that ran through Fugard’s career: situations that he detested as a citizen were his dramatic fuel.Parents leaving the London production of Statements could be heard explaining to appalled children that the immorality laws had existed in a Commonwealth country during the lifetime of anyone older than 36. That duty of education will keep Fugard’s plays in the theatrical canon, as will the broader lessons of Statements, “Master Harold” … and the Boys and The Island in how racism roots and grows. His 1980 novel Tsotsi, about crime in Johannesburg, was adapted as an Oscar-winning 2005 film, directed by Gavin Hood.Fugard would have been the first to acknowledge that others, such as Kani and Ntshona, were the theatrical Mandelas of free South Africa, but the man who called himself “a classic example of the impotent, white liberal” was an epitome of the good people who, inHannah Arendt’s formulation, must act if evil is not to prevail.Explore more on these topicsAthol FugardTheatreSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was -30C and she wore a “funny hat” for the cold and, “It was fabulous,” because, she says, “Everything… paused.” It’s February now, and the restaurant near the river is just beginning to fill with evening diners when Blanchett slides between the tables in her tartan “chicken feeding coat” and striped shirt, collar popped. “Who are they murdering out the back?” she shouts – the noise of dough being pounded in the kitchen sounds as if they’re beating somebody to death and means we need to lean in, over her pot of turmeric tea. “I always thought, if the acting thing didn’t work out, which it still might not, I would love to be a Foley artist,” creating sound effects for film, smashing watermelons, clicking cups. “Yes, I can burp to order.” Oh? “Not fart, though. One of my primary school friends, vomiting sounds was her trick. Are you any good at noises?” I attempt, quite sweetly, a generic beatbox. “That sounded slightly like a kangaroo. I’ve been away from Australia a long time, though, so…”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course she can burp to order. She is Cate Blanchett, two-time Oscar winner, one of our greatest living actors. This is a person who, at 55, is balancing Hollywood movie stardom and motherhood (her eldest is 23; the youngest, who she and husband Andrew Upton adopted in 2015, nine), while also maintaining the freedom to regularly veer away from the family blockbusters or exquisite thrillers and take a part that is gloriously insane, like a German prime minister set upon by wanking bog-men (Rumours, 2024) or a female spider (Red, 2017) or, following her Oscar nomination for Tár (she remains the most nominated Australian, a feat!), the dancer in a Sparks video (The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte, 2023). The women she plays (and, as in her sly portrayal of Bob Dylan, men) are unpredictable, inscrutable and occasionally icy. Which takes us back to the Arctic.View image in fullscreen‘I’d rather listen than talk’: starring in Black Bag.Photograph: Album/Alamy“The only thing keeping me remotely sane at the moment is getting into cold water every day,” Blanchett says. “I get up and get in. Five minutes and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are.” Do you not… feel like you’re dying?“Well, I don’t know what your experience of childbirth was?” We digress, tea is drunk. “You just have to breathe and be there. You can resist that pain or you can surrender to it. And I’ve done it long enough now that I can return to that place during the day. Otherwise, you know, my brain’s like a Pac-Man.” We spend a happy five minutes scrolling through photos on her phone to find the ice hole (huskies, her funny hat, her daughter wrapped in jackets, “A lot of pictures of people doing yoga stretches and making ceramics, sorry,”) until she apologises again, violently. “I mean, what middle-aged person isn’t talking about cold plunging? It is so boring!” In many circumstances I’d agree, but with Blanchett it remains interesting because of the impulse – the thing that leads her to the ice.“I always think you have to start as you mean to continue. I think that’s true of relationships, friendships, any enterprise. It’s a new day. And I’m just trying to start my day as I mean to continue – connected and open-hearted. That’s what I’m trying to do.” Is it working? “It feels like a monumental challenge at the moment. My job is to connect. And there are a lot of nefarious actors at the moment striving for us to separate ourselves from each other.” She purses her lips. “It’s not my daily protest, but it was a magical holiday. What did you do for New Year’s?” I tell her I made a cake. “Excellent. See? Starting as you mean to continue.”View image in fullscreen‘One day, I’ll grow up and get a proper job’: Cate Blanchett wears bodice and tailored trousers, both byvictoriabeckham.com; earrings bylateliernawbar.com; and invisible bra cups byintimissimi.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverBlanchett camestraightto the restaurant from a rehearsal room. She’s working on a stage production of The Seagull with a cast that includesTom Burke, who also stars in her new film, Black Bag. The thing about Blanchett, says Burke, is, “She’s not a soloist. Even though she, of course, has the talent, charisma and skill set to be exactly that. She wants to be part of the band.” Black Bag is a spy thriller directed bySteven Soderberghin which Blanchett andMichael Fassbenderplay married intelligence agents whose loyalty to each other is tested by a case – the black bag is the suitcase required for a covert job you can’t tell anyone about, even your husband.In some ways, I suggest, their marriage, with its secrecy built in, is ideal, in that it has the space required to maintain desire. “Yes, it’s all about the things that are not said, which is really interesting to play. I think it’s a fascinating way to look at a marriage now, because it’s meant to be all about honesty, having everything out there. But what does that mean for desire and what does it actually mean for trust, if there are no secrets that you’re prepared to keep?” Blanchett has been married to Upton, a playwright, since 1997. They’ve worked together, too, running theSydney Theatre Companyat home in Australia – now they live on a 100-acre farm in Sussex that the Daily Mail calls “Blanchettville”. What did this film teach her about relationships? “Every marriage is different, but the ones that last are based on a profound trust and, I think, not having a stranglehold over your partner. Or an expectation, really, that you can ever truly know one another.”View image in fullscreenTable talk: with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jude Law and Adam Scott in the Aviator from 2004.Photograph: Album/AlamyAs she dithers about perhaps ordering some cauliflower (“I love a cauliflower. I can’t grow it, though. We’ve got problems with moths that eat our broccoli but, oh well, they were there first”), I admit I was nervous about our meeting. In previous interviews she has shown resistance. There is a moment when Blanchett typically sighs, or declares her lack of interest in talking about herself, or her characters, or her “craft”. “Ah yes,” she says. “We could make this very short.” She rearranges her shirt collar, which emerges rakishly from a red jumper. “I’d much rather listen than talk. Some people come to life in these environments, being able to articulate the ‘why’ of what they do. But I find it a little bit like the question, ‘Why do you love your partner?’ It’s really difficult to say, particularly after a long time, because you’re so entwined and meshed, and it’s like an organism that keeps evolving. It’s hard to pin down.” Why does she love her partner? “On Tuesday it might be his beard and on Wednesday it might be the way he eats cherries. And it’s interesting, some relationships which you think are incredible and full of passion, you realise, oh, they’re actually competing with one another. Or they need the partner to be something in relief of themselves, rather than being their own entity.” She and Upton both do the cold plunges every morning, “before going off into our separate little worlds,” but no more swimming talk, boring, sorry.In her role asa goodwill ambassador for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), Blanchett recently announced a new grant scheme for refugee filmmakers, offering up to €100,000 each to five people creating work about the experiences of displaced people. “When I began working with them, the number of people who were displaced around the world was approaching 60 million, now it’s over 120 million. And a vast majority of those are children, which, as a mother of four…” she shudders. “I do feel there’s an obvious intersection between what’s going on with our climate, our collective climate, and displacement. It’s not going away.” So these filmmakers’ perspectives, “are important to break down the preconceptions we have about individuals who are displaced, the false and dehumanising narratives that are out there.” Does she feel a responsibility, having a profile, to take action? It’s simpler than that, she tuts. “The more generationally, culturally and, from a gender point of view, diverse any room of any industry in any walk of life is, the more fascinating the conversation is going to be.” She shrugs.View image in fullscreenOut of the shadows: structured basque skirt and embroidered pearl top, bothbalmain.com; Aurora pearl earrings,tasaki.co.uk; black pumps,christianlouboutin.com; and second skin tights,calzedonia.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverWhat’s her relationship with the news? Is she compulsively scrolling? “I think sometimes by ‘switching off’ you can switch on? I’m trying to take a leaf out of my husband’s book – he’s not bound up in that 24-hour news cycle addiction where we keep swiping because we hope that these horrific situations will somehow change. So sometimes I think by disconnecting you can reconnect in a different way. You hear the dog-whistle side of things and see the longer arc of the narrative – I hope there is a longer arc.” She gulps her turmeric tea. “Knowledge has different rhythms. And wisdom and perspective isn’t always gained by being caught up in the drama. Being knowledgable of the events and their repercussions and the consequences is important, but The white noise can be very distracting.”Her head to the side, she asks what it’s like digesting news in order to write a weekly column, and I admit I forget everything the second it goes to press. “Oh, that’s interesting because I have the opposite thing. Once I’ve put something to bed, I have this profound realisation – I see the train receding and I think, now I know I was sitting in the wrong seat. That’s why theatre’s more natural to me, in that you can get up every night and re-offend and hopefully repair what you did the night before or go deeper. And until someone stops you at the bus stop you don’t know if anybody’s even seen a film.” There used to be box-office receipts, she remembers, “but now it’s ‘eyeballs’.” I was shocked to read about how streamers were commissioning “second screen” content – films that won’t distract viewers from their phones. “Yeah, it’s a little bit soul-destroying as an actor when you’re just a narrative delivery device.” How is she feeling about art and AI? “It’s very difficult to know at the moment where to put one’s energy. We’re in a transitional phase of something I hope is not going to be cataclysmic and horrific. I would have hoped that they, at this point in human history, would have developed enough wisdom to know these things have to serve the common good, not just line an individual’s pockets. But you have to be… there’s no option but to be… hopeful?” What does hope look like, for her?View image in fullscreenFully charged: on stage at Glastonbury in 2023, dancing with the Sparks.Photograph: James Veysey/Shutterstock“My hope has to have an engaged, active quality to it. I don’t think it’s a time to be passive, but it is a time to really deeply listen to what is behind what’s being said, what is behind people’s fear, behind people’s aspirations.” She flutters her fingers around her face. “I think there is an urge for people to gather. That may be around a screen watching a film or protesting, but people want to be in groups, and you hope that those groups are communities and not tribes.” What does she see as the main difference between the two? “Tribalism has an aggression that is so destructive and I think communities are about finding points of connection with people.” She looks at me sharply, catching herself. “I don’t want to sound too pompous or sentimental, but – breaking bread together or playing sport together or going to a movie together, we don’t have to have the same political views, or sexual orientation or the same culture, but there’s an urge to find pleasure in life and to not rid other people of their ability to seek that.”In 2018, Blanchett spoke out aboutHarvey Weinstein, with whom she’d worked on films such as Carol and The Aviator, and this year talked about her “distress” at how the #MeToo movement “didn’t really ever take root”. It’s the responsibility of those in “public-facing industries,” she says today, to continue the conversation. “When you talk about equity and inclusion, that means the people who’ve had all the toys need to share. They’ve got used to that being normal. And so you have to be very vocal in order to rebalance it.”What happened with #MeToo? “Well, the conversation had just begun and suddenly everything was being discredited and undermined, so we’re still having to fight for those same basic conversations.” Sometimes it feels as though we’ve gone backwards. “Definitely.” And where did the industry’s equal-pay discussions land? “We’re nowhere near equal pay! Talking about it noisily doesn’t mean action has happened. I mean, there’s a greater concentration of wealth than perhaps there ever has been in human history. And we can see where that’s got us.” I wait, but she doesn’t elaborate. Is she wary, I wonder, of talking directly about politics? She pauses.“I think a lot of human issues have been politicised.” Carefully, she continues. “And the problem is that everything is so fragile at the moment, so we really have to be very judicious and targeted about where and when and to whom things get said, because so much is at stake. And somehow often a throwaway comment gets picked up and suddenly it becomes a mission statement. And what does that add to the action?” She flutters, apologetically. “ Maybe I am wary, but not because of personal repercussions. I’m a big girl. It’s more that I think there’s so much at stake.” Plus, she reminds me, chuckling, “We’re here to talk about a spy movie! I’m trying to keep it in context!”As she’s talking, I’m reminded of a dress she wore last year at Cannes – it appeared to be a simple black gown, but when she lifted the white hem to reveal a green silk lining against the red carpet she suddenly became the Palestinian flag. At the time she neither confirmed or denied the intention. “I don’t know that talking about any dress that one wore could have done or will do anything to affect what is going on in Gaza,” she laughs, darkly. “But I think the lack of listening to people’s point of view and how quickly toxic that conversation became was heartbreaking.” She waits, serene now, for another question.Do Blanchett’s characters stay with her? “There’s a weird thing that happens particularly when you’re…” She has extracted from her bag a small medical pot of gel and is rubbing it into her cuticles. “I had to wear these fake nails and… sorry, this is really inappropriate. I’ve got my bunion separator in my bag as well. I won’t open that up. Do you want some?” We briefly, happily, massage our hands. “It’s not necessarily that the characters stay with you, but it’s a little bit like being in a new relationship, in that through the prism of the dialogue and the fabulous sex you’re having with that partner, the world seems suddenly different. It depends on if it’s all-consuming, like [Lydia] Tár or Blanche DuBois, then it does affect your dream life, too. But the best antidote to that, I think, is having four children.” Are they interested in her work? “Well,” she says evenly, “I love talking to my kids. The three boys have got this language they speak between one another that’s kind of beautiful and impenetrable. But they’re constantly dismissing me.” Oh dear. “Yeah, fast-track humility going on – I’m constantly lampooned and discredited.” In what way? “I’m an irrelevance around the kitchen table, in a great way. Everyone’s an equal player, but sometimes my husband and I are less equal than the rest of them. They’re quite a force.” She packs away her gel.She’s mentioned the idea of giving up acting more than once. “Yes I had a fantasy about getting on the train to Paris and not showing up in rehearsal today. That was my 3am dance. But I think I had to have that dance.” What was that? Nerves? “Nerves and fear of letting people down and not being able to give what, in the architecture of the thing, you need to reach. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn’t and irrespective, you have to show up.” Is that fantasy also about the life not lived? “Yes, possibly Dr Freud. And I’ve had a delightful avoidance of that by, I suppose, temporarily stepping into other people’s lives. But one day I’m going to grow up and get a proper job.” Foley! The chef is no longer pounding. “Foley!” Her press director is hovering, waiting to accompany her to a screening. I applaud her energy, as well as everything else, including the ice baths. “I get four hours’ sleep each night,” she grimaces. “So I’ll die soon.

This, at least, is the hope of the publishing industry this spring, as it welcomes news that sales of children’s comics and graphic novels have reached an all-time peak of almost £20m in Britain.While publishers and editors are celebrating this boom for its own sake, the popularity of these titles is also being hailed as a good omen for novels, ahead of the London Book Fair at Olympia this week. “Over the last decade we’ve seen a significant rise in sales of graphic novels for both the adult and children’s markets,” said Philip Stone, media analyst at NielsenIQ BookData, as he revealed details of the latest trends, hits and flops this weekend.“Superhero books have been a reliably big feature, probably boosted by all the screen superhero movies. A lot of manga series are doing very well again, and this may also be linked to screen versions. What we really need now is some deep-dive research into the impact of graphic and comic fiction as a gateway for young people into reading. We certainly suspect it’s true.”Among the major hits to lure the readers of the future with comic-style stories are paperback-sized titles such as theDiary of a Wimpy Kidseries by Jeff Kinney, and Jamie Smart’sBunny Vs Monkeybooks.Smart said: “As a creator, comics are one of the greatest ways to tell a story. You get to show the reader everything that’s inside your mind, how a scene looks, who the characters are, what they’re doing, all the subtleties and nuances of their behaviours, and you hold all that within the space of a single panel. Then you do it again, and again, propelling the story forwards, unfolding entire worlds in front of your audiences. And when you’re given that freedom to tell a story exactly how you imagine it, I think readers really respond to that.”The appetite for books in graphic form comes after the National Literacy Trust confirmed thedecline in children’s general reading habitslast November. It found that just one in three children and young people aged eight to 18 enjoyed reading in their free time, with enjoyment levels decreasing by 8.8 percentage points in the past year.Undaunted, Smart will attend the book fair as its first “creative” in residence this week, a sign of his industry status. He is convinced children are beguiled by books that avoid making them feel they are doing something overtly educational.“A good story well told is worth its weight in gold, and comics are no exception,” said Smart. “We’re seeing that now, especially with younger readers and reluctant readers, who are all drawn in by the bright visuals and funny characters, before becoming carried along by the stories, and then forming lifelong bonds with these books. Something quite magical is happening at the moment. It’s really exciting to see.”In truth, the demand for grown-up fiction needs little encouragement. In print it continues to drive sales across all the markets Nielsen looked at. The top-performing fiction titles were all written by women, such as Colleen Hoover’sIt Ends With Us, Rebecca Yarros’sFourth WingandIron Flame, Sally Rooney’sIntermezzo, and Freida McFadden’sThe Housemaid. Notably, the thriller writer LJ Ross has significant popularity in the north of England, becoming the second most popular fiction author in the region, ahead of everyone except McFadden.Fiction hardbacks also achieved the largest sales by value in Britain on record, with six titles selling more than 100,000 units on their own. “Fiction is a little cheaper, which may be an element,” said Stone. “It’s also offers pure escapism, which people may be seeking now.”In contrast, non-fiction is “having a tough time”, with the lowest sales figures in about 20 years. Stone ascribes this continuing slump partly to cost and partly to the internet. “There’s a lot of free content out there in the non-fiction area. We used to see personal development titles doing very well, but it’s fallen away a bit. Religious books are up, though,” he said.Last year, the first university-led research programme into the impact of comics on literacy showed that superheroes may be saving us from more than supervillains: they also seem to turn young people into enthusiastic readers. The study project, funded by Comic Art Europe and conducted by researchers at Manchester University in collaboration with the annual Lakes International Comic Art Festival, ran for two years at Abraham Moss community school in north Manchester. Fifty students took part in the comics literacy programme, while 50 others functioned as a control group.According to the school’s own measurements, the average reading age of the class involved in the comics intervention rose by 18 months in the year after the workshops started, in contrast to a rise of 11 months in the other group.The number of children who listed reading as one of their favourite leisure activities also doubled in the intervention group, while falling in the comparison group.Explore more on these topicsComics and graphic novelsThe ObserverPublishingChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Do some people crave the solace of the corner more than others? He finds clues to the compulsion in his upbringing – and in artGeoff DyerSun 9 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 9 Mar 2025 17.39 EDTShareIt can take a surprisingly long time to become conscious of something that has been a feature of one’s life for as long as one can remember. I was 66 before I realised that I had always liked sitting in a corner. This revelation occurred in a restaurant while I was waiting for a friend. I’d got there right on time – I’ve known for more than 40 years that I have a mania for punctuality – and after being shown to a corner table I took what was obviously the best of the two seats on offer: the one in the corner. When I was growing up my mum said that if a man was out with a lady he should always walk curb-side; was there a version of this whereby the gentleman should always let the lady have the corner seat and sit with his back to the interior equivalent – the foot traffic – of the open road, with the attendant risk of being assaulted from behind by the chill blast of air conditioning? If so, that bit of chivalry had been invalidated by my friend’s texting to say she was running an incrediblesevenminutes late.As soon as I sat down I was happy. Because I was in a corner. Realising is one thing, but I also want to understand. Where does the satisfaction and pleasure of the corner come from? What does it mean? The following reflections are personal and contingent but, as Diane Arbus once said: “I do feel I have some slight corner on something about the quality of things.”The mob boss tends to favour the corner seat of a trattoria so that he can see who’s potentially coming to whack himThe first stop for any investigation of this kind isThe Poetics of Space, in which Gaston Bachelard points out that the pleasure of being in a corner has nothing to do with the expression – and sensation of – being cornered. In that situation you are under pressure, threatened; being in a corner, by contrast, is a position of safety. And while turning a corner means putting a previous phase of life behind you, a corner seat means that the only things behind you are walls and maybe cushions. You are content to stay put, with no desire to move on. The constant possibility of danger in gangster films means that the mob boss tends to favour the corner seat of a trattoria so that he can see who’s potentially coming to whack him. In the non-drama of normal restaurant-going, where the main threat is noise – music, loud voices, atrocious acoustics – the pleasure has little to do with surveilling the room. It’s a semi-uterine feeling of being partly enclosed. Booths offer a way of multiplying this feeling of enclosure, expanding it beyond actual corners to entire sides of a restaurant, but the best spot will still be the booth – more exactly, thecornerof that booth – in the corner of the room.These are shared but not universal urges. Why do some people crave the solace of the corner more than others? In my case I put it down – as I do most things – to having no brothers or sisters. Alone – and being an only child means one is instinctively on one’s own – in a restaurant, I like the way that I can sit tacitly concealed in my aloneness.The Corner Table(1886) by the American artist Irving Ramsey Wiles depicts a woman seated in the corner of a restaurant, posed and poised in a fashion familiar to any reader of Henry James or Edith Wharton, between restriction and independence. She’s on her own but it’s not clear whether she will be dining alone or if she’s waiting, as I was in the opening paragraph, for a companion. Over her right shoulder is a glimpse, in a mirror, of her view of the restaurant (a partial optical allusion to Manet’sA Bar at the Folies-Bergère?) depicting a male diner being served by a waiter in another corner, with the corner of a painting on the wall above their manly heads. A narrative connection between these paired elements is suggested but unresolved. Either way, she is self-contained, and this self-containment is protected and shared, reflected upon by – and within – the painting’s multiple angled recessions.View image in fullscreenNighthawks, 1942 by Edward Hopper.Photograph: Corbis/GettyConsider, by contrast, how exposed are the three customers in Edward Hopper’sNighthawks(1942).They’re in a brightly lit corner diner while enjoying none of the comforts of cornerhood: their backs are displayed to the street. If we are discussing the man in the far left of the picture, we are literally talking about him behind his back. Beyond the frame, out of sight to the far right, there may be a seat enabling someone to look at the other diners and out at the street. If there is, that’s where I would want to be. From there, implicitly, it might be conceptually possible to see viewers looking at the painting.My desire to be in the corner is not confined to public settings like this. The reading chair in my study is in the corner. Sitting in it, I am conscious that the open book I’m holding forms another micro-corner of sorts so that – if the book is as absorbing asThe Cornerby David Simon and Ed Burns – I’m enclosed in the corner of the corner room of a flat on the top floor of a house. The feeling is most intense after dark, when the chair is bathed in the glow of a lamp, after I’ve locked the door of the flat from the inside, with the key in the lock. No one can get in but this is less a security measure than an expression of fulfilled intent: for the rest of the night I am not venturing out again for anything or anyone.View image in fullscreenThe Red Room, Etretat, 1899 by Félix Vallotton.Photograph: Artefact/AlamyOn this particular evening, in this little nook, I’m looking through the catalogue of an exhibition devoted to the Nabis, the clique of artists from the last decade of 19th-century Paris. Given their fondness for intimate interiors I guessed that the corner would be featured in their works – and so it turns out. The painting that best expresses the psychological comfort of the corner isThe Red Room, Etreat(1899) by the Swiss-born Félix Vallotton. (Described as a “loner among friends”, Vallaton was himself painted, perched on a chair in the corner of his studio, by friend and fellow Nabi Édouard Vuillard the following year.) Vallotton’s painting shows a woman in a red armchair to one side of an unlit fire, tucked in the corner of a room with Rothko-red walls. Her eyes are closed. At her feet a child tears up a piece of paper on a patterned dull rug. It would be convenient to claim that the painting shows a mother in a state of blissful content, a feminine version of the opening of Dickens’sDombey and Son: “Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead…” Her expression, however, refuses to confirm – to conform to – this snug reading. And there is a further complication. One of the blobs of red to her left actually represents a bed squeezed into the corner – in an alcove, to be precise – so she’s not quite in the corner. But the flattened vertical colours mean that this bed is perceived less as a physical object than an abstract magnification of the psychological space and comfort – the illusion – of being in a corner. (Hence, perhaps, my saying that she was “tucked in” to the corner.) The opposite of Henry Fuseli’s rearing and unsettlingNightmare(1781), this is the nest where dreams of corner-ness sleep.Geoff Dyer’s memoir,Homework, will be published by Canongate (£20) on 29 May.

The number of local authority-run youth centres in England slumped from 917 to 427 between 2012 and 2023, while council spending was reduced by 75%. Unison claimsmore than 1,000have shut since 2010.Koleoso says the clubs that have closed should be reinstated to create a “network” that will spur the next generation of Britain’s artistic talent.“The dream is we reopen a lot of these youth clubs and pay people salaries so that they can work full-time with these children,” he adds. “Some of you teach music, some of you teach them how to produce. Some of you teach them how to draw. All different types, all different shapes, all different sizes.”Koleoso argues that we need to broaden our understanding of what constitutes a youth club. It’s not just a “town hall, table tennis, a couple of biscuits”, he says.View image in fullscreenStudents with the youth music groupKinetika Bloco.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianHe cites the example of Arsenal’s football academy and the Lee Valley Athletics Centre, which was built in the lead-up to the London Olympics in 2012 and wasstate of the art. “They had a thing where if you wanted to train you could,” Koleoso says. “At the last Olympics half the team seemed to come from my school.”He watched as local athletesChijindu ‘CJ’ UjahandDesiree Henrycompeted for Team GB. “All of these Enfield kids represented Team GB,” he adds. “I just wish someone said: ‘Do you know why that happened? Because of that one building’. It’s not that deep.”Ezra Collective also practised together at the Southbank Centre’sKinetika Bloco, a long-running youth music charity that introduces children to brass, woodwind, steel pan and other instruments.When Ezra Collective performed live at the Brits, playing Little Things with Jorja Smith, theybrought Kinetika Bloco’s current cohort of young talent, out on stage with them.View image in fullscreenEzra Collective accompanied by young musicians from Kinetika Bloco at the Brit awards.Photograph: Scott A Garfitt/Invision/APThe closure of youth clubs is often linked to risingviolent crime and other forms of antisocial behaviour. But Koleoso thinks there needs to be more nuance in the debate, and an understanding that youth clubs don’t just reduce violent crime but are places where creativity can thrive.“If I didn’t have that youth club, would I have just gone around shooting people? Probably not,” says Koleoso. “I’m not saying it saved me … yes, I was born into a very working-class life, but I had mum and dad at home. My state school was cool.“My narrative is different … I saw my future compared with the people around me that didn’t have that youth club experience. I was so long-sighted with everything.”The band try to visit different youth clubs wherever they tour, popping in for sessions before sound check and gigs in the evening. Koleoso regularly volunteers at his local youth club, which was thrilled about his Brits success.But this year’s messy Shrove Tuesday celebrations might be the last for the drummer. “I probably won’t do pancake day again,” he admits.Explore more on these topicsJazzClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The brainchild of Gints Zilbalodis, a 30-year-old Latvian film-maker, it’s about an unnamed house cat cast adrift on a sailboat alongside a capybara and a ring-tailed lemur. The world has flooded; one disaster follows another. The animals on the boat have to help one another or die.Flowcontains no human life and not one line of actual dialogue. Despite this, it is eloquent and humane and almost unbearably tense.Animators, says Zilbalodis, are a little like cats, in that they tend to be self-sufficient, antisocial and have to be coaxed into joining a team.Flow’s production involved Zilbalodis abandoning his desk to oversee a small crew of artists. He had to learn how to delegate, collaborate and risk having his ideas challenged and shot down. The finished film, therefore, is almost a parable of its own making; a comment on all those behind-the-scenes negotiations. It’s a salute to the loners who need to pool their resources, and the endangered beasts on the margins that have to adapt to survive.Flow, though, has managed more than mere survival. It’s a phenomenon, a breakout hit; a hand-tooled, small-scale production that speaks to the multiplex and the arthouse alike. At last weekend’s Academy Awards, Zilbalodis’s labour-of-love drama scooped the Oscar for best animated feature, the first independent production to do so, beating out the likes ofInside Out 2andThe Wild Robot. The picture (which was also nominated in the best international film category) may count as a trailblazer of sorts, part of a new breed, because it was recognised on the animated Oscar shortlist alongside Adam Elliot’s mordantMemoir of a Snailand Nina Gantz’s eerie shortWander to Wonder. Each of these pictures is nuanced, distinctive and strange. Each was produced for next to no money. Independent animation used to be seen as an atomised backwater. Now it’s emerged from the shadows to trouble the mainstream.View image in fullscreenGints Zilbalodis with his Oscar last weekend. Flow won in the face of competition from Disney, Dreamworks – and Wallace & Gromit’s Aardman.Photograph: Getty ImagesIf there exists such a thing as an animation community, it lives a nomadic existence on the European film festival circuit. That’s where the artists tend to congregate, Zilbalodis says. Festivals were his film school, or possibly his watering holes. “But as a community it’s very fractured,” he adds. “People live in their own niche bubbles and don’t interact much. They definitely don’t follow any formula. If you look at the big animation studios, there is an established system, a general understanding of the way things are done. But independent animations are made by just a few people. There is no industry standard, so you can tell whatever story you like in whatever style that you like.”That variety is reflected at every festival, he adds. “One film will have a conventional narrative and the next will be abstract. One will be for young kids and the next will be very dark and adults-only. Everyone uses different tools, different software or different puppets. The possibilities are infinite.”Zilbalodis createdFlowon Blender, an open-source software that enabled him to animate the animals as CGI wireframe models and paint in his backgrounds of forested hills and drowned cities. Dutch-born Nina Gantz, by contrast, is more old-school. Her Bafta-winningWander to Wonderuses stop-motion puppetry to resuscitate the survivors of an old children’s TV show. These puppets live on in the studio after the aged presenter has died, recording forlorn updates for the fans who have long since grown up and moved on. As withFlow, it’s a film that reflects on its own existence, celebrating the dying art of physical media while eerily subverting it too.View image in fullscreen‘Eerie and old-school’: the Bafta-winning animated short Wander to Wonder.Wander to Wonderclocks in at under 14 minutes. But the fact it exists at all is a miracle, Gantz says. “There were so many disasters along the way. The puzzle of funding. One of the companies went bankrupt. The puppets weren’t done on time. There were so many moments when I almost dropped the whole thing. But I loved the world we were creating. That’s what kept me going, I think.”The film took about eight years to complete. That’s a lot of time spent on 14 minutes of puppetry and raises a crass and obvious question. Just how viable is a career in independent animation?“Not viable!” says Gantz. The very idea makes her laugh. “It’s not viable at all. You do it for the love of the craft and the film and you try not to think about all the rest. And probably you have to be a little bit insane.”I put the same question to the Australian animator Adam Elliot, who spent a similar amount of time makingMemoir of a Snail. “It’s barely viable,” he says. “I haven’t starved yet, but I’ve come close. Luckily I draw and sell my artwork as a way of keeping myself alive between productions. Also I’m a product of government funding in Australia. That means I get money to write and develop. It would be different if I were trying to make films in America. I’d have to be making family-friendly children’s entertainment.” He shrugs. “So as an auteur it’s a struggle. And it’s not getting any easier.”View image in fullscreen‘Stop motion has a magical quality’: Adam Elliot checks his creations for Memoir of a Snail at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianElliot has been around for donkey’s years.

Every one of his characters is a plasticine model, dressed up for action and manipulated gently by hand.Our budgets are what the big studios spend on cateringAdam Elliot“When I was starting out, I was told I was pursuing a dying art form,” he says. “That was 29 years ago. Computer animation had just started and was going to take over the world. And it sort of has. We’re drowning in digital culture and CGI animation. But I think the arrival of AI has brought a greater appreciation of hand-crafted art forms, whether it’s knitting or breadmaking or stop-motion animation. It’s an egalitarian art form because you can shoot a film on your phone. But stop-motion also has a magical quality that other animation doesn’t. When the audience is able to see the thumbprint on the clay, they know they’re looking at something tangible, tactile and real.”Thatpersonal touchimprints every frame ofMemoir of a Snail, a tragicomic coming-of-age tale that took top prize at the 2024 London film festival (the first stop-motion picture to do so). Animation, Elliot says, is a medium, not a genre.Flow,Memoir of a SnailandWander to Wonderare all very different movies. But their independent nature filters through to their stories. They’re more complex and less costly than most mainstream animations.Memoir of a Snailwas made for about £3.5m.Flow’s budget was £3m. Compare that with the bill for the average studio behemoth. “Inside Out 2cost $200m,” says Elliot. “You look at me withMemoirand Gints withFlow– our budgets are what those people spend on catering. So I’m trying to talk to the big studios – Netflix, Amazon, DreamWorks – and say, ‘Come on, guys, be more generous. Carve out a little slice of these budgets and invest in some independent auteurs.’” It makes economic sense: a number of big animations (Wish,Elemental) have recently sputtered at the box office. “The old formula isn’t working. Hollywood is really struggling with animation. So it needs to transition. Things have to change.”View image in fullscreen‘Stop-motion has a magical quality’: Memoir of a Snail, which won best film, animated or otherwise, at the 2024 London film festival.The creatures on the boat (the cat, the capybara and the ring-tailed lemur) have simple needs: food, shelter, dry land. The three independent animators (Zilbalodis, Gantz, Elliot) aren’t asking for a whole lot more. They’d like sound infrastructure and a better model of distribution. Extra money would allow them to develop, crew and shoot their films more quickly. But a lifetime of solitude is a hard habit to shake and too much interference risks muddying the finished film.“I know all the stories about independent film-makers who go and make something huge,” Zilbalodis says, “and more often than not they get overwhelmed. The system doesn’t allow them to express or say what they want.”A century ago, an independent animator named Walt Disney embarked on a career that would carry him from the drawing board to global dominance; from 1928’sSteamboat Willieto studios and theme parks and a company that is valued at about £165bn. So there is a precedent here and a possible path to glory, should Zilbalodis choose to take it.“You never know what’s going to happen,” he says ruefully. “But I promise youthatis never going to happen. I’m not going to build a business. I don’t know what I’d do with big success. I don’t have any hobbies. I sleep and I eat and I sit at my desk. Anything more would only be a distraction.”Flowis in cinemas ​in the UK and Ireland on 21 March​, in Australia on 20 March and is available to stream in the US.Memoir of a Snailis in cinemas now​ in the UK and Ireland and available to stream in Australia and the US.Wander to Wonderisn’t currently available in the UK but is ​in US cinemas along with the rest of the Oscar-nominated short films​ – detailshereWatch a trailer for Flow.Explore more on these topicsAnimation in filmThe ObserverOscarsAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a place of obvious delight, thanks to a garden enclosed by old stone walls in which it stands, a clump of grand old beech trees just outside, and broad views of sweeping countryside beyond. The house itself is a well-proportioned, thoughtfully detailed, somewhat rustic glass box that makes good use of the transparency and openness that modernist building methods made possible. It’s also a work of less obvious riches, a material diary of building and dwelling, a three-dimensional essay on the passage of time. Now it is being put up for sale by its owners for the past 23 years, the graphic designerIan Cartlidgeand his wife, Jo.The Smithsons, acknowledged founders of brutalism, never saw themselves as practising a style, but applying an attitude – one that makes evident the ways buildings are made. Upper Lawn is possibly the purest expression of their ideals. Having to satisfy no clients but themselves, it was a “device”, as Peter (1923-2003) called it, “for trying things out on oneself” and for generating ideas they could use on larger projects, such as theirheadquarters for theEconomistin St James’s, London.The story of their house began in 1945, when the 17-year-old Alison (1928-1993) went looking for the remains of Fonthill Abbey, the fabled and colossal folly built from 1796 to 1813 by William Thomas Beckford with his father’s vast and ill-gotten, slave-based wealth. As if in a “fairy story”, as she later put it, Alison hacked through a thorn hedge to discover substantial fragments of gothic architecture that, according to history books of the time, did not exist.View image in fullscreen‘A device for trying things out’: Upper Lawn under construction, left; Peter and Alison Smithson at the drawing table in 1961.Composite: Peter Smithson/ Smithson Family Collection; GettyYears later, she and Peter bought a derelict cottage, condemned to demolition, on the abbey’s landscaped estate. The Smithsons set about designing a place that was, as their daughter Soraya Smithson now says, “about everyone going away and spending time as a family. If both parents are working that’s a very important thing.” Their project would also“test new products”, try out “certain applications and assemblies” and find out what it would be like to live year-round in a house glass-walled on every side except the north – a “Solar Pavilion”, to use one of several names they gave the house – with solid masonry inside that it was hoped would store the heat. It was, says Soraya, “cold in winter and blazingly hot in summer, but it was not unpleasant and we didn’t think anything of it”.The project was romantic and technical at once, bringing together the ghost of the abbey and the pages of a building products catalogue, the stone ruins of the old cottage with pitch fibre drainpipes and high-purity aluminium sheet. The old gable wall was re-used as an internal structure that divided the new house into two parts, and off which its light timber frame was supported. The walled garden was retained, its paving repaired and selectively rearranged. Two windows from the cottage survive in the perimeter wall, one looking into the new house, the other into what is now an external room.View image in fullscreenThe Smithsons’ daughter Soraya recalls that the house was ‘cold in winter and blazingly hot in summer’.Photograph: Ian CartlidgeIt’s a rare example of architecture that gets you looking at things other than itselfThe Smithsons’ architecture was about not just the house but everything around it – planting, paving, atmospherics, landscape – and they wanted to honour what they found. When a self-seeded hawthorn proved too thick to be easily sawn, they pruned it into a peacock-like piece of topiary they called the “wall bird”.Architectureat Upper Lawn merges with gardening – a matter of choosing and nurturing as much as making new. The glass box of the house itself, the flimsiest and plainest part of the ensemble, is an instrument for experiencing everything else: its lower level acts as an extension of the introverted garden, its upper as a light-filled deck for enjoying the expansive surrounding panorama, looking back to the space in the sky where the abbey’s 300ft tower once stood. Two opposite spatial experiences can be had within the one modest structure.The design animates different kinds of time – historical, human, seasonal, biological, constructional. The juxtaposition of stone and aluminium marks the passage of centuries. Weathering has brought together the once-contrasting metal panels and timber frames, dulling the shine of one and silvering the other. The Smithsons made a written, drawn and photographic record of their 20-plus years in the house, some of it eventually publishedas a book, which describes its different characters in snow and sunshine, their children’s improvisations with landscape features and building materials.Another book,AS in DS,chronicles their trips from London to the house in their Citroën DS 19.View image in fullscreenA ‘shelter for the simple life’.Photograph: Ian CartlidgeIn the county of Stonehenge and Avebury, Upper Lawn works its own quiet magic, making relationships between building and land. It’s a place of simple pleasures of material and nature and unexpected inversions, the house sometimes looking less substantial than the old plants climbing the walls, and with crossovers of inside and out. It has the power to make the things around it into enhanced versions of themselves: the big old trees, for example, look especially big and old. It’s a rare example of architecture that gets you looking at things other than itself, which is one reason why the Cartlidges have welcomed hundreds of students over the years to come and see how it’s done.All of this is achieved with austerity. While the Smithsons’ “folly”, as they called it, shares with Beckford’s a desire to escape, it is the opposite of his extravagance, its total mass and volume a tiny fraction of the abbey’s. It was (as they also said) a “camping box”, an exercise in living with very little. It consists of two upstairs rooms and one downstairs, a shower/WC, and a small kitchen counter with, in the Smithsons’ days, only a camping stove for cooking. Thanks to the madness of property values, the asking price of this shelter for the simple life, now Grade II-listed, will be about £800,000. You won’t, though, find anything else like Upper Lawn, for this or any sum.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe ObserverWiltshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She ran the household errands, made sure he remained active and protected him from illnesses.Authorities in Santa Fe revealed on Friday that thecouple had died of natural causes, Hackman from heart disease and Arakawa from a rare viral infection. Arakawa died first, perhaps on 11 February, when she was last seen or heard from. Investigators said in apress conferencethat Hackman, 95, was likely unaware that his wife had died.He would have been alone in the house for days, disoriented and too frail to seek help. His pacemaker last recorded his heartbeat on 18 February, which indicates that he died about a week after his wife.Their decomposing bodies were discovered on 26 February when a maintenance worker called security after no one answered the door. Emergency responders found Arakawa, 65, on the bathroom floor near spilled pills and a medicine bottle. The pills were identified as an unspecified thyroid medication, Tylenol and the high blood pressure medication diltiazem. Her body showed signs of “mummification”, which suggests she had been dead for some time.Zinna, one of their three dogs, was found dead in a crate in a closet. Hackman’s body, wearing slippers, was found in a mudroom near a cane.New Mexico’s chief medical examiner confirmed that Arakawa had succumbed tohantavirus, a rare and often fatal illness contracted from exposure to rodent droppings. Hackman’s Alzheimer’s, combined with his declining physical state, was listed as a contributing factor in his death.“Autopsy examination and a full body postmortem CT examination demonstrated no acute findings of internal or external trauma, and showed severe heart disease including multiple surgical procedures involving the heart, evidence of prior heart attacks, and severe changes of the kidneys due to chronic high blood pressure,” said Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico’s chief medical investigator.Authorities are still waiting for the dog’s necropsy results. During the press conference on Friday, New Mexico state public health veterinarian Erin Phipps said “it is a possibility” that the dog, Zinna, died of dehydration and starvation.The exact details of that final week remain unclear. Friends and neighbors told theNew York Timesabout how the couple had increasingly withdrawn from public life, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic.Arakawa had taken mighty precautions to avoid exposing Hackman to illness. She often wore a mask in public, and surveillance footage from 11 February showed her visiting a Sprouts Farmers Market, a CVS pharmacy and a pet food store in Santa Fe before driving back to their gated community around 5.15pm.After that, she was never seen or heard from again. Investigators believe she stopped checking her emails that evening, and no further communication was recorded, authorities said on Friday.The sheriff’s office found no evidence that anyone had been caring for Hackman besides Arakawa. “There was no food in his stomach, which means he had not eaten recently,” said Jarrell.Hackman’s decline starkly contrasts with the life he had once built. The Oscar-winning actor moved to Santa Fe in the late 1980s after divorcing his first wife, and quickly fell in love with the city’s landscape and artistic community. He had already won an Oscar for his role in The French Connection in 1971 and would later earn another for 1992’s Unforgiven.“I think you can escape anywhere, but I think the beauty of the city – they just loved the area,” Mark Kreusch, a photographer, toldFox Newsafter the couple’s deaths. “Even though he was a bit reclusive, he really loved Santa Fe. It resonated with him.”Arakawa, a classical pianist from Hawaii, met Hackman while working part time at a Los Angeles fitness center. When Hackman forgot his entry card one day, Arakawa refused to let him in. That encounter led to a relationship that bloomed despite their 30-year age difference.“That part never came to mind because they seemed equal in so many ways,” a friend, Susan Contreras, told the New York Times. “She was a personality unto herself.”As time went on, Hackman’s health visibly declined.“Obviously, he was 95, so he was slowing down,” Stuart Ashman, who met Hackman in the late 90s when they served on a committee together at the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, toldFox News. “And after Covid, he was more reclusive, protecting his immune system and everything else.”Two of the couple’s family friends, Daniel and Barbara Lenihan, along with their son Aaron, toldPeoplemagazine that Hackman had become “essentially home-bound” in recent times and had “stopped riding his bike through the neighborhood”.“Betsy tried to keep him kind of active and engaged,” said Aaron, adding that Hackman did puzzles and yoga via Zoom daily. “She was still trying to keep him as active and engaged and healthy as possible.”Daniel and Barbara Lenihan noted that in the “last couple of months”, the late actor “was really slipping there”.Gary Sinise, who worked with Hackman on the 1995 film The Quick and the Dead, made a similar observation.“I know once he retired to New Mexico, he was retired. He did not want to come back and get any awards or, you know, go to any Hollywood events or anything like that. He was done, and he was moving on from that part of his life,” Sinise told Fox News.Their privacy, much-valued in Santa Fe, may ultimately have contributed to their tragic deaths.Explore more on these topicsUS newsGene HackmanNew MexiconewsShareReuse this content"

Responsibility for looking after it passed toEnglish Heritage, which in 2015 split into two, with Historic England responsible for the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, while the English Heritage Trust charity operates its historic properties.“Gradually they were not able to undertake their duty of maintaining [Wingfield Manor] in good order so the public could access it, and ultimately, that’s the duty of the government – EnglishHeritageact as an agent of government,” Joyce said.“In this case, the government took it off the owner because he wasn’t looking after it. Now the government isn’t looking after it. So it’s rather paradoxical, isn’t it?”Joyce said the DHBT first began looking into saving the manor because of the strength of feeling about it.“It’s such a shame,” said Vicky Parsons, 64, a retired teacher walking her dog past the ruins. “It was just such a lovely place … We once even had a barn dance in there; it used to have peacocks.“It’s just a lovely, atmospheric historic place to be in with a lovely view. It’s just got a bit run down.”Jonathan Clitheroe, 54, who runs a walking group for people with learning disabilities, said: “It would be lovely to see it open again to the public, because obviously it’s Mary, Queen of Scots and the associated history.”When DHBT trustees heard the owner, Sam Critchlow, planned to sell the manor they floated the possibility of crowdfunding to buy t themselves, “but that’s kind of pie the sky thinking at the moment”, Joyce said.A spokesperson for English Heritage said: “Wingfield Manor is significant as a late-medieval aristocratic house surviving inEnglandand was influential in the development of such great palaces as Hampton Court Palace.“The two edges of the site are in the guardianship of the state and managed by English Heritage, while the central section remains in private ownership.“With it being originally conceived and built as a whole, this makes it a relatively complicated site on a number of levels, not least in terms of maintenance and conservation.”The spokesperson said that while the organisation and owner had previously discussed options for reuniting the site, “unfortunately we were not able to arrive at a consensus”.They said that since English Heritage became a charity, it has spent more than £100,000 on repairs and maintenance, and is developing a full conservation project for the parts it manages. “However, there are major challenges and costs involved with securing its future.”A spokesperson for Historic England said: “We are concerned about its condition and are working with English Heritage to discuss the steps needed to ensure that it has a sustainable future,” adding that the organisation had not offered to buy the building.Critchlow said he was prepared to sell the manor. “No reasonable offer refused, that’s it. Up to now I haven’t had an offer because it’s not really for sale.”And if he received an offer? “I’d have to think about that one and have a word with my land agent, see what he said, see what it’s worth.”Critchlow said he was not responsible for the poor condition of the building. “English Heritage has a guardianship order on it, anything that happens to it is down to them, end of story.“It’s nothing to do with me. I only own it.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageDerbyshireEnglandEnglish HeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

His every deal is transactional. He exaggerates for effect. He is seduced by money, deluded about his importance and clearly going to leave his sons with a father complex.Yet Willy Loman is no president. The ordinary guy at the centre ofArthur Miller’s 1949 classic might have fallen for a Trumpian myth about the self-made man – crushing competition, fighting for family, privileging the individual – but he is at the losing end of the equation. “The only thing you’ve got in this world is what you can sell,” his old neighbour admonishes, knowing this exhausted salesman has sold his last.It is the exhaustion David Hayman plays best. In Andy Arnold’s no-nonsense touring production for Raw Material and Trafalgar, with its live music and open staging, the actor starts out crumpled and broken. That someone has called him a “little squirt” seems cruel, but you can see why. He is drained of colour in a sepia world, deflated and beat. The optimism that sustained him over long years of pushing product to the buyers of New England has become all empty promise. His old lines no longer resonate. He tries them out anyway.View image in fullscreenWaking up to the lie … Dan Cahill and Michael Wallace in Death of a Salesman.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanSo desolate is he that it is hard to see the charismatic huckster he once was. Behind the hyperbole, we can suppose he used to have at least some charm and skill, but here it is too distant a memory. Was he ever well liked? All that remains is the damage, not only to himself but to the family who have bought into the illusion.In an especially powerful performance by Dan Cahill, his son Biff is waking up to the lie. Well matched in stocky physicality with Michael Wallace as brother Happy, he gives every impression of the sportsman gone to seed, a dropout searching for meaning when he can no longer measure success in trophies and sales targets. He carries a brute, inarticulate anger.Offsetting their angst, Beth Marshall gives a fine, subtle performance as mother Linda, showing her as the rock that holds the family together, balanced, forgiving and wiser than anyone in an economic system that is cruel and dehumanising.Touring until 3 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreGlasgowArthur MillerreviewsShareReuse this content"

But such a creature, recognizable from medieval art to My Little Pony, is one of the less familiar elements of Death of a Unicorn, the debut feature from writer-director Alex Scharfman that premiered at theSXSWfilm festival on Saturday. The film, produced by clout powerhouse A24, traffics in well-trod territory: the prestige eat-the-rich satire with a stacked cast and a beautiful backdrop. So well-trod, in fact, that it’s a relief when the mythical beasts do arrive – if only to reveal dubious CGI and a questionable commitment to the bit.The Accountant 2 review – Ben Affleck’s autistic assassin returns for solid sequelRead moreSilly as it may sound, Scharfman treats this unicorn bit with sincere seriousness, aiming for relevance on the rapacious state of late-stage capitalism satirized in such recent hits as The Menu, Triangle of Sadness, Knives Out: Glass Onion, Parasite and Succession, among others. I know this road, you know this road, even disaffected college student Ridley (Jenna Ortega) knows this road as she and her credulous father Elliot (Paul Rudd), a corporate lawyer, drive into the Canadian Rockies for a retreat with Elliot’s billionaire boss and his family. “Philanthropy is just reputation laundering for the oligarchy,” she retorts when her father tries to extol the largesse of the Leopolds, a clan of pharmaceutical executives loosely based on America’s Sackler family.There is nothing about the Leopold family – terminally ill patriarch Odell (Richard E Grant, bringing a dash of British colonialism to this tale of American capitalism), wife Belinda (Téa Leoni) and feckless son Shep (Will Poulter) – that could surprise or perversely amuse anyone familiar with this genre. Just jobs for the actors to so, boxes of craven behavior and delusions of infallibility to check, mellifluous single notes of callous narcissism to hit. Which all the performers do well, Poulter especially, though that does not leaven a pervading sense of boredom.What is surprising, at least initially, is to see how Scharfman devises the promise of the title, which arrives abruptly in the first few minutes: Elliot, distracted by a tiff with Ridley, accidentally hits a unicorn, rendering it immobile but still alive, and the duo spattered in purple blood. Ridley, a lonely daughter without a mother, forms an instant bond with the creature rendered as a freewheeling acid trip through the cosmos with a touch of its horn. Elliot, a widower hellbent on making some cash to support his daughter, beats the unicorn to death with a tire iron, the first of many tough instances for the squeamish among us.Back at the estate – which is indeed beautiful and managed by put-upon head of staff Griff (Barry’s Anthony Carrigan) – the oligarchs strain to not say what the creature really is, nor squander its potential when it becomes clear that unicorn blood can cure everything from teenage acne to cancer. It’s a mode of writing that grows tiresome quickly. Ortega, the nominal star of the film though remarkably underused, provides the film’s sole grounding point, as Ridley intuits something darker afoot and begins to research unicorn folklore, correctly interpreting the famous medieval unicorn tapestries at the Met’s Cloisters as evidence that such hubris will only invite destruction. (If nothing else, this film will activate some latent art history nerds.)Indeed, these unicorns are not rainbows and butterflies but the all-powerful monsters of yore, capable of jump scares and very bloody impalements, among other gory violence. Scharfman has a solid handling on the trappings of the mega-wealthy, though his interstitials of deluxe service feel derivative of The Menu; less so the mechanics of a creature feature in which the unicorns range from indestructible to wary of doors. Not that the internal logic would matter, if the stakes felt compelling (you know how this will go for the rich, who are of course very bad), or if the monster madness felt inventive (it doesn’t, although the specter of a sharp-toothed horse is a strangely intriguing conceit). Death of a Unicorn clocks in at under two hours, but feels longer, its inherent silliness not matched with the necessary self-awareness, chemistry or fun.What does work, however, is a last-minute play to connect Ridley’s ineffable connection to the slain unicorn with the magical realism of grief, the way we see things, realms, creatures and spirits that may or may not be there in the aftermath of loss. There’s something weird and moving and different in that interpretation, if only for a brief few minutes, that brings a small point to the tedious lunacy of the ultra-rich that comes before. But by large, this beastly feature is exactly what you would expect it to be: fashioning itself different but in fact much like the others. A unicorn, this is not.Death of a Unicorn is showing at the SXSW film festival and will be released in cinemas on 28 MarchExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewA24Paul RuddRichard E GrantSXSWFestivalsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a piece of journalism that captures the spirit and meaning of the republic. Hardboiled but with a soft centre, in the US feature-writing tradition, it might be set inNew York, the most American of places.Indeed, you can still catch staffers at theNew Yorkermagazine having a crack at it, though they’d never admit it. Their copy might include a zigzagging fire escape, or a genie of steam escaping from a sidewalk, or perhaps a yellow cab hopscotching over potholes. But never all these motifs together! That would risk unfavourable comparison with the cherished chroniclers of the city’s past: EB White, AJ Liebling, Dorothy Parker and others.But one veteran who has a good chance of joining the pantheon on journalism’s Mount Rushmore is Gay Talese, 93, who has written for theNew York TimesandEsquireand published 16 books. He remains the man to beat for his classic 1966 piece of reportage rather uninvitingly calledFrank Sinatra Has a Cold.Vanity Fairhailed it as “the greatest literary nonfiction story of the 20th century”. It’s included in a terrific new collection of Talese’s stories about New York,A Town Without Time, a title that echoes Sinatra’s serenading of “the city that never sleeps”.Sinatra has a valet on the payroll as well as a haberdasher and a toupee-wrangler who holds his hair in ‘a tiny satchel’Talese finds Old Blue Eyes pushing 50, extricating himself from a run of ill-advised novelty records and one of his marriages. The writer doesn’t overreach himself, as others might, to explain Sinatra’s quiddity; he does it with some dispatch: Sinatra seemed to be “the embodiment of the fully emancipated male, perhaps the only one in America, the man who can do anything he wants, anything, can do it because he has money, the energy, and no apparent guilt”. Talese’s piece is an eyewitness account from inside the singer’s magnificent entourage. Sinatra has a valet on the payroll as well as a “haberdasher” and a toupee-wrangler who holds his hair in “a tiny satchel”. He is the Sun King, with the rookeries of Versailles replaced by the sunless lounges of Sands casino and Jilly’s saloon in New York.What impressed Talese’s first readers was his discursive storytelling and insider take. For this he was credited by Tom Wolfe with inventing the New Journalism, a first-person narrative technique later adopted by Norman Mailer, Hunter S Thompson, Joan Didion and Wolfe himself, among others. We have this self-referential formula to thank for the columns that fill the papers now, roaring confessionals about throuples and wild swimming. But today’s readers, and particularly other journalists, will be astonished by the access Talese had, not to mention freedom from nixing PRs.Gay Talese: ‘Most journalists are voyeurs. Of course they are’Read moreThis was also true of his encounters with politicians and criminals. There’s a grippingly good piece about the kidnapping of mafia don Joe Bonanno. As his leaderless gang lay low to avoid rival goombahs and the feds, it’s as if Talese is filing his pages from one of their apartments. The famous prison cookery scene inGoodfellas, in which Paul Cicero slices garlic to a thou of an inch, has nothing on Talese’s account of these hideouts redolent of sweat and red-sauce meals. “The men had complained that the spaghetti had a metallic taste – they later learned that the cook had knocked his pistol out of his chest holster into the pot.”You can’t tell where his intrepid research ends and other sources begin, including, perhaps, inspired guesswork. Talese doesn’t show his working: for a New Journalist, this is self-effacing to the point of invisibility. In another story, 1961’s New York Is a City of Things Unnoticed, he puts this civic inattention to rights, noting, among other things, Gotham’s 1,364 messenger boys, 650 doormen in their “heavily festooned” uniforms and the 10 fleapit cinemas that open their doors at 8am. This charming miscellany is the perfect antidote to the listicles of celebrities’ favourite things that clutter newspapers now. It’s a wonderful nonfiction rendering of New York – in fact, a piece of New Journalism to relish at a time when the fourth estate increasingly seems to favour No Journalism instead.A Town Without Time: Gay Talese’s New Yorkby Gay Talese is published by Mariner Books Classics (£20).

Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA) are best friends and roommates in a cheap and cheerful apartment in LA’s Baldwin Village. But then Alyssa’s feckless boyfriend spends the rent money and the women have until the end of the day to raise the cash.With its zingy colour palette and effervescent, unapologetically uneven storytelling, the film has a buoyant, almost cartoonish quality (albeit one laced with lip-smacking, sexually explicit dialogue). What elevates this raucous romp by music video director Lawrence Lamont is the crackling energy between Palmer (Nope) and singer SZA, making her acting debut here. Dreux also gets a love interest, in the shape of a mysterious hunk named Maniac (Patrick Cage).

Her killer was never found and the case remains one of the most pored-over mysteries of the 20th century. Crime novelists including Dorothy L Sayers and PD James have written essays and books about it, and none other than Raymond Chandler, who knew a thing or two about unsolvable wickedness, described it as “the nonpareil of all murder mysteries... I call it the impossible murder because Wallace couldn’t have done it, and neither could anyone else.” Why would anyone murder an apparently nondescript, harmless woman? Anthony Quinn has now turned his attention to the case in his new novel; the result is intensely readable and, appropriately enough, indelibly haunting.Quinn’s masterstroke is not to focus on Wallace himself, a middle-aged insurance company collection agent who lived inLiverpool, but to invent a newcharacter, Detective Inspector Key, who plays chess with Wallace and is drawn into the case as much through his friendship with the accused man as for professional reasons.View image in fullscreen‘Great quality’: Anthony Quinn.Photograph: Mark VesseyThe early chapters of the book stick closely to the historical facts as recorded. On 19 January 1931, Wallace was telephoned at home by a mysterious man – a “Mr Qualtrough” – who suggested that “he had some business to put Wallace’s way” and that he should call on him at home the following night. Wallace, who was off the clock by then, headed to Qualtrough’s given address of 25 Menlove Gardens East, only to find that it did not exist, and returned home where Julia had been brutally murdered in his absence.In real life, Wallace’s guilt seemed to be overwhelming, if largely circumstantial, and he was arrested, tried and initially convicted. Quinn’s Key – an experienced policeman who believes that his colleagues’ rush to solve a high-profile murder meant that they fixed on the wrong man –enables him to offer an alternative perspective to the case. In Quinn’s telling, it is in part thanks to Key’s support that Wallace is acquitted at the court of criminal appeal the month after he was sentenced to death (in life it proved a pyrrhic victory; already in poor health, Wallace remained a target of suspicion and distrust, and died of a persistent kidney infection a couple of years later).There is a Hitchcockian tension as Quinn, through flashbacks, elegantly offers a compelling solution to the killer’s identityWere this simply a true-life tale, a la Kate Summerscale, it would be interesting enough. But Quinn has another intention, and he blends the true-life account with his own storyline, in which Key recounts the sorry tale to a pair of intrigued listeners - playboy and aspirant writer Teddy and a “somewhat plain girl, awkwardly tall” Lydia Tarrant while on a transatlantic cruise15 years later. Teddy is persuaded into writing a screenplay about the events and there is a Hitchcockian tension as Quinn, through flashbacks, elegantly offers a compelling solution to the killer’s identity.The novel is rich in legal and procedural detail – in the acknowledgments, Quinn says that he was inspired to write about the case by a conversation with his barrister friend Thomas Grant, to whom the book is dedicated – but is never dense. Instead, it remains gripping and surprising, right up to the final revelation. It is a mark ofThe Mouthless Dead’s great quality as both a novel and reinvestigation of this bewildering murder that the reader finishes with a sense of satisfaction at apparently having the case closed, even though, in reality, Julia Wallace’s killer will probably remain unknown for ever.The Mouthless Deadby Anthony Quinn is published by Abacus (£20).

Outraged, he writes to Martin himself and Martin writes back.So Dave and Martin begin as pen-pals before becoming real-life pals when Dave starts visiting – and inexplicably relying on Martin’s guidance for matters of love and romance.Madeleine Brettingham’s play about a psychopath-behind-bars and a naive visitor in his thrall is written in a darkly comic vein, and contains the promise of unpicking masculine friendship as well as sending up the groupies who flock around high-profile criminals in the true crime genre.Brettingham, better known for writing TV comedies for Frankie Boyle and Mitchell and Webb among others, treats the subject of mental health and male vulnerability lightly and without enough real bite.It is tightly directed by Wiebke Green but plays out larkily and nothing quite makes sense, even within the logic of the absurdist setting (Kit Hinchliffe’s spare stage design is a wash of psychiatric white).Dave is too gullible, the story flimsy to the point of silliness, the characters too broad-brush. The barbarity of Martin’s crime is only hinted at and his manipulations of Dave are entirely unbelievable. None of it has the complexity that makes this story of masculine crisis, mental health and criminality in any way meaningful.So you are left with the funny moments, of which there are a few, and some performances entertain, too: Alex Mugnaioni, as Martin, is darkly charming and Mephistophelean. Edward Judge, as Martin’s fellow inmate, is the cliche of a smiling, simpleton and Dave, played by Ben Simpson, is so gullible that he seems childlike, but Amelia Donkor is accomplished in switching between multiple characters.“We are all psychopaths deep down,” says Martin. Are we? The play does not go any way to proving that. Where it takes hold is in the dangerous face-offs between Martin and his psychiatrist (Donkor). A mutual hostility builds and bears the potential for a darker and more serious play.Brettingham’s talent for funny writing is clear and the production has all the signs for a sharper, darker play imprisoned within this one.AtArcola theatre, London, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

On the bill was the colourful pastoral L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, in which wit and jollity look set to gain the upper hand before Handel decides to put a dampener on things by insisting on moderation in everything.Faced with a shortage of Italian singers in 1740, the composer went full English, laying aside ideas for Messiah “to please the Town with something of a gayer Turn.” His librettist, James Harris, interwove Milton’s poem L’Allegro (The Happy Man) with the contrasting Il Penseroso (The Melancholy Man), before adding a codicil at the composer’s request in the form of Il Moderato (The Moderate Man). The result, which ends with a paraphrase on Shakespeare’s The Tempest, may feel a bit of a mashup, but it provided Handel with irresistible opportunities for turning vivid imagery into equally vivid music. Remarkably, he knocked the whole thing out in just 14 days.Cohen seized upon the score with relish, his keen dramatic instincts ensuring bright tempi while knowing just when to give his singers room to spread their wings. Arcangelo, their plush sound underpinned by chamber organ and two harpsichords, responded with crisp, spirited playing and noteworthy solo contributions. The incisive, 18-strong choir sang with imposing power.Three singers represented L’Allegro, led by Stuart Jackson whose fluid tenor, expressive diction and theatrical nous really brought Handel’s multihued music to life. Haste Thee, Nymph with its infectious laughter was a hoot, and he brought an egotistical swagger to I’ll to the Well-trod Stage Anon. Paulina Francisco’s vivacious soprano was a ray of sunshine, with Adam Plachetka’s boisterous baritone offering insistent, though slightly dour support.As Il Penseroso, Rachel Nicholls, a late replacement for Louise Alder, faced challenges with muddy diction and the voice not always ideally steady. But the night belonged to Cohen. With Arcangelo lighting up the baroque interior of St George’s Hanover Square, Handel’s own parish church, you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife.TheLondon Handel festival continues in various venues, until 10 AprilExplore more on these topicsClassical musicGeorge Frideric HandelreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a rush to catch his flight home, the journalist and presenter hopped out of a taxi at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport without his bag – containing his passport, wallet and phone.“I felt like I was having two heart attacks at the same time,” the SBS World News host says, remembering his reaction. “Our saving grace was that we had booked the taxi, not hailed it. So we called the hotel, who contacted the taxi company, which radioed the driver, and he came back to the airport to reunite me with my bag.”Enus grew up in Durban, South Africa, moving to Sydney in 1999 to take up a role at SBS. Many of his happiest travel memories are from family trips close to home, though he has also explored everywhere from Europe to India. Here, he shares the good and bad of his travel life, as well as telling us about the trip he didn’t take – but still wishes he had.Away with Rachel Griffiths: ‘I feel more relaxed holidaying in Australia’Read moreMy earliest childhood holiday memory is …As a family we always went camping over the Easter school holidays at Midmar Dam, a couple of hours outside Durban. Some years we camped in tents, in others we splashed out and rented a holiday shack. All pretty modest, but enjoyable family times.Midmar Dam had a tennis court. My best memory was beating my dad for the first time. It took me years, but I was determined – and it didn’t matter one bit that his sports were rugby and wrestling, not tennis.Describe your most memorable travel meal – good, terrible or completely out there.A long time ago on a backpacking trip through India, my partner and I blew a whole week’s budget on the buffet at the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, a very fancy hotel. But I can still remember the joy I got from those amazing flavours and the sheer luxury of the experience.What’s the most relaxing place you’ve ever visited?Probably the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa. For years I would spend every Christmas with friends, hiking to the top of the plateau for five or six nights. The views, earned from a hard day’s slog with a heavy backpack, were spectacular and serene.View image in fullscreenAnton in Paris, wearing running gloves: ‘Much lighter, thinner and more breathable than everyday gloves,’ he says.And the most stressful?The centre of New Delhi. Unrelenting noise, a crush of people that reduced personal space to zero, scam artists at every turn, tireless beggars, masterful pickpockets. But, despite those frustrations, it’s also totally unforgettable.What’s one item you always put in your suitcase?Running gloves. I tend to travel in early European springtime when the temperature can be bracing. Running gloves are much lighter, thinner and more breathable than everyday gloves.And since I pack very lightly for my trips, having a pair of gloves that takes up no space at all, is very functional and doubles up for other occasions, is a big win.What’s your strategy for enduring long-haul flights?Beg for an upgrade to a lie-flat seat. Sadly, this is a fantasy, as I’ve never been game to ask. Failing that, always have a really good book, plush eye mask and, not least, noise-cancelling earphones.What’s your biggest travel regret?Not accompanying my partner to Machu Picchu when it was still possible to do it as a quiet, meditative experience.It must have been 1995. I stayed home because money was tight. My partner, then working as an engineer, got to stay at a modest hotel near the entrance to the site. This afforded him an early and serene experience before the hordes arrived.The hotel has since been taken over by a chain and is no longer affordable. I feel I missed my opportunity to see Machu Picchu without the crush of people.Anton Enus hosts SBS World News, nightly at 6.30pm.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleAway withAustralia holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some years ago, we were on our way from the south of Italy, where my father is from, to Tuscany, where my parents now live. We had a new baby and a car suspension compromised by a boot packed with wheels of cheese and salami. We took a break on the outskirts of a town not far from Naples, where we planned to order a quick primiand be on our way.The pastas came and went, and then more cutlery arrived for one member of our party – my father, unable to resist salt cod, sat bashfully awaiting a sneakily ordered secondi for at least another hour.So this, Dad, is one for you – a quick way of preparing the fish and satisfying the most ardent bacalao lover.Cod and leeks with garlic and chilliAlthough not the primary reason, the pre-salting of the cod also works wonders at removing any fishy taint it may have.Serves 4. Ready in 20 minutes, plus time for salting the codcod loin pieces4, about 120g eachsea saltenough to cover the fishleeks4, largewhite wine50mlgarlic1 clovered chilli1 driedolive oil4 tbspparsleyasmall bunch, roughly choppedSalt the cod well and set it aside in the fridge for a good 3 hours or longer.Trim the leeks, remove the outside layer, cut in half crosswise and wash. Place them in a wide pan that will fit everything comfortably, and add the white wine, a cup of water and a pinch of salt. Cover and simmer over a medium heat for 15 minutes, or slightly less depending on their size, turning them halfway through.In the meantime, quickly rinse the cod under the tap. Add the cod to the pot and keep on the heat for another 5 minutes, pausing to spoon the hot water over the fillets halfway through. Then, when cooked, remove both from the cooking liquid with a slotted spoon to a warm serving plate.Peel the garlic clove and slice length-wise into paper-thin strips. Tear the chilli into several pieces. Heat 4 tbsp of olive oil in a small pan over a medium heat again.Add the garlic slices to the pan. After a minute or so, once the garlic begins to get sticky, add the chilli, and turn the heat down a little. Allow it to achieve a golden-brown colour before you add the parsley and turn off the heat. The parsley will easily fizzle.Spoon the garlic-chilli oil all over the cod and leeks, so that everything gets a look-in, before serving.Roasted Jerusalem artichokes, eggs and anchoviesView image in fullscreen‘Roast for 35 minutes until soft and cooked’: roasted Jerusalem artichokes, eggs and anchovies.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverIf you are scared of whole peppercorns, leave them out and replace them with a pinch of dried chilli or a generous grind of black pepper in the whisked eggs.Serves 4 as a starter. Ready in 45 minutesJerusalem artichokes500ggarlic1 whole small head or half a large onelemon½black peppercorns1 tspsalted anchovy fillets10eggs5olive oil2 tbspsea saltparsleyasmall bunch, roughly choppedScrub the Jerusalem artichokes clean. No need to peel them. Peel and halve the garlic cloves and remove the green shoots, if they have any.Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Lightly oil an earthenware baking dish or ovenproof pot, about 25cm in diameter. Arrange the Jerusalem artichokes cut-side down. Only lightly salt them as you’ll add plenty of salted anchovies later. Top with a little more oil, sprinkle with water and the lemon juice. Roast for 35 minutes until soft and cooked.In your smallest pot, place all the garlic covered with olive oil and the whole peppercorns. Simmer over a low heat for 30 minutes until the cloves are totally soft. Remove from the heat before adding the anchovies. Stir, they’ll quickly melt, then smash altogether with the back of a fork.Check the artichokes to see if the roots are cooked and, if so, remove from the oven. Whisk the eggs together with the garlic and anchovy paste.Cover the hot Jerusalem artichokes with the eggs, turn them over with a wooden spoon and return to the oven for 4 minutes, then remove them and turn them over again. The eggs will finish cooking in the residual heat of the pan. Serve right away with freshly chopped parsley, if you like.Fennel, tomato and creamView image in fullscreen‘My dad used it to dress pasta for the kids’: fennel, tomato and cream.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverI had intended this as a side dish, but my dad found it on the stove and used it to dress pasta for the kids. It was too spicy for them, but he enjoyed it immensely, so it has another use.Serves 4. Ready in 20 minutesgarlic4 clovesfennel2 bulbs, roughly 800golive oil2 tbspsea saltfennel seeds½ tspdried red chilli1, crushedchopped tinned tomatoes4 tbspdouble cream75gPeel the garlic cloves and halve. Trim the fennel at the base, cut off any stalks, cut in half lengthways and then into slices, roughly 1cm thick. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil over a medium-high heat in a wide pan with a lid. Add the garlic and the fennel along with a pinch of salt. Allow to sizzle, stirring intermittently for 4 minutes. Then, once slightly coloured, add the fennel seeds and chilli and fry for a further minute.Add the tomatoes, closely followed by 2 tbsp of water, cover and turn the heat to low. Allow to stew for 15 minutes at the low temperature, by which time the fennel should be much softer. Shake it from time to time and add a splash of water if it ever threatens to catch the bottom of the pan (once the fennel begins to stew, it should release some water of its own).After a further 15 minutes, once yielding, add the cream and cook for a final minute or two. Serve warm.Pear, honey and rye dessertView image in fullscreen‘Conference pears stand up to the cooking really well’: pear, honey and rye dessert.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverI make this with hard conference pears, as they stand up to the cooking really well.Serves 4.

Peel, core and quarter the pears. In a flan dish lined with baking paper, artfully arrange the pears to fit.Grate the lemon zest into a separate bowl and squeeze the juice over the pears. Then drizzle with 1 healthy tbsp of honey and add 3 tbsp of water. Bake until the pears are soft, the water evaporated, and the honey has begun to caramelise – about 30 minutes, but this will depend on your oven.Meanwhile, prepare the batter. Whisk the egg yolks together with the sugar and zest until pale. Then add the flours, brandy and milk and mix again. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white to peaks and add a pinch of salt and whisk again. Then add the remaining honey and whisk some more – the peaks should be thick, aerated and firm. Stir the egg white into the rest of the batter.When the pears are done, remove from the oven and turn the temperature down to 180C/gas mark 4. Cover the pears with the batter and return to the oven for 35 minutes. Turn out on to a plate, dust with icing sugar, and serve hot or cold.Joe Trivelli is co-executive head chef at the River Café, LondonExplore more on these topicsItalian food and drinkThe ObserverFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

Starters £4.25- £5.95, mains £6.95-£12.95, desserts £1.50-£4, beers from £3.95I can’t describe in detail how the upstairs dining room at Sharmilee in Leicester has changed since last I visited, but that’s not down to senility, not yet at least. After all, 26 years is quite a long time. The impressive young woman managing the restaurant today wasn’t even born when I came the first time. Back then, I wrote that it was decorated in calming shades of sandstone and noted a little decorative ironwork. Now the walls are a White Company shade of cream and there’s a mural of an Indian vista. It’s a comfortable, if functional, space. What matters is the extremely good value vegetarian Indian food, which I loved then and adore now.There’s an enormous, volcano-shaped serving of crisp, crunchy chaat, interlaced with dribbles of tamarind and yoghurt, around a warm, flaky samosa. There’s a dark aubergine curry, with dimpled pools of spiced oil across the surface that coat the mouth, and another of new potatoes, in a thick, lightly sour, tomato-based masala. I mop away at all of this with buttery rags of still-warm dosa, which comes with various chutneys and a small metal pot of restorative vegetable and lentil soup. Finishing it all will be impossible, because today I am alone. A lot will come home with me to my family. Lucky family.View image in fullscreen‘I loved vegetarian Indian food then and adore it now’: Kashmiri dum aloo.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverSharmilee was the second restaurant I reviewed when I started writing this column in the spring of 1999 and it’s the only one of the first six that is still trading. The sports café Babe Ruth’s on London’s Finchley Road, the subject of my first review, is long gone and the small children who enjoyed going there for cheesecake may well now have children of their own. For this, my last column for theObserver, I have therefore returned to the very earliest place I could, to be a little reflective and annoyingly wistful.View image in fullscreen‘Still warm’: dosa.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/ObserverAmusingly, at least to me, that second column began with me recounting how I had been lectured by friends that too many restaurant reviews by the national critics were of shiny new London ventures “where the bill for an evening’s fun can easily match the national debt of a small African country”. You will forgive me, I hope, if I don’t now mount a detailed defence of my last quarter century’s travels. My family knows just how much time I have spent on trains. Certainly reviewing Sharmilee, established by the Gosai family in 1973, felt to me back then like a declaration of intent: that good food can be found anywhere and at almost any price. Downstairs is a counter selling Indian savouries and rainbow-coloured sweets or mithai. Upstairs is the restaurant where, in 1999, starters were £2–£3 and mains rarely broke a fiver. Given that starters are now about a fiver, and mains rarely break £8, I don’t think the bill has quite kept pace with food price inflation. Like Bobby’s across the road, it’s a stalwart of Leicester’s Golden Mile, launched to serve the city’s Asian community, but welcoming to so many others.View image in fullscreen‘Crisp and crunchy’: chaat.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverIt is unneeded proof of what a history of immigration to the UK has gifted us. We may not have the deep culinary culture of France, Italy or Spain. Instead, we’ve long had profound culinary breadth, by being open to the food of elsewhere. I have been lucky enough to travel the world by plate and bowl, from Afghanistan to Myanmar, from Bangladesh to Jamaica and all points in between, just by staying here. Long, intense essays, which are a little light on laughs, have been written about the importance of such restaurants as third spaces for these communities. All of this is doubtless true. I have read some of those essays and nodded sagely at the footnotes.View image in fullscreen‘Dimpled pools of spiced oil across the surface’: dark aubergine curry.Photograph: Fabio De PaolaBut it’s never been a zero-sum game in which the profound virtues of small, cheaper places negate the massive pleasures to be taken in the shinier and the more expensive. I love a quality amuse-bouche, me; something topped with a ludicrous dollop of sparkling fish roe. I love a pre-dessert involving, say, sea buckthorn, and a little advanced praline frottage. I love all the esoteric bits in between. The fact is, I have long been a wet-lipped, weak-kneed, unashamed chef groupie, here for all of it. I may have insisted a little defensively over the years that mine is a writing job, not an eating job. That is true. But to do the writing bit, I have had to hang out in all those restaurants, good and bad, weird and wonderful, cheap and less so. I have been blessed with good fortune and I’ve tried not to take that for granted. Underlying this column has been one grand principle: that there must be space in life for fun because otherwise, what’s the point? For me, fun is going to a restaurant. I really am easily pleased.In the online age, which had not begun when I started, it has become obvious that some people find this whole business of people going to bloody restaurants and spending their bloody money on having a bloody nice time, an absolute outrage. How dare they? They have told me so vituperatively, below the line, via email and across social media. You do you, I suppose. The conversations with those readers with similar appetites to mine have, however, been so much more nourishing. You have shared with me your enthusiasms and recommendations, many of which I have followed. You have educated me, made me think and made me laugh, for which huge thanks. I could have done it without you, but it wouldn’t have been anywhere near as enjoyable. And I am, of course, indebted to the 1,300 or so restaurants I have reviewed, even the shockingly bad ones. You can learn a lot from a lousy night out.View image in fullscreen‘Rainbow-coloured’ mithai.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverThat’s not to make light of how tough things are right now for hospitality, but I have always written from the point of view of the diner. Which is what I am today, here at Sharmilee in Leicester. It really is worth your time. They serve great thalis and on weekdays run a buffet for just £10.95 a head. Do note the £3 charge for anyone who wilfully takes more than they can finish, to guard against food waste. Soon I’ll start writing a new restaurant column elsewhere. For now, though, it’s time for me to lay down my knife and fork and call for the bill. Thank you so much for reading. It’s been an honour. But it’s time for me to go.News bitesAmsterdam-based food-delivery business Just Eat is being sold to investment company Prosus for €4.1bn, in a deal which the acquiring company says provides ‘an opportunity to create a European tech champion’. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Just Eat saw its share price surge during the pandemic, but it has been less successful since then. Prosus already has share-holdings in similar food-delivery companies based in Germany, China and India.The London-based restaurant company behind Gymkhana, Sabor and Speedboat Bar, among others, has signed a lease on what will be its first permanent site in New York. Last year, it launched a temporary residency for the Persian-inspired Berenjak brand at an outpost of Soho House in Manhattan. The new venture will occupy the ground and lower ground floors of 1245 Broadway, which is already home to various media companies, including A24 Films. JKS have not said what will be installed on the site, though there is speculation that it may be a second branch of the Indian restaurant Gymkhana, which holds two Michelin stars in London (jksrestaurants.com).Tom Kerridge has announced the line up of hospitality businesses taking part in his Pub in the Park festival at London’s Gunnersbury Park from 30 May to 1 June. They include Henry Harris’s Bouchon Racine, Alan Yau’s Duck and Rice, Indian food pub the Tamil Prince and gastropub the Bull and Last. Music will be supplied by the likes of Soul II Soul, Judge Jules and something called the Jay Rayner Sextet.

Indeed, the basic formula for most examples of these fussy little descriptive texts is “fruit + enthusiastic adjectives”, and reading them, you could be forgiven for thinking that wine’s chief value is as an intoxicating version of the Jelly Belly; that the grape is effectively the Rory Bremner of the fruit world, known above all for its ability to do impressions of other fruits. I don’t really have a problem with that: pinning down the fruit associations is a helpful way of remembering what you liked about a wine. But I am much fonder of words and phrases that go beyond the merely fruity, such as the “sprinkle of spice” I noted down as I tasted Waitrose’s “succulent” red from Mont Ventoux in the southern Rhône.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Tesco Finest Fino, Jerez, Spain NV (£7.50, 37.5cl,Tesco)What do I mean by spice? Most often it’s a reference to freshly milled pepper, which is not merely a poetic flourish: the culprit, in tiny quantities, is a potent compound known as rotundone, which is found in certain grape varieties, notably one of the ingredients in Rhône reds, syrah (aka shiraz), and the Austrian white variety grüner veltliner (which often smells and tastes of, specifically, white pepper). Other spices I routinely find in wine such as vanilla and cinnamon have come from the vanillin found in oak barrels; while ginger is a consistent note in gewurztraminer thanks, apparently, to the presence of the flavour compound citral. But if it’s sometimes gratifying to discover that what you’re tasting is not always a figment of your imagination, I’m loathe to do away with comparisons that have no such scientific underpinning. There is no umami in fino sherry for example. But, in subtly Marmitey, salty-nutty, sourdough-bready wines such as Tesco’s example it certainly feels like it.William Fèvre Chablis, Burgundy, France 2022 (from £27.46,laywheeler.com;bcfw.co.uk)Another increasingly popular wine-tasting term that I love, but which cannot be traced back to some actually existing compound found in the wines it’s used to describe, is “mineral”. Indeed, for a phrase that is generally used to describe something infinitesimally subtle, mineral inspires some surprisingly powerful feelings. Many winemakers argue, with justification, that there is something inherently anti-scientific, or at least scientifically illiterate, about the whole concept of “minerality” in wine and the way it seems to imply that we can taste what are in fact flavourless traces of minerals in wine that have been transmitted directly to the grapes by the soil. As with savoury or umami, however, I find mineral very useful. It’s the best way of gesturing towards a certain kind of sensation that goes beyond fruit, spice, sweet or savoury, and which can be found amid the citrus and the steeliness, raciness and fluency of William Fèvre’s immaculate chardonnay.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
