But how convincing are they?Zoe WilliamsFri 10 Oct 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn The Woman in Cabin 10, Netflix’s new potboiler, Keira Knightley plays a fearless justice warrior, a lone voice of dogged truth in a maelstrom of corruption, and this is not her first foray into such terrain: six years ago she played the whistleblower Katharine Gun inOfficial Secrets, the 2019 film about some pretty dicey US and UK behaviour before the Iraq war.This time round she’s a journalist, though – and not just any old hack, a Guardian journalist. Exhausted and possibly traumatised by a crusading investigation she has just finished about some bad people doing bad things, she accepts a trip on a billionaire’s yacht for a breather, only to discover that billionaires arealso bad. You cannot call that a spoiler, even though it technically is one. You’re reading the Guardian, for Pete’s sake.View image in fullscreenClose in mannerism … Toby Jones as former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ShutterstockJournalists on screen are always idealised, whatever paper they’re from – film amps up the tenacity, intelligence, commitment and, often, cardiovascular fitness of hacks, which is fair enough: that’s its business, to filter out frailty. The only rose-tint that bugs me with print journalism, and this has been bugging me since Almost Famous came out a quarter of a century ago, is that all the drama happens in a situation where interesting things are going down and the key players actively want to include a journalist. It just isn’t true to life. Any time a billionaire, or a rock quartet, or some generals, or a prime minister, actively want to talk to you, it’s to tell you something boring, to keep you busy. But this is a pet peeve; back to Knightley, on her yacht, being told real things, when a murder happens.Box sets and films dealing specifically with the Guardian –Snowden, about the CIA whistleblower and the paper;The Hack, about Nick Davies’s hacking investigation;its role in The Bourne Ultimatum– idealise in bespoke ways. They always make the office look incredibly lively, people constantly leaping up and pointing at each other in a universally understood semaphore of hard news, whereas in real life people are disappointingly quiet and sedentary, often, en masse, remaining so still that the movement-triggered lights go off. Knightley in this film is exquisitely tailored. The stories always get into print incredibly fast, with nobody ever saying: “We won’t be able to say this until it’s been proven in a court of law, which will take roughly 18 months.”Why they used the Guardian in The Hack and Snowden is self-evident, it’s because those things happened here; in The Hack, the performances are so close in mannerism and bearing that you just have to hand it to them, they obviously were trying to work with what they had. David Tennant is spookily likeNick Davies, Toby Jones doesn’t physically resemble former editorAlan Rusbridgerbut almost shapeshifts. All other considerations (please stop saying “redacted”, it’s very distancing; is it too much to ask that the bad guys go down for something?) melt away. In Snowden, I was constantly distracted by the glamour of people being journalists, yet also being in the US, or Hong Kong or Russia. There was no gloss, here!Janine Gibson(now at the Financial Times, played with a Her-Own Girl Friday briskness and vim by Joely Richardson) genuinely was in New York at the time, this shouldn’t push at the boundaries of disbelief-suspension, and yet it does.View image in fullscreenBriskness and vim … Joely Richardson as Guardian journalist Janine Gibson and Nicholas Rowe as the paper’s assistant editor, in SnowdenWhen it’s an entirely fictional character, set in this newspaper that really exists, you have to wonder what the film is trying to say with that. Paddy Considine admitted straight to our faces that he’d had to“to wimp down a little bit” to play Simon Ross, security correspondent, and this is a) because he’s in this with Matt Damon, so has to be his opposite (a wimp); b) because he’s gonna die in a minute, so you mustn’t fall in love with him; and c) because he’s meant to embody the noblest search, for truth without ego.A mixed bag, then, for the newspaper as trope; very moral, not very sexy. There are some neat observational lines that approximate the trade pretty well – when Bourne is on his phone, directing him through Waterloo concourse, telling him to go “east”, he surmises correctly that he won’t know which way that is, adding “your left”. But then there are other lines like, “This isn’t some story in a newspaper, this is real. Do you understand me?”, to which Ross replies, “Yes” – whereas in real life, he would say, “Actually, all the stories in our newspaper are also real,” and then maybe Bourne would reply, “What about that time you told everyone to vote Lib Dem”, in the middle of which the CIA would shoot Ross in the head.View image in fullscreenSearch for truth … Paddy Considine, right, with Colin Stinton in The Bourne Ultimatum.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhy Knightley has to work here, forThe Woman in Cabin 10, could be to convey in shorthand her sense of civic duty, or it could be to give her a dusting of wholemeal flour (oh, there’s that pill of a woman again, who could be drinking champagne but instead is going on about the dead body she just saw), or it could be to give the whole thing aGaslight-y frisson, she’s a journalist that a bad guy could plausibly persuade everyone was totally insane.Sometimes the paper pops up on its own as just a thing people are reading – in Wallace and Gromit, in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – and I want to say it’s there to signify: “This is the baseline reading matter of the everyman.” Maybe in Wallace and Gromit it is, but I think in fact it’s a global-audience thing, they can’t use the Times because an American audience will go: “The New York is missing and the font is wrong.”In Killing Me Softly (2002) the Guardian is everywhere; its journalist interviewing one of the other characters, another character masquerading as a hack, all of them constantly reading it. It’s widely thought of asthe worst film of all time. It’s just a coincidence; no actual Guardian journalists were harmed in the making of that film.Explore more on these topicsFilmKeira KnightleyThe GuardianTelevisionNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One giant leap for Sam: for everyone else, not so muchFri 10 Oct 2025 10.55 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareTake a look at Sam Altman. I mean, actually do it. Go to Google images, where you can find countless photos of the OpenAI boss smiling in a kind of wan genius way, the humble lost puppy ofSilicon Valley. But I urge you to simply cover the bottom half of his face in any of these pictures, and you will immediately clock that Sam has the sad-psycho eyes of the lost woman’s boyfriend who the police have asked to front the missing person’s appeal. Please come home, Sheila – we’re all worried sick and we just want you back.If that joke seems off-colour, or crass, or some kind of manipulative stretch – please, don’t worry. I’m using the OpenAI gold standard of giving-a-toss, where the unwilling subjects of any generated content have to formally, time-consumingly and bureaucratically optoutof being used/abused/exploited any way anyone likes. I haven’t heard from Sam, so my assumption is that he’s fine with me saying that he knows exactly where Sheila is because he put her there. He is, after all, fast emerging as precisely the type to appear alongside the phrase “in plain sight”.The past fortnight for Sam has involved the release of AI video generator Sora 2 – a staggering upgrade on the Sora of barely 10 months ago – and its instant descent into a sludge of stolen copyrighted goods. We also saw the announcement of a further web of circular bargains between OpenAI and chip firms likeNvidiaandAMDthat brings OpenAI’s frenzieddeal tally to over $1tnthis year alone. That absolutely does not mean that in addition to enabling you to watch videos of meticulously created charactersget pixel-puppetedby aggressively bigoted and talentless losers, OpenAI will also enable you to lose your home in a financial crash if the bubble bursts badly.And look, no offence to Sora’s “creators”. I often walk through art galleries and realise the stuff on the walls would be so much better if I simply stole it and drew hilarious penises on it or whatever, and that they wouldn’t have made it publicly viewable if they didn’t want that. Furthermore, no tech titans have a cultural life, so they can’t possibly imagine what could be so creatively valuable you wouldn’t want a robot to desecrate it for cash. If you’ve seen Sam’s frequent reading recommendations, you’ll know they’re literally the “business philosophy” section of a second-tier airport bookshop. Mainly this week, he wanted us to know Sora 2 was all cool and fun. “It is way less strange to watch a feed full of memes of yourself than I thought it would be,”Sam posted reassuringly. So everything’s fine! Although, I guess it helps if you’re one of the most powerful people in the world and making untold billions off this stuff, not just getting revenge-porned in a Byzantium simulation because somehow historical prompts seem toconfuse the“guardrails”.It’s time to prepare for AI personhood | Jacy Reese AnthisRead moreI’ve seen it said that OpenAI’s motto should be “better to beg forgiveness than ask permission”, but that cosies it preposterously. Its actual motto seems to be “we’ll do what we want and you’ll let us, bitch”. Consider Altman’s recent political journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,”Sam warned in 2016, “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” He seems to have got over this in time to attendDonald Trump’s second inauguration, presumably because – if we have to extend his artless and predictable analogy – he’s now one of the industrialists welcome in the chancellery to carve up the spoils. “Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president,” Sam simpered to Trump at a recent White House dinner for tech titans. “It’s a very refreshing change.” Inevitably, the Trump administration has refused to bring forward any AI regulation at all.Meanwhile, please remember something Sam and his ironicidal maniacs said earlier this year, when it was suggested that the ChineseAI chatbot DeepSeekmight have beentrained on some of OpenAI’s work. “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” his firm’s anguished statement ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Hilariously, it seemed that the last entity on earth with the power to fight AI theft was OpenAI.It was left to Hollywood talent agencies this week to extract some kind of momentary pause from Altman, whoposted some flannelabout trying to direct, if not hard cash, then certainly some “new kind of engagement” at those he openly called “rightsholders”. Many of us remember a time – about 15 minutes ago – when rightsholders meantthe people who hold the rights. I mean, the clue’s right there in the word. But Sam is post-rights. The question is: if he’s post creative rights, can we honestly believe he isn’t effectively post other kinds of rights?OpenAI wants what all loving platforms ultimately want: its users never to have to leave its confines. It’s clearly positioning towards being seen as the new default homepage of the web, as Meta once did.

It could be the US. It could beGreta Thunberg.Over the past month, Thiel has hosted a series of four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a “small-o orthodox Christian”, believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people inSilicon Valleyand the US.Peter Thiel’s off-the-record antichrist lectures reveal more about him than ArmageddonRead more“A basic definition of the antichrist: some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil,” Thiel said, kicking off his first lecture. “What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.”TimelinePeter Thiel's lectures on the antichrist, summarizedShowPeter Thiel divided his four lectures on the antichrist under loose banners of subject matter. After listening to recordings of his off-the-record talks, the Guardian has summarized each lecture by synthesizing them into a format easier to follow than his meandering musings. The timeline below consists of the title of each lecture, the question Thiel is attempting to answer within it, and the conclusion he comes to, accompanied by representative quotes.15 September 2025Lecture 1: “Knowledge shall be increased”Question:What is the antichrist’s relationship to Armageddon?Answer:The antichrist, whom Thiel believes is some sort of evil tyrant, will come to power by constantly talking about the existential threats of technology and science to the world. They will use this prognostication to gain some type of unifying global power and force the complete stagnation of technological and scientific progress which he says is already stagnant.Quote:“The antichrist comes to power by talking constantly about Armageddon, about rumours of wars and scaring you into giving him control over science and technology,\" said Thiel.\"We have sort of an answer in late modernity, which is that the antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon non-stop. Matthew 24:6: ‘You shall hear of wars and rumours of wars.’ If you think of it not in the timelessly eternal but in the one-time world historical way, it's sequence. The rumors come after the wars or they're escalations from the wars. In some ways, we got the answer already in Los Alamos,” he said.22 September 2025Lecture 2: “Empire and the antichrist’s relation to government”Question:What kinds of government are antichrist-like in nature?Quote:“Last time I talked about Daniel 12:4 – ’knowledge shall be increased in the end times.’ Tonight I will explore the other half of this prophecy, that ‘many shall run to and fro,’ which I read, much like Francis Bacon did, as a prophecy about globalization, empire, and the dangers of a one-world state,” Thiel said.Answer:There are several forms of either anti-science, pro-science, anti-Christian or pro-Christian governments represented in literature that show the various forms that an antichrist-like government can take. These dynamics change throughout modern history. He zeros in on four books: Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’s Watchmen, and Eiichiro Oda’s manga One Piece, which embody various stances in favor of or against science and Christianity.Quote:“You can at least identify the antichrist in literature. I'm going to try to illustrate this change in history through these four books,” said Thiel.29 September 2025Lecture 3: “How one person can take over the world and the velocity at which that person has to move to do so”Question:How can the antichrist, a single mortal person, achieve world domination?Answer:They can do it if they’re young – or – get rich young, since “money has this remarkable velocity”.Quote:“Tonight, I’ll continue this investigation by asking the seemingly narrow question of the velocity of the antichrist. What I mean by that is: the Bible says that one man will take over the entire world. He only has one lifetime to do that. How on earth can he achieve that?”6 October 2025Lecture 4: “The new Rome”Question:Where today might we find the antichrist's new Roman Empire?Answer:According to the Bible, the Roman Empire served as thekatechon, or the place that will restrain an antichrist figure, and provided law and order, which in turn prevented or delayed the coming of the apocalypse. Thiel says the modern-day katechon is likely in America. One possibility is San Francisco, partly because of its distance from Washington DC, which would make it harder for there to be a fusion of too many powers like the federal government and the technology industry. Ironically, though, he says America is also likely the place with the most markings of a future one-world order.Quote:\"It's just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one-world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one-world state.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest ofSilicon Valley took a rightward turnwithDonald Trump’s second term as president. He’s had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, iscreditedwith catapultingJD Vanceinto the office of vice-president, and isbankrollingRepublicans’ 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund.Palantir, which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the National Health Service in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology.“I’m a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I’m worried about the antichrist,” Thiel said during his third lecture.The meandering gospel of PeterThiel’s talks, which began on 15 September and ended on Monday, were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinksBill Gatesis “a very, very awful person”.Tickets for the series went for $200, selling out within hours. Attenders were told that the lectures were strictly off the record and that they were forbidden from taking photos, videos or audio recordings. At least one person who took notes and published them had his ticketrevoked by a post on X.Guardian reporters did not attend the lectures or agree to the off-the-record stipulation. Recordings were provided by an attender who gave them on the condition of anonymity.When reached for comment, Thiel’s spokesperson, Jeremiah Hall, did not dispute the veracity of the material given to the Guardian. Hall did correct a piece of the Guardian’s transcription and clarified an argument made by Thiel about Jews and the antichrist.The Silicon Valley heavyweight drew on a wide swath of religious thinkers, including the French-American theorist René Girard, whom Thiel knew at Stanford University, and the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, whose work he said helped create the core of his own beliefs. He credited the English Catholic theologian John Henry Newman as the inspiration for his four-part series, saying: “Newman did four, so I’m doing four. I’m happy about it.”The venture capitalist has hosted and attended events and lectured on the topic for decades, going back to the 1990s,according to a report by Wired. In recent months, he has spoken to theologians andpodcasters aboutthe antichrist both publicly and in private. His beliefs are diffuse, meandering and often confusing, but one tenet he’s steadfastly maintained over the years is that the unification of the world under one global state is essentially identical to the antichrist. In his talks, he uses the term “antichrist” almost interchangeably with “one-world state”.“One world or not, in a sense is the same as the question antichrist or Armageddon. So in one sense, it’s completely the same question,” he said.His version of history, and its potential end, posits technology as a central driver of societal change and takes a Christianity-focused, Eurocentric view that declines to engage much with other religious movements or parts of the world.On the day of Thiel’s final lecture inSan Francisco, as the mostly young and mostly male crowd lined up to get in, a group of about 20 protesters stood out front holding anti-Palantir and anti-Ice signs that said things such as “Predatory tech”, “We do not profit from people who profit from misery” and “Not today Satan”.View image in fullscreenPeople protesting outside a Peter Thiel event in San Francisco.Photograph: Dara Kerr/The GuardianA trio of self-described “satanists” dressed in black costumes with goth makeup walked up and down the line of attenders carrying a goblet of red liquid with a small plastic replica of a bone. “Will you bring our dark lordPeter Thielthis baby’s blood?” they asked. Then they performed what they called a “dark ritual”, dancing slowly in a circle to Mozart’s Requiem in D minor, which ended with them writhing on the city sidewalk, and yelling: “Take us to your personal hell … Thank you for being our dark lord.”What do Thiel’s lectures say?The Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors.He believes the Armageddon will be ushered in by an antichrist-type figure who cultivates a fear of existential threats such as climate change, AI and nuclear war to amass inordinate power. The idea is this figure will convince people to do everything they can to avoid something like a third world war, including accepting a one-world order charged with protecting everyone from the apocalypse that implements a complete restriction of technological progress. In his mind, this is already happening. Thiel said that international financial bodies, which make it more difficult for people to shelter their wealth in tax havens, are one sign the antichrist may be amassing power and hastening Armageddon, saying: “It’s become quite difficult to hide one’s money.”It’s because theantichrist talks about Armageddon nonstop. We’re all scared to death that we’re sleepwalking into Armageddon. And then because we knowworld war three will be an unjust war, that pushes us. We’re going hard towards peace at any price.What I worry about in that sort of situation is you don’t think too hard about the details of the peace and it becomes much more likely that you get an unjust peace. This is, by the way, the slogan of theantichrist: 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It’s peace and safety, sort of the unjust peace.Let me conclude on this choice ofantichrist or Armageddon. And again, in some ways the stagnation and the existential risks are complementary, not contradictory. The existential risk pushes us towards stagnation and distracts us from it.How does Thiel think Armageddon will happen?Thiel rarely gives a definitive answer about who exactly the antichrist might be or how Armageddon might come about – a central point across his lectures is that nothing is written in stone or inevitable – but he does give the contours of what a global conflict that could lead to Armageddon might look like.There’s all sorts of different ways,oneworld ornone,antichrist or Armageddon, that I’m tempted to think about this, and here’s one sort of application. In terms of how does one think about the current geopolitical moment. How does one think about the nature of the conflict between the United States and China, thewest and China. You don’t really know how it’s going to go. You can ask, are we heading forworld war three orcold war two? And if you sort of reflect on the history of the twoworldwars and the firstcoldwar. But first, if there ever was an unjust war,world war one is an unjust war. If there ever was a just war,world war two was probably a just war, with certain caveats. Worldwar one is really insane. Worldwar two was about as justified as a war can be. I think we can say that if you had an all-outworld war three or war between nuclear powers involving nuclear weapons, it would simply be an unjust war. A total catastrophe, possibly literalArmageddon, the end of the world. Soworld war three will be an unjust war. But then if you have acoldwar, you have to distinguish between – can you have a just peace and an unjust peace?Somehow, it’s very strange how the firstcoldwar from ‘49 to ‘89 ended. But it ended with roughly what I think of as a just peace, where somehow you didn’t have a nuclear war. And somehow our side, which I think was more the good side, basically won. And you ended up not with a perfect peace, but more or less a just peace. And so if we haveworld war three, it will be an unjust war. If we havecold war two, maybe it can end in a just peace or an unjust peace. Reflecting on this material and thinking about it, it’s obviously not written in stone and there’s a lot of different ways this stuff can go. But I keep thinking that, if you had to put odds on it, aren’t the odds that we’re trending towards the fourth quadrant this time. The fourth possibility thatcold war two will end an unjust peace.Thiel devotes a large section of his second lecture to a quote from the Book of Daniel that involves a prophecy about the end times, which he equates to modern advances in technology and globalization.Let’s go on to ‘many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased.’ It means science progressing, technology improving, globalization, people traveling around the world. Of course in some sense, I think these things … I’m not sure they’re completely inevitable, but there is some direction to it. Where there’s a linear progression of knowledge and something like globalization that happens. But of course, the details matter a lot. Knowledge increasing, science progressing, technology improving can be a very good thing. No disease, death, protect people from natural disasters. Then, of course, we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, bioweapons, etc. And similarly, globalization is … you have trade in goods and services. There’s certain ways to escape from tyrannical governments. And of course there is danger in theone-world state of theantichrist.As the antichrist is synonymous with a one-world state for Thiel, he also believes that international bodies including the United Nations and the international criminal court (ICC) hasten the coming of Armageddon. Throughout his lectures, he warns of what he sees as the danger of these bodies and the harms they have already caused. In the following quotes, he’s lamenting the actions of the ICC:They’ve started arresting more and more people.Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was arrested this year. They had arrest warrants out for Netanyahu and Gallant.When I met Netanyahu early in 2024, about a year and a half ago, we talked about what he’s doing in Gaza, and the one-liner he had was: ‘I can’t just Dresdenize Gaza – you can’t just firebomb them.’ So it’s like, come on, ‘I’m less of a war criminal than Winston Churchill. Why am I in so much trouble?’During a Q&A portion of one of the lectures, an attender asked specifically about Thiel’s thoughts on abolishing the ICC, saying: “If we get rid of the ICC or other organizations that exist to bring, in theory, justice, how can we right crimes? Should we not have prosecuted Nazi criminals?” Thiel responded:I think there was certainly a lot of different perspectives on what should be done with the Nuremberg trials. It was sort of the US that pushed for the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union just wanted to have show trials. I think Churchill just wanted summary executions of 50,000 top Nazis without a trial. And I don’t like the Soviet approach, but I wonder if the Churchill one would have actually been healthier than the American one.Who could be Thiel’s antichrist?Thiel believes that the antichrist would be a single evil tyrant. He mentions several figures he believes are particularly dangerous and, while he never definitively says who the antichrist is, he makes suggestions about how some people could be antichrist-type figures.A basic definition of theantichrist. Some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil. What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation ofantichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the endtimes.Specifically, he suggests the antichrist would be a “luddite who wants to stop all science”, referencing Thunberg, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Marc Andreessen.My thesis is that in the 17th, 18th century, theantichrist would have been a DrStrangelove, a scientist who did all this sort of evil crazy science. In the 21st century, theantichrist is aluddite who wants to stop all science. It’s someone like Greta orEliezer.It’s not Andreessen, by the way. I thinkAndreessen is not theantichrist. Because you know, theantichrist is popular. I’m trying to say some good things aboutAndreessen here, come on.During a question-and-answer session, Thiel was asked to respond to a quote from fellow investor Andreessen – a name he audibly bristled at. He said Andreessen was engaged in hyperbole and “gobbledygook propaganda” when it comes to the promises of AI.Where should I start? I’m tempted to be triggered in some nasty ad hominem argument, but I can’t resist so I’ll do that. I don’t know, this is just pure Silicon Valley gobbledygook propaganda. I wouldn’t give someone who said things like that too much money to invest.Later, he returns to these “legionnaires of the antichrist”.In late modernity, where science has become scary and apocalyptic, and the legionnaires of theantichrist like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostromand Greta Thunberg argue for world government to stop science, theantichrist has somehow become anti-science.Gates, the philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, is high on the list of people Thiel does not like.One of my friends was telling me that I should not pass up on the opportunity to tell those people in San Francisco that Bill Gates is theantichrist. I will concede that he is certainly a DrJekyll and MrHyde-type character. The public MrRogers, the neighborhood character. I saw the MrHyde version about a year ago, where it was just a nonstop, Tourette’s, yelling swear words, almost incomprehensible what was going on.Ultimately, Thiel concedes Gates cannot be the antichrist, bringing up the topic more than once:He’s not a political leader, he’s not broadly popular, and again, perhaps to Gates’s credit, he’s still stuck in the 18th century alongside people like Richard Dawkins who believe that science and atheism are compatible.I don’t think even someone like Bill Gates, who I think is a very, very awful person, is remotely able to be theantichrist.Pope Benedict XVI is someone who Thiel admired because he was one of the few popes who referenced the possibility of an antichrist:Thetl;dr: my belief is that Benedict literally thought that the historic falling away from the church during his papacy was a sign of the end times.However, Thiel said Benedict failed at spreading the message of the antichrist because he “was not very courageous”.I often like to say libertarianism and marijuana are both gateway drugs to alt-right, other ideas. The danger of the red pill is you move on the black pill. And somehow Benedict overdosed on red pills.Musk, a longtime friend and ally of Thiel, came up during one of the lectures in the context of theGiving Pledge, a pact Gates founded in 2010 where billionaires pledged to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. Here is Thiel recapping the conversation:If I had to pick a little bit on Elon – and I’m going to pick on him because I think of him as one of the smarter, more thoughtful people …This is a conversation I had with him a few months ago, and it was like: ‘I want you to unsign that silly Giving Pledge you signed back in 2012, where you promised to give away half your money. You have, like, $400bn. Yes, you gave $200mto MrTrump, but $200bn– if you’re not careful – is going to leftwing non-profits that will be chosen by Bill Gates.’And then I – one step ahead – rethought it and said: ‘You don’t think about this much because you don’t expect to die anytime soon, but you’re 54 years old. I looked up the actuarial tables: at 54, you have a 0.7% chance of dying in the next year. And 0.7% of $200bnis $1.4bn– about seven times what you gave to Trump. So MrGates is effectively expecting $1.4bnfrom you in the next year.’And to his credit, Elon was, well,pretty fluid on it. He said: ‘Actually, I think the odds of me dying are higher than 70 basis points.’ A shocking explosion of self-awareness. Then: ‘What am I supposed to do – give it to my children? I certainly can’t give it to my trans daughter; that would be bad. You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.’When asked about the slain far-right commentatorCharlie Kirk’s memorial in reference to the role of Christianity in American politics, Thiel initially demurred saying it was “above his pay grade”. When further prompted, he described what he saw as two versions of Christianity on display at the event:I think, um – what to say – I was thinking about, you know, I had the chart: thekatechon pagan Christianity versus theeschaton – the Christianity of Constantine versus that of Mother Teresa. We had an illustration of that with Kirk’s wife saying that sheforgavethe murderers because that’s what Christ would do. This was an incredibly saintly form of Christianity. And then, you know, President Trump – I don’t know, I forget the language exactly – but, you know, Charlie was into forgiving, being nice to his enemies. He doesn’t believe in being nice to his enemies; he wants to hurt his enemies. And that’s sort of the pagan Christian view. And the problem – the naive view – is: there has to be something somewhere in between, right? But how do you concretize that? What’s the thing that’s in between Mother Teresa and Constantine – between forgiving the murderer and delighting in punishing your enemies?Perhaps, I don’t know, perhaps the in-between thing I thought was that maybe Trump and Elon were able to forgive each other.Thiel argues that, in order for the antichrist to be able to pull off the Armageddon in one lifetime, they need to be young today – he points to 33 as an auspicious number. In these quotes, he draws parallels to powerful figures who died at the age of 33, including Jesus, Buddha and some literary characters:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theantichrist has to somehow outdo this. I don’t want to be way too literal on the 33 number – I’d rather stress theantichrist will be a youthful conqueror; maybe in our gerontocracy, 66 is the new 33. But something like these numbers do occur almost mystically through a number of different contexts.Buddha begins his travels at age 30 and experiences Nirvana, ego death, at age 33. But I had to be ecumenical and say something nice about Islam. One idea that’s pretty cool is, when you’re reborn into your afterlife, you’re born into your 33-year-old self. Your 33-year-old self is your best self.Livy’s – the Roman historian’s 33rd chapter of the 33rd book – it announces this 33-year-old conqueror. It’s like Alexander at the peak of his power. Or even in Tolkien, the hobbits have a coming-of-age ceremony at 33. That’s how old Frodo is when he inherits the ring.By the same token, people who are older cannot be Thiel’s antichrist. Here Thiel gives some examples:Trajan, a Romanemperor, wept when he reached the Persian Gulf in AD115 at the age of 65. He’s too old to beat Alexander the Great’s achievements in India. He died two years later. Hitler is 50 by the timeworld war two starts – he mimetically loses to Napoleon, who’s only 30 when he became first consul of the French Republic. That goes on to the same problem for a seventysomething Xi Jinping. Racist, sexist, nationalist, maybe the second coming of Hitler. But not even the second coming of Genghis Khan. Past the sell-by date.He frequently oscillates between talking about the antichrist and the katechon – a term very briefly used in the Bible that refers to something holding back the coming of the antichrist. In one example, he describes a post-cold war shift to embracing neoliberalism and bureaucracy as an example of antichrist-like government.Of course, you have all these examples where it’s one toggle switch fromkatechon to the antichristic thing. Claudius to Nero, Charlemagne to Napoleon, anti-communism after the Berlin Wall comes down, it gets replaced by neoliberalism. Which is, you know, the Bush 41newworld order, which you can think of as anti-communism where there’s no communists left. Or Christian democracy, which is sort of the European form of thekatechontic, transnational anti-communism. Once the communists are gone, it sort of decays into the Brussels bureaucracy. All kinds of different riffs one could do with this. Or to go even further, if something is not powerful enough to potentially become theantichrist, it probably isn’t that good as akatechon.In his last lecture, Thiel also responds during the Q&A portion to a question about potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they are antichrist or katechon. When asked aboutAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Thiel says that he worries about there being a “woke American pope”– Pope Leo XIV – and a “woke American president”, creating a “Caesar-Papist fusion”. He goes on to talk about Ocasio-Cortez in relation to Thunberg:One of the ways these things always get reported is, I denounce Greta as anantichrist. And I want to be very clear: Greta is, I mean she’s maybe sort of a type or a shadow of anantichrist of a sort that would be tempting. But I don’t want to flatter her too much. So with Greta, you shouldn’t take her as theantichrist for sure. With AOC, you can choose whether or not you want to believe this disclaimer that I just gave.What does he say about Trump and politics?Thiel is asked several times about Trump and how he fits into his imagination of what form Armageddon might take. In one instance, he is asked whether Trump’s opposition to global governance makes Thiel feel any relief about the hastening of a one-world order.At the very best, you shouldn’t have even the most fanatical Trump supporter. You know, no politician, not even Reagan, will solve all problems for all time. Maybe we both were sort of delusional about Reagan in the 80s. There was some moment in the 1980s when we thought that Reagan had permanently solved the deepest problems in the world for all time. And that’s too high a bar. That was too high a bar for Reagan. That’s an unfairly high bar you’re giving to MrTrump. You’re just trying to make a subtle anti-Trump argument and I’m not going to let you do that.One of Thiel’s longstanding political affiliations has been anti-communism, and in his fourth lecture, he suggests that opposition to communism following the second world war is something that held back the antichrist. At other times, he is critical of post-cold war presidents and government order.I always sort of wonder what functions as thekatechon in the world after 1945. This is Schmitt’s 1947 diary. ‘I believe in thekatechons, for me the only possible way to understand Christian history and find it meaningful. Thekatechon needs to named for every epoch for the past 1948 years.’ The way I interpret this is that sotto voce, Schmitt is saying he has no idea what thekatechon is. And maybe, the New Dealers are running the whole planet. Then of course, 1949 the Soviets get the bomb, and my sort of provisional answer is that thekatechon for 40 years, from’49 to’89, is anti-communism. Which is in some ways is somewhat violent, not purely Christianbut very, very powerful.I’ve argued that thekatechon, or something like this, is necessary but not sufficient. And I want to finish by stressing where one goes wrong with it. If we forget its essential role, which is to restrain theantichrist, theantichrist might even present himself or itself or herself as thekatechon, or hijack thekatechon. This is almost a memetic version. A similarity between theantichrist and thekatechon, they’re both sort of political figures. Thekatechon is tied in with empire and politics. If theantichrist is going to take over the world, you need something very powerful to stop it.Thiel also opines on modern-day Russia and offers his views on Vladimir Putin:In some sense, there are perhaps two candidates for the successors to Rome. For all sorts of reasons, I don’t particularly like the Russian theories of all these ways where you have Putin describing himself as thekatechon and the last Christian leader in the world. It’s hard to look into someone’s heart. I always suspect he’s more of a KGB agent than a Christian. And then, of course, to be akatechon, you have to be strong enough to possibly become theantichrist. And Russia is not nearly powerful enough to take over the world. It cannot simply be thekatechon or the new Rome.Thiel also comments on the relation between Jewish people and the antichrist. He argued against medieval theologians’ idea that the antichrist would be Jewish.There’s probably a lot I can say about the relation of the Jews to theantichrist. The philo-semitic rebuttal, just to get it on the table, is that the Jews in the Bible are described as a stubborn and stiff-necked people. Which is mostly a bug, but maybe in the end times, it is a feature because – this is sort of the way [Vladimir]Solovyov phrased it – that they’re too stubborn to accept Christ, they will be too stubborn to be charmed by theantichrist. And so, they become the center of resistance to theantichrist in theSolovyov narrative.In response, Thiel’s spokesperson said: “Peter was arguing against medieval, antisemitic theologians who suggested that the antichrist will be Jewish,” citing Solovyov.Thiel’s final lecture dedicates a large portion of its time to talking about empires and what role the US government plays in holding back or advancing the antichrist. He is characteristically noncommittal, describing the country as having characteristics of a one-world government and also being outside it:Now this is not meant to be an anti-British or anti-American lecture. It’s just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate forkatechon andantichrist, ground zero of theone-world state, ground zero of the resistance to theone-world state. The US world police is the one truly sovereign country. They always say the president is the mayor of the US and the dictator of the world. International law gets defined by the US. That’s sort ofNato’s prime, to see in some ways, coordination of the world’s intelligence agencies.Then of course, the global financial architecture we discussed is not really run by shadowy international organizations, it’s basically American. And perhaps always a very important feature is the reservecurrency status of the dollar, where it’s sort of the backstop for all the money. The petrodollar regime, there’s sort of crazy ways you have trade deficits, current account deficits, but then in all these ways, the money gets recycled into the US.Then of course, there’s sort of a way where from a certain perspective, the US is also the place that’s the most outside the world state. In many ways, it’s probably one of the best tax havens, at least if you’re not a US citizen. And then there are all these ways the US is a kind of ideological superpower. Christian, ultra-Christian, anti-Christian sense, woke Protestant liberation theology, social gospel, social justice. City on a hill, this institution serves as a beacon of light for other nations and honor.At another point in his final lecture, he seems to suggest that when things are codified or formalized they tend to lose their power or ability to operate. He selects Guantánamo Bay detention camp as an example:By 2005 in Guantánamo, you were way better off as a Muslim terrorist in Guantánamo, the liberal lawyers had taken it over by 2005, than as a suspected cop killer in Manhattan. In Manhattan if you were a suspected cop killer back in 2005, you know, there was some informal process they had for dealing with you. Guantánamo, it was formalized. Initially, they did some bad things and then very quickly, they weren’t able to do anything, any more. And this is again a sort of revelatory unraveling process.During the Q&A section, Peter Robinson talks about John Henry Newman’s description of the antichrist promising people things like civil liberty and equality. “He offers you baits to tempt you,” Robinson said, quoting Newman. Then, Robinson says to Thiel: “The antichrist is a really cool, glamorous hip operator. Is that Zohran Mamdani?” Thiel doesn’t directly answer the question, but does offer his take on the young, progressive mayoral candidate:I don’t thinkMamdani can be president because he’s not a natural-born citizen. So he’s capped out at mayor. I also don’t think he’s really promised to reduce my taxes.In his final lecture, Thiel was asked to comment on various potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they’d be more of an antichrist figure or a katechon.Thiel says he is “very pro-JD Vance”. But he has some concerns about his allegiance to the pope.“The place that I would worry about is that he’s too close to thepope. And so we have all these reports of fights between him and thepope. I hope there are a lot more. It’s the Caesar-Papist fusion that I always worry about. By the way, I’ve given him this feedback over time. And you know with the sort of … I don’t like his popeism, but there’s sort of a way if I steel manned it. It’s always, you have to think about whether if you say you’re doing something good, whether it’s a command, a standard or a limit, or whether in philosophical language, is it necessary or sufficient. And so when JD Vance said that he was praying for Pope Francis’s health, it’s as a command, as a necessary thing.OK, that’s … if you’re a lot more if you’re a good Catholic. But what I hope it really means is that it’s sufficient, and that he’s setting a good example for conservative Catholics like you, Peter, who listen to thepope too much. And perhaps all you have to do to be a really good Catholic is pray for thepope. You don’t really need to listen to him on anything else. And if that’s what JD Vance is doing, that’s really good. I’m worried about the Caesar-Papist fusion.Thiel also spoke about San Francisco and his views on Gavin Newsom, the California governor.​​I would say that if we go to thekatechontic thing and the US is that, tech and politics are radically separate, Silicon Valley is really, really separate from DC in an extreme way. If these things could be fused,… someone like that perhaps represents a way to do that. That’s the part where, if there was a way to … you know, he was the governor of California, he was the mayor of San Francisco. In a way, San Francisco is more important than California. The world city is more important than just this sort of silly province called California. And if you could fuse Washington and San Francisco, that’s a very dangerous thing. It’s kind of, it’s sort of in a way the lastprecedent where such a fusion of sorts happened. I think it was FDR with New York and DC. So that’s the piece that would be tricky.And you know, by the way, these things have been very, very unfused historically. Back in 2008, one of my liberal friends was trying to get 75 tech-type people to endorse Obama and they got like 68, 69 and thought maybe they could get me. I told them, man, if there are only six or seven, you want to be in the minority. It’s more valuable to be one of the seven than one of the 68. And then his counterpoint was, well, you know, we need to all get on board with Obama because he’s going to win and then we’ll have an influence. And then, the really crazy … and then in a way, Obama … if you think about the primary in 2008, the Democratic primary, Obama had the students, the minorities, the young people. Hillary was the finance world in New York, the unions. Hollywood was sort of split 50/50 between Obama and Hillary.But Silicon Valley was the one sector of the economy that went all in for Obama. But it didn’t work at all. And then if you fast forward to the Obama cabinet, there were zero people from Silicon Valley. There was no representation at all. And so, even Obama was very far from anything resembling a fusion. And then the question is whether Newsom will be like that or different.Why is he fixated on stagnation?Chief among Thiel’s concerns about how quickly the world is hurtling toward an Armageddon is what he describes as a stagnation or slowing down of technological and scientific progress. He attributes part of that to the use of science and technology – once largely seen as a force for good, in his telling – for harm.The creation of the gun and the machine gun “wounded our faith in science and tech”, he said. “And then the atom bomb somehow blew it up entirely. And in some sense in 1945, science and tech became apocalyptic. It left us with a question.” This fear of tech is what the antichrist will seize on to gain power, he says.During the Q&A portion of the first lecture, Thiel is asked about howartificial intelligence(AI) – the much-hyped darling of his fellow Silicon Valley investors – fits into this larger narrative of technological stagnation. Thiel said AI was a symptom of the larger tech stagnation and that people including Andreessen needed to boost its promises because there’s nothing else going on.If we’re going to not have this sort of crazed corporate utopianism versus effective altruist luddism, luddite thing. If you try to have some more nuanced version of this, you try to quantify it. How big is the AI revolution? How much is it going to add to GDP? Add to living standards? Things like that. My placeholder is, it’s looking probably on roughly the scale of the internet from 1990 to the late 90s. Maybe it can add 1% a year to GDP. There are big error bars around that. And I think the internet was quite significant. People talked about the internet in very similar terms in 1999. That’s another way where it sounds like roughly the right scale.The place where it’s very different, where it feels both true of the internet and maybe it’s true of AI, maybe a place where I would agree with Andreessen. The negative part of the statement is: ‘But for AI, nothing else is going on.’ He’s not talking about going to Mars, so it doesn’t sound like he believes Elon’s about to go to Mars. I think there’s a negative part, if AI was not happening, wow, we are really stuck. Things are really stagnant. And maybe that’s why people have to be so excited about this one specific vector of technological progress. Because outside of that, to a first approximation, things are totally, totally stagnant. Maybe even the internet has run out of steam but for AI. So that’s another framing. Now, the thing that strikes me is very different from’99, if I had to give a difference, again I’m too anchored and rooted in the late 90s. But the late 90s, it was broadly optimistic. And there were a lot of people who thought about it just like Andreessen does. Nobody feels that personally. You can’t start a dotcom company from your basement in Sacramento. You can’t start an AI company, you have to do it in San Francisco. You have to do it in Silicon Valley. It has to be at an enormous scale. Most things aren’t big enough. And then there are layers and layers and layers where it feels incredibly non-inclusive. Maybe people just updated from the internet because maybe the internet turned out to have a lot of winner-take-all dynamics.In one of the lectures, Thiel plays a video of a60 Minutes segmentabout a German law that cracks down on online hate speech. He’s trying to show an example of where tech regulation goes too far – hence giving power to the antichrist:This kind of video is ridiculous but, of course, indicative of this larger trend. There is this crazy judge in Brazil who is arresting everybody. Australia has more or less ended internet anonymity with age verification required for all social media. The UK is arresting 30 people a day for offensive speech. I’m sort of always in favor of maximal free speech, but my one concrete test is whether I can talk about theantichrist. If I can’t, that’s too restrictive.In his fourth lecture, he also suggests that his beliefs about the end of the world informed his own work in tech at companies such as PayPal:I was working at PayPal at the time trying to build the technology to evade these policies of the world’s powers and principalities. So it was natural to think about theantichrist in the context of the world of financial architecture. I’llstill defend PayPal as more good than bad.References to pop culture and literatureThiel peppered his lectures with references to pop culture, calling out YouTube influencers likeMrBeastand throwing out terms like “libtard” – a rightwing slur for people with progressive political views. Sometimes these references pertained to the antichrist; at other times, Thiel was just giving his views on politics, modern society and Silicon Valley, like here:TheSuccessionTV show about the Murdochs is unthinkably retro in Silicon Valley. Only a 20th-century media company could be handed off to someone’s children. If you think about the tech companies, I don’t know, would anybody name a company after themselves? The last tech person who did this was, I think, Dell in the mid-1980s. This is like if you’re a retro Republican from Texas. It is so unthinkable to do this.In his second lecture, Thiel also explores the idea of the antichrist through four works of literature – Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore’s Watchmen graphic novel and Eiichiro Oda’s manga series One Piece. Thiel states that identifying the antichrist is possibly “hard to do in the present and always sort of controversial”, but that “you at least identify the antichrist in literature”.He describes the plot of Watchmen, a 1986 graphic novel involving superheroes grappling with moral questions about humanity against the backdrop of impending nuclear war:The antihero Ozymandias, theantichrist-type figure, is sort of an early-modern person. He believes this will be a timeless and eternal solution – eternal world peace. Moore is sort of a late-modern. In early modernity, you have ideal solutions, ‘perfect’ solutions to calculus. In late modernity, things are sort of probabilistic. And at some point, he asks DrManhattan whether the world government is going to last. And he says that ‘nothing lasts forever.’ So you embrace theantichrist and it still doesn’t work.Thiel later finds biblical meaning in the manga One Piece, discussing how he believes it represents a future where an antichrist-like one-world government has repressed science. He believes that the hero, Monkey D Luffy, represents a Christlike figure.In One Piece, you are set in a fantasy world, again sort of an alternate earth, but it’s 800 years into the reign of thisone-world state. Which, as the story unfolds, gradually gets darker and darker. You sort of realize, in my interpretation, who runs the world and it’s something like theantichrist. There’s Luffy, a pirate who wears a red straw hat, sort of like Christ’s crown of thorns. And then towards the end of the story, transforms into a figure who resembles Christ in Revelation.Thiel, along with a researcher and writer at Thiel Capital, explored these ideas at greater length in an essay for the religious journalFirst Thingsearlier this month.Do Thiel’s arguments make sense?In a word, no. For one representative example, look to his muddled, contradictory summation of who the antichrist may be:There is a way to think that theantichrist represents the end of philosophy – culmination, termination. He is the individual who gets rid of all individuals; the philosopher who ends all philosophers; the Caesar who ends all rulers; the person who understands all secrets. How is this possible in late modernity, where we don’t believe a philosopher-king, tyrantor ruler can come to power?Explore more on these topicsUS newsPeter ThielSilicon ValleySan FranciscoReligionJD VanceElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A group that had arrived earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there.”Welcome to our own Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, another real-time demonstration of the fact every satirical absurdity described in Catch-22 has become, yeah, pretty much totally plausible. The nation is now fully hostage to bad actors and phoney rage. And as ever football must act as a key amplifier of all this, a public echo chamber for the anxieties of what we must, out of a sense of duty, still call the real world.Gary Neville says he took down union flag being ‘used in a negative fashion’Read moreIt took eight minutes for the crowd at Wembley on Thursday night to demonstrate that they have finally moved on from chanting Keir Starmer is a wanker. Instead they chantedGary Nevilleis a wanker. Two days earlier Joey Barton, who exists in the public consciousness solely because of football, published a video to his 2.7 million X followers in which he said he would punch a disabled person in a wheelchair if they suggested a union flag should not be flown over a building site.To be fair, this does seem an unlikely scenario. Perhaps there could be an interim stage where the two of them try to have a chat about it first. But no. Joey would rather cut straight to the real business of violently vetting disabled people for patriotism, out there furiously overturning wheelchairs like Indiana Jones weaving through the souk looking for Marion inside a laundry basket. Sometimes, you just get the heroes you need.Here are two pretty sound ideas. First, if anyone ever asks you to take a flag seriously, they’re immediately to be distrusted. A flag is just some colours. A flag has no inherent fixed meaning. Flags are groupthink, a suspension of independent thought. The civil rights movement wasn’t defined by a flag. The fall of the Berlin Wall didn’t have a flag. The peace movement didn’t have a flag, just flowers, hair and chauvinistic sex.And second, there are few things more un-English than brandishing the flag like a weapon. For this reason alone I am proud of Gary Neville forspeaking up this week about flags, for trying to make the point that it is un-patriotically un-English to go around insisting on English patriotism.View image in fullscreenThe reaction to Gary Neville’s video message about flags and patriotism shows he was on to something, even if he did not articulate it well.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianNeville is of course an easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy. He can be a doofus and a chop, thehammer of Qatarwho will also work for the state broadcaster at Qatar’s propaganda World Cup, a Lineker-level degree of cognitive dissonance.And yes, in his speech Neville rambled widely, exposing the contradictions of pretty much every fixed position you may choose to take right now. He should also have condemned acts of Islamic terrorism, something people on the left often seem unable to do. He shouldn’t have focused solely on “angry white middle-aged men” in the wake of a double murder at a synagogue.It is also a ducking of what he seemed to want to say. Which was to talk specifically aboutNigel Farage, who does need to be challenged openly, who is a deeply cynical threat to the public discourse, a campy and theatrical nihilist posing as a Real Person, who uses fear and division to manipulate people into voting for him.But I am still proud of Neville for speaking up. It is good that a sportsperson is addressing this, an actual issue in his hometown, and doing so with genuine feeling, unafraid of the violent reaction that will follow. This is his parish. He is an angry middle-aged white man, and has spent a lot of time around flags. For all his easily gotcha-contradictions Neville feels it, is well- intentioned and is worth a million Farages. And while it is easy to say Stick To Sport VAR-boy, the reality is this has everything to do with sport, a place that has been aggressively flag-draped and militarised, where even a radio interview in midweek with the deeply mild Chris Woakes ended with the phrase “Thank you for your service” as though Woakes has been out there killing the Taliban for the last 10 years.Above all the reaction to Neville’s video message proved he was on to something. Before long a Traitor Scum banner had appeared outside Old Trafford. On the internet Neville was pilloried over old video clips of him not singing God Save the Queen, a genuine moment of salt and pepper flag-pledge madness.The Daily Telegraph has had a permanent hate-erection for the last four days, and can only be a small step away from giving away Gary Neville wicker dolls for your children to burn with its weekend editions. Rumour has it four leader writers have already been hospitalised by rage.Most tellingly the same paper published a response from Farage that suggested Neville should be fired by his private sector employer for not wanting to fly a flag, an idea so absurd, so unpatriotic, so wilfully ignorant, it seems impossible nobody inside this mighty engine of English free speech didn’t feel uneasy about projecting it as a serious political message.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hesaid the messaging is getting dangerous. He said Brexit has had a terrible effect (see: the steel industry). He said we shouldn’t be pulled right and left. He said we must stop promoting abusive hate speech. He said he had ordered one of his building sites to take down a union flag because they had never previously flown one, and, like, it’s also just a building site.The best thing he said was that “the union flag being used in a negative fashion is not right”, something that is, intentionally or not, very George Orwell in its understanding of patriotism. Orwell gets marched around the place in a headlock all the time these days, dragged randomly into every debate. But he knew about symbols and flags and about Englishness and its values.View image in fullscreenFlags are prevalent at sporting events these days, but George Orwell said that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging was a key ingredient of English resilience and character.Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty ImagesIn The Lion and the Unicorn, a love letter in support of the war against German fascism, he writes that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging is a key ingredient of English resilience and character. He speaks with pride and affection of the fact “the working man’s heart does not leap when he sees a union jack”, that “the patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious”, and thatEnglandis above all a compromise, “a strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency”.Neville is groping for something similar, the fact the best kind of freedom is the freedom not to give two hoots about a square of fabric, or browbeating notions of patriotism. Pointedly, Orwell also preaches vigilance, the need to let your heritage grow and change, that England “has to be true to herself”, and that “she is not being true to herself while the refugees who have come to our shores are penned up in concentration camps”.Famously Orwell also hated sport because of its weaponising of nationalism, its glorification of physical victory, and has been proved right in this now more than ever before. England football didn’t traditionally have flags in it right through to the 1980s, when they would occasionally appear daubed with National Front slogans. Right now the last two hosts of the men’s World Cup, and also the next one, are involved in a bloody conflict of some kind. Orwell was half right. Sport is now war plus the shooting.There are two last things worth saying. Neville may be correct in his sense of a more nuanced idea of traditional English patriotism. But he is also out of time. The hive mind, shout-politics, algorithm life have trampled over lots of things. The idea that the best kind of Englishness can stay separate from this seems out of date. Britain itself is more than ever like a strange, small, damp archipelago marooned at the jumping-off point between the continents.On the other hand, it doesn’t mean this is fixed either. In Catch-22, The Great Loyalty Oath Crusade comes to an end when the largely silent Major de Coverley walks into the mess hall, scowls at the absurdity of flag-hugging and anthem-singing, and says three words: “Give Everybody Eat.” At which point the whole thing evaporates in its own absurdity. Someone has to say something, and keep saying it, however garbled or easily shot down. Neville may not be our George Orwell. But he is, for all his contradictions, a very English type of patriot.Explore more on these topicsGary NevilleEnglandJoey BartonNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I’ve included great affordable pieces (and some tips that don’t require any money at all), as well as accessories, shoes, styling ideas, nifty hacks and a few grooming products.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’d recommend sticking as close to the classics as possible. What’s “in” shifts a little from season to season, but there’s a knack to choosing pieces high on the fashion agenda that also have staying power for the next time autumn rolls around. I’m talking rugby jerseys, Chelsea boots, XL overcoats and dress watches – pieces that will make your wardrobe look current but are classic enough to stand the test of time. My rule of thumb with all new purchases: if you see something you like, consider how it will fit with the rest of your wardrobe.The best men’s wardrobe updates for autumn and winter 2025Indigo denimIndigo jeans really come into their own in the shoulder season. Not only do they go best with autumnal colours (burgundy, forest green, burnt orange), but they’re usually made of a heavy, rigid denim that feels tough enough to deal with the worst of the weather.The high street always has a strong selection of indigo denim, so there’s no need to spend a fortune on a quality pair. The best place to start is Marks & Spencer, which has seriously upped its menswear game this year. If you want to dial up the fashion stakes, follow the lead of Jeremy Allen White and get a matching jacket.View image in fullscreenRelaxed straight-fit jeans£35 at M&SFor more, read the Filter’s guide to thebest men’s jeans for every occasionSave with high-street cashmereIf there’s one thing I’d recommend for every winter wardrobe, it’s a cashmere jumper. It’s warm, but also naturally breathable, so it regulates your temperature. This means stepping off a hot bus or tube on to a cold street won’t cause you to start pouring with sweat.Specialist cashmere brands (Oyuna, Begg x Co, John Smedley, Kiltane) offer premium knitwear but at a price. Fortunately, high-street stores are more accessible – and the quality can be decent, too. In my view, Uniqlo is the best of the lot.View image in fullscreenPure cashmere crew neck£89.90 at UniqloChecked flannels are back (again)Everyone from Ami to Hermès and Zegna showed checks in their autumn/winter 2025 shows, so consider this your cue to unpack your plaids. If this is your first foray into checks, I’d recommend a cosy flannel shirt like the one from Dickies. If you want something more affordable, go secondhand – try thrift storesBeyond RetroandRokit.View image in fullscreenAndorra Hendersonville shirt£75 at Urban OutfittersView image in fullscreenChecked flannel Charlie shirt£100 at Octobre EditionsA relaxed black suit for party seasonView image in fullscreenAustin Butler, a current champion of the understated pinstripe.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Warner BrothersA relaxed black suit is a great investment – and surprisingly useful for winter. Dress it up with a shirt and tie for party season (think 90s Armani with avintage tieand louche flowy shirt) or with a printed T-shirt and baseball cap for a smart-casual weekend, where you need something nicer than jeans. You can style the blazer and trousers separately, too.A 70s-inspired double-breasted cut is big this year – see Saint Laurent, Amiri and Paul Smith – alongside understated pinstripes championed on the red carpet by Austin Butler and A$AP Rocky.View image in fullscreenRelaxed suit in black metallic pinstripeJacket£85 at AsosTrousers£35 at AsosCheck out thebest suits for men under £400Dip a toe into technical outerwearGorpcore kings, this is your moment.

Idris Elba has embraced the shirt-blouse look at premieres and events.Photograph: Kate Green/Getty Images for NetflixAKA the shirt-blouse hybrid, a nod to menswear’s adoption of traditionally feminine fabrics and shapes this season (Josh O’Connor and Idris Elba have given this look a spin on the red carpet). Think satin shirts and neckties, which I’d leave loose rather than actually tying. Zara has a great selection to choose from, all around the £50 mark.View image in fullscreenSatin polo shirt£49.99 at ZaraView image in fullscreenFlowing shirt with bow scarf£49.99 at ZaraA great jeans alternativeHeavy-duty work trousers are a solid buy for autumn. They’re usually made from a premium-looking heavyweight cotton to create a strong line that feels smart, especially with a pair of loafers. Always go for brands with workwear in their DNA, such as Dickies, Ben Davis and Carhartt.View image in fullscreenCotton trousers£80 at CarharrtV goodV-necksMost men reading this probably have a couple of V-necks stuffed away in a drawer somewhere, and this season the neckline has nudged the crew neck off the top spot. If you don’t already have one, begin with a simple lightweight jumper – this khaki option by Cos is a strong choice.View image in fullscreenMerinoV-neck jumper£65 at CosTrousers with a twistWide-leg trousers have been popular for a while, but the voluminous silhouette has been revamped this year. Designers such as Lemaire and Studio Nicholson are releasing trousers with slightly twisted side seams, giving a curved shape that’s somewhere between a wide and barrel leg. Whether you go for jeans or tailored trousers, it’s a subtle detail that shows yougetmenswear without shouting it.View image in fullscreenTwisted baggy wide jeans£75 at Asos£100 at Levi’sSupersize your overcoatA big overcoat is a staple that almost always looks good, whatever you throw it over. Make sure you choose one that’s the right length – the hem should sit somewhere below the knee without trailing on the ground – and go for a slightly roomy design that leaves space for layers and looks more expensive, too.View image in fullscreenSingle-breasted wool-blend coat£135 at WeekdayLayer with a thin roll-neckAutumn/winter is all about layering. A roll-neck is a useful tool to make your summer shirts work double duty – as long as they’re long sleeved, that is.

In this price range, you’re looking at either pleather or, better, vintage. Avoid fitted biker jackets à la Danny Zuko in Grease, and instead go for a slightly oversized silhouette, which would look best with relaxed menswear staples. Check out Nicholas Hoult (above) for styling tips.View image in fullscreenFaux leather Harrington jacket£70 at AsosView image in fullscreenVintage leather jacket£60 at Beyond RetroRingerT-shirtFor those unfamiliar, this is a T-shirt with a contrast collar-and-sleeve hem.

This season, the rugby top (a heavyweight long sleeve that usually has a three-button collar and some sort of stripe) is No 1. Lots of brands have jumped on the trend, from Barbour to Reiss, John Lewis and M&S, but my top pick is from Percival. Otherwise, if you’re a rugby fan, just wear your team strip outside match days.View image in fullscreenStriped rugby polo shirt£119 at PercivalMocha mousse is made for autumnThe trending Pantone colours don’t always translate to fashion (did someone say peach fuzz?), but this year’s a good one, especially for autumn: mocha mousse. Brown is almost always flattering, and it looks great with other earthy tones, like burgundy and dark green. Or, you could fully commit and go head to toe à la Burberry autumn/winter 2025.View image in fullscreenLamb’s wool sweater£120 at A Day’s MarchView image in fullscreenDylan trousers£65 at 33mmCosy corduroyView image in fullscreenIn a cord: get corduroy guidance from Robert Redford’s look in All the President’s Men.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAvoid geography teacher-chic (anything chunky with extra-wide ribs), and instead go for a fine corduroy. Think Robert Redford in All the President’s Men. Whether you’re going for trousers or a shirt, choose a modern, relaxed fit that looks comfy. Anything overly fitted is a hard no.View image in fullscreenWyck cord shirt£76 at Beaufort & BlakeView image in fullscreenLoose-fit corduroy trousers£85 at Arket£85 at AsosLean into nu-westernA western look has been on the rise ever since Taylor Swift and Beyoncé doubled down on country, but this season’s interpretation is more low-key. Go for subtle elements – stitched details (Kiko Kostadinov), a low-key cow print (Prada), suede (Hermès), or a boot-cut-fit trouser (Louis Vuitton) – which nod to the mood without looking like you’re cosplaying John Wayne.View image in fullscreenCo-ord denim shirt£45 at AsosBe a gentGentlemancore is in, thanks to elegant menswear everywhere from Saint Laurent to Dior. Consider this your cue to get a tie. All the bestties are secondhand; you can get looks from the necktie’s heyday – the 70s and 80s – from top brands such as Dior, Ralph Lauren or Armani for less than most new options. Silk is best: try to find one with some interest, be it a pin-dot, stripe or paisley.View image in fullscreenVintage silk blend tie£55 at RokitCoats with metal hardwareMetal hardware detailing looks expensive when done right. Usually, it’s best on leather accessories, but a wave of brands are upgrading their coats with it – whether it’s firefighter-style clasps (Wales Bonner), D-rings (Barbour) or metal poppers and snaps, like H&M’s design below.View image in fullscreenWaxed cotton jacket£64.99 at H&MParty as a Hedi BoyIf you’ve not heard of theHedi Boyaesthetic, it’s one to get clued up on in the run-up to party season. Based on designer Hedi Slimane’s signature rock’n’roll aesthetic, it could be a sexy shirt worn beneath a blazer with slim trousers, or a leather jacket with black jeans and pointy-toed boots. Either way, it’s a look to give your party season rotation added spice. Phix is a great starting point.View image in fullscreenBlack lace embroidery shirt£99 at PhixView image in fullscreenSkinny fit jeans£129 at All Saints£150 at LibertyTry an XL toteView image in fullscreenHold all? Jannik Sinner has joined the XL crowd when it comes to bags.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty ImagesWhat do Jacob Elordi, A$AP Rocky and Jannik Sinner all have in common? They’ve all stepped out carrying an XL bag. While theirs were by Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton and Gucci respectively, you can jump on the trend with something much more budget friendly. A large bag made from leather is a stretch for less than £150, so look for a substantial canvas or utility-inspired fabric instead – I like these by Klättermusen and Cos.View image in fullscreen£55 at ArketView image in fullscreenOversized tote bag£95 at CosBuy a baby dress watchView image in fullscreenTick-tock star: Joseph Quinn wearing a super-slim watch at a premiere for The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Brendon Thorne/Getty ImagesUnderstated and elegant, as they were originally designed to sit neatly beneath a shirt cuff, the dress watch is a subtle classic.

What I can do, though, is give you tips on the best styles to go for: because it’s likely to be slippy, steer clear of leather soles and instead stick to rubber. When it comes to the upper, real leather is the best because it holds its quality for longer and you can get it repaired. Chelsea boots are the most versatile. Depending on how they’re styled, they can be smart or casual, classic or modern. The elasticated sides mean you can slip them on and go.View image in fullscreenDax leather Chelsea boots£70 at SchuhView image in fullscreenLeather pull-on Chelsea boots£89 at M&STry a college scarfFrom letterman designs by Loewe and Aries to Paul Smith’s collection with Manchester United, college-style scarves are everywhere.

Lodge and Justin Hayward were new to the band, Lodge playing bass and Hayward guitar, who had been booked into a well-paid series of cabaret shows in northern England. The Moodies were playing a revue-style show, with bits of R&B punctuated by comedy numbers, dressed in blue suits. They’d had a big hit a couple of years earlier with Go Now, but by 1966 they looked and sounded passé.After the show, Hayward told me a few years ago, a man came to the dressing room to see the band. “Normally they would say something like, ‘Oh, you’re great.’ But he said, ‘I just thought I’d tell you, you’re the worst fucking band I’ve seen in my life. You’re rubbish. And somebody’s got to tell you.’” Hayward and singer Ray Thomas were reduced to tears, and later on, as their van headed south from the venue, drummer Graeme Edge piped up from the back: “He’s right, that bloke. We’re crap.”Moody Blues singer and bassist John Lodge dies aged 82Read moreThe next day, the Moodies pledged to drop the suits, the act and the past, and reinvent themselves. In doing so they became British rock’s most underrated band: pioneers of a style, consistent platinum sellers across multiple decades in the US and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees who played prestige venues on both sides of the Atlantic until their career ended in 2018 with a Vegas residency.And John Lodge, who has died aged 82, was central to that enduring success, as bassist, singer and songwriter. With Days of Future Passed in 1967, the Moody Blues didn’t so much embrace the new psychedelic fashions as assimilate them and catapult past them in one movement: a year earlier they had been a cabaret band, and now they were creating the elements that would form a new genre: prog rock.Not that the Moodies were terribly prone to 20-minute epics with multiple time signatures. They wrote what were at heart pop songs, but wrapped them in gorgeous arrangements, with lush harmonies and rich instrumentation (the defining sound in Nights in White Satin, their “legacy” song, isn’t guitar: it’s flute). They understood the capabilities of the studio in a way few of their contemporaries did. And in a band packed with capable songwriters, Lodge more than held his own.Ride My See-Saw, from 1968’s In Search of the Lost Chord, showcased Lodge’s talents: you can hear the R&B band in the rhythm section and Hayward’s choppy guitar, but the vocals are layered so deeply the song becomes almost hymnal. It’s very much of its time, but also entirely fantastic – the sound of pop evolving in the moment, in the studio. (There’s a live version from 1969’s that’s blistering: this band really could rock.)Lodge had chosen to be bassist because he loved pianists. As he toldIt’s Psychedelic Babymagazine in 2023: “When I was at school, there was a cafe right by my school with a Rock-Ola jukebox. Every lunchtime, I used to leave and instead of having lunch at school, I’d go to the cafe, drink a cup of coffee and put a coin in the slot and play whatever my favorite record was. I realised that what I really liked about rock’n’roll is the left hand on the piano, the driving force. I realised that the artists I was listening to were people like Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and I realised the left hand side, the boogie piano, was the heart of rock’n’roll … There were no basses in Birmingham at the time. When the bass finally came to town it appeared in a music shop called Jack Woodross. Every Saturday morning, all the young musicians would go there and play their guitars and learn something new from someone else. And one day, I went there and I saw ‘Direct from the USA, Sunburst Precision Bass’ in the window. So I went home and said to my father, could you help me buy this bass? And we went back to the store, I bought it, and it’s been with me ever since.”By 1972, the Moodies were genuinely huge, and encouraged by their propensity for vague but faintly profound-sounding lyrics, fans took to thinking they possessed rather more wisdom than they actually did, a situation that provoked what became Lodge’s defining song for the Moodies, I’m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band). The track, which reached No 12 in the US as a single, saw Lodge disavowing any kind of knowledge: “And if you want the wind of change / To blow about you / And you’re the only other person to know, don’t tell me / I’m just a singer in a rock and roll band.”The 1973 tour to support Seventh Sojourn saw the Moody Blues living a lifestyle more commonly associated with Led Zeppelin. As Lodge recalled in the liner notes for a reissue of the album: “We had our own Boeing 707 aircraft which was decked out with a sitting room and a fireplace. There were two bedrooms, some 20 individual TVs, soundsystems everywhere and we had our own butler and our name written on the outside of the plane. I had a very empty feeling knowing that things had got this excessive.”The following year, the band went on hiatus for four years. It was probably a good job, because as Andy Childs wrote in ZigZag in January 1976, just as punk was stirring, “They make records which sell to middle-class trendy young couples living in the stockbroker belt who know and care as much as about rock music as Batman.”When they returned in 1978, with the Octave album, it wasn’t exactly as the Clash, but the album’s opener, Lodge’s Steppin’ in a Slide Zone, showed that the Moody Blues could adapt to changing time without losing their essential Moodiness – the layered vocals and unusual arrangements were still in place, but Steppin’ in a Slide Zone had an aridity that still sounds very 1978, clean and taut and tense. Just in case anyone was scared off, Lodge’s Survival from that same album had orchestras to go with the synths, and the gentleness that was one of the group’s great qualities.Yet although they were the great survivors and great successes of psychedelia’s golden age – arguably only Paul McCartney had more success for longer – the Moody Blues never occupied a central cultural space. But they did occupy their own space, and that was more than enough for the vast numbers of people who never stopped loving them.And Lodge never took music lightly. He always saw in it the potential for something more than entertainment. In that 2023 interview, he was asked what “psychedelic” meant to him, and answered perfectly: “I hope your mind will explore the music and take you wherever the music takes you. It’s not a case of just singing along, it’s listening. It can be one note and that transports you somewhere. And I think if you can conjure up experiences and stories in your mind where the music takes you, to me that’s psychedelic. You have to listen to things, not just hear them.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockPsychedeliacommentShareReuse this content"

The US president is expected to visit Israel on Monday to address the Knesset in Jerusalem.Netanyahu also threatened a return to violence. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt the sword resting on its neck and it is still on its neck … Hamas will be disarmed andGazawill be demilitarised … If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better. And if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” he said.Officials from Hamas appeared equally sceptical. Basel Naim, a senior leader of the militant group, said in an interview with Sky News on Friday that it would not disarm, contrary to the Trump plan.“Our weapons are going to be handed over only to the hands of a Palestinian state, and our fighters can be integrated into the Palestinian national army,” Naim said.In a joint statement issued later on Friday evening, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestinerejected any “foreign guardianship” over Gaza, stressing that its governance was a purely internal Palestinian matter.But they expressed their readiness to benefit from Arab and international participation in the reconstruction of the territory.Officials have said Israeli forces will remain in control of 53% of Gaza in the initial withdrawal phase before the hostages are released, and Israeli bombing in Gaza had intensified on Friday morning up until the ceasefire began. However, Israeli troops were seen pulling back from areas such as the eastern part of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, and the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.With the announcement that a ceasefire had begun, thousands of Palestinians began heading north towards Gaza City, the territory’s biggest urban area, mostly on foot. Nearly half a million Palestinians living in north Gaza were displaced by Israel’s military advance into Gaza City, and many were eager to return to their homes.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather their belongings and make their way back towards their homes after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Khan Younis.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersFootage showed huge crowds on the coastal road, which had been closed to returnees just days prior.“On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,” Asmaa Zuheir said. “At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.”In the south of Gaza, thousands left the crowded coastal strip of al-Mawasi to travel inland to the partly ruined city of Khan Younis. Ahmed al-Brim pushed a bicycle loaded with wood through row after row of buildings crumpled by bombardment and streets strewn with rubble. “We went to our area – it was exterminated,” he said. “We don’t know where we will go after that.“View image in fullscreenIt is the first time in six months that fighting has not raged in the strip, and residents are keen to check on their neighbourhoods.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersAnother Khan Younis resident, Muhannad al-Shawaf, said it used to take him three minutes to reach a nearby street from his house. Now, it took over an hour as he picked his way through piles of debris. “The destruction is huge and indescribable – indescribable,” he said. “It is almost all in ruins and not suitable for living in.”The conflict has destroyed or damaged more than 90% of homes in Gaza and almost all infrastructure. Almost everyone in the territory has been displaced many times. Malnutrition is rife across all of Gaza, and there is famine in parts, according to UN-backed food experts.The ceasefire is meant to be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza through all five crossings from Israel, though it is unclear how and when this will happen. Israeli army radio said Israel would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day. Aid agencies say such quantities are grossly insufficient.Leading international agencies, including the UN Palestinian refugee relief agency, Unrwa, said they had yet to receive details on what role they would be able to play during the ceasefire. Unrwa, which has been banned from operating in Israel, urged Israeli authorities to allow it to take 6,000 trucks’ worth of aid into Gaza, including enough food to feed the population for three months, from Jordan and Egypt.View image in fullscreenMuch of Gaza lies in ruins after two years of Israeli bombardment.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPA“We’ve not had any progress to move those supplies into Gaza … and this is absolutely critical in controlling the spread of famine,” Juliette Touma, the spokesperson for Unrwa, said.Care International said on Friday it still had not received clearance for its supplies to enter. “We still need clarity on how we’ll be able to get supplies into Gaza that have been stuck outside for months,” said Jolien Veldwijk, Care’s Palestine director.More than 67,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed during Israel’s offensive, and the toll is expected to rise. Medical workers announced that they would use the ceasefire period to start recovering bodies trapped under rubble. Thousands of bodies are though to lie under the debris of ruined buildings, as fighting made excavation and recovery difficult.Israel launched the war in response to a Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.View image in fullscreenAid deliveries are expected to surge, in a relief to those in the population enduring famine and malnourishment.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APThough there is much relief in Israel and in Gaza at the ceasefire, there is anxiety too. Trump’s ambitious 20-point proposal calls for the disarmament of Hamas, further Israeli withdrawals, the creation of an international stabilisation force and a new technocratic Palestinian administration which would answer to Trump.Little of this has been discussed in detail during the frantic negotiations in recent days, and securing agreement from all parties on the thornier issues will be extremely difficult.Already disagreements have emerged over the makeup of the body that will take power from Hamas in Gaza. The US has said Trump and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair will lead the body, while Hamas has called for a Palestinian led-entity to oversee administration of the strip.Naim rejected the involvement of Blair in particular.Bringing the war in Gaza to a close would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the conflict there and in Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.The war has evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His responses led Acoba’s chair, Isabel Doverty, to find him in breach of the rules.On 15 September, Johnson responded to Acoba’s queries to say the stories were “based on material illegally hacked by a hostile state actor. That may explain why they contain so many assertions that are either false or misleading.”He added: “The committee may rest assured that Acoba rules were followed at all times.”The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files contain false or misleading information. The data was obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. It has said it does not know the provenance of the leak.Acoba sent Johnson five specific questions about his relationship with Better Earth, the consultancy firm looking for work with the Saudi government, and his relationship with Bia Advisory, the venture seeking the UAE’s billion-dollar investment.The watchdog wanted to know if he had mentioned the companies when he had spoken with the Saudi ministers, including the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chief executive of one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds.Johnson said he had not started work with Better Earth until Acoba had given the green light for him to join it, and that Bia Advisory had never been set up as a company. He did not address their questions about whether he might have mentioned the ventures to the foreign government representatives.Acoba was frustrated by Johnson’s refusal to give straight answers. The watchdog tried to give him another week to answer and appealed to his standing as a former prime minister and a “reasonable expectation that you would respond fully and factually to my questions to dispel the suggestion that you acted in a manner contrary to your obligations under the rules”.When he was prime minister, Johnson issued his version of the ministerial code. It included the very rules he has now been found to have repeatedly breached.His foreword to the code said: “The precious principles of public life enshrined in this document – integrity, objectivity, accountability, transparency, honesty and leadership in the public interest – must be honoured at all times.”Johnson, however, opted not to engage with the watchdog’s substantive questions.Doverty, the Acoba chair, said it was “highly disappointing” that Johnson refused to substantively deny the allegations he had breached the rules.It adds to a litany of earlier violations by Johnson. They include him asking Acoba to approve a retrospective application asa £275,000-a-year columnist for the Telegraph; asking Acoba to approve an application asa £500,000-a-year columnist for the Daily Mail, 30 minutes beforeit was announced; and refusing to answer Acoba’s questions abouta meeting with Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, and a hedge-fund manager wholater paid him £240,000.Acoba has used the sole mechanism it has to enforce the rules: a letter to the Cabinet Office.Writing to Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, Doverty said: “Mr Johnson is aggrieved that Acoba sought to investigate these allegations, given how the information behind them was obtained.” But she said there was a public interest in investigating any breach of the rules and a duty to do so.She concluded: “Mr Johnson’s lack of cooperation with Acoba and failure to deny the allegations has led me to report this to you as a breach of the government’s rules.”A government spokesperson said: “As announced in July, new arrangements for the administration of the business appointment rules will take effect from Monday 13 October, as part of our commitment to restore trust and ensure the government is in the service of working people.“As part of the new arrangements,Acoba will be closed, and former ministers found to have seriously breached the rules may be asked to repay any ministerial severance payment.”However, a source indicated that no further action would be taken against Johnson, who is no longer subject to the business appointment rules, for the breach.Johnson has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe Boris FilesConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The outgoing centrist education minister, Élisabeth Borne, said Lecornu could “build compromise for France”.But it was seen by opposition parties as a sign that Macron, who has 18 months left until the end of his presidential term, refused to broaden the government to other political views that reflected the divided parliament.Lecornu is now under pressure to quickly form a government of new faces with a range of political views, but this is looking increasingly difficult.Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, wrote on social media that Lecornu’s reappointment was a “bad joke”, a “shame on democracy” and a “humiliation for the French people”. He said his party would back a vote of no-confidence in Lecornu at the soonest opportunity.Parties on the left expressed surprise and criticism. The Socialist party said it had made “no deal” not to join a no-confidence vote in Leconru. “Incredible,” wrote the Green party leader, Marine Tondelier, of Lecornu’s appointment.Macron is facing the worst domestic crisis since he first won the presidency in 2017. On Monday Lecornu dramatically resigned only 14 hours after he appointed a new government. He quit after facing fierce criticism from opposition parties that he was refusing to broaden the government to different political groups and viewpoints that reflected France’s divided parliament.He resigned before he had even attended his first cabinet meeting or made his first policy speech to parliament. Weeks earlier, his predecessorFrançois Bayrou was ousted over his proposed budget cuts.Lecornu, 39, has previously served as defence minister and was known for his work on increasing French military spending. Last month, he became the third French prime minister in only one year as the country has lurched from one political crisis to another since Macron’s gamble on aninconclusive snap electionlast year.The parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads and there has been no stable government for weeks.The reappointment of Lecornu came at the end of a day of high drama in which several opposition parties were invited to the presidential palace for talks with Macron and many left saying they had not felt listened to. One attender said it was like “talking to a wall”.Julien Aubert, a vice-president of the right’s Les Républicains, which had until now propped up Macron’s centrists in government, said: “Reappointing the same prime minister after such a circus is a provocation – the messaging is terrible.”Others were more reconciliatory. Vincent Jeanbrun, the spokesperson for Les Républicains in parliament, said: “Reappointing Lecornu gives a chance for stability.”Macron’s approval ratings have dropped to a historic low. Alain Minc, an essayist and commentator, told BFMTV Macron was now so unpopular, he was “politically radioactive”.Lecornu must now attempt to appoint a government this weekend in time for a first cabinet meeting on Monday, in order to begin the lengthy process of getting parliamentary agreement on the 2026 budget.France’s central bank chief, François Villeroy de Galhau, forecasts that the political uncertainty that France has seen in recent weeks would have an impact on business, consumer confidence and economic growth. “Uncertainty is … the number one enemy of growth,” he told RTL radio.Under the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "1:00María Corina Machado announced as Nobel peace prize winner – videoNobel peace prizeVenezuelan politician María Corina Machado wins Nobel peace prizeOpponent of Maduro regime receives award and praise for keeping ‘flame of democracy burning’Tom PhillipsLatin America correspondentFri 10 Oct 2025 10.59 EDTFirst published on Fri 10 Oct 2025 05.24 EDTShareThe Venezuelan opposition politicianMaría Corina Machadohas won the Nobel peace prize for her dogged struggle to rescue the South American country from its fate as “a brutal, authoritarian state”.Machado, 58, a conservative often described as Venezuela’s Iron Lady, has spent the last year living in hiding after her political movement was widely believed to havebeaten the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, in the July 2024 presidential election.Maduro refused to accept he had lost to Machado’s ally, the former diplomat Edmundo González, and launched a ferocious political crackdown that forced González into exile and Machado to go underground.In one of her last public appearances in Caracas, Machado said she was convinced Maduro’s days in power were numbered after his apparently stinging defeat. “I would say his departure is irreversible,”she told the Guardian.More than a year later Maduro remains in power and, crucially, has retained the support of Venezuela’s military and key international backers such as China and Russia. Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast in recent weeks, which some suspect could bea prelude to some kind of regime change operation.1:51Who is María Corina Machado,'Venezuela’s Iron Lady' and new Nobel peace prize winner? – videoMachado reacted to her Nobel prize in a video that González posted on social media in which the pair celebrate the news. “I can’t believe it! My God!” an incredulous Machado tells her ally. “It’s fucking incredible!” replies González.The Norwegian Nobel Instituteshared a videoof the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke up Machado with the news. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.”“It caught her totally by surprise,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, an opposition politician and friend of more than four decades. “She’s very moved. She’s very concerned about what impact this has on the last phase of the struggle. She’s tearful,” he added, shortly after speaking to Machado on Friday morning.Writing on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people ofVenezuelaand to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”She said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.”View image in fullscreenMachado in Caracas during the 2024 election campaign.Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/ReutersThe Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”.It also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election andcollect detailed tallies showing that González had won.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read more“But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez.“Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said.“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.”Machado, who many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. Shefamously clashedwith Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.”But it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary.Her rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro.“She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.”View image in fullscreenMachado addressing supporters at a protest in January.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersMachado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes.“She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​.The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”.For all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a“a real, credible severe and imminent threat”of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power.David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.”Others are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, andher supportfor Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US.Trump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and forstrikes on alleged “narco-boats”in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people.Maduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands.Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said.“I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.”Burelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”Explore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaNorwayEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s gone.”He added that the explosion was “one of the most devastating situations I’ve been on in my career”.The incident occurred at Accurate Energetic Systems near the town of Bucksnort, about 60 miles south-west ofNashville, the Hickman county sheriff’s office said. The agency asked people in a social media post to avoid the area to allow responders to do their work.Further blasts were initially keeping rescuers at some distance, David Stewart, a Hickman county advanced EMT, told the Associated Press by telephone.Some time later on Friday morning, access was achieved and first responders and explosives experts were searching the rubble for casualties and trying to determine what caused the explosion.There were casualties and injuries related to the explosion, but the Tennessee emergency management agency was not yet sharing any numbers early on Friday afternoon because the state department of health had not confirmed them, spokesperson Kristin Coulter said by telephone.“We can confirm that we do have some that are deceased,” Davis saidIn a later news conference on Friday, Davis said: “We have not notified all the families. We are still reaching out to the families.“It’s a massive situation.”He went on to say: “It’s hell. It’s hell on us. It’s hell on everybody involved … I can tell you right off the top of my head that there’s three families that’s involved in this that I’m very close to.”Davis went on to urge residents to notify law enforcement of any unfamiliar debris that they may spot on their properties, saying: “That’s something we need to get recovered – and because it could have information that we need for the investigation.”Accurate Energetic Systems, which makes and tests explosives and is based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Friday morning. The cause of the explosion is not yet known.In an email to the Associated Press, McEwen’s mayor, Brad Rachford, said: “This is a tragedy for our community.”Video from the scene showed a burning debris field with smoke billowing into the air. WTVF-TV in Nashville broadcast images of debris strewn about the site, with damaged vehicles in a parking lot. The news station said it received calls from people in the area who felt a large explosion.Residents in Lobelville, more than a 20-minute drive from the manufacturer, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.“I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,” he told the AP by phone. “I live very close to Accurate and I realized about 30 seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.”Tennessee’s governor, Bill Lee, responded to Friday’s blast on X, saying: “We are monitoring the ongoing situation in Hickman county & state agencies are responding in partnership with local & federal agencies. We ask Tennesseans to join us in prayer for the families impacted by this tragic incident.”Explore more on these topicsTennesseeUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate.The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added.“I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase ofTariffson Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president.The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago he described US relations with the country as “excellent” aftersigning off on a tariff reduction deal.Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%.But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%.The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%.Shares in the tech giant Nvidia – the world’s biggest public company, with a market value of almost $2.5tn – were hit particularly hard, dropping almost 5%.Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London.China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines.Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues.“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.“But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.”Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda. He has claimed higher taxes on imports from across the world will strengthen the US economy and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government.But tariffs are also often passed on to consumers, lead to higher prices. After years of heightened inflation, Trump has repeatedly claimed there now is none in the US. In reality,price growth has been rising.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaTariffsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in hospital.Cordons are in place around the property, and the public is being asked to stay away from the area.“The incident is contained and there is no wider threat to the public,” the spokesperson said.The matter has been referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards, who in turn made a mandatory referral to the IOPC.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have started an independent investigation into the actions of the Met police during an incident at an address in Walthamstow, east London, where we understand a man was shot by police this afternoon and taken to hospital.“After being notified by the Met police we declared an independent investigation at 4.13pm this afternoon and have sent investigators to the scene and to the post-incident procedure to begin gathering evidence.“Our investigation is in the very early stages.”Assistant commissioner Matt Twist said: “Our thoughts at this time are with the injured man and his family.“I know this news will be concerning for the community in Walthamstow and the wider public in London. However, I want to reassure you, incidents where officers discharge their firearms are incredibly rare.“It is right that there is a full investigation into the circumstances around this incident, and the Independent Office for Police Conduct is leading this. This process must take its course and while that is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.“Armed officers do a difficult job for London, they respond to 4,000 calls a year, placing themselves in danger to protect others. They make split-second decisions in incredibly difficult and challenging circumstances, and I am grateful to all of them for their professionalism and bravery.”Explore more on these topicsLondonIndependent Office for Police ConductMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

His death at home on 14 September was mourned throughout the world, with a minute’s silence held during the Manchester football derby that was played later that day.Ricky Hatton obituaryRead moreHatton’s funeral cortege wound its way through Manchester, with a sea of mourners clapping loudly at every stop and turn on its two-hour route. The procession began at the Cheshire Cheese in Hyde, his favourite pub where he was a regular and a stone’s throw away from his home, before continuing through the area towards Manchester Cathedral. Along the way it also stopped at sites such as the Harehill Tavern, another favourite of Hatton’s, as well as Hatton’s gym. A mural of Hatton was unveiled at the Harehill Tavern when the hearse stopped there.Once the procession reached Manchester Cathedral, Hatton’s coffin was led into the building carried by family and friends, including his brother, Matthew Hatton, and son, Campbell Hatton, both also boxers, and Paul Speak, who managed the Hitman throughout his career.One of Manchester’s favourite sons, many famous faces associated with the city attended the service, including the Oasis frontman and fellow Manchester City supporter, Liam Gallagher, who, along with brother Noel, had carried Hatton’s championship belts into the ring during his 2008 clash with Paulie Malignaggi.Shaun Ryder and Bez from the Happy Mondays also paid their respects at the service, along with Manchester United great Wayne Rooney and some of the biggest names in British and world boxing, including fellow former world champions Tyson Fury, Tony Bellew, Amir Khan and Anthony Crolla.Mani and Liam Gallagher, Colleen and Wayne Rooney attend Ricky Hatton’s funeralMusicians Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield and Liam Gallagher touch Ricky Hatton’s coffin, Colleen and Wayne Rooney arrive for Hatton’s funeral.Amir Khan and Tyson FuryFormer boxer Amir Khan arrives for Hatton’s funeral, Tyson Fury departs after the service.Giving an emotional speech during the service, Campbell called his father “the people’s champion” and said he looked up to him in “every aspect” of his life.“I can’t explain how much I’m going to miss you, Dad, and that we won’t be making any new memories,” he said. “But the ones we did I will cherish for ever.“Growing up I looked up to my dad in every aspect of life whether it be following in a career in boxing like he did or the way he carried himself out of the ring. But all of that was fuelled by the love I had and always will have for him.”From the cathedral, his coffin was driven to Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium for a private service. Hatton’s coffin was painted the same shade of light blue as his beloved City, the team he had supported his entire life and at whose stadium he defeated Juan Lazcano in 2008 in front of a then postwar British record 55,000 capacity crowd. The cortege carrying his coffin was led by the famous yellow Reliant Regal three-wheeler van from Only Fools and Horses, with Hatton, a fan of the comedy show, having bought the original van.Reliant Regal from Only Fools and Horses and funeral cortege passes the Cheshire Cheese pub in Hyde.Ricky Hatton’s Reliant Regal from Only Fools and Horses at the Etihad, Hatton’s funeral cortege passes the Cheshire Cheese pub in Hyde.WBC tribute and Hatton’s padsA tribute from the WBC and some of Ricky Hatton’s pads in the hearse.Outside the Cheshire Cheese pub Mike Lunney and Martin Taylor, two friends who had followed Hatton across the Atlantic to Vegas in 2007 paid their respects to a “boy from Manchester who became a hero” to many.“Look around you,” Lunney said. “There’s as many people here as there were in Vegas. Who else can do that? That many people following you over there at your best, and this many people paying their respects once you’re gone?”Taylor added that Hatton, who was known to people in the area on a personal level and loved being in the company of others, was a “humble and kind” person who was loved by everyone he met.“This is just a normal working-class place and he resonated with people because of who he was. He would talk to people, buy them a drink and talked to people like he was a nobody, but he was so much more than a nobody to so many people,” he said.“They say people only get their flowers when they can’t smell them,” Lunney added. “I hope he knew what he meant to people. Not just to the city or to his fans but to people he met. He was the people’s champion for a reason, he was the best person you could meet, he’d buy everyone a round and chat to you all night. He was the Hitman but he was also Ricky, and he’ll be missed.”Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

Though he left the city just a few weeks ago, he could no longer recognise its streets. The buildings he had grown up in between had collapsed, their contents carpeting the roads in a mixture of torn furniture and broken concrete.Al-Kurdi could only recognise the Netzarim checkpoint marking his entry into north Gaza by the bodies lying at its feet – those who had tried to return home too early, their faces obscured by dust after being cut down by Israeli fire.“The city looks completely different, as if it is no longer the Gaza we once knew. In just a short time, massive destruction has spread everywhere. Almost all of the houses are destroyed, the streets blocked,” said al-Kurdi, a 40-year-old resident of Gaza City, as he returned to his home in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.Al-Kurdi was one of the thousands of people of Gaza who took advantage of theceasefire announced on Fridayto travel back to their homes in northern Gaza. Videos showed a coastal highway clogged with crowds , many on foot, making their way northwards.View image in fullscreenPalestinians, carrying their belongings, return to the north of Gaza’s Sheikh Radwan as the ceasefire took effect in the Gaza Strip.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesFor the first time since a previous ceasefire had collapsed in mid-March, fighting had stopped in Gaza. Hamas and Israel had agreed to stop fighting to prepare for the release of 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in anagreementthat is meant to lead to a complete end to the two-year war.Like most people of north Gaza, al-Kurdi was filled with anxiety as he walked north. In the days leading up to the ceasefire, Israel had been intensely bombing Gaza City as part of its campaign to occupy the city.Al-Kurdi had no idea if his home was among the lucky few that was still standing.“I expect to find a ghost city. Some neighbours went ahead of me and told me the situation in the neighbourhood is catastrophic. They said my house was badly damaged by drone strikes, but is still standing,” he said. Even if his house was uninhabitable, he hoped to at least salvage some of his belongings.The journey north was not easy, as transportation was overwhelmed by the hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to return home. Those who headed north described walking for hours with Israeli drones flying overhead, and hearing explosions in the distance.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman carries her baby as she walks with others along the coastal road towards Gaza City.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/AP“I slept in the street for two days waiting for permission to pass through the [Netzarim] checkpoint and return home. There were no vehicles available so I hung on to the back of my neighbour’s car for three hours until we arrived safely,” said Ahmad Salem, a 30-year-old from al-Jabalia in northern Gaza.Though a ceasefire was in effect, Israeli troops were still present in about half of the Gaza Strip. Approaching them could spell death, an Israeli military spokesperson said shortly after the ceasefire was announced, specifying specific areas that were still off limits.Despite her home town of Beit Lahia being one of the areas that the Israeli army said was still forbidden to enter, Asmaa Zuheir decided to make the journey back anyway. Even if she could not reach her home, she was hoping to at least catch a glimpse of her neighbourhood from afar.“I managed to reach the outskirts of Beit Lahia but could not move toward the centre because of the danger still present. Drones started firing at anyone who advanced toward the city,” said Zuheir, a 34-year-old nurse.From her vantage point on the outskirts of Beit Lahia, she could only see bare earth; the entire area had been flattened by bulldozers.“I saw no landmarks. The entire area had been levelled to the ground. There was not even rubble left from the houses,” said Zuheir.Map showing areas of Gaza Strip still occupied by Israeli troopsZuheir did not dare stay too long, leaving as the crowds of people began to thin. Though she had not managed to reach her home, she began to walk back, stopping along the way to collect some tree branches to make a fire to keep warm once night fell.Salem had managed to reach his home, only to find that it no longer existed. He added his home to the long list of things he had lost over the last two years, unimportant compared to the loss of his brother.Still, despite losing his house, Salem still felt he had returned home.“Here in the north, despite all the devastation, I feel more at peace than in the south, because I am back where I belong, to my memories, my neighbourhood, my neighbours, and my home, even if it is destroyed,” he said.It is unclear how long the ceasefire in Gaza will last. The head of Hamas’s negotiating team, Khalil al-Hayya, said in a video address on Thursday that he had received guarantees from the US and other international powers that the ceasefire will hold. But negotiators still had to agree on thorny issues such as the disarmament ofHamasand the makeup of a governing body for Hamas.View image in fullscreenA throng of Palestinians displaced to the southern part of Gaza, make their way along a road as they return to the north.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersResidents of Gaza had been here before – a ceasefire had ended in mid-March when Israel unilaterally decided to resume fighting – and so were eager to return home while they still could.Despite the destruction they found upon their return, many hoped that the days ahead held a respite from the brutality of the past two years. Amid the mounds of rubble, small scenes of joy still unfolded.“On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,” said Zuheir. “At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.”“People here, when they see any trace of their house, feel great hope and joy, as if it had never been damaged. All they want is a small piece of their memories from the house they once lived in,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaHamasGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The party promised to declare China’s systematic repression of its Uyghur Muslim minority as a genocide. Its MPs united to support a genocide amendment to a 2021 trade bill, voting with Tory rebels andonly failing to defeatBoris Johnson’s government by 11 votes.But in the past week recriminations have swirled after the prosecution of two Britonsaccused of spying for China was dropped. A refusal by the government to describe China as a national security threat has reinforced Labour’s already softened approach to Beijing and sharpened focus on the figure at its heart: Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.Critics sayLabouris hastily pursuing a return to the “golden era” rapprochement led by David Cameron in 2015, when China’s president, Xi Jinping, came on a state visit and Beijing was given approval to build nuclear power stations in the UK.That collapsed afterChinacrushed the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and repeatedly engaged in cyber espionage against British targets. Beijing then became a “decisive enabler” in supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine with critical components.“In opposition, there was a strong sense of moral conviction on Labour party policy on China,” said Luke de Pulford, director of the International Parliamentary Alliance on China, a cross-party group of China-sceptic legislators. “Now that seems to have fallen by the wayside in favour of a focus on trade, investment, sacrificed at the altar of perceived economic gain.”In the run up to the election, Labour had already lightened the policy load inits manifesto, promising “a long-term and strategic approach” to China that would be generated by an “audit of our bilateral relationship”.At the same time, threats from China continued. The chief executive of the Electoral Commission said last month that it took three years to recover from a Chinese hack between 2021 and 2022 in which the details of 40 million voters were accessed.An estimated 20,000 Britons have been approached byChinese state actors on LinkedInin the hope of stealing industrial secrets, the head of MI5 warned in October 2023. Over a quarter of a million military payroll records were compromised by hackers from China in May 2024.Powell, Tony Blair’s chief of staff between 1995 and 2007, arrived in November as national security adviser – in effect the prime minister’s most important geopolitical adviser. A political appointment, he is the first special adviser, reporting to Starmer, to hold the post.A veteran of the Northern Ireland peace negotiations, Powell had set up Inter-Mediate, a charity aimed at promoting dialogue between parties to a conflict. “If we ever want to secure lasting peace then we have to engage with our enemies, not just with those we like,” he said in a Guardian articlein September 2021.Other figures were also trying to exert influence on China policy after Labour’s election victory. A couple of months before his nomination (and short-lived appointment) as UK ambassador to the US,Peter Mandelson– the only Labour peer tovote against the genocide amendment– said Britain had gone too far in its falling out with China. In September 2024, he also told the South China Morning Post “we need a relationship that enables us to cooperate with China when desirable and necessary”.Labourbacktracked on its commitmentto label Uyghur repression as a genocide in October 2024 before a visit to Beijing by then foreign secretary David Lammy.The month after, Starmer met Xi at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, the first time leaders from the two countries had met since 2018. Other engagements followed. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, visited in January, and said the UK should have “a pragmatic and good relationship” with countries around the world.She returned with pledges of £600m of investment over five years, though some specialists argued that was a poor return. “She shouldn’t have been getting out of bed for less than a billion,” said Sophia Gaston, a senior research fellow at King’s College London.Powell himself visited Beijing this July, meeting China’s foreign affairs minister, Wang Yi, in an announcement placedon the Chinese embassy’s website. “Powell expressed the UK’s willingness to enhance dialogue,” the Chinese statement said. Starmer will visit China, perhaps as soon as next year.Meanwhile, China was left off the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (Firs) when it launched in July. It is only occupied by Russia and Iran.The enhanced tier requires anyone in the UK acting for a foreign power or entity across a full range of political and economic activity todeclare their activities to the governmentor face sanctions. Even a proposal to only designate China’s military and espionage apparatus in the higher tier has not been implemented,amid Beijing’s threats of retaliation.The promised China audit never publicly materialised, with experts arguing it was too difficult to publish a frank document. Instead it was subsumed into a UK national security strategy published in late June by Powell’s team in the Cabinet Office, which promised “greater robustness and consistency” in dealing with Beijing.View image in fullscreenChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash leaving Westminster Magistrates’ Court,  where they were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act.Composite: Jeff Moore/PAIt is against this backdrop that Stephen Parkinson, the director of Crown Prosecution Service, revealed this week that for “many months” before August, he had tried and failed to get an assurance he thought necessary to prosecute Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary aide to backbencher Alicia Kearns, and his friend Christopher Berry. Both men were accused of spying for China,passing information from Westminster to the country’s ruling politburo– though they denied the charges.Parkinson had wanted Matthew Collins, a UK deputy national security adviser, to testify that China was currently “a threat to the national security of the UK”. But when it was clear the statement was not forthcoming, he abandoned the case.On Thursday, while visiting India, Starmer said he could “be absolutely clear no ministers were involved” in decisions relating what evidence to submit. Downing Street aides were emphatic that denial covered Powell as well.The allegation that China was seeking to obtain information from Westminster was novel, unlike accusations of hacking or industrial espionage. Yet, due to a still unclear set of circumstances, the trial of Cash and Berry did not begin, because the director of public prosecutions could not obtain what he wanted from the government machine.Whoever was at fault, it amounted to “pusillanimous judgment over what would upset the Chinese”, according to one former senior Whitehall insider.Gaston, a foreign policy expert, argues that any engagement with Beijing should always be undertaken from a position of confidence. “The last thing we want when the government is pursuing a relationship reset with China is to send a message that there were any constraints in its capacity to defend national security, and that we might not have all the right tools to sufficiently protect our democracy,” she said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyChinaKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

My friend Daniel Medin had recommended two books to me, both by the Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai, one called War and War and the other The Melancholy of Resistance. We had also watched some Béla Tarr films, whose screenplays had been written by Krasznahorkai. The sense of slow, seething menace in the filmWerckmeister Harmonies, based on The Melancholy of Resistance, and the lack of easy psychology and obvious motive in the film, the camera moving like a cat, made it exciting, but not as exciting as the two novels.Krasznahorkai, I noticed, loved the snaking sentence, the high-wire act, mild panic steering towards a shivering fear felt by his characters, followed, in clause after clause, by fitful realisations and further reasons for gloom or alarm, and then, with just a comma in between, ironic (and even comic) responses to what comes next into the mind. These extraordinary sentences had been translated by the poet George Szirtes with considerable rhythmic energy.Krasznahorkai –who this week was awarded the Nobel prize in literature– is concerned with limits, with what can happen if language is pushed further than its own decorous rules might suggest. Or what can happen if consciousness itself is rendered as infinite in its systems and capable of doubling back and feeding on itself before it edges forward again. Or what can happen if knowledge, or action, or memory, or voice, are each incapable of being easily tamed by narrative. For this reason, he is, as a storyteller, fascinated by extremes, by the possibility of apocalypse.It would be a mistake to read the menace in his work as either political or coming from nowhere. His imagination feeds on real fear and real violence; he has a way of making fear and violence seem all the more real and present, however, by removing them from a familiar context. He places them in a dark context of his own choosing. In this way, he stands closer toKafkathan toBeckett, but he is close to neither in his interest and delight in verbal pyrotechnics.‘Slow, seething menace’ … a trailer for the film Werckmeister Harmonies, directed by Béla Tarr and Agnes Hranitzky and based on a Krasznahorkai novel.In 2006, when I came home all enthusiastic about his work, he still had no UK publisher. I had read the books in the US editions published by New Directions. The view in London was that he was too difficult; no publisher could take the risk. In response to this, with the literary agent Peter Straus, I set upTuskar Rock Press, which, using Profile Books as the parent publisher, aims to publish writers who have been overlooked by other UK houses.Once we acquired the rights to Krasznahorkai’s books, the task was to make them better known. At the Edinburgh Book festival in 2011, when he appeared, I saw that we were pushing an open door. The audience contained serious young readers, admirers of Tarr’s films, who were already familiar with these novels. All we had to do was find more of them.In person, Krasznahorkai is thoughtful, almost shy, soft-spoken, unfailingly polite. He is not talkative or outgoing. Thus, when I prepared to interview him at the London Review Bookshop in 2012, I wondered how he would respond to questions about his background and the roots of his inspiration.Not well, is the answer. Or maybe the answer is that there was something wrong with one of the questions.In retrospect, I can see that he did say some interesting things. For example, about his novel Sátántangó: “I had to write only this book and no more. You try to write only one book and put everything you want to say in one book.”Before 1989, he said: “Hungary was an absolutely unreal, crazy country. Abnormal and unbearable. After 1989, it became normal and unbearable.” In what he called “Old Hungary”, there was “very big misery – the mood was unbelievably sad and hopeless”.He was not worried about finding readers. “Most of us need only 10, maybe six on a bad day.”The problem arose when I asked him about God, about what it meant to write a novel that moved beyond the secular, beyond the domestic or the finite, reaching towards some larger space. “Hmmmm,” he said. And then repeated: “Hmmmm.” His comic timing could not have been better. He looked at me mournfully and said: “The question is wonderful, but I couldn’t answer. It’s too difficult for me. I’m not that clever.”It tookSzirtes, who joined him on the platform, to deal with the issue: “I know that world more, but it’s a visionary world – a visionary world looking for order. The characters are not looking for God, but looking for their place.”When it came to the time for audience questions, Krasznahorkai seemed relieved. And then he joined his hands together and looked up at the ceiling, half shaman, half shy showman, and as though he were praying for deliverance, he said he was happy to answer questions: “Only I beg you, nothing about God.”Explore more on these topicsLászló KrasznahorkaiNobel prize in literatureColm TóibínHungaryFictionAwards and prizesBéla TarrfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dogs just do. “Well, of course,” Martín Zubimendi says, cracking up. The July day he walked through the doors at theArsenaltraining centre, the club’s resident chocolate labrador – a therapy dog the head coach had brought in to bring the kind of calm wanted from the new signing too – was the first to welcome him. “It was lovely. I arrived with my parents, my agent, a small group, and he came straight to me, sat by me, rolled on the floor at my feet; that was very nice.”It was also the way he would have wanted it, part of the plan. “He’s a bit like yours,” the sporting director, Andrea Berta, offered as Win lent against the midfielder’s legs. Zubimendi’s dog, Lea, hadn’t made it to London – he’s hoping she will soon – but this was a good start. There was a letter from Mikel Merino and a video call from Martin Ødegaard, teammates at Real Sociedad, yet no friendlier face than this. That can help when you’re departing the city you were born in and the club where you have been since you were 12.View image in fullscreenZubimendi’s welcome at Arsenal included meeting Win, Arsenal’s therapy dog.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“I hadn’t left home yet; going was a radical change,” Zubimendi says, and there is a glimpse of that here, at Las Rozas with theSpainteam, preparing for World Cup qualifiers against Georgia in Elche on Saturday and Bulgaria in Valladolid on Tuesday. When you’re away, he admits, you appreciate these moments even more. “The climate, the language, and above all it’s lovely being with these mates – the atmosphere is great,” Zubimendi says. “But the change was what I was looking for. I didn’t have too many doubts.”Arsenal consider Emirates Stadium expansion to 70,000 capacityRead moreNot any more, not by this summer. A year earlier, Zubimendi had chosen not to leave home, where he has had the same mates since he was three or four. Arne Slot admitted that Liverpool hadtried everything to sign himand he had listened but, unlike his teammates, friends and fellow European champions Robin Le Normand and Merino, he didn’t take the final step. Twelve months on, he did. Why wait? What changed?There is a pause. “When any proposal comes, the first question has to be whether to stay at la Real,” he says. “And it wasn’t the right moment [to go]. I stayed and it was a hard season but I learned a lot. I wanted to step forward, take that weight after others went.” Fans appreciated his staying. “Well, until you do decide to go,” he says, smiling. “But I’ve always tried to choose the right time and I’m happy with how it happened in the end.“I had watched Arsenal and I liked everything I saw, in terms of passion, youth, the feeling you got watching them. And when Mikel Arteta called me … Well, if you’ve ever spoken to him you’ll know that he can beveryconvincing. He’s mad about football, crazy about having everything under control, trying to get something from every little detail. He’s very clear on everything and the proposal he had was the best for me.”The leap wasn’t so great, not once he got the initiation out the way. “The worst thing in football,” he calls it; by his own admission, he is quite reserved, after all. “I had to sing: I did La Bachata, by Manuel Turizo.” And how was it? “Horrible, horrible.”Otherwise, it has gone well, although he misses Lea. Merino and Ødegaard are there. A footballer’s life is similar anywhere, Zubimendi believes, adaptation not so hard. He lives less than 10 minutes from the training ground, north of the city but with London only a train ride away. And he had studied English, even if it’s one thing tothinkyou understand the language and another to turn up and test that. On the pitch, theproposal fit perfectly, going to a different league good for him.View image in fullscreenZubimendi holds off Manchester City’s Erling Haaland during September’s 1-1 draw.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThere is a confidence about him too, born of continuity at the highest level: a stability, a maturity, recognition now too. He will be at the heart of the Spain team this week. He came on at half-time in the final of Euro 2024, with everyone fearing that Rodri’s injury was a disaster – in the directors’ box, one Basque member of the delegation rounded on Spanish colleagues unable to believe that they didn’t have more faith – and ran the game. He scored the champions’first goal back on Spanish soil. And he has started 10 of Spain’s past 11 games.“I always felt that Luis [de la Fuente, the Spain coach] trusted me but when you’re on the pitch [regularly], when you can contribute, you feel more involved in everything. And I do feel that. At half-time, there were nerves for sure. But doubts? None. It also happened so fast, and was so unexpected that I didn’t have time to think. Often the issue is [mental]. There are players who have the level but the hardest thing is taking that step, finding a way to be yourself.”Zubimendi may be the best in the world in a position where even what it is called says something about how it is conceptualised: the defensive or deep midfielder is apivotin Spain, the piece upon which it all hinges. When Rodri got injured, De la Fuente said the City midfielder was thebest in the worldbut, not to worry, he had the second best too. If few followed him then, the debate now may be only about the order. Inside the game, it had already been seen. Slot had little doubt; Arteta had even less. Arsenal’s manager, after all, is from the same city and played for the same team as his new signing: not just Real Sociedad but theirlocal club Antiguoko.View image in fullscreenZubimendi (left) poses with Rodri after Spain’s Euro 2024 final victory over England – his international coach believes the pair are the two best midfielders in the world.Photograph: Pablo GarcíaArsenal, Premier League runners-up three years in a row, a feeling growing that this yearhasto be their year, were determined to build strength in depth. “From what teammates have said to me, the problem was the injuries, that when someone got injured, the team came undone,” Zubimendi says.“This year the club has invested a lot in having two players in every position.” In having different types of solutions, too. As for the 26-year-old, he was the central piece, a qualitative leap towards a title challenge, his profile one they didn’t have.“Actually, I don’t agree with that,” he says. “Because the midfield there was already very strong.”As for the demands of his position, he says: “The pivot has to be someone who is very complete; he has to have the best qualities with the ball and without it, plus the physical capability. He has to be able to do everything. It completes you [to move]. It would be easy to stay in my comfort zone. But I wanted to leave that environment where I was with Real Sociedad and grow in a personal sense, to see another culture, another football.

I think I have a lot to learn in the Premier League, a lot to improve, but I think I can do that.”Well, if he can learn tobelt volleys in from 20 yards, as he did against Nottingham Forest last month … Zubimendi laughs. “Just my thing,” he says.Is it as brutal as it looks? “Yes. The mentality is: be a man. Go into clashes hard. It’s more direct. In Spain when you get the ball, it’s more about keeping it; [in England], whenever you win it, it’s straight on to the attack. Transitions are unavoidable, it’s harder to control. But [handling] that is not about ability as such, it’s getting your mind used to it. That’s different to La Liga but the thing that has most struck me is the dead ball, how important it is. I’m seeing loads of goals from that and they’re often what opens up the game. We have a set-play coach and we work on that practically daily.View image in fullscreenMartín Zubimendi jumps for joy after his stunning volley opens the scoring in Arsenal’s 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest in September.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA“But I choose a team on the basis of my qualities too: what they wanted from me. I have to adapt my play a bit in terms of playing faster, more direct. I’m a pivot, but in this structure I have the chance to take that step forward and Arteta insists a lot that I can play that final pass and make the difference. But I think my profile doesn’t change much.If they have signed me it is because they like what I do. They know this is what I can contribute to the team. If I changed my profile it would be an error.”Brought, like Win, to make everyone else feel better, putting them at ease. “Totally reliable,” in De la Fuente’s words, someone who “thinks more about his teammates than himself,” according to Xabi Alonso,his idol first and his coach later. It’s in the person, and the player. The son of teachers, a little less timid as time passes, he is engaging, warm company but there is no show, no desire to be noticed, just to help.Saka sends Arsenal top with victory over West Ham in Arteta’s 300th gameRead moreAs Spain’s coach put it: “Martín doesn’t get nervous, even if he’s walking along a high-wire without ropes. He’s always so calm, so in control.”“Well, I look like it, at least,” Zubimendi replies, laughing again. Inside, you’re terrified?“No, I try to be calm because I think in that emotional state I’m going to make better decisions. When it comes to the ‘caffeine’ level I’m cautious.Overstimulation isn’t good. I’m naturally calm. Away from football, too, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see me out of control or overexcited. But it’s also the confidence and trust I have in my teammates that gives me the tranquillity to know we’ll be fine.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalSpaininterviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s good news for Bradley Cooper’s latest directorial effort, Is This Thing On?, which, despite its foregrounding of discovering stand-up, is more a subtle, self-deprecating, ultimately endearing rom-com between two people who were married for 20 years.Their split, at least, was amicable. Is This Thing On?, written by Cooper alongside Arnett and Mark Chappell, opens with Alex and Tess (an especially winsome Laura Dern) calling it quits with all the drama of brushing one’s teeth. Before they’ve even told their friends – primarily Cooper’s Arnie, a cartoonishly self-absorbed working actor, and his artist wife (Andra Day) – Alex has moved out of their suburban house and into a prototypically divorced dad apartment downtown, a gray place devoid of personality or much furniture. His still-married parents (Christine Ebersole and Ciarán Hinds) meddle but refuse to take sides. The former couple split custody of their two 10-year-old sons, played with sharp comedic timing by Blake Kane and Calvin Knegten. Marriage Story this is not.But the friendliness doesn’t make the quotidian struggles of separation any less painful. Is This Thing On? fast-tracks Tess and Alex’s confused stumbles into single life in one’s late 40s, while rewardingly slow-rolling the reasons for their split. It refreshingly devotes less focus to the much-ballyhooed experience of dating again or sleeping with someone new – though there is, of course, some of that – than the trickier, scarier work of discovering new hobbies and rediscovering oneself, of rebuilding identity and self-worth both post-split and in middle age. Tess, a former Olympic volleyball player whose lostness is buried under several layers of steely pride, experiments with coaching. Alex has comedy, which he convincingly explains to his children as the grown-up version of making up stories to get through.The film is loosely based on the life of the British comedian John Bishop, who, like Alex, accidentally stumbled into stand-up mid-divorce by putting his name down to avoid paying cover. Unlike Bishop, who performed his first set to about seven people at an entry-level pub, Alex starts at New York’s famed Comedy Cellar – certainly no amateur’s hangout, though it does effectively serve as a love letter to the city’s thriving comedy scene and the people sick enough to process life on stage in front of other people (said with love, and appreciation for no excess painful bombing scenes). Interstitials between Alex and Tess’s strained co-parenting paint a rosy picture of comedian camaraderie, as Alex goes from accidental natural and student of the craft, with new friends played by real standup regulars Jordan Jenson, Reggie Conquest and Chloe Radcliffe (and, as themselves, Sam Jay and Dave Attell); Amy Sedaris plays a supportive booker.Alex’s nascent love affair with the art of stand-up, one man’s process toward processing his raw feelings on stage, is so enjoyable that I found myself wishing to stay at the cellar longer; this community, at once caustic and supportive and all in love with the same thing, is far more convincing Tess and Alex’s mutual one, populated with the type of caricatures or exaggerated bits you might find in a standup routine (and, inexplicably, former NFL star Peyton Manning as a fellow mid-40s divorcee who looks, sounds and acts exactly like Peyton Manning). Cooper, who shares more than a passing resemblance with Arnett, is particularly distracting, if funny, as a comically over-serious creative who makes no sense with Day’s overbearing artist.But these off notes fade into the background of Alex and Tess’s evolving dynamic – sometimes barbed and sometimes witty, always charged and, in the hands of Arnett and Dern, magnetic. Is This Thing On? picks up steam as the two begin to fall in love in ways they didn’t expect – with new hobbies, with new versions of themselves – and trip over the questions and hurt they bring up. Both actors believably bear the mark of this weird, unexpected, inexplicable period of transition – Dern is positively sprightly as Tess reconnects with an older version of herself, Arnett lumbering with the pain of new revelations, both jittery on the edge of something new in what becomes an absorbing portrait of a relationship in flux. Is This Thing On? starts with a punchline – sad divorced dad stumbles into a bar as a cry for help – and smartly works backward; like a great routine, beneath the jokes lurks something tender, grounded and real.Is This Thing On? is screening at the New York film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 19 December, Australian cinemas on 22 January and in the UK on 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmFirst look reviewBradley CooperLaura DernWill ArnettComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her own young daughter has suffered serious breathing problems, which at their worst involved the harrowing experience of having to pin her to the floor to administer an inhaler.It is 10 years since the scandal erupted, exposing cars that pumped out far more toxic fumes on the road than when passing regulatory tests in the lab. But Dieselgate is far from over.The excess pollution emitted has already killed about 16,000 people in the UK and caused 30,000 cases of asthma in children,experts have estimated. A further 6,000 early deaths will occur in coming years without action, they say.That action is taking an “outrageous” amount of time, say lawyers, leaving more than a million of the dirty diesels still on the road today. Unlike countries such as the US and Germany, the UK government has yet to fine any car manufacturer, or force them to recall and repair their vehicles. Instead, owners have had to seek justice by mounting the largest group action claim in English legal history, with 1.6 million claimants represented in a high court trial that starts on Monday.“I want the alleged deception of these manufacturers to be brought into the open and for them to be held to account,” says Adam Kamenetzky, from south London and one of the claimants. When buying a car in 2018 before the birth of his twin children, he chose his 2013 Mercedes ML250 specifically because of its low emissions in official tests. Now he says he feels he was deceived and was contributing, unknowingly, to deadly air pollution.View image in fullscreenAdam Kamenetzky chose this particular model of Mercedes car because of its low emissions credentials.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianCourt documents assessed for the Guardian, which the car companies hadsought to keep confidential, reveal an extraordinary array of alleged illegal “cheat devices”. These enabled many diesel cars to sail through official tests, only for the nitrogen oxides (NOx) in their exhausts to soar when used in real-life driving.Previous reportshave shown thatmost diesel carssold from 2009-19emitted more NOxon the roadsthan in official tests.The motivation for this deployment of engineering ingenuity was, the claimants lawyers argue, to save the car companies money and save drivers the inconvenience of having to top up tanks with AdBlue, a chemical used to reduce pollution. The carmakers deny the alleged defeat devices were illegal and say the claims against them are without merit, arguing the devices were necessary to protect the engines.A guilty verdict could see the carmakers having to pay billions of pounds in compensation, although the legal fight could take another three years to complete.Even then, while each diesel owner may receive thousands of pounds in financial compensation, judgments against the carmakers would not compel them to fix the cars. Ministers have had the legal framework needed to do this since 2021 but have yet to use it, and while 76 models are under investigation by officials, progress is agonisingly slow, say lawyers.‘Struggling to breathe’Concern over the impact air pollution was having, particularly on children, was the reason Hartshorn founded campaign group Mums for Lungs in 2017. But in 2022 that concern became deeply personal.View image in fullscreenFive years after founding Mums for Lungs, Jemima Hartshorn’s own daughter ended up in the hospital with breathing difficulties.Photograph: @CrispinHughes/Mums for Lungs/Crispin Hughes“My daughter, who was three-years-old at the time, became very ill,” she wrote in a witness statement related to the group claim trial. “She was struggling to breathe and our GP advised us to go immediately to the accident and emergency department. The severity of her condition was instantly recognised by a nurse. My daughter was given inhalers and steroids and, after five hours, was eventually discharged, with daily nurse visits scheduled from the following day.“I had to administer a spacer, which is a type of inhaler, to my daughter every two hours, over the next several days. My daughter found the spacer frightening. I had to restrain her in the ‘crucifix position’, pinning her arms with my legs, in order to force her to breathe through it. This experience was gruelling and deeply upsetting for us both.”Three days later Hartshorn’s daughter was back in hospital. “It was a very frightening time,” she wrote. Thankfully, her daughter’s respiratory health has improved recently. “However, children growing up in London, Manchester and other cities and towns across this country are sick because of diesel emissions,” she told the Guardian. “It is time the car manufacturers paid as well.”Prof Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory medicine expert at Imperial College London and medical director of Asthma + Lung UK, says: “Dieselgate isn’t just a corporate scandal – it is helping to fuel a toxic air emergency that has already cut short thousands of lives, and will continue to do so without urgent action. The UK government has been too slow to act, resulting in millions of high-polluting diesel vehicles remaining on our roads.”‘Still pumping out NOx’The car companies on trial have made the vast majority of cars on the UK’s roads, but the colossal scale of the case means the court has chosen five lead defendants to go first: Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault and Nissan. Nine more companies face similar claims of using illegal defeat devices, including Vauxhall, Volkswagen, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW, Fiat, Hyundai-Kia and Toyota. These cases will be considered in the light of the result of the first trial.View image in fullscreenRenault is one of the five carmakers chosen to be lead defendants in the trial.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesBenjamin Croft, a partner at Leigh Day, one of the two law firms leading the case, sets out the claim: “Firstly, the claimants’ case is that these drivers were deceived into buying vehicles that were marketed as conforming with the legislation and being environmentally friendly and not pumping out NOx that is harmful to human health.”“The second point is that the expert evidence shows that these vehicles are still pumping out far more NOx than they should, and people’s health is being affected by it.”At the heart of the case are the alleged illegal defeat devices. Diesel car manufacturers had developed sophisticated technology to reduce NOx emissions. But, the lawyers argue, they deployed equally sophisticated ways to ramp the technology up when the cars were undergoing the official emissions test then ramp it down during normal driving on the road.UK electric car sales hit record high as taxpayer subsidies help attract buyersRead moreThis was possible because the test involved a fixed sequence of gentle accelerations, steady travel and braking, highly unlikely during real-world driving, and were conducted on rollers under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. When a car’s onboard computer spotted it was undergoing the test, it ramped up NOx control, cutting emissions. (A more realistic test, including on-the-road emissions testing, started to be introduced in 2019.)The court documents allege that the five manufacturers used dozens of single defeat devices between them. As well as the characteristic test pattern, documents say the vehicles used multiple other factors to identify the test conditions: the ambient temperature being outside the test requirement of 20C to 30C, engine torque being higher than needed in the gentle test, and even the atmospheric air pressure, which was also a test requirement.When test conditions were detected, the cars then adjusted the NOx control systems. One alleged illegal cheat device was cutting the recirculation of exhaust gas into the engine, which reduces the combustion temperature and lowers NOx production. Another affected the lean NOx trap, a unit that absorbs NOx like a sponge. Here the alleged illegal cheat device would purge the unit during the prescribed warm-up before the regulatory test, ensuring optimum performance during the test.The third major category of alleged cheat device altered the most effective NOx control of all: selective catalytic reduction (SCR). This works by injecting urea – sold as AdBlue – into the exhaust stream, but was reduced outside test conditions, the court documents say. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler werefined €875m in 2021by the European Commission for cartel conduct that restricted competition in SCR use.Cost and inconvenienceThe obvious question is why did the carmakers go to such trouble to allegedly cheat the NOx emissions test?“We say the automakers had the technology to limit NOx to legal levels but chose not to deploy it and instead used their expertise to prioritise cutting costs and inconvenience, eg. Ad Blu refills, for themselves and the drivers of their cars,” says Croft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But these are problematic, say experts, and only cover a small fraction of polluting vehicles.“There’s no easily accessible central database that we can search,” says Emily Kearsey, a lawyer at Client Earth, which has made three legal complaints about diesel NOx emissions to the UK government since 2023.“ So it’s incredibly difficult to get any sense of what is the actual fix? What is the timeline? What is the actual percentage of vehicles that have been fixed?”Yoann Bernard, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the group that first exposed the Dieselgate scandal, says doubts also exist about the effectiveness of some of the software updates after the EU Joint Research Centretestedsome updated vehicles and found no improvement in emissions.Bernard adds that Renault, for example, has saidits software updateshave no impact on vehicle performance or fuel consumption: “If manufacturers possessed a software solution capable of reducing NOx emissions without adversely affecting fuel consumption and performance, why was it not implemented from the outset rather than risking a scandal?”The carmakers largely accept that the vehicles operate as the claimants allege but say the alleged defeat devices are in fact legal technologies, in some cases necessary to protect car engines from damage and issues such as the build up of soot. They say the claims against them are unfounded and that the companies will robustly defend themselves in court.View image in fullscreenA Volkswagen Passat during emissions testing.Photograph: John Stillwell/PA“In our opinion, the emission control software functionalities in question are justifiable from a technical and legal standpoint,” said a spokesperson for Mercedes. The company has rolled out voluntary software updatesshown to be effectiveat reducing NOx emissions by 25-30%, she said, adding: “As a responsible vehicle manufacturer, we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of vehicle emissions and to further climate protection and air quality.”“All Renault’s vehicles were type approved in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable at the time,” a company spokesperson says. A spokesperson for Peugeot/Citroën’s parent company said: “Stellantis firmly believes that its vehicles and engines fully comply with all applicable emission regulations.” A spokesperson for Nissan said the company is committed to compliance in all markets and supportive of the evolution of emissions testing regimes and standards over time. Ford did not respond to a request for comment.Rulings by the court of justice of the EU since 2020 ruled that defeat devices that operate most of the time are not legal and, in any case, are only permitted if required to prevent extremely serious damage.The ICCT has continued to track the diesel emissions polluting Europe’s air and says there are still more than 1.3m diesel vehicles with “extreme” emissions of toxic pollution on the roads of the UK today, with a further 10m on EU roads.Extreme means at least three timesover the official NOx limit for the cars, which were sold from 2009 to 2019. “The issue therefore remains unresolved,” says Bernard.‘Huge deal’Some countries have held carmakers to account for Dieselgate. VW was the first company to be exposed and was hammered by the US Department of Justice. In 2016, the DoJ forced VW to pay about$10bn compensating driversand $5bn to support electric cars and cut air pollution, as well as compelling the recall and fixing of the dirty diesels.German prosecutors fined VW €1bnin 2018, and by 2020 the company said the scandal hadcost it $34bn. Smaller fines have been imposed in Italy, the Netherlands and Poland.Frailty in ageing populations worsened by air pollution, global review findsRead moreIn the UK, VW settled a 2022 court case brought by 91,000 drivers by agreeing topay them £193m, about £2,100 each. But the British government has yet to punish any car company.“Auto manufacturers have been trying to sweep the Dieselgate scandal under the carpet for too long,” says Kearsey.“[The group claim trial] is a huge deal and a very important part of securing justice for people who feel they were misled. But we are working in parallel to try to ensure the government takes the action it needs to ensure that these cars are taken off the roads. Even if the manufacturers are found guilty of wrongdoing and there is compensation for consumers, it wouldn’t necessarily result in the cars being fixed and the air being cleaned up.”The UK government has had the power since 2021 to implement laws allowing them to compel recalls. But it has yet to use that power, despitesaying in 2023: “Abuse of the system is not acceptable – we are looking to bring forward stronger powers.” It is investigating76 models of car.“These investigations seem to be taking longer than they should, especially given the gravity of the issue,” Kearsey says.A spokesperson for the Department forTransportsaid: “We acted quickly to set up an investigation into defeat devices. We are now considering what action we could take should manufacturers be found to be breaking the rules.”View image in fullscreenKamenetzky, along with other claimants, is determined to see the case through despite it being expected to take another three years.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the three-month group claim trial begins on Monday, there is a long road ahead. Final submissions in the trial are due in March 2026, with a judgment expected next summer. If the claimants win, then another trial to determine how much the carmakers will have to pay is listed for autumn 2026. There may even be further legal wrangling, such as whether a time limit could rule out the oldest vehicles.Kearsey says: “It’s hugely frustrating and outrageous when you see the wealth of evidence over the past 10 years that strongly indicates that the original VW scandal was just the tip of the iceberg. [The damage to health] is shocking, really affecting people’s lives now, and it will do so into the future until action is taken.”Kamenetzky, a Mercedes driver, says he is determined to see the case through: “I’m not in this for a payout. I’m just staggered by the level of injustice.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringTransportAir pollutionPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As she takes on big tech in The Iris Affair, she talks about nerves, AI nightmares – and battling a malevolent supercomputerFri 10 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTShareExplosions weren’t a problem, nor were the guns, fire, multiple fights and a spell underwater – but dealing with cockroaches? The line was drawn. “That was the one stunt we weren’t allowed to do,” saysNiamh Algarwith a laugh, “because cockroaches are actually quite dangerous.” Plus, she says with a wry smile, you can’t train one not to bite. It’s not too much of a spoiler to say her character in the new Sky Atlantic show The Iris Affair has a run-in with a bug infestation – CGI it turns out, and fakes made by the props team – that makes her other encounters with corrupt police, internet sleuths and a potentially malevolent megaquantum computer seem tame.Algar, most recently seen in the ITV thrillerPlaying Nicewith James Norton earlier this year, plays Iris Nixon, a genius who is on the run having disappeared with a notebook that contains the encrypted activation sequence needed to “wake” a supercomputer. She stole it from Cameron Beck (a typically wonderful Tom Hollander), who has borrowed vast amounts of money so that in a brutalist bunker somewhere in the Italian mountains he can make the machine, named Charlie Big Potatoes – “well, he’s not small potatoes,” says Beck of the most powerful computer ever built. His life now depends on getting it going again.View image in fullscreen‘Could AI wipe out the human race? It’s a terrifying concept – and a very relevant question right now’ Niamh Algar photographed  in London for the Guardian.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIt’s fast and fun, while also getting at the big existential questions about technology, consciousness, ethics and whether we’re all on a runaway train – right now, with AI – that will wipe out humanity. “I think if you were to look at a narrative like this 20 years ago you would be like, that’s so sci-fi,” says Algar. “I don’t think we realised how quickly technology was going to advance. The idea of building a computer and technology that is so advanced that it might have the capability to solve huge questions, like the cure for cancer? But then, does it also have the ability to wipe out the human race? It all depends on the hands controlling it, and it is a terrifying concept – and a very relevant question right now.” Iris, she says, “is very suspicious of the whole thing, and I think there’s reason for it.”We don’t ever get to know much about Iris, only that she is superhumanly clever, supremely capable and physically strong (she also has a nice way with tailoring). Is it hard to play someone without any backstory? “No, I think it’s more interesting because sometimes you feel like you have to honour a backstory.” Though she did come up with a bit of her history, which she sent toNeil Cross, the writer (who also createdLuther), just to give herself a foothold.“She’s not like anyone I’ve got to play before,” she says, when we speak over Zoom, with Algar at home in London. “It was hugely enjoyable. And to play an enigmatic genius, it’s fascinating to get inside that.” Iris also doesn’t go in for emotion, but Algar defends her against suggestions she may be a psychopath. It’s more, she says, “like a coming-of-age story for someone who, as an adult, is trying to understand emotion and relationships later in life. I look at her almost like this computer. She looks at something, she copies it, she stores it.”It’s a great role for Algar, whose first big breakthrough was as troubled young woman Dinah inShane Meadows’s 2019 Channel 4 seriesThe Virtuesand who starred as a consultant doctor under incredible stress in ITV’s 2023 dramaMalpractice. Both were tough and brave, but playing Iris, not someone wounded by trauma or particularly emotional was, says Algar with a small laugh, “really freeing”.View image in fullscreenData retrieval … Algar with Tom Hollander in The Iris Affair.Photograph: Sky UK Ltd/PAThis summer, she worked on a film in Ireland, based on Anna McPartlin’s novel The Last Days of Rabbit Hayes, in which a dying woman is surrounded by family and friends. “It was a beautiful script,” says Algar, and it was also the first time she had worked on a production where there was a mental health adviser on set. Just as intimacy coordinators now routinely work on sets, to ensure comfort and safety in vulnerable scenes, the emotional toll of acting seems to be taken more seriously. Of course it’s acting but, says Algar, “you are exploring emotions and you can trigger something within you that you didn’t realise. You have to be mindful that you’re portraying the human condition and not take for granted that sometimes your body doesn’t know the difference.”Algar grew up in Mullingar in Ireland, the youngest of five. There was an arts centre opposite her primary school and she remembers taking drama workshops there, and falling in love with acting. “It just brought me so much joy. It’s a sense of play that is, for me, hugely addictive. I think it’s escapism. You’re escaping into a different world, putting on someone else’s shoes for a moment.” She wasn’t from a family with connections to the arts – her father was a mechanic, her mother a nurse – but becoming an actor didn’t feel as if it was an impossibility. “I looked at it as a huge, exciting challenge,” she says. She moved to Dublin to study design, her parents encouraging her to think about a more stable job, while also taking acting classes, writing and performing in theatre roles; alongside that, she had worked as a runner and in the art department on film sets.Having moved to London, it was her role in The Virtues, starring Stephen Graham, that allowed her to give up her pub and temping jobs to focus on auditions. Algar had grown up watching Meadows’s films. “He gave me a huge sense of ownership over character,” she says. “He instils an immense work ethic.” Was it intimidating to go on to a show such as that, so early in her career? Did she have self-doubt or imposter syndrome? “I think imposter syndrome is unavoidable, like, I didn’t train, I didn’t do the drama school way into acting.” When Algar first came to London, she says, she planned to say she had been to drama school in Ireland. “But it’s not like medicine,” she says with a laugh, “where you go, yes, you need eight years’ experience to do that.”View image in fullscreenIn cahoot … Algar with Julianne Moore in Mary & George.Photograph: Rory Mulvey/Sky UKSurely, with the career she is building, she doesn’t feel like that now? “I don’t know if it’s ever going to go away,” she says. Algar remembers Julianne Moore, on Sky’s historical dramaMary & George– Algar played her lover – admitting to nerves before filming. “I was like, how areyounervous? You’ve got Academy awards, you’ve worked with some of the most established film-makers, it always looks effortless.” It’s that old quote, she points out, about the moment you think you know everything is the moment you stop learning. “So I think imposter syndrome has benefits to it. Every set is different. You always feel like you’re going back to school on every production, and I don’t think I’ve ever met an actor that’s not said they’ve been nervous.”Is there added pressure when you’re the lead? It’s not that it doesn’t enter her head, she says, but “you take it week by week”. She was inspired by the actor Helen McCrory on the BBC drama MotherFatherSon. It was one of Algar’s first jobs and she had long admired McCrory; she was excited to have a big scene with her but it was cut, the news delivered by McCrory herself, who then stayed for a long chat, dispensing career advice. Most other lead actors, she says, wouldn’t have thought anything of allowing a runner to tell the unknown actor their scene had been cut. McCrory lobbied for a smaller scene to be shot. “I’ll never forget that, because that is the definition of a generous actor.”So now, leading a production such as The Iris Affair, she says, “it’s being aware that you can set the tone.” She adds, “Tom [Hollander] is brilliant in that sense.” Presumably, their quantum computer co-star Charlie Big Potatoes was less good. The day before we speak, Algar saw the viral clips ofTilly Norwood, the AI-generated actor that has drawn condemnation from actors and performing arts unions. “I think as humans, we connect to each other on a very human level, and I don’t think you can ever replace that.” Then she adds with a laugh, “I try not to think about it too much.”The Iris Affair starts on Thursday 16 October, Sky Atlantic, 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The island has become emblematic of the most heated debate in travel: overtourism – and how to tackle it.The island’s Calviá region, home of Magaluf, this week played host to the annual Abta convention for Britain’s tourism industry. And tourism doesn’t get much more industrial than here.Straight out from an evening bash at the upmarket Nikki Beach club, a short walk through British pubs, kebab shops and purveyors of I ❤️ DOGGY STYLE T-shirts led delegates to the party end of the Strip, where bar ambassadors come out in force to lure in the punters.“Beer and two shots, four euros?” one offers. The Guardian declines. The man reconsiders: “Titties?”Prominent signs in English advise €300-€400 (£261-£348) penalties for nudity, fighting and drunkenness on the street. On an October weeknight, the patrolling police aren’t overstretched – but it’s early yet, only midnight, and as one seasoned resident warns: “It gets a bit dirty after 2am.”View image in fullscreenStreet signs in English warning of fines for behaviour along the Magaluf Strip.Photograph: Gwyn Topham/The GuardianBut the main business was in the Abta conference hall. Debates on overtourism and homilies on“slow travel”peppered the agenda for an industry grappling with the realisation that, despite the tantalising invitations on the Strip, not everyone wants them there.Mallorca is one of many destinations where locals have demonstrated against overtourism: this June, thousands marched through the capital in protest. But diagnoses of the problem – and potential remedies in a country whose annual flow of Britons exceeds all others – divided the convention.Thestrategy in Spain’s new marketing campaign is chasing diversification rather than numbers: urging visitors to go inland, stay longer, try things such as “astrotourism and oleo tourism”, watching the next eclipse from a parador and sampling the olive oil.Steve Heapy, chief executive of mass market holiday operator Jet2, read the runes: “They want less tourists, but they want them to be richer. I don’t think it’s very fair. Why should holidays be only available to a certain subset of the population?”Prices in lesser-visited Galicia up north were even cheaper, Spain’s tourist office protested. UK director Manuel Butler says: “Like fast fashion, we have had fast tourism … We have to slow down, have more contact with people and explore more deeply the destination.”Tourism should be “resilient, inclusive, and beneficial to visitors and residents alike” – and places such as Magaluf, he says, “have to target a different clientele, people are who not looking to get drunk and make a noise. It’s the reality.”A decade-long strategy in Palma has massively increased its stock of small upmarket hotels for year-round breaks; it is bidding to become Spain’s next European capital of culture. Calvía and Magaluf have been following on a similar path: 80% of the hotels are now four or five star. Tens of millions of euros have been invested in cleaning up and improving the beach. And, as Calvía’s mayor Juan Antonio Amengual Guasp proudly told the auditorium, Magaluf now hosts a literary festival.It is a difficult balance for a place reliant on tourist income, with expats also a significant population; Amengual says Magaluf has “achieved a harmonious relationship between tourists and residents over the decades, and that has not changed.” But, he concedes, local discontent with tourism was “a reality” worldwide.View image in fullscreenEnglish breakfast in Magaluf.Photograph: Schoening/AlamyThe UK managing director of the travel giant Tui, Neil Swanson, was conciliatory: “They are in charge, right? Clearly we’re bringing money into the local economy, but it’s got to work for you in other social ways, and maybe not all tourism has. It needs to feel right for the local community, and for the guests coming in.”Abta’s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, says: “If you can extract more value that’s good.” But, he adds: “If they don’t want us, we won’t go. People like Jet2 will fly their planes somewhere else.”Heapy says the anti-tourism protests were having an impact, albeit small, after headlines about kill-a-tourist graffiti in Tenerife: “We’ve had many people writing into us and ringing our call centre saying, is it safe to go to Spain?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Visitor numbers from January to May this year were 9% higher than in 2019, while the peak summer months remained static.Heapy is unconvinced: “People want that Mediterranean holiday in the summer months. I live in Manchester. It’s pretty grim – it’s cold, dark and wet. I want to get away to the sun, and if it’s hot, well great.”Others sense further change ahead. “You’ve got to look to see what’s coming,” says Cathy Sasson, owner of Pirates, a Magaluf landmark whose “swashbuckling immersive dinner show” (★★★★★ – the Daily Star) claims to have entertained 4 million people over 40 years. “A few years ago nobody served calamari. Now if you’re in a restaurant and it didn’t have salt and pepper squid you’d be disappointed.”Pirates sticks resolutely to one meal: chicken and chips with corn on the cob, even for its late-night adult show. But Magaluf, she says, is “not what it was in the old days”. Is she sad? “No – my dad would never let me out!”Nonetheless, she says: “No one wants people to stop drinking. We’re Brits, we go on holiday, and we like a drink. But it’s how they come and how they drink.”On the Strip, the lunchtime after the night before, barmaid Emma is opening up at Lennons pub and putting the bins out. “I think it probably will change,” she says, smiling a little sadly. Only one punter is here this early, Steve Davis, 75, from Coventry, holidaying to visit family here. He shows a photo of himself 17 years ago dressed as Elvis, in the nearby Three Lions pub: “I couldn’t remember, but my niece said it was in Magaluf.”These parts, he says, haven’t altered much: “I’ll be here till closing.” His Heineken and Guinnesses, though, are zero-alcohol: “Cirrhosis of the liver.”Ainhoa Paredes Penades, a journalist with Telecinco, grew up in Calvía, when visiting Magaluf upset her: “All the people working there were talking to me in English, I felt a stranger in my own island.”Now, she says, Spanish locals have rediscovered Magaluf. “This summer, several friends asked me if I’d been, saying the water is really clear. They wanted to transform Magaluf as a better tourist destination – but now there are more Mallorcans going there with their family as well. You see the change.”Explore more on these topicsSpainMallorca holidaysSpain holidaysTravel & leisureEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tracking back? Not for us, thanks. Too many wanted to do their own thing and itground Tuchel down in the end. The German is a coach who wants structure, identity, sacrifice and energy. At PSG, though, he saw how individualism can bring a dressing room down. How could Tuchel make his mark when he had players who would moan if a teammate looked at them the wrong way?And so to the question of England, celebrity and the power of the collective. It was with a good sense of timing that Steven Gerrard analysed the failures of the“egotistical losers” of the golden generationthis week. Club rivalries were a problem and the English obsession with star names was a hindrance. It is not a surprise that Tuchel, unafraid to risk bruising the odd ego or two, wants to create something different as he plots how to end England men’s long wait for a trophy at next summer’s World Cup.‘The stadium was silent’: Tuchel critical of England support during Wales winRead more“We are building the best team” has been a regular refrain from Tuchel over the past week. There has been no backtrackingover the omission of Jude Bellingham, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden. “The radical statement is that we don’t collect the most talented players,” Tuchel said beforeEngland’s friendly victory against Waleson Thursday. “We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team.”Tuchel’s career offers pointers about his apparent power play with Bellingham. Having Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani at his disposal did not make PSG stronger in the crunch Champions League games, and there were problems at Bayern Munich with certain key players. At Chelsea, though, Tuchel’s greatest triumph –winning the Champions League in 2021– came with a counterattacking and defensively brilliant team. The key player during that run was N’Golo Kanté. Thiago Silva, a model professional, and the selfless, counterpressing Mason Mount were also vital.Chelsea were defiant, unflinching. WithEngland, Tuchel’s mission is to forge a brotherhood. He shrugged off questions about whether leaving out his best creative players before the Wales game was a gamble too far. He backed his calls and was rewarded when England destroyed Craig Bellamy’s side with goals from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka during a brutal first half.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel won the Champions League with a Chelsea team that were defensively solid and threatening on the counter.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAWe are starting to see Tuchel’s England take shape. Dynamic full-backs overlap, there is pace on the flanks (a crucial element if Harry Kane is to thrive at the World Cup) and balance is provided by Elliot Anderson’s emerging midfield partnership with Declan Rice. “We are getting there,” Tuchel said after the 3-0 win. “In Serbia it looked like club football and today it looked like club football.”Leaving aside whether England will be able to replicate the physicality of a Premier League style in the heat expected at many of the venues in the US, Mexico and Canada, it is worth considering the role of Rogers in the position usually occupied by Bellingham. “A humble player, a physical player … a very talented player,” was Tuchel’s verdict on the 23-year-old. More talented than Bellingham, though? Obviously not. Nobody doubts Bellingham’s ability. The 22-year-old is one of the best in the world. How do you leave out a player who, with disaster fast approaching, can keep his team in a tournament with alast-minute overhead kick?The answer lies in looking at the wider picture; in remembering that Bellingham was often playing his own game at Euro 2024. Tuchel calls him a special talent. But while he haswithdrawn the infamous “repulsive” remark, he has not taken back what he said about Bellingham needing to channel his edge towards his opponents and not to intimidating teammates or referees. None of this feels accidental. Pointing to Bellingham only just returning from shoulder surgery is convenient. Tuchel has talked about players needing to accept “the hierarchy within the team”. After the Wales game he said the door is open for “top quality, top characters” to return.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bellingham can come back but if he does there will be no special treatment. It is a fascinating situation. The smart money remains on Bellingham going to the World Cup but Tuchel has created a world in which he stays at home. The challenge is balancing the pros and cons. Bellingham would undoubtedly be an asset if he accepts Tuchel’s tactical demands and does not try to win the tournament on his own.But this is not going to be the Bellingham team. If anything this is still the Kane team. The captain reports for duty every time, fulfils his media duties without complaint and leads by example. Vincent Kompany, Kane’s manager at Bayern, talks about the forward’s work ethic off the ball. The goals are inevitable; the effort out of possession sets the standard for others to follow.This is what Tuchel craves. He would not be drawn into imagining whether he could possibly leave Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer on the bench in a World Cup game. He threw the focus on to the players who are performing for him now. England have played well without Bellingham in successive fixtures. Tuchel is fashioning a team, with Rogers as an updated version of Mount. His time at Bayern and PSG showed him what happens when it is every man for himself.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think we deserved it.”The victory was reward for a strong performance, particularly in the first half, but the man at heart of it, captain Conor Bradley, picked up a cheap late yellow card that rules him out of Monday’s visit ofGermany.Northern Ireland 2-0 Slovakia, Sweden 0-2 Switzerland: World Cup qualifying clockwatch – as it happenedRead moreBradley had looked like a man on a mission from the start as Northern Ireland played with energy and desire and it was the Liverpool man who sparked the move for the opening goal. He picked out Ethan Galbraith in space inside the box, and the Swansea midfielder pulled back a low cross which the hapless Hrosovsky turned into his own net.The second came on 80 minutes when Dubravka, unconvincing in commanding his area for much of the night, punched the ball weakly and it landed for Hume to lift it back over him and into an unguarded net.Michael O’Neill had refused to call this a must-win, but the reality was they needed all three points to keep pace in European Group A, in which Northern Ireland,Slovakiaand Germany now all have six points from three games.Joshua Kimmich netted twice to powerGermanyto a 4-0 home win overLuxembourgafter the visitors went down to 10 men in the first half.

The Real Madrid forward opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time and set up Adrien Rabiot for the second, with substitute Florian Thauvin adding the third to put Les Bleus on nine points from three games and give Didier Deschamps’ side a chance to secure qualification on Monday when they travel to Iceland.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé celebrates opening the scoring for France against Azerbaijan.Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images“We got the result we wanted but not the performance – especially in the first half,” said Deschamps. “Our ball circulation was too slow, it was all a bit too flat.

Not against aNewcastleteam who surrendered so meekly during the opening 40 minutes that this clash was anything but the feisty northern derby it had been billed.Alex Sanderson’s side were 31-0 up and in total control at half-time after running in five tries, before adding another four after the break in front of a paltry 5,785 crowd. There will be far greater challenges forSale. There has to be. It cannot always be this easy.Exeter’s Brown-Bampoe in the fast lane for great things for club and countryRead moreStill, for Sanderson the nine-try blitz was a welcome antidote to last week’s defeat at champions Bath and a reminder of Sale’s strength on home soil with a second bonus-point victory of the season in Salford. For England coach Steve Borthwick, there were also plenty of reasons for optimism from a Sale perspective, with winger Tom Roebuck claiming centre stage with a clinical hat-trick.“Tom has been training with a sprint coach down at Loughborough and that’s not just him – a few of the squad go down,” said Sanderson. “It looked like it showed with how he stepped in off the right foot coming infield. I don’t think he’d hit his straps so far this season, so there were conversations with him this week about him actually stepping up. He trained really well and goes and performs like that.”For Newcastle, still in the early throes of their post-Red Bull takeover reconstruction, this was another night to forget as they slumped to a third straight defeat. They lie in familiar territory at the bottom of the table and have already conceded a whopping 134 points.Coach Alan Dickens defended his players after their abject first-half display, saying: “I would never question their desire. Every time they step on the field they put their bodies on the line.”View image in fullscreenSale’s Nathan Jibulu, advancing past the challenge of Newcastle’s Tom Gordon, made another big impact after coming on.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images for Sale SharksSale were missing the Curry twins through injury but Luke Cowan-Dickie made his first appearance since featuring in the British and Irish Lions’ summer tour of Australia.The England hooker will hope to feature in next month’s autumn internationals along with the likes of Joe Carpenter, Roebuck, George Ford, Bevan Rodd and Asher Opoku-Fordjour.

As he tried to find a way past Britain’s Cameron Norrie in the first round, the Russian simply did not feel comfortable striking the ball.With his prospects of advancing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world dwindling, the 29-year-old settled on a drastic solution. Medvedev requested completely different strings when he sent his rackets to be restrung mid-match, switching from a hybrid of natural gut and polyester strings to a full polyester setup.It is normal for players to alter their string tension during a match, but few would consider a change as dramatic as the actual string type. Medvedev has now made the switch many times this year: “Until 2023 I had never done it,” Medvedev says. “Something started to change on tour, I had to adapt. Now I’m never sure.”‘We rewatched an Ajax match’: What really happens when tennis anti-dopers callRead moreThe world No 18 is referring to the properties of the tennis balls on tour and how slight changes in recent years have left him uncertain how to optimise his game. The quality of balls across the tour has been one of the most significant talking points and sources of frustration among players around the world. “That’s probably the biggest difference I can notice, compared to maybe 10, 15 years ago,” Novak Djokovic says. “It’s the balls.”One of many significant challenges in elite tennis is adjusting to the differing conditions each week, including the constantly changing balls. Different tournaments have their own contracts with ball manufacturers, which present other issues. Injuries are often attributed to players having to adjust to different types of balls.There is a growing consensus that many different balls decay at a faster rate than ever before, which Emma Raducanu describes as difficult to navigate and another injury hazard: “I do think the balls are a big challenge for all of us,” says Raducanu. “The way that they deteriorate is really challenging. I think it gets very fluffy. You see a lot of wrist, elbow, shoulder injuries happening now. And it is hard because the dynamic of the points can be different from when they’re new to when they’re old.”New tennis balls are encased in a tight layer of felt but, as they make contact with the racket strings and court surface, it fluffs up, making them less aerodynamic. They travel through the air more slowly, meaning it is harder to hit winners as fluffier balls lead to more prolonged rallies. Many players believe they fluff up more quickly today. At least some of these issues can be attributed to production line problems in factories during the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the consistency and quality of the felt provided by the suppliers to the tennis ball manufacturing companies.View image in fullscreenDaniil Medvedev says since 2023 he is ‘never sure’ about how tennis balls will behave during a match.Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAs players try to adjust, the sport itself is changing. Less powerful players such as Norrie now believe it is even more difficult to impose their game with some balls. “I think that the ball’s getting messed up easier in some tournaments,” he says. “For players like me and Daniil, it’s not easy to generate as much power as other players, and that’s cost me, or it’s easier for other players. But, to be honest, I’m never complaining about the balls.”Those who generate significant amounts of topspin have also felt the differences. A livelier ball accentuates the effects of heavy topspin, allowing the ball to bounce higher and rise further outside the opponent’s strike zone. Casper Ruud, who possesses one of the game’s most spin-heavy forehands, believes his strokes are less potent due to the balls: “I feel like the players are handling my heavy shots like way better now than when I came on tour, which was pre-Covid, and they’re able to just step in and rip the damn thing back and I’m kind of surprised how well people do it.”Many players have addressed their issues with the balls by incorporating natural gut strings in their rackets alongside polyester strings, which helps to generate more power. Others shift to a looser string tension when they feel they are struggling to generate pace with certain balls. As is often the case in tennis, however, a disadvantage for one player is another player’s asset. None of this has stopped Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner from dominating the sport this year. Both possess such destructive weapons that they can still generate massive speed off slower balls.Nobody has been more outspoken on this subject than Medvedev. Two and a half years after holding the No 1 ranking, he is trying to find a way through one of the most difficult periods of his career. The Russian, who has achieved one of his best results of the year this week by reaching the Shanghai Masters semi-finals, now sits at No 18 in the ATP rankings and he frequently describes the balls as his biggest obstacle.Medvedev says he does not want to be known as the player “crying” after every match, but says he is just being honest: “Some players will like this ball, so I get it,” he says. “I’m crying because it disadvantages me. But if you take six balls out of the new balls out of the can, if you look closely and you bounce them, there are going to be six different balls. I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to be.”Explore more on these topicsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to some reports his entire series could even be in jeopardy.England beware: terminally obsessed Marnus Labuschagne has gone back to basics | Jonathan LiewRead moreAndrew McDonald, Australia’s head coach, looked to temper those fears on Friday but conceded that, with his captain needing at least “four, four and a half weeks” of bowling in the nets to get ready – something that is yet to get under way – it is getting “tight”.For Brook, whose England white-ball side fly to New Zealand this weekend in advance of the Ashes tour, the loss of a quick who has dominated recent encounters – including notable success against Joe Root – would clearly be significant.“Obviously he is an amazing bowler and has been for many years; he bowls at high pace with high skill,” said Brook, speaking at the Toyota Professional Cricketers’ Association Awards on Thursday. “With him out of their side for the first game, from [the reports] we’ve seen, hopefully that plays into our hands.“But they have a hell of a lot of good, quick bowlers out there. Guys who can come into the side and, when their tails are up, they can plough through teams. So we can’t take anybody lightly.”Scott Boland is the likeliest quick to replace Cummins and, having claimed 49 Test wickets on Australian soil at an average of 12.6, any drop-off with the ball should in theory be minimal. Thereafter Australia’s fast bowler stocks are untested, reflecting close to a decade of dominance by Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.Quick GuideCox and Lamb win awardsShowJordan Cox and Emma Lamb were the big winners at the Professional Cricketers' Association annual awards in partnership with Toyota, whille Davina Perrin and Rehan Ahmed were also recognised as rising stars of the game.After a prolific season with Essex and Hundred winners Oval Invincibles, Cox beat Test star Joe Root, Dom Sibley and Ed Barnard to be named Toyota PCA men's player of the year in a ceremony at London's White City on Thursday night.Cox, who is preparing for England's T20 series in New Zealand later this month and will also shadow the Ashes squad with the Lions, said: \"It's an honour for the players to vote for me, when it's your peers and your team-mates that really means the world. On the Lions trip I want to show the selectors I'm capable of playing Test cricket.\"I've got a crazy busy winter and there's a T20 World Cup coming up so hopefully if I continue performing I might get a chance.\"Lancashire batter Lamb, currently in Sri Lanka at the World Cup, claimed the Toyota PCA women's player of the year ahead of her captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, as well as Georgia Elwiss and last year's winner Kathryn Bryce.Speaking at the PCA Awards in partnership with Toyota, she said: \"It was nice to find out I had won after our second game in the World Cup, so it was great timing. I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of weeks to see what we can achieve.\"The young player prizes went to Perrin, who lit up the Hundred with a stunning 42-ball century for champions Northern Superchargers, and Ahmed, whose career-best season helped Leicestershire to the Division Two title in the Rothesay County Championship.\"It's almost surreal, I'd never played in front of crowds as big as in The Hundred and when you've got a great team around you it makes it even more special,\" said Perrin.Ahmed, who took his batting to a new level with five first-class hundreds, also set his sights on higher honours after missing out on Ashes selection.He said: \"My red-ball season was great and I want to be a regular in the England team - it's more important to me than the white-ball stuff, so being given the opportunity to perform and then repaying the coaches with my form for Leicestershire has been great.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Matt Roberts/ICCWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.While Australia sweat on Cummins, England are growing increasingly confident that Ben Stokes will be ready from the start of the series following the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the fifth Test against India. The all-rounder has now returned to full training and has been building up his bowling both with Durham and at Loughborough.The question of Stokes’s fitness is particularly acute for Brook, having replaced Ollie Pope as vice-captain for this tour and thus an injury away from leading the team for the first time in an away Ashes Test. Part of his role as consigliere will be to step in when Stokes is attempting one of his marathon spells and potentially prevent this from happening.Brook said: “It’s an honour to have any leadership role. But it’s not something that I’m biting at the bit to do. If you want it too much, then it’s not a good thing. And I see Stokesy playing all five Tests, if I’m being honest. I think he’ll power through even if he has a little niggle.“Everybody in the world knows what he’s like, his character and the way that he just cracks on. That is the way that the team is built now; everybody keeps going. If you do have a little niggle, just power through – and that is what he does so well.“Because he wants to bowl long spells, that can sometimes be to his detriment. But he told us last year as a group that if he gets into a position like that again, then go up and have a word with him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 26-year-old suspected it was coming his way and says he and Pope have been in contact since.“I dropped him a couple of messages a couple of weeks ago, talking about golf mainly,” said Brook. “I don’t think he’s too bothered; he’s just happy to still be in the squad. He is a vital part of the team, batting at No 3, and we all know how valuable his runs are.”As regards his own runs, once six white-ball internationals in New Zealand are out of the way, Brook will be playing his first red-ball cricket in Australia. A spell with Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League in 2021-22 returned only 44 runs from seven innings – an experience Brook described as going “horrendously” and one he is “trying to erase” from his memory.Brook added: “I haven’t had too much experience of the pitches out there, so I have to stay in the moment as much as possible and play what’s in front of me.“I don’t know what I’m stepping into. I know [an away Ashes] is a massive thing but I’m still trying to get over that India series. To play 25 days out of 25 days was mega. That was the most intense series I’ve ever been part of. If the Ashes tops that, I will be a very happy man.”Asked if England will be returning home with the urn, Brook replied: “I bloody hope so”.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025 - 26Harry BrookEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Almost everywhere you turn in the town, there is a nod to the great players and triumphs Wigan recalls with immense pride.The modern era has not exactly been short on supply when it comes to similar memorable moments but in terms of teams and players that will stand the test of time, it is not unreasonable to suggest this current incarnation of Wigan Warriors is on the verge of entering the pantheon of the club’s all-time greats.Ask anyone for their standout Wigan team and most would almost certainly reply with the team of the late 1980s and early 1990s that ­dominated the sport. Martin Offiah, Shaun Edwards, Ellery Hanley, Andy Farrell et al. That Wigan side is the only one to have won three league titles in succession – and they went on to win seven in a row.Mr Hull KR: real-life hero of Post Office IT scandal bankrolls club to verge of treble gloryRead moreThe only Wigan side until now, perhaps. Victory over Hull KR in Saturday’s Grand Final would guarantee a third straightSuper Leaguetitle for Matt Peet and his squad, only the fourth time in rugby league’s 130-year history such a feat would have been achieved by any club, not just its most successful.Their captain, Liam Farrell, grew up idolising the greats of that ­legendary Wigan team which included his own cousin. The scale of what he and his teammates could achieve is not lost on the 35-year-old. “I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t on my mind, the three in a row,” Farrell said this week.“It’s been spoken about a lot this week, the opportunity we have here. That Wigan team you speak about did a lot more than win three in a row but to be involved in three is not lucky, it’s four or five years of hard work. We’re 80 minutes away from that and I believe we can go down as one of Wigan’s great teams. To do that as captain would mean a lot.”Having wonan unprecedented quadruple last yearand dominated the British game for the best part of three years, it is not unreasonable to question what still motivates this Wigan squad. For Farrell, the drive to get up and go again is twofold.“Honestly, I still have a fear of ­losing,” he smiles. “I hate losing and, being part of this club, it’s built on success and winning.” But ­having swept the board last year, Farrell also admits to being slightly irked by watching Saturday’s opponents, Hull KR, lift the first two trophies of this year. They are now the ones trying to deny the Robins a historic treble.“It really stings seeing other teams take your trophies off you,” he says. “What we had the year before, and the trophies metaphorically disappear from your cabinet but they do deserve it. Hull KR have been great but make no mistake, it’s added to our motivation to get this last one of the year, seeing them win the others.”This has quickly emerged into Super League’s most compelling rivalry. Hull KR return to Old Trafford looking to avenge the9-2 loss on this stagelast year, and they have shown this season they are very much the equals of Wigan. But there is more that binds these two great clubs than divides them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That point is not lost on the Wiganer who has driven this revolution, Peet.“A lot of rugby league towns are like that, small communities, ­working class,” Peet said this week. “A lot of people have their challenges in life so if we can give them a break from that and inspire a little bit of positivity then it’s a good start. If we have 28,000 fans here at the weekend, I probably knew a lot of them before I got the job and got to know a lot more since.“I know a lot of people are ingrained in the community and they support me. Also, it brings a pressure no doubt, but it’s one that I enjoy.”Wigan are favourites once again this weekend and so, perhaps not today, or maybe even tomorrow, would the Warriors’ achievement fully be appreciated, if they manage three in a row? In the years to come, this group would surely be spoken of as one of rugby league’s – not just Wigan’s – all-time great sides.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Willie Mullins, Gordon Elliott, Charles Byrnes and Tony Martin all have leading candidates for the latest renewal of the historic stayers’ handicap at Newmarket on Saturday.Martin, who was serving a ban for a doping offence 12 months ago, is back on the licence as the trainer of last year’s winner, Alphonse Le Grande, who edged home by a nose, lost the race a few days later due for a whip offence by his jockey, and then got it back on appeal.He would create another piece of Cesarewitch history if he could become the first horse to win twice for different trainers, but he is 4lb higher in the weights and there has been just one dual winner in the race’s 186-year history.Mullins, who won three times in a row from 2018, has three live candidates headed by the lightly raced Bunting, but he is not obviously well handicapped off 95 and there is better each-way value elsewhere.Elliott, by contrast, is still waiting for a Cesarewitch winner but he has decent contenders in Ndaawi andMordor(3.40)and the latter looks overpriced at around 20-1.The five-year-old ran well to finish eighth in the Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham off 130 and an excellent second at Glorious Goodwood in August suggests he has a big run in him on Saturday off his Flat mark of 88.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewmarket1.15 Gladius 1.50 Allegresse 2.25 Pathein 3.00 Distant Storm (nb) 3.40 Mordor (nap) 4.15 Blue To Blue 4.50 Alfa KellenicYork1.30 Division 2.05 Erzindjan 2.40 He’s Waliim 3.15 Binhareer 3.55 Joulany 4.30 Ribble Vibe 5.05 I Still Have FaithChepstow1.35 Ammes 2.10 My Friend Sean 2.45 Destroytheevidence 3.20 French Ship 4.00 Moutarde 4.35 Thistle Ask 5.10 MarlacooHexham1.55 We Got Your Back 2.30 At Vimeiro 3.05 Pismo Beach 3.45 Jupiter Des Mottes 4.20 Roger Pol 4.55 Easy Bucks 5.25 HourmanWolverhampton4.10 Typeface 4.45 Shetakesthegold 5.20 Miss Ayala 5.50 Nala’s Dream 6.20 Hasiyna 6.50 Ever Driven 7.20 Schemeya 7.50 Basholo 8.20 LhebayebWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newmarket 1.15:Lightly racedGladiusis two-from-three at this unusual trip and ran well on his Group-race debut at York last time.York 1.30:Divisionhas progressed by the race since his debut in late August and looks more than ready for the step into Listed company.Newmarket 1.50:There is plenty of stamina on the dam’s side ofAllegresse’s pedigree and this marathon test by juvenile standards could see further improvement.York 2.05:The draw did forErzindjanin the Cambridgeshire last time but he was clear of the next horse home on his side and is just 1lb higher here.Newmarket 2.25:Pathein’sdefeat of the promising Lyneham on debut was franked by the runner-up’s victory next time and Ed Dunlop’s colt looks overpriced at around 12-1.Newmarket 3.00:Zavateri and Gstaad top the ratings for the Dewhurst Stakes and are closely matched on their form when first and second in the National Stakes, but the progressiveDistant Stormposted a very strong time when nearly five lengths clear of his field in a Group Three last month and could prove more than a match for them.York 3.15:Binhareersuffered early interference last time but still finished within four lengths of the winner, has been dropped 1lb since and has a useful low draw.Precise takes O’Brien closer to recordAidan O’Brien is within sight of his own record of 28 Group One wins in a calendar year after Precise, the new 5-1 favourite for next year’s 1,000 Guineas, took his 2025 tally at the highest level to 22 with a convincing success in the Fillies’ Mile, the feature event on day one of the Future Champions weekend at Newmarket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was O’Brien’s second winner of a juvenile fillies’ Group One in the space of six days, following Diamond Necklace’s success in the Prix Marcel Boussac last weekend, and third in the last fortnight since True Love’s victory in the Cheveley Park Stakes last month.“She looks very special and everything she has done from day one has been so easy, so we were never sure how good she was,” O’Brien said. “She looks serious and it reminded me of [the 2015 winner] Minding [who went on to five Group Ones at three].“She’s doing everything so easy. She’s a total natural athlete so you never do too much at home with her, but these races, like this and the Boussac, you like to see them in there so you know what you have for next year.“She was out very quick and what you love about her is she sailed down to the two-furlong pole and at that point you thought she was going to win. By the time she got to the seven it was over.”O’Brien rarely lets the juvenile turf races at the Breeders’ Cup meeting pass without a fancied runner from Ballydoyle but he feels that both Precise and Diamond Necklace have done enough for the year.“When those special ones come along you have to look after them and give them a chance and let them mature over the winter,” he said. “I’d say we’ll put her away and we’ll train her for the Classics.”A Ballydoyle filly that could be on the way to San Diego, though, is Minnie Hauk, the Oaks winner in England and Ireland this summer, whowent down narrowly to Daryzafter setting off as the favourite for last Sunday’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe.“Minnie is very good, everything seems well with her and it’s possible she could be trained for the Breeders’ Cup Turf,” O’Brien said. “It would be good to see her in that, it’s a possible and obviously she has to go through her work and everything perfectly.”Minnie Hauk is priced up at around 4-1 for the Turf at Del Mar on 1 November.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A packed Twickenham international stage, with him playing on one wing for England and hisExeterteammate Manny Feyi-Waboso on the other. “Of course I’ve imagined that day,” he says, smiling broadly. If the double-barrelled whizz-kids continue their current form it might just happen sooner rather than later.Admittedly it is early days in the new Prem season but something potentially thrilling is stirring out west. Feyi-Waboso, after an injury-curtailed year, is back fit and firing with five tries in his opening two league games. The top-drawer Wallaby Len Ikitau has arrived to link up with Henry Slade in the Chiefs midfield and also lurking with intent is the 23-year-old Brown-Bampoe, a serious athlete with numerous strings to his bow.Not unlike Feyi-Waboso, who combines rugby with his medical studies, Brown-Bampoe is a world away from your run-of-the-mill pro. He has just completed a masters in finance to add to his BA in mechanical engineering and came close to pursuing a career in the City. As the Durham University graduate puts it: “I have that perspective of having been an intern at an investment bank, working 18-hour days and getting four hours of sleep a night. If this [opportunity with Exeter] didn’t come I was going back there.”Northampton welcome back Lions – and not a day too soon as Leicester loomRead moreSince then his on-field numbers have more than added up, with 21 tries in 23 games for Exeter in all competitions last season. Most striking of all, perhaps, is his firm belief that if he can develop his all-round game he is well placed to represent England at the highest level. “If I’m feeling supremely confident in all those other areas I really think that opportunity will come for me. Because, physically, I believe I’m there.”The Croydon-born Brown-Bampoe is also not the type to be intimidated by big-name opponents, unconcerned whether, say, the similarly hyphenated Louis Rees-Zammit might have outpaced him had the latter been fit to play for Bristol at Ashton Gate on Saturday. “It’s about what I can do to them, not what they can do to me. What I find works for me is realising I’m the superpower. I’m the one who’s going to be wreaking havoc on my opponents. That’s my aim anyway.”By now a couple of things should be becoming clear. Not only is Brown-Bampoe an endearingly entertaining character but a smart cookie intent on going places. He is even keener to fly the flag for late developers everywhere, having never even made a club academy as a scrawny youngster. “I really hope that’s inspiring for the late bloomers of the world who got rejected at a young age. Rugby is a late-developer sport.“There were boys I played with at school – great guys, my friends still – who were academy players and at 16 had the world at their feet. As a young lad who always wanted to be a professional sportsman I’d look at them and think: ‘I’m never going to get there.’ So I just focused on my academics. In a really roundabout way, I’ve ended up where I assumed they’d end up in life.”In his case his horizons changed when he grew seven inches during one teenage summer holiday break, fuelled by his mother’s Ghanaian-influenced home cooking. “She’d make a whole chicken every two days and I’d be demolishing it.” Now, at 6ft 3in and 99kg, he has even Feyi-Waboso casting envious glances in his direction. “It’s definitely healthy competition,” he says. “When I was out injured and was seeing Paul fly, it was crazy. I was just like: ‘Give the ball to Paul. Give it him.’ In training we do a lot of reps together to help each other. Yes, we’re fighting for the same position but we want each other to get better. It’s really good.”View image in fullscreenPaul Brown-Bampoe slips past Northampton’s James Ramm in their Prem match in late September.Photograph: Craig Mercer/AlamyNone of this will hugely surprise Brown-Bampoe’s classmates at Reed’s school in Surrey, where he was head boy. “Quite arrogantly I’d like to think they would have thought I was going to be prime minister,” he says. As it happens he wouldn’t be entirely averse to dipping his toe into politics one day: “I’m sure at some point politics is something I might be interested in.” So, not unlike the England captain, Maro Itoje? “He loves his politics doesn’t he? Yeah, me versus Maro. We’re all the same party.”For the moment, though, he has other priorities, his talent most strikingly underlined by the spectacular length-of-the-field try he scored at Sandy Parkagainst Bordeauxin last season’s Champions Cup. “I never doubted I made the right decision to play professional rugby from the minute I arrived here.” And his next overriding motivation is to follow his mate Feyi-Waboso into the Test arena. “Absolutely. 100%.

One of the best things that has happened to me in my career is that I get to be around an international winger day in day out. Straight away I knew I’m physically capable. In fact I might even be more physically capable.

If Feyi-Waboso doesn’t scorch past you, the chances are Brown-Bampoe will. And as they seek to blaze a trail for more players of west African heritage, Exeter’s twin threats are also demonstrating to every youngster that rugby and intellectual rigour can still smoothly coexist. “Limiting your opportunities at 16 years old is a terrible thing to do, in my opinion,” Brown-Bampoe says.“I like that feeling of being multifaceted and not being pigeonholed as a rugby player or an academic. I know I need something off the field. Otherwise I’ll just be thinking about rugby all the time and that’s not a good thing.” Future prime minister or not, don’t bet against him doubling up with Feyi-Waboso for club and country.Explore more on these topicsExeterPrem RugbyRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last month, that appeared to changeFri 10 Oct 2025 14.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareAfter nearly nine months in office, Donald Trump seems to have had enough of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, undermining his ambition to establish himself as a global peacemaker. Over the past few weeks, the US president finally decided to use his leverage to force Netanyahu to accept a new ceasefire and stop two years of genocidal war in Gaza.On Thursday, Israel and Hamasagreed to the first phaseof Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, including an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory. It’s unclear what guarantees the US gave to Hamas and Arab mediators to ensure that Netanyahu would not resume the war after the hostage-prisoner swap – if negotiations on later stages of the deal are stalled. That’s what happened earlier this year, when Netanyahu accepted a truce that took effect in January, but then refused to move into the second phase of negotiations with Hamas, andviolated the ceasefireafter two months.Back in March, Trump was still enamored with hispreposterous ideafor the US to take control of Gaza and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, displacing 2 million Palestinians. He showed little interest inpressuring Netanyahuto negotiate with Hamas to extend the ceasefire. But in recent weeks, Trump has become personally invested in ending the Gaza war – and his ego might be the one thing that keeps him engaged in preserving a peace agreement that essentially carries his name.It’s been clear since Trump took office that he’s the only world leader who could effectively pressure Netanyahu to end Israel’s war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and triggered a famine in parts of Gaza. The president has considerable leverage over the Israeli premier:billions of dollarsin American weapons and constant diplomatic support for Israel at the UN security council, including multiple US vetoes of ceasefire resolutions over the past two years. Like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Israel with a virtually unlimited supply of weapons after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Trump also refused to use his influence over Netanyahu. That allowed Israel to defy global outrage and isolation, and continue its onslaught.Beware Netanyahu: he is a master of self-interest – and that’s why he signed the Hamas ceasefire deal | Ben ReiffRead moreFor two years, Netanyahu has repeatedlysabotaged negotiationsand torpedoed potential deals by adding new conditions. He prolonged the war in an evident effort to avoid early parliamentary elections and block an inquiry into his government’s security failures that led to the Hamas attack. His clinging to power alsodelayed a corruption trialbased on an earlier stint as prime minister.Trump, who has faced his own series of charges and convictions in US courts, expressed empathy for Netanyahu, calling the legal case against the Israeli leader a “witch-hunt” that should be thrown out. Last year, the international criminal courtissued an arrest warrantfor Netanyahu on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity – and the Trump administration recently retaliated byimposing sanctionsagainst four ICC officials.But Trump appears to have soured on Netanyahu last month, after Israel launchedan attack against Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders who were meeting in Doha to consider a ceasefire proposal submitted by Arab and US mediators. The Hamas officials, including the group’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the airstrike on 9 September. But the attack outraged Qatar’s leaders, along with other US allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These three wealthy Gulf petrostates have each spent tens of billions of dollars on US weapons and other military assistance over the past two decades. They also all happen to have ongoing deals withTrump’s family businessfor branded real estate projects, hotels and golf resorts worth billions of dollars.Two weeks after the attack on Qatar, Trump met with a group of Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. The US administration then circulated a 21-point peace plan that emerged from that meeting, which included a ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner swap, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a transitional government led by an international body. The proposal also envisioned creating a temporary governing board for the territory that would be headed by Trump and would include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Trump planned to host Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September, and started pressuring the Israeli leader to prepare for a joint announcement. In the days leading up to that meeting, Netanyahu spent hours negotiating with two Trump confidants who had taken a lead role in drafting the new plan: Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the president’s longtime friend and Middle East envoy.According to reports inthe Israeli press, Netanyahu managed to make significant changes to the plan that Trump had negotiated with Arab and Muslim leaders. The prime minister altered the timing of Israeli troop withdrawals, enabling Israel to temporarily keep its forces in more than half of Gaza’s territory, even after Hamas released all of the Israeli hostages. Netanyahu also won concessions on requirements for Hamas to disarm and Israeli troops being ableto control a “security perimeter”inside Gaza until the territory is “properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. That could mean Israel would keep its forces in a section of Gaza indefinitely.At their White House announcement, Trump and Netanyahu presented the plan as anultimatum for Hamasto release the hostages and lay down its weapons, or face even more severe Israeli attacks – it was framed more as a surrender than a ceasefire. In a video posted after his meeting with Trump,Netanyahu boastedthat he got everything he wanted out of the US president. “Now the whole world, including the Arab and Muslim world, is pressuring Hamas to accept the terms that we created together with Trump, to bring back all the hostages – the living and the dead – while the IDF stays in the Strip,” Netanyahu said in Hebrew, in a message aimed at a domestic Israeli audience. “Who would have believed it?”Indeed, some Arab officials worried that Hamaswould reject the plan, partly because of Netanyahu’s last-minute amendments that reduced Israel’s commitment to fully withdraw from Gaza and to end the war.Hamas, which was facing pressure from two allies, Qatar and Turkey, did not refuse Trump’s deal, but didn’t fully embrace it. On 3 October, the group announced that it accepted some elements of the plan, while downplaying several key provisions, including those requiring it to disarm and give up any future role in governing Gaza. Hamas’s response was a qualified yes that called for more negotiations – and Netanyahu tried to frame it as arejection of Trump’s proposal.But the president jumped on the Hamas statement and finally pushed Netanyahu into accepting that an agreement was within reach. After Hamas issued its response,Axios reportedthat Trump had a tense call with Netanyahu, in which Trump snapped at the prime minister: “I don’t know why you’re always so fucking negative. This is a win. Take it.”Trump’s willingness to strong-arm Netanyahu was the key to achieving the initial deal that is supposed to lead to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in the coming days. The president will need to sustain that pressure on Netanyahu to make sure he doesn’t blow up the ceasefire, as he did in March, and resume Israel’s brutal war.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

On the world’s TV news broadcasts, the screen was split on Thursday: celebrations in Gaza and celebrations inIsrael, the scenes of cheering and clapping mirroring each other, as if to confirm that this was a war the peoples themselves wanted over long ago – and which most never wanted to begin.The images were not unfamiliar. We had seen a version of them in January, when a ceasefire was announced to great jubilation. That held only until mid-March, when Israel broke the agreement and resumed its bombardment ofGaza, an experience that should temper, and caveat, the current hope with the knowledge that things can unravel at any moment. Still, this time, even the region’s most seasoned pessimists concede, the deal looks more durable.So how did it come about and who deserves the credit? Often a breakthrough such as this is the result of both parties shifting their positions, more or less equally. At first glance, it can seem as if that is what happened here. Hamas was clearly weakened, with Israel having eliminated its leaders and diminished its great patron, Iran. And Donald Trump ensured that those states with leverage over Hamas – Qatar, Turkey and Egypt – pushed the organisation to say yes. (He did that using tools uniquely held by the US, agreeing, for example,a defence pact with Qatarthat gives the Gulf state Nato-level protection.)Even so, and despitethe best effortsof Benjamin Netanyahu’s advocates to suggest otherwise, Hamas was not forced to make a major shift in its stance. Trump’s 20-point plan might call for the group to hand over its weapons, but Hamas has made no commitment on that and there is no mention of it in the current, fairly narrow ceasefire agreement billed as the first phase of the deal.From the start, the group said it would hand over the hostages it held once Israel agreed to release Palestinian prisoners, eventually withdraw its forces from Gaza and end the war. Sure, the withdrawal will be done in stages, but those three moves are what Israel has broadly agreed to. AsMichael Milstein, a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence widely regarded as the country’s foremost analyst of Hamas, put it to me when we spoke: “Let’s face it, Hamas didn’t really change anything dramatically in its basic positions.”In other words, the big shift has been in the Israeli stance. Just a few days before Trump unveiled his plan at the White House with Netanyahu at his side, the Israeli prime minister was telling the UN in New York that the war would not end untilHamaswas entirely destroyed. Now he has agreed to a deal that leaves Hamas in place. He has accepted what he had previously deemed unacceptable. What got him to do that?The concise answer is that Donald Trump at last wielded the full might of his office and called time on the war. He left Netanyahu in no doubt that his patience had run out, confident that the Israeli PM had nowhere else to turn. Over the past two years, Netanyahu has shown the middle finger to everyone else – including Israel’s historic friends and allies – leaving him dependent on Trump alone. If the US president said the war had to end, it had to end. As Trump himself told Netanyahu: “Israel cannot fight the world.”Most observers suspect that Trump decided to put his foot down after Israel’s 9 September failed attack on the Hamas negotiating team in Doha. Trump took that as a personal affront. Not only did Netanyahu give him insufficient warning that Israel was planning to kill the very people with whom it needed to discuss an agreement, he did it on the sovereign territory of a country with which Trump has personal and financial ties: recall that the Qataris had gifted Trump a new plane to use as Air Force One. It was an act of hubris by Netanyahu. And, like a mafia don insulted by an attempted hit on one of his business associates, Trump decided it was time to remind the Israeli PM who was boss.1:59'The mood is jubilant': Guardian journalist at hostages square in Tel Aviv – videoThe US president also noted the loud protests on Israeli streets, as the public there demanded an end to the war, and the global outrage caused by Israel’s shattering of Gaza, and calculated that brokering a ceasefire deal would bring him the kudos that, though he often affects to disdain international opinion, he craves. To say nothing of the Nobel peace prize, which he covets as the one priceless bauble that has so far eluded him. Such is the power of a US president that, once he decided to use it, the pieces swiftly fell into place.Does that, then, makeDonald Trumpthe hero of this hour? Those of us who have opposed him with such vehemence this past decade should swallow hard and give credit where it is due. His willingness to bully and twist arms, his command of global attention, his force of personality were all deployed, on this occasion, towards a noble goal: to stop the killing and to free the hostages.But any admiration has to be qualified by a single, hard fact. Trump could have done this so much earlier. When he returned to the White House on 20 January, a ceasefire deal not too different from this one was in place. When Netanyahu moved to break that ceasefire in March, Trump could have slammed his foot down then and said no. Instead, he gave him a green light – and what followed was, in many ways, the worst six months of the war. Trump had the power to stop it – and he chose not to.Of course, this same critique applies in spades to Netanyahu himself. Indeed, the offence is worse because a deal broadly similar to the one he agreed this week was on offer as early as June 2024. But he refused it, and others like it that followed, deciding at each turn that his personal and political interests were best served by ongoing war. True, Joe Biden deserves blame for not using US power to demand a halt (though his situation was harder than his successor’s, if only because Donald Trump does not have a Donald Trump in the wings, seemingly promising Netanyahu better terms). But Netanyahu’s culpability runs deep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Palestinian lives destroyed in Gaza since then; the hunger as Israel shut off aid. And from Israel’s own point of view: the hostages forced to endure seven months more in captivity; the soldiers killed in action; the demolition of Israel’s standing, especially over aid, turning the country into a global pariah. “It’s really a catastrophe,” says Milstein, “because it seems we made a very long voyage only to find ourselves once again at exactly the same point.” You can pass a similarly damning judgment on Hamas: it could have ended Gaza’s agony so much earlier by releasing all the hostages.As it turns out,Trump did not get his Nobel– not this year, at any rate. If he really wants it, it’s clear what he has to do. He has to stay as engaged over the coming months and years as he has been these past 10 days. Every one of his plan’s 20 points contains enough unresolved tensions to bring the entire thing crashing down.Above all, he has to stay on Netanyahu’s case, alert to the danger that Netanyahu will bank what has been agreed and never move on to what is meant to come next. Note the Netanyahu ally who starkly declared: “There’s no phase two.” Trump cannot tolerate that. He has to maintain the pressure, preventing Netanyahu from playing any of his usual games. If Trump really wants the prize of peace, there is no other way.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about.It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors –some estimatesput it at nearly 90%.Thewhite paperoutlining these plansactually boaststhat there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trustcouncillors twice as muchas they do Westminister politicians.For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities.Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time.Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve apopulation of at least 500,000, todeliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.)Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvourging the government to plough onand block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans.The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely toraise council taxby the maximum 5%.Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons libraryresearch finds: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.”Portsmouth, one of themany towns and cities resisting, protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finallynext Marchby the minister.Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn onLabourMPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds.Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its£1bn debt? Oxfordshire county council just signed aneight-year highways contract: can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You may have fallen asleep by now: local authority politics rarely electrify. But when this actually happens, the government may find people care more than expected about losing their council. Councils need three vital reforms: the creation of a promised national social care service and an urgent reform of property taxation, starting with the preposterous council tax.

So, too, have thefamilies of Israeli hostageswho thought they might never see their loved ones again. We can only share in their relief. And still, the reasons to be wary of the ceasefire’s long-term prospects are endless.We have been here before. I’m haunted bya videofrom back in January, in which 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif removes his press vest and helmet live on air before being hoisted aloft by a joyous crowd as he announces news of a ceasefire. That deal led to several successful exchanges of Israeli and Palestinian captives and brought two months of relative respite to Gaza – before Israel tore up the agreement by launching more than 100 airstrikes on the besieged territory in one night,killing more than 400 Palestinians. Five months later, Israel bombed a press tent outside a Gaza City hospital, killing Sharif andfive other journalists.A bad deal is better than no deal (and with Donald Trump and Tony Blair at the helm of Gaza’s future, this iscertainly a bad deal), but what is especially concerning is the shift in official discourse that suggests we may not even get that far. According to Trump’sannouncementon Wednesday night, what the parties have agreed to is, in fact, only “the first phase” – a term that does not appear anywhere in thetext of the agreement itself, and is more reminiscent of the January deal which Israel moulded to facilitate a resumption of the war after a few dozen hostages were released.This linguistic bait-and-switch was not arbitrary. As the journalist Amit Segal, considered one of Benjamin Netanyahu’s mouthpieces in the Israeli media,saidon Thursday morning: “There’s no phase two. That’s clear to everyone, right? Phase two might happen someday, but it’s unrelated to what’s just been signed. The deal signed now is a hostage release deal. It doesn’t imply anything about the future.”So should we take from this that Netanyahu is already planning to resume the war after the remaining hostages have been released, as he did last time? That is certainly one reading. But longtime observers of the Israeli prime minister will know that what has kept him at the top for so many years is his ability to spin multiple plates at once, juggling them as he works out which one will best serve his personal and political agenda at any given moment. And right now, his calculations appear to have shifted.To understand Netanyahu, you need to understand what influences his decision-making. The first major factor is his ongoing trial in an Israeli court after his 2019 indictment for bribery, fraud and breach of trust – charges that carry significant prison time. Since then, Netanyahu has been more determined than ever to retain the position of prime minister in order to drag out the trial and fend off the charges. This is what led him to throw his political weight behindmessianic fundamentalistsahead of the 2022 election in order to safeguard his return to the premiership, and it has been a key driver of hisgovernment’s crusadeagainst the independence of Israel’s judicial system.The second factor is the reason he got into politics in the first place: to thwart any meaningful progress toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. From driving a spear through the remnants of the Oslo peace process upon first taking power in the 1990s, to paying lip service to subsequent US peace initiatives while legislating piecemeal annexation of the occupied West Bank, Netanyahu has made it his life’s mission to ensure that no Palestinian state can ever come to exist between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.Since 7 October, these motivations have fused to devastating effect. After the deadliest attack on Israelis in the country’s history, Netanyahu’s approval rating slumped to an all-time low. His desperation to cling to power led him to dive head-first into a genocidal war with no clear aims in the hope that it would keep his government together long enough for him to restore some semblance of his prior prestige. This meantsabotaging ceasefire negotiationsat almost every turn, and cutting short the deal he signed last January when it suited him.1:59'The mood is jubilant': Guardian journalist at hostages square in Tel Aviv – videoHaving long pioneered a policy of “managing the conflict” in order to keep the Palestinians subdued, Netanyahu soon began spinning a different plate. Enticed by the prospect ofremoving 2 million Palestiniansfrom the demographic equation once and for all, and emboldened by Trump’s own sudden fascination with a “Gaza Riviera”, the Israeli prime minister embraced theeliminationist agendaof the extreme right. He pursuedvariousavenuesin an effort to ethnically cleanse the territory of Palestinians, but ultimately ran up against aresolute Egyptian borderand a lack of interest around the world in absorbing hundreds of thousands of starving refugees.Netanyahu has decided to shift gears once again and sign the new ceasefire deal. His efforts to empty Gaza of Palestinianshave failed. Israel is becoming a global pariah, with all the economic and cultural burdens that entails. His approval rating isn’t getting any higher – despite all of the military achievements heproudly proclaimedat last month’s UN general assembly – and there is an election on the horizon.Now, it seems, he believes he has more to gain fromdeclaring a comprehensive victoryin Gaza to launch his re-election campaign than from continuing the war. If he loses the messianic wing of his coalition, whose leadersare threateningto quit the government in response to the ceasefire, so be it; he’ll reach across the aisle in the name of “national responsibility” and find old-new partners.Photo ops with returning Israeli hostages and a triumphant Trump, who is set to visit Israel in the coming days, will do that campaign no harm. Nor would steps toward additional normalisation agreements which a ceasefire might make possible, perhaps with Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, or even Syria. As a result of his own calculations and a little more pressure from the White House than he is used to, Netanyahu is leaning into the deal,extolling its virtuesand stroking Trump’s ego – most recently bytweetingan AI-generated image in which he is placing a giant “Nobel peace prize” medal around the president’s neck in front of an adoring crowd.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s over!’ they shout, but people here in Gaza still fear what the future may bring | Hassan Abo QamarRead moreYet by splitting the implementation of the ceasefire into phases, the Israeli prime minister is once again giving himself the option of sabotaging it if he changes his mind. Certainly, he has no intention whatsoever of paving “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”, as the agreement stipulates. The rest of the international community, which has either stood by or given its backing for two years as Israel pulverisedGaza, simply cannot allow Netanyahu to subvert another deal, and should be intervening already to ensure that any deviation will be met with diplomatic might.Nor can the international community take its foot off the gas as Israel inevitably shifts its focus to the West Bank, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced over the past two years. Recognition of Palestinian statehood means nothing as long as Israel is allowed tocontinue devouring Palestinian landwith impunity. The annihilatory fervour that has taken hold among a large segment of Israeli society will not dissipate overnight, which is why the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem haswarnedthat the genocide could just as easily pivot to the West Bank.And even if the ceasefire holds, there can be no going back to an illusory pre-7 October “business as usual”. Crimes against humanity demand accountability and justice, most of all for those who didn’t live to see them end. Gaza must be rebuilt, and Palestinians must be freed from Israel’s stranglehold.Ben Reiff is a senior editor at +972 magazineExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelPalestineHamasDonald TrumpIsrael-Gaza warcommentShareReuse this content"

It leaves voters facing a dangerously unstable political orderFri 10 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 08.09 EDTShareMuch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening.Thus this week’sConservative conferencein Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes.Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events.“I don’t think theConservativesare in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …”Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membershipsupport a merger with Reform UK– the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.”Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith.Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary.Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put itmore melodramatically: “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!”Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates.Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would mostbenefit the wealthiestin the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt.If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to useattacks on Reformto make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generatedno improvement in the polls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We must keep our eyes on MillerFri 10 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 11.37 EDTShareIn an interview on Monday,CNN’sBoris Sanchez asked Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, whetherDonald Trumpintended toabideby federal judge Karin Immergut’s order blocking the deployment of the national guard in Oregon.Miller said neither yes nor no. But the implication was no. Theadministrationhad already filed an appeal with the ninth circuit. He said: “I would note the administration won an identical case in the ninth circuit just a few months ago with respect to the federalizing of the California national guard.” Actually, it didn’t quite win. As I understand it (and lawyers, please correct me) the administration won a temporary stay on a temporary injunction against federalizing the California national guard in Los Angeles.Then Miller continued: “Under Title 10 of the US Code, the president has plenary authority, has–”There he abruptly stopped. The man whose entire head looks as if it’s covered by a stocking mask seemed to betray a feeling. Maybe regret, maybe embarrassment. Maybe:Oh shit, I just gave away the game.Miller blinked several times. Sanchez called his name and asked if he could hear him. Miller did not respond. Then Sanchez apologized for technical difficulties and cut to a commercial break. When the interview came back on the air, the wordsplenary authoritywere not uttered. The clip CNN posted to the internet deletedthat bit of the conversation, but it was widely posted and viewed anyway.Plenary authority, or plenary power, means absolute, unlimited, and unchecked power.The power of a king. The power of Caesar, of Hitler, of Stalin.Title 10 of the US Code, which covers the structure and laws of the military, refers little to the president, and most of that is about appointing secretaries and submitting a budget to Congress. There’s nothing in the code that remotely suggests absolute presidential power.The constitution gives the president only one unchecked power: the power of the pardon. Even theInsurrection Act, under which a president can impose martial law and overstep other laws and judicial orders, is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Or so some commentators, sunnier than I, have reassured.In short, the executive branch is supposed to be checked and balanced by the other two branches of government. That the other two branches of government don’t feel like checking or balancing at the moment does not give the president absolute power.The meticulously lawyerly way in which Miller lied about the US Code is complemented by the vague, all-encompassing apocalyptic rhetoric with which he is preparing Maga for war against the domestic enemy.“We are the storm,” he thundered atCharlie Kirk’sfuneral, in aspeechsome listeners havecomparedto one the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels gave at a 1932 campaign rally. “Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion. Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry,” he continued. “We stand for what is good, what is virtuous, and what is noble.”And who are “our enemies”? They are both mighty – “the forces of darkness and evil” – and puny. Turning his address to “you”, the enemy, he went on: “You are nothing. You have nothing. You are wickedness, you are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing! You can build nothing, you can produce nothing. You can create nothing.“You have no idea the dragon you have awakened. You have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization. To save the west, to save this republic.”Miller referred to the future generations of “our children” and to the nothingness to which “you” will eventually come. Or rather, be delivered.AsTrump grows increasingly incoherentand emotionally labile, Miller grows more and more influential. He is the president’s brain, his discipline. Where Trump has no guiding principles, Miller is a resolute ideologue of white, western supremacy and a tactician of final solutions. Trump is easily lampooned, but Miller is the grimmest of reapers.Timothy Snyder, the historian and author of the influential book On Tyranny, posted avideoon his Substack, comparing Miller to Stalin. One thing he said is that Stalin gained power as Lenin’s health failed. Lenin’s leadership ran from 1917 to 1924, but he was incapacitated by strokes beginning in 1922. Stalin’s murderous reign lasted until 1953.In Stephen Miller, we see that Maga will not simply end with Trump. We must keep our eyes on him, contest everything he does and says. Because – while this may be hard to fathom – if the US ends up with Miller as its dictator, we are in even deeper trouble than we are with Trump, and it could last a lot longer.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, comes across as a weary grandpa, glasses perched halfway down his nose as he reads his script in sleep-inducing monotone. Quick – who’s the minority leader of the House? You get bonus points if you can identify Hakeem Jeffries. Charismatic he is not.What’s to be done?Democrats cannot afford to play possum and wait for Trump to implode, as onetime political guru James Carville urged in a New York Times opinion piece. That won’t be Trump’s fate – his boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters isn’t far off the mark.Barack Obama could go toe-to-toe with Trump. He’s the most popular living president – a YouGov poll, taken just before the last election, showed that over half of all Americans would most likely vote for him. Although the two-term president can’t run again, he’d garner the attention that Democrats badly need.But the former president has had next to nothing to say about Trump’s initiatives. While he has scolded Democratic politicians for not speaking out, he has gone silent. He hasn’t appeared at any public event staged by opponents of the president. Instead, he’s producing movies and documentaries, playing golf (as of 2016, he was an “honest 13”) and building an $18m mansion in Hawaii.What’s the alternative?Several presidential hopefuls have already hit the rubber-chicken circuit, making coy noises about their intentions for 2028, but that’s not nearly good enough. These desperate times demand boldness. Here’s my proposition:a leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now.Hear me out before you start laughing.For starters, the reign of theancien regimeand its timid successors like Kamala Harris is finally over. That’s the message delivered by 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, who trounced septuagenarian Andrew Cuomo, avatar of the past, in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary. Whoever runs for president should take a leaf from Mamdani’s playbook. No more tedious, repetitious TV ads. It is essential to reach voters where they are, knocking on doors, listening to what they say about what matters to them, then turning out a stream of TikTok and Instagram videos, delivering messages that resonate.Goodbye to laundry lists of forgettable nostrums, like the multipoint policy plans that Harris lugged around. My ideal candidate must have the skill to communicate ideas – bold ideas, not small-bore suggestions – in a non-wonky way. As former New York governor Mario Cuomo memorably put it: “You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.”While it’s hard to imagine any Democrat winning over the Maga diehards, Republican voters who held their noses and voted for Trump could be swayed by someone who concentrated on meat-and-potato issues, pledging to build millions of units of affordable housing, deliver universal preschool and affordable healthcare, picking up the bill with a fair tax law. That was Mamdani’s message, and a considerable number of Trump backers voted for him after hearing his pitch.My candidate should be prepared to take on some of the Democratic party’s sacred cows. Assailing Israel for the war crimes committed in Gaza comes to mind.The toughest hurdle is raising enough money to be taken seriously, but it isn’t impossible. Billionaires including the Democratic mega-donor George Soros, Bill Gates, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently formed a group called Billionaires Against Billionaires to do battle with Trump’s coterie of billionaires. Imagine the impact if these mega-donors join forces with grassroots groups nationwide.The Democratic Party has a deep bench, and there’s no shortage of politicians who could fill the bill. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear are among those who come to mind. And while the first profile-in-courage candidate will have first-mover advantage, others may well enter the fray.Let’s be clear – there isn’t a candidate, no matter how artful, who has a prayer of dislodging Trump from his imperial perch. But the presidential hopeful who decides that now is the time to present themself as a genuine alternative will attract attention, and right now, attention is what matters most. Unless someone steps up – and improbable as this scenario is, I haven’t come up with a better alternative – the Democrats will be giving Trump a free pass for the next three and a half years. Think about what this human wrecking ball can achieve in that time.David Kirp is professor emeritus at the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California-BerkeleyExplore more on these topicsUS politicsHow can Democrats win?DemocratsDonald TrumpUS CongressRepublicansTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

With so much cash riding on so few firms, anyloss of faithcould send shares tumbling and drag down the wider economy. China’s proposed export controls onrare earthsadd a fresh threat: not just to sentiment, but to advanced chip supply chains themselves. It’s a long way down from such dizzying heights if gravity reasserts itself.Warnings from the past abound in Charles Kindleberger’s history of financial crises,Manias, Panics and Crashes, which begins with tulip mania in 1636. What commonly happens, he wrote, is “that some event changes the economic outlook. New opportunities for profits are seized, and overdone.” Once the mistake is realised, there’s a panicked exit with a crash in the price of “whatever has been the subject of the mania”. The pattern repeats itself so frequently that it seems investors never learn and central bankers learn too late.But why? Look to economistHyman Minsky,from whom Kindleberger borrowed much. Minsky addressed the deeper conundrum that is being sidestepped today: how to stabilise financial innovations before they destabilise the system? He thought that the longer markets remain calm, the more risk they take. The genius – and danger – of capitalism is that it can’t stop chasing another win. To prevent that, Minsky thought, required not moral restraint but institutional redesign.Minsky’sinsightinto capitalism was that it runs on belief. Firms invest today because they expect others to invest tomorrow, while lenders need high asset prices – and move to shore them up. This confidence loop keeps the economy humming until doubt creeps in, valuations slip and an inevitable and abrupt market crash looms. To avert this needed radical change. Hisplanadvocated a “big government” not to prop up share prices, but to prop up society when share prices fall. Backing this was a “big bank”, a monetary authority that would make it harder to buy risky assets on credit. Minsky thought cash should be guided toward productive uses, not asset inflation. He didn’t want to stifle innovation but to make it safe for democracy.It’s a warning worth hearing today. This summer, OpenAI’s Sam Altman called some tech valuations “insane”. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we’re in abubble. The AI boom looks alarmingly like Minsky’s Ponziendgame– with prices sustained purely by expectations of rising valuations and easy refinancing. Startups with no product raise billions;  index funds becomedominatedby juiced up stocks; capital chases fads rather than earnings. The ratio of the total market cap of all US stocks to US GDP is at arecordhigh.Sceptics, however, point out in the year before the dotcom crash the Nasdaq rose86%,while it has only gone up24%in the last 12 months.AI may change the world. But perhaps not, if markets can’t deal with the wave of speculation it has unleashed. A Minskyan approach would couple borrowing limits with fiscal and industrial policies that steer cash toward socially useful tech. Mr Altmanwarnedthat AI startups with “three people and an idea” are raising vast sums, adding “that’s not rational behaviour. Someone’s gonna get burned.” He’s right. The point isn’t to scold risk-takers, but to build capitalism that can handle – and survive – their excesses.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They belong to the cities and towns that have sustained them over the decades. For the vast majority of supporters, the sense ofidentityand matchgoing rituals associated with following their team are worth as much as the occasional trophy or glorious victory.That culture becomes harder to maintain, however, if your club’s next game is taking place 5,000 miles away. European football’s governing body, Uefa, this weekannouncedthat it will allow a Spanish league fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona to take place closer to Cuba than Catalonia, in Miami’s Hard Rock stadium. This will be followed, in February, by therelocationto Australia of an Italian Serie A match between Milan and Como. Global sports promoters, rubbing their hands at the potential profits this precedent could unlock, are cockahoop. Supporters organisations in Spain and Italy are considerably lessimpressed.It is not hard to see why. The clue as to where Milan should play home fixtures is in the name. And at a purely sporting level, regularly playing games on the other side of the world would undermine the fairness of leagues based on an equal distribution of home advantage. While fans outside Europe may get to see their heroes play in meaningful contests this way, the money spent staging them would be far better invested in boosting domestic competitions such as the US’s Major League Soccer.Sadly, in an age when the hyper-monetisation of elite football is already far advanced, a Serie A game in Perth looks like the thin end of a very large wedge of cash. Uefa’s reluctant permission follows the out-of-court settlement of alawsuitbrought by a US sports promoter, which argued that restrictions on where teams play their matches were illegal. For European clubs desperate to compete with the financial heft of English Premier League rivals, the riches promised by freer access to global markets add up to a tempting invitation to sell their soul.As football’s profit-hungry overlords seek ever more creative ways to turn a quick buck, the traditional supporter is the last person on their minds. Spain and Italy have alreadysoldtheir annual Super Cup games to sportswashing Saudi Arabia, while the cost of tickets for the 2026 World Cup is likely to soar thanks to the use ofdynamic ticket pricing. In Britain, the number of one-off visitorspayinghospitality-type prices is booming at elite matches, as younger and less well-off fans are priced out.A line must be drawn. Treasured local institutions should not be shunted around the globe in search of the highest bidder. Though it oncetoyedwith the notion of an extra round of matches to be played outside England, the Premier League has thankfully distanced itself from the idea for now. Uefa executives, having been blindsided by the latest developments, havevowedto ensure that rules are updated in order to “uphold the integrity of domestic competitions, and the close bond between clubs, their supporters and local communities”.Longsuffering supporters must hold them to their word. The challenge of “playing away” is an integral part of football. But it should never be necessary to book an intercontinental flight to attend a domestic league fixture.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For all our sakes, we need compassion, 7 October). I offer my condolences to her and her family.There is no denying the genocide in Gaza, the inhumane treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government, and the disgusting lack of Israeli empathy (I was horrified watching the recent video of one of your reportersinterviewing people in Tel Aviv). Yet this bizarre tribalism on either side astonishes me. I am horrified by the suffering in Gaza and by the suffering of 7 October – am I not allowed to feel for all civilians, for every life taken? Am I not allowed to mourn for children shot in Gaza and mourn for children shot by Hamas? You would think not, from the sort of vitriol I come across daily in comments on TikTok videos.I relate, too, to Sharone’s descriptions of those who have become so staunchly againstIsraelthat they support Hamas. To align yourself with an organisation that slaughters civilians, while asking for peace in Gaza and deploring the violence of the Israel Defense Forces, is insane. Using Israel’s past violence is not justification for the slaughter of civilians, just as Hamas’s actions are not justification for the genocide in Gaza. It is categorically wrong to align the actions of a government with the value of its civilians’ lives.I don’t see anyone offering the same vitriol as they do for Israel to, say, Russia or China, where monstrosities have occurred against Ukrainians and Uyghurs. The rising antisemitism is bleak, the masses apparently unable to separate Jews and Israelis. I saw a TikTok video of two girls eating matzo for Passover earlier this year, with no mention of Israel at all (and why would there be?). The comment thread was flooded with hate, as if they had done something wrong by simply being Jewish. One, simple in its hatred, just said “demons”.It is very sad that we live in a world with so much hate and violence. I can only hope that Sharone’s mother is correct, and that there is a brighter future on the horizon for all.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus letters fromDerrick JoadandColin BurkeFri 10 Oct 2025 12.27 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 12.43 EDTShareGeorge Monbiot is correct that cuts in public services cost far more than the money saved (It hurt when I crashed my bike into a pothole – and it taught me the true price of austerity, 4 October).I am a trustee of a small charity in Kent,The Social Justice Network, which runs a number of projects, including supporting refugees and their families to settle locally. Recently we welcomed a family of 10 (parents and eight children aged five to 16) from another county. The council had worked hard to house the family in its area but was unable to, despite having accepted its duty to do so. As a result of a forced move of nearly 100 miles at 24 hours’ notice, the father lost his job and is now benefit capped. Removing the two-child limit would make this family only marginally better off as they would still face the family benefit cap.Organisations including the Department for Work and Pensions, Canterbury city council and Kent county council (KCC) worked with us to find schools, healthcare, benefits, food banks and free English classes for the parents, which were essential if they were to find work, settle and contribute to society. However, they were turned down for bus passes by KCC (which said there were no funds for this). The parents had no means of transport to get to the local adult education centre (funded by KCC) nearly three miles from their home.As a result of not attending, they were kicked off the course. The family has since been rehoused, but for three months they were not learning English, not employed, not settled.They are one family among thousands, trapped in poverty and isolation by disjointed policies that are ostensibly about money, but which fail to acknowledge the true cost.Jeremy CrossCanterburyGeorge Monbiot’s excellent article on the actual cost of potholes does not mention one infuriating aspect of the whole sorry business. Road maintenance has been outsourced for decades by council authorities to private contractors on the basis, one assumes, that it looks cheaper on the council’s books. But private contractors appear to have little interest in doing a good, lasting repair. What they want to do is a cosmetic “throw-and-go”, which deteriorates rapidly. This is the basis of their projected income stream – repeat purchase – as it is for any business.It’s no use blaming the contractors, as they are only doing what any business would do when faced with a tender system that always favours the lowest quote. The council, in turn, is similarly trapped in a system where it wants to keep council tax as low as possible and economise wherever possible on the cost of services. There is little interest in undertaking longer-term cost analysis because it might reveal myopic decision-making.Monica HallFarnborough, HampshirePoliticians pride themselves on their realism, yet they invariably choose the more expensive option over the cheaper one. In this example, doing nothing over doing something, for fear of financial overspend. The same meanness applies to the two-child benefit cap. The spirit of the Dickensian workhouse is alive and kicking in contemporary Britain.The reason is the embedding of neoliberalism in mainstream political thinking. As forMargaret Thatcher, so for Keir Starmer: there is no alternative. A ramshackle Britain is the price worth paying, as low taxes mean the freeing of entrepreneurial talents of the wealthy. That plus the belief in transferring state enterprise to the more capable hands of private management. As a citizen of this country, I have yet to see any of the benefits of neoliberalism materialise.Derrick JoadLeedsGeorge Monbiot’s analysis of the negative financial, as well as physical, effects of potholes highlights the repeated failure of governments to appreciate the economic‑growth benefits of maintaining and improving the country’s transport links. There is an old Chinese proverb that every prime minister should have on the wall of No 10: “If you want to get rich, build a road first.”Colin BurkeCartmel, CumbriaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, her article remains constrained by a predominantly Eurocentric lens.Most of Spinney’s examples are drawn from Europe and Asia, where patriarchal systems displaced “biarchal” models (those based on shared gender governance) in the distant past. Yet in some regions biarchal cultures endured far longer. In places such as Canada, the US, parts of Africa, southern India and Polynesia, these biarchal traditions are almost within living memory.For evidence look atMi’kmaw Women – Strength of a Nation, a web-based learning initiative by Mount Allison University in Canada. It educates Indigenous women about how colonialism dismantled previous female autonomy in Mi’kmaw society, including the forced removal of children to mission schools where Christian patriarchal values were imposed.Similarly, a2022 Guardian articleabout Kenyan Kikuyu women reclaiming their own heritage says: “Under Kikuyu cultural practice, women had control over agricultural production, the community’s main source of livelihood. Mukuru says she was surprised to discover that the culture was also matrilineal and sexually liberal.” Again it was European colonial pressure that suppressed these female roles.Also often overlooked is the intersection of biarchy and LGBTQ+ history. In societies where women were valued equally to men, individuals with both masculine and feminine traits were often revered. Many biarchal cultures embraced gender-variant people, assigning them spiritual and cultural roles.Simon DawsonWinterbourne Gunner, WiltshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I was reluctant to shatter his fond illusions, but as my personal tribute toJilly Cooperhave decided I will now do so.Incidentally, our younger daughter is known as Bella, but not this time after a Cooper title character.

If they can do it, of course me and Jeremy can.“The only difference between us is that Jeremy still thinks Arsenal are still going to win the Premier League, and we know that they will always come second place with a second-place trophy.”The status of the new party, also billed as a grassroots membership organisation, has been in doubt for weeks after Sultana and Corbyn, the former Labour leader who was re-elected last year as an independent MP, fell out bitterly over its organisation.This reached its lowest point last month when Sultanasaid she hadconsulted defamation lawyers after a very public spat with Corbyn about her decision to set up a paid membership system for the party.Corbynsaid the payment sitehad been set up without approval, describing it as a “false membership system” that collected money and data without authorisation. He said he had referred the matter to the Information Commissioner’s Office.In response, Sultana said she had been frozen out of the new party by a “sexist boys’ club” consisting of Corbyn and four pro-Gaza independent MPs.Sultana swiftly rescinded the threat of legal action,saying she wasin talks with Corbyn and wanted to reconcile.A subsequent video message by Corbyn to the mailing list of 750,000 people who had expressed interest in the party apologised for events butmade no mentionof Sultana, while the video showed her only fleetingly.The leftwing World Transformed event used to run in parallel with the Labour conference, but is taking place this year after Labour’s event ended in Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Polanski recently told his party conference that the Greens were going to challenge Labour because Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Nigel Farage.Speaking at the event on Friday, Sultana accused Farage of “peddling racism” to distract people from other events.“The truth is, Reform is just another wing of the political establishment,” she said. “Funded by billionaires and aristocrats, fronted by a millionaire stockbroker, an ex-public schoolboy, Nigel Farage. He is peddling racism to distract us from the real agenda: more privatisation, more deregulation, more handouts for the rich, more cuts for everyone else.”Corbyn said his new party would need to work with the Greens and local independent parties.He said: “There are going to be opportunities and points where we need to work with the Greens. There may be points where sometimes we don’t agree with the Greens. So we have our identity, we have our principles, and we have our position, but we’re anxious to make progress in our society, and that will mean working with a lot of different people – nothing wrong in that.”Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

Chernukhin has previously stressed that she and her husband have no links to Putin’s regime and that she has condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenLubov Chernukhin, left, leavng a Tory fundraiser at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2022.Photograph: Eleventh Hour Photography/AlamyAccording to Companies House, the couple set up a new company called Satellite Energy Systems in January of this year, with Chernukhin, who is resident in the UK, listed as a director and her husband, Vladimir Chernukhin, who is resident in Italy, as the owner. On LinkedIn, the company describes its purpose as: “We provide net zero energy where it is needed. We are in our customer’s orbit.”Labour said Tice’s decision to accept the hospitality from Chernukhin was “troubling” and questioned why the Reform deputy leader was listening to “vested foreign interests” on the subject of UK gas power.Asked why he accepted the hospitality, Tice told the Guardian: “We’ve got a shortage of electricity in this country, and we face the risk of rationing and blackouts and what we need is more gas power plants and Lubov is interested in developing such a thing and wanted to talk to me about it.”He said if people wanted to invest in the UK energy system with reliable and cost-effective generation, creating jobs in the process, “then I’m going to push that and promote that as much as I can”.He added: “Frankly, my diary is so busy here that it’s the ability to do that, to spend some hours talking about it … I don’t have meetings in the UK more than an hour and a quarter with anybody.

He also highlighted that the Chernukhins are British citizens.“If Labour criticise it, I might just remind them of that when we face higher energy bills and rationing because we haven’t got enough electricity in this country,” he said.Tice said he was not expecting Lubov Chernukhin to start donating to Reform as she was a Conservative, and added: “This is about getting people to invest money in the UK as opposed to invest elsewhere.”A spokesperson for Lubov Chernukhin said: “Luba is a British businesswoman, philanthropist and investor focused on promoting inward investment, local economic growth and charitable initiatives both in the UK and abroad.

The road ended up costing£74m to build, £5m to police and £25m for the 800 security guards employed to deter the campaigners. Nearly 800 arrests were made.Activists told the Guardian that Gratwick played a prominent role in helping to organise the protests, supervising the acquisition and distribution of equipment, such as rope and harnesses, to assist the protests.The Newbury bypass protest of 1996 - in picturesRead moreCraig Logan, a campaigner, said: “Literally people from every camp would come and talk to him about what they were doing at their camp, what they want to build, what they were trying to do. I can’t think of a better role that you could have for an informant … he’s absolutely at the core of it.”Gratwick was known by the nickname “Radio Nick”, as he was instrumental in establishing a network of CB radios – at a time before mobile phones were being used widely – so that activists in different camps could communicate and warn each other about the impending police actions.Helen Beynon, another campaigner, said: “If you wanted to spy on people, being one of the people crucial to our radio network was absolutely a very good place to be. You could hear everything that was happening. He’s right in the middle of that.”Gratwick later infiltrated animal rights groups, including a campaign to close theanimal testing laboratoryrun by a commercial company, Huntingdon Life Sciences.In March, Gratwick, whose full name is Edward Nicholas Gratwick, was arrested by NCA officers at Stansted airport as he was about to board a flight to Romania to rape a child in a paid arrangement with her mother, the prosecution told the court. In his bag was an item that he had previously said he was going to use to suffocate the child slowly while he raped her.Robbie Weber, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “The abuse [he] described inflicting on young children with other like-minded individuals was abhorrent. It was clear from the evidence that he was intent on harming and abusing children and was willing to pay significant sums of money to do it. Not content with satisfying his own sexual desires, he also advised and encouraged others how they could commit equally horrific crimes.”In interviews with the police, Gratwick alluded to his past covert work for Thames Valley police, suggesting that the officers “talk to special branch”, the secretive unit responsible for monitoring political groups. Gratwick and Thames Valley police declined to comment on his work as an informer.An account of the case, agreed by barristers acting for both the prosecution and his defence, revealed that “records show that during the eight-year period between 1995 and 2003, [Gratwick] provided information to police for a total period of approximately six years. He provided information on animal rights and environmental matters.”At his trial, his defence said that he had created a fake persona to string along abusers and extract information so they could be prosecuted.Prosecutors told the court that Gratwick also schemed to rape and abuse children in the US and Switzerland.Danielle Pownall, a senior investigating officer at the NCA, said: “Gratwick has continually denied the offences he faced, despite overwhelming and indisputable evidence, which shows his lack of remorse and disregard for the safety and welfare of children.”He will be sentenced on 28 November. He pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing and offering to supply banned drugs.Explore more on these topicsCrimeBerkshireProtestEnvironmental activismSurreyPoliceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It could eventually reach a weight of about 250kg.Photograph: Chris Tagg/Nature SeychellesThe researchers said the successful trial could help to stave off an extinction crisis for other threatened species.“This is a huge leap,” said Alessia Lavigne, a Seychelloise based at the University of Sheffield, in England, who was the lead author of arecent studyrelated to the project. “It shows what conservation can do.”The study examined the reproduction rates of five turtle and tortoise species, which revealed that 75% of undeveloped eggs had been fertilised but contained embryos that died at an early stage.Those findings cast new light on why the Aldabra giant tortoise, which is classified as vulnerable by the International Union forConservationof Nature, appears to have very low hatching success in wild nests. The failure rate is considered more likely to be due to environmental factors than to any genetic trait of the tortoises.Giant tortoises were wiped out from most other Indian Ocean islands in the 19th century as a result of hunting by sailors, but the population on the Aldabra group of islands in the Seychelles was saved thanks to their isolation. They, along with 400 other endemic species and the extraordinary colours of the landscape, were the reason why the atoll was listed as a world heritage site by Unesco in 1982.As a hedge against extinction, some individuals were moved to other islands, including Cousin, in the hope that they could establish backup populations in the event of new threats. This has proved prescient because at least one island is being developed as a luxury tourist resort, funded with Qatari money, as the Guardianrevealedlast year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But the priority for research will be how to improve the conditions of wild nests.“It’s wonderful that these eggs have been shown to be viable but artificially incubating eggs is not a long-term solution,” said Nicola Hemmings of the University of Sheffield’s School of Biosciences. “We now need to identify the variables that are impacting survival in the natural nest environment, and then see if there are ways to improve them.”View image in fullscreenAn Aldabra giant tortoise on Curieuse Island, Seychelles.Photograph: cinoby/Getty ImagesThe team says it would like to share its results with scientists in the Galápagos islands, which are home to the only other species of giant tortoise.Explore more on these topicsConservationReptilesSeychellesEndangered speciesAfricaAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

For the first month, only coaches and HGVs will be checked at Eurotunnel and Dover, and until January, only a minority of passengers will be asked to register at Eurostar.The European Commission said on Friday it expected the system would mean “travelling will become smoother and safer for all”, with databases automatically giving border officials across the EU instant access to irregularities.During the rollout, EU member states would be able to decide when and where they started deploying the system. It would allow them to “start benefiting from the new system, while ensuring that border authorities, the transport industry and travellers can adjust to the new procedures,” the commission said.The UK government is expected to remain in close contact with EU authorities to monitor its introduction and has launched an information campaign for travellers. It said that while checks should only take up to two minutes for each person, there could be longer waits on arrival in the Schengen area.Keir Mather, a UK transport minister, said: “Our priority is to minimise disruption for travellers and hauliers, particularly at our busiest border crossings.“We’ll continue working closely with European partners and local resilience forums to keep traffic flowing and journeys smooth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An Abta spokesperson said: “It should eventually make travel easier. But those breaching the 90-day rule will be automatically detected.”The freight industry has urged the government to secure an exemption for professional drivers, who may also have been waved through the border until now.The trade body Logistics UK welcomed the phased introduction but said “disruption was inevitable”, and called on the government to work with France to develop an app to allow drivers to register away from the border.The EU expects passport stamping to be phased out before 10 April ahead of the busy summer period, with travellers advised to goto the official websiteif they are unsure of the requirements.EES requirements will apply to countries in the Schengen area, which include the non-EU states of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, but not Ireland and Cyprus.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTransportEuropeAir transportRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Together, the network of solar panels and batteries was set to produce 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly 2m homes.Asked to comment, the interior department appeared to leave open the possibility that at least parts of the project could be resubmitted for review. In an email, a spokesperson said: “During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project inNevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”Trump’s hatred for renewables means the US is falling behind the rest of the worldRead moreThe developers’ joint proposals werepermittedby Joe Biden. Even onceDonald Trumpre-entered the White House this year, the process appeared to bemoving forwardwhen his BLM advanced a draft environmental impact statement. But the process has since come to a standstill, with the BLM failing to issue a final environmental impact statement or record of decision for the project.Reached for comment, a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said: “We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.”The Guardian has also contacted Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy for comment.In an executive order on day one, Trump directed a pause on new renewable energy authorizations for federally owned land and water. Then in February heappointedKathleen Sgamma, president of the Colorado-based oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance, to head the BLM, which manages a quarter of a billion acres of public land concentrated in western states.In July, as part of an attempt to win support for his tax and spending bill, Trump issued anotherorderaimed athalting renewable projects, which called on the Department of the Interior to review its policies that affect wind and solar, and gave the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, final decision-making power on whether such projects could proceed.The following month, the president said his administration would not approve solar or wind power projects. “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,” heposted on Truth Social. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationSolar powerRenewable energyNevadaEnergyDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just nine years ago, 44% of assessed bird species had declining populations, according to the red list of endangered species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Dr Ian Burfield, BirdLife’s global science coordinator, who helped oversee the assessment, said: “That three in five of the world’s bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements.”It comes as hundreds of conservationists gather in Abu Dhabi on Friday for the IUCN’s congress, where the fate of many of the world’s most at-risk wildlife species will be discussed. In the face of global headwinds on environmental action, scientists are urging governments to deliver on recent pledges to better protect nature.Birds play an important role in ecosystems, helping to pollinate flowers, disperse seeds and control pests. Hornbills – which are found across the tropics – canspread up to 12,700 large seeds a dayin a square kilometre.Dr Malin Rivers, head of conservation prioritisation at the Botanic GardensConservationInternational, said: “The fates of birds and trees are intertwined: trees depend on birds for regeneration and birds depend on trees for survival.”The green sea turtle’s recovery “reminds us that conservation works”, said the IUCN director general, Dr Grethel Aguilar. Once classified as endangered, it is now viewed as a species of least concern due to conservation efforts. The turtles’s numbers have grown by 28% since the 1970s thanks to greater protection for nest sites in Ascension Island, Brazil, Mexico and Hawaii.View image in fullscreenA Pacific green sea turtle cruising off Hawaii.

The loss of sea ice has seen population numbers for bearded and harp seals fall sharply. Thinning sea ice means that the Artic seals are finding it more difficult to find areas to rest and breed. They are a critical prey species for polar bears, which researchers fear will also be affected by the loss.Dr Kit Kovacs, Svalbard programme leader at the Norwegian Polar Institute, said: “Each year in Svalbard, the retreating sea ice reveals how threatened Arctic seals have become, making it harder for them to breed, rest and feed.“Their plight is a stark reminder that climate change is not a distant problem – it has been unfolding for decades and is having impacts here and now.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverage.Explore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionAnimalsWildlifeBiodiversityConservationIUCN red list of endangered speciesEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

In south-east China, temperatures have climbed steadily since late September under the influence of higher than average pressure to the north-east, reaching the mid-to-high 30Cs during a period when conditions would normally be cooling from about 30C to the mid-20s. Inland areas have neared 40C (104F), with Xiushui, in Jiangxi province, recording 38.9C on Wednesday, about 13C above average for early October.Overnight warmth has also persisted. In Hong Kong, further heat on Wednesday brought October’s tally of “very hot days” – defined by temperatures remaining above 28C throughout the day – to four, the highest ever recorded for the month. Models suggest the unusual heat across south-east China will last for another eight to 10 days, before colder air pushes in from the north.In northern China, a much colder air mass clashed with the warmth to produce stubborn, heavy rain. There had been at least 36 hours of continuous rainfall in Beijing as of Thursday afternoon, averaging 68.8mm (2.71in) across the city, with one Daxing district station recording 140.4mm since Wednesday. The persistent rain kept temperatures unusually low; Thursday was Beijing’s coldest early October day since 1951, with a maximum of just 10.6C – about 10-15C below average.View image in fullscreenPedestrians in Beijing.Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesChina has experienced numerous extreme rainfall events this year, an increase that can be linked to a warming global climate. For every 1C increase in global temperature, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture.Meanwhile, typhoon activity continues over the Pacific. Tropical Storm Nakri, which formed on Wednesday, has tracked north-east towardsJapanover the last few days. However, it is expected to veer east, following a similar path to Typhoon Halong, which is now travelling out into the northern Pacific.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He had made the threat to kill the Reform UK leader in October last year in a video that Farage told the court was “pretty chilling”.Khan had a “very large presence online” with his videos on TikTok, amassing hundreds of thousands of views, jurors had heard.In autumn last year Khan’s videos were focused on his attempts to come to the UK by small boat. He had lived in Stockholm, Sweden, since 2019, the prosecutor, Peter Ratliff , told the court.On 12 October last year, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube titled “the journey of an illegal migrant” that highlighted Khan and referenced “young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little”, jurors were told.Ratliff said Khan responded with a video on 14 October in which he appeared to say: “Englishman Nigel, don’t talk shit about me. You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me.“Don’t talk about me more. Delete the video. I’m coming to England. I’m going to pop, pop, pop.”While Khan said “pop, pop, pop” he made “gun gestures with his hand”, headbutted the camera and was pointing to an AK-47 tattoo on his face to “emphasise he wasn’t joking”, Ratliff told jurors.Farage said on Tuesday that Khan’s video was “pretty chilling”, adding: “Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried. He says he’s coming to England and he’s going to shoot me.”Jurors were shown a screenshot of a subsequent TikTok post by Khan with the caption “I mean what I say” written on an image of a GB News report about the alleged threat against Farage.The court was also shown other videos on social media by Khan in which he appeared to make “pop, pop, pop” noises and similar hand gestures to those in the TikTok video referencing Farage.The court heard that Khan had livestreamed his journey across the Channel from France and was arrested on 31 October after arriving in the UK on a small boat.Khan said in a police interview it was “never my intention to kill him or anything – this is my character, this is how I act in my videos. In every video I make those sounds, I say ‘pop, pop pop’.”Khan was not called to give evidence.Ratliff said in his closing speech the alleged threat to kill was “not some off-the-cuff comment” and the video was “sinister and menacing”. He added that Khan was “a dangerous man with an interest in firearms”. “If you’ve got an AK-47 tattooed on your arm and your face, it’s because you love AK-47s and you want the world to know that.”In his closing speech, the defence lawyer, Charles Royle, said Khan was “remonstrating in his own idiosyncratic, moronic, comedic, eye-catching, attention-seeking way”, rather than making a threat to kill in the TikTok video.Khan will be sentenced on Tuesday for the threat to kill conviction and for entering the UK illegally.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageImmigration and asylumCrimeReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

He was found guilty of murder on Thursday.Ahmad,who fled war-torn Homsafter being injured in a bombing, had been living in the West Yorkshire town for only a couple of weeks when he crossed paths with Franco, who had been for a jobcentre appointment that day and was going to buy eyelash glue with his girlfriend.View image in fullscreenAhmad Al Ibrahim.Photograph: West Yorkshire police/PALeeds crown court heard that Franco – who had consumed cannabis, cocaine, diazepam, ketamine and codeine – took “some petty exception” to Ahmad “innocuously” walking past his girlfriend in the street.CCTV footage showed Franco saying something to Ahmad, and calling him over after a short verbal altercation. As Ahmad walked over, Franco opened the blade on a flick knife he was carrying in his trousers and drove it into the boy’s neck.Franco denied murder, but was found guilty by a jury who deliberated for just over three hours. He pleaded guilty to possessing a knife in a public place.While handing Franco his sentence on Friday, judge Howard Crowson said that upon seeing Ahmad, Franco “identified him as a target and lured him to within your range to strike before killing him”. He said Franco’s claim to have seen a weapon in Ahmad’s waistband was “a lie”.Crowson said of Ahmad that “it is a testament to the medical personnel trying to save his life and his will to live he even made it to the hospital alive, but in truth his wounds were unsurvivable”.Reading out a statement drafted by Ahmad’s uncle Ghazwan Al Ibrahim, with input from his parents, Richard Wright KC told the court that the teenager’s father had suffered a heart attack upon hearing the news of his son’s death, causing him to require surgery.“I am unable to describe the impact of their heinous crime and the impact it had over everyone,” the statement read. “His mother still cries over his clothes as they smell of him.”Ghazwan, who said Ahmad was like a son to him and he felt ashamed he could not protect him, went on to state that Ahmad had thought he had found “the land of peace and the fulfilment of dreams” in Britain, but instead was “cruelly taken away by the senseless and unprovoked act”.“As Ahmad’s uncle, I will always carry the guilt that Ahmad had come to the UK, and I could not keep him safe,” he said in a statement after the sentencing. “Ahmad we love you, we miss you and we will do for ever.”The court heard Ahmad had travelled for three months to reach the UK from Syria, stopping in a refugee centre for teenagers in Swansea and attending college in the Welsh city before arriving in Huddersfield. The teenager had aspired to be a doctor, driven in part by a desire to look after his mother, who suffered from a chronic medical issue.Explore more on these topicsHuddersfieldSyriaCrimeMiddle East and north AfricaKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

It is second only to Ed Sheeran’s ÷, released in 2017 to 672,000 first-week sales.Only the Beatles and Robbie Williams have had more UK No 1 albums than Swift, with 15 apiece. At a concert in London last night,Williams admittedthat he had pushed back the release of his album Britpop from last Friday – The Life of a Showgirl’s release day – to 2026 because of Swift: “I could pretend it’s not, but it is. It’s selfish. I want a 16th No 1 album.”Swift has now surpassed Elvis Presley, with 13 No 1 albums, and is tied with the Rolling Stones. No one else has notched up so many No 1 albums in such a short time: the Official Charts Company said that since 2012, the 35-year-old pop star has averaged more than one a year.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreThe Life of a Showgirl also scores the biggest first-week UK vinyl sales since modern chart records began in 1994, as well as the most UK album streams in a single week.Swift also claims the entire top three songs in the UK Top 40. Lead single The Fate of Ophelia is at No 1, with the biggest opening week since 2021’s Christmas No 1, LadBaby’s Sausage Rolls for Everyone featuring Ed Sheeran and Elton John. At No 2 is Opalite and 3 isElizabeth Taylor.Official Charts’ chief executive, Martin Talbot, said in a statement: “What an incredible week forTaylor Swift, which has topped the many other incredible weeks of her career. Her list of achievements this week is extraordinary, not least the fact that The Life of a Showgirl has just registered comfortably the biggest first week in the UK of her career. Taylor is bigger than she has ever been in the UK – and shows absolutely no sign of letting up.”In the US,Swift beat Adele’s first-week sales record, selling 3.5m units in under a week with two days of the chart window still to go; in 2015, Adele sold 3.482m copies of her third album, 25, in its initial release week. Swift’s previous album, last year’s The Tortured Poets Department, sold 2.51m units in its first week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

And no one questioned it.“It’s a low-level mistake but nevertheless, it is indicative. It was good to spot it, because what you wouldn’t want to do is just to make some kind of egregious claim about somebody and it is defamatory.”The BBC’s broadcast of the claim comes amid increasing concern over online misinformation reaching the mainstream media, with media workers often users of platforms such as X, owned by the billionaire Elon Musk. The post about Blair, which is still on the site,has been viewed almost 3m times.Blair’s company, Multiverse, offers apprenticeship programmes and tech-related training, but has said it is not involved in the proposed digital ID project and does not have the expertise to oversee it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At Merkur, these targets include revenues from punters’ losses on highly addictive slot machines.For venue managers at Merkur, most of the bonus – worth up to 80% of annual salary – is linked to “controllable profit”, according to one internal document setting out the scheme’s structure.This measure is partly determined by outgoings on wages and smaller items designed to keep customers playing, such as complimentary food, drinks and “cash giveaways”.But the first item on the list of factors contributing to controllable profit is “net revenues”.In effect, this means takings from the shops’ slot machines, which offer stakes of £2 every 1.5 seconds, for a maximum jackpot of £500.The machines have been linked in successive studies to higher rates of addiction than most other gambling formats.View image in fullscreenJackie Olden, whose late mother lost thousands of pounds at a branch of Merkur in Stockport.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianJackie Olden had campaigned for tougher regulations on AGCs, after her late mother, who was terminally ill,lost thousands of poundsat a branch of Merkur in Stockport. The company wasfined nearly £100,000 earlier this yearfor social responsibility failings, after reporting by the Guardian.“It feels like a punch in the face that my mum might have been helped, but the staff may have been financially motivated not to stop her,” Jackie said.“It feels like the fine they received has taught them nothing.”Merkur said it “strongly rejects” any suggestion that its incentive scheme undermines safer gambling objectives.Lawyers for the company pointed out that a portion of the controllable profit bonus, equivalent to 20% of salary, can be lost if shops fail to hit performance targets, which include completing safer gambling training.The bonus also includes a separate element – worth up to 20% of salary – based on reaching “compliance and audit” targets. These are understood to include a “safer gambling” element involving bosses asking junior staff about their interactions with customers.Lawyers for the company said extra safer gambling elements had been added to the bonus scheme in January 2025 and had resulted in more interactions with customers.But MPs from across the political spectrum raised concerns about the potential moral hazard created by any incentive scheme linked to revenues from slot machines.They said this could give AGC staff, some of whom earn minimum wage, a reason to look the other way when vulnerable people are racking up huge losses.Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader who now campaigns for gambling reform, said that even though an element of the bonus was linked to safer gambling targets, the overall scheme looked like “an incentive not to intervene” when punters are losing sums they cannot afford.He said it appeared that firms were “paying cynical lip service to their ‘obligation’ to stop harmful gambling. Appalling.”The Labour MP Dawn Butler, who is bidding to become London’s next mayor, said: “The payment of these bonuses seems to completely contradict statements from these companies about their commitments to social responsibility.“This bonus structure should immediately be changed. It also begs a question as to why theGamblingCommission allows these practices by AGCs in the first place.”Her fellow Labour MP, Alex Ballinger, said the scheme “shows a complete lack of responsibility and the urgent need for greater regulation”.In 2020, the Gambling Commission told operators to stop paying bonuses to staff working on controversial “VIP schemes” for high-value customers, meaning those who lose a lot of money. But it said these rules do not apply to how staff are paid in AGCs, despite the fact that punters can easily lose hundreds of pounds an hour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The deaths were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre.Footage shared on social media after the first quake showed students fleeing in panic from their classrooms, radio anchors leaving their seats mid-air and people crouching and bracing themselves on all fours as the ground shook violently. Motorcycles were knocked over by the force of the tremor.mapThe governor of Davao Oriental said people panicked when the first earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told the broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”Evacuation orders were issued in affected areas, with schools suspending classes for the day.Damage to infrastructure, including cracks in the structure of the Magsaysay Bridge in Butuan city, were reported. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said authorities were assessing the extent of the damage and search and rescue efforts being prepared. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said.The energy secretary, Sharon Garin, said officials were monitoring four electric companies in Mindanao after power supply in some areas tripped. It was not immediately clear whether the shutdowns were caused by the earthquake or were a precautionary measure.View image in fullscreenStudents are evacuated in Mindanao after the powerful earthquake.Photograph: Golden Cornucopia - Davao de Oro State College/AFP/Getty ImagesChristine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela, near Manay, told Agence France-Presse she was in an online meeting when the violent shaking started.“It was very slow at first then it got stronger … That’s the longest time of my life. We weren’t able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,” she said. “The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured.” She said some of the school’s 1,000 students “suffered panic attacks and difficulty in breathing”.Kath Cortez, a journalist based in Davao city, said the ground floor walls of her family’s house were showing small cracks. “I was surprised by the strength,” she said, adding members of her family ran out of the house.The quakes hit just 10 days after a deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Bogo City in Cebu province, which killed 71 people. Aftershocks are still being felt in the area.Neighbouring Indonesia also issued an earlier tsunami warning for its regions of North Sulawesi and Papua, according to its geophysics agency.The Philippines sits on the Pacificring of fireand experiences more than 800 quakes each year.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsEarthquakesPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But deadly attacks on civilians have continued and a deadline to reach a peace agreement was missed in August.Last year a group of UN experts said up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside M23 and that the Rwandan military was in “de facto control of M23 operations”. Rwanda has long denied backing M23 and says its forces act in self-defence.View image in fullscreenAn internally displaced family loads belongings on to a motorbike as they leave a camp in Bulengo, DRC.Photograph: Jospin Mwisha/AFP/Getty ImagesThe DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi, on Thursday appealed to his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, to stop supporting militants in the DRC at a Brussels event attended by both leaders, drawing a rebuke from Kigali that he was “completely mistaken” about the roots of the conflict.Saying he was stretching out his hand to make peace, Tshisekedi told Kagame: “This requires you to order the M23 troops supported by your country to stop this escalation, which has already caused enough deaths.”‘I was terrified’: refugees who fled DRC to Burundi recall deadly river crossingRead moreThe Rwandan foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, later responded on X, saying Tshisekedi was “completely mistaken” and accusing him of abusing the platform at the Brussels event.Speaking before the meeting, Wagner drew parallels between Rwanda’s violation of DRC territory and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU had adopted a catalogue of sanctions against Russia, but made only “very timid progress” over the conflict in eastern DRC.The eastern DRC, a region bordering Rwanda with abundant natural resources but plagued by non-state armed groups, has suffered extreme violence for more than three decades.The EU has placed sanctions on 32 people and two entities – a militant group and a Rwandan gold refiner dealing in illegal supplies of the metal – for their role in fuelling the conflict. Setting out justifications for these sanctions, the EU said the Rwandan Defence Force in eastern DRC had violated the DRC’s territory and “sustains the armed conflict … [and is] also responsible for serious human rights abuses, including collective punishment”.Despite this finding of human rights abuses by the Rwandan army in the DRC, the European Commission hasbrushed off calls to suspend a 2024 minerals deal with Kigali, which is intended to boost the supply of raw materials to power Europe’s electric car batteries and microchips.Wagner said the memorandum of understanding with Rwanda was “void of any credibility in a context where it has been established that Rwanda has been siphoning off Congolese resources” extracted under brutal conditions of forced labour, involving children.The US and many others have raised concerns about illegal trade in gold and tantalum in eastern Congo, extracted via forced labour, then trafficked to Rwanda for export to benefit armed groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It remains one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with more than 7.8 million people internally displaced in eastern DRC and 28 million facing food insecurity, including 4 million at emergency levels, according to the UN.As the DRC’s chief diplomat, Wagner signed the agreement with Rwanda in the White House in June, which also aims to give the US greater access to Congolese natural resources.View image in fullscreenThérèse Kayikwamba Wagner (right) at the White House in June, where a deal was signed that includes giving the US greater access to Congolese natural resources.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/ReutersShe said the US was still engaged in the peace process and she rejected suggestions that Trump’s sole motivation was the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, while adding: “It is just a reality ... that this potential is currently untapped.”She was in Brussels to take part in a conference onthe global gateway, Europe’s lower-budget answer to the Chinesebelt and road initiative, which aims to finance infrastructure projects around the world.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, opened the conference on Thursday, saying the EU wanted “partnerships based on common interests and respect for sovereignty”. She highlighted the Lobito corridor – rail, road and water transport links – connecting the mineral heartlands of the DRC and Zambia to Angola’s Atlantic coast.Wagner said the EU and DRC had a strong foundation in the Lobito project, but “a lot has been overshadowed by the situation in eastern DRC”.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoEuropean UnionRwandaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Pilots who examined the picture said this would be enough for just five or six minutes of flying.Analysis of the log suggests the plane left Pisa with reserve fuel, as commercial flights are required to do.A spokesperson for the airline said: “Ryanair reported this to the relevant authorities on Friday [3 October]. As this is now subject of an ongoing investigation, which we are co-operating fully with, we are unable to comment.”The Air Accidents Investigation Branch confirmed on Thursday it had opened an investigation after being notified by Ryanair.A spokesperson said: “The AAIB has commenced an investigation into a serious incident involving an aircraft which was diverted from Prestwick to Manchester Airport on Friday 3 October. AAIB inspectors have begun making inquiries and gathering evidence.”The Boeing 737-800 can carry up to 189 passengers. One person on board recounted what is thought to have been a two-hour attempt to make a safe landing, saying the plane made two attempts to land at Prestwick, before heading for Edinburgh and finally Manchester.“Everyone was calm until the descent; we were being buffeted around a lot and jumping. There were a few worried people on the second descent as we could feel the plane was struggling,” Alexander Marchi told theAyr Advertiser.“Then the pilot surprised us by saying he was going to attempt Edinburgh. This was just as bad, though, as the second time at Prestwick.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the potentially multibillion-dollar financial crisis surrounding First Brands has them rattled.As ever in finance, it’s what investors don’t know that scares the most, and with First Brands, there appears to be plenty.What is First Brands?First Brands was founded by the Malaysian-born businessman Patrick James. Starting life as Ohio-based Crowne Group, James acquired Trico, best known for windshield wipers, and went on a debt-fueled acquisitions spree, snapping up auto-focused parts makers. James rechristening the company as First Brands Group in 2020. It now owns 24 automotive-related companies, according to thegroup’s website.“If your car is 10 years old, odds are good that parts from these companies are already on there,”notes the auto website CarBuzz.“And they were probably half the cost of original equipment parts sold through dealerships.”Seems like a sensible business. Why did it collapse?The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the southern district of Texas on 29 September due to creditor concern over the company’s use of opaque off-balance sheet financing, listing liabilities – what it owed – between $10bn and $50bn against assets – what it owned – of between $1bn and $10bn.But the speed of the First Brands implosion has spooked investors, and the more that’s known, the more they are spooked.The company had until recently had a decent cash buffer, but it was using private debt or “shadow banking” to borrow against invoices, in effect keeping debt off its balance-sheet disclosures, and turning a company with 26,000 employees into a finance company more than the supplier of auto parts.That system, known as factoring, is not unusual. But when the size of that debt, and who is holding it, becomes obscure, problems can rapidly accumulate, as the financial industry saw with the collapse of the UK fintechGreensillCapital in 2021 and London-listed firmCarillionin 2018.On Thursday, the technology group Raistone, which arranged some off-balance sheet financing, claimed that as much as $2.3bn had “simply vanished” as part of the bankrupt auto supplier’s failure.Jim Chanos, who predicted the Enron disaster in 2001,told the Financial Timesthat complex financial systems tend to flourish at the tail end of a boom when everyone wants in. “As long as everything works, nobody asks questions,” he said. “It isn’t until something stumbles, or the markets stumble, that people say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we doing here? This doesn’t make any sense.’”Why is Wall Street so worried?Just as in other financial crises – most recently the housing crisis that led to the 2008 financial meltdown – Wall Street is worried that the issues at First Brands are a sign of worse to come.The Texas auto lender Tricolor – which specialized in lending to low-income “sub-prime” lenders – collapsed last month amidfraud allegations.Ben Lourie, professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine, says the issues at First Brands, and the collapse ofTricolor, connect because one was selling cut-price parts, and the other older cars, to consumers under economic pressure.“My guess is the companies went into bankruptcy because the market is not great and they started doing things they should not be doing. So they went into financial innovation with invoice financing,” Lourie says.“The fear is that the private debt market has been too hot, and [has been] giving out money, at high interest rates, to companies that just can’t pay it back, and especially to companies in the auto market,” he adds.Fears over what the failure of both companies portends are highlighting worries about what other issues the private debt markets may face.“The private debt market is much bigger than it used to be, and we can see that by companies pulling their IPOs because they are raising money in those markets,” says Lourie. “But there isn’t as much disclosure as there is in the public markets. So there is a disclosure issue because we don’t really know what’s going on.”He adds: “When there isn’t as much disclosure, there’s more risk, and there’s a fear of contagion, because somebody is going to have to take on these losses, and eventually it will reach up into the banks.”Jefferies, a midsized Wall Street lender, was advising First Brands, acting as lender against invoices through a specialist invoice-finance fund it manages, Point Bonita Capital, and placing billions of dollars of loans with other investors.Who those investors are, and how far the chain of debt stretches into the mainstream banking system, is an open question. Jefferies says it has $715m in exposure to First Brands. An investigation has been set up in part to examine whether invoices were pledged more than once.But it goes further, with concerns mounting that First Brands’ precarious arrangements could be found elsewhere.Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, says concerns are primarily about unregulated private debt markets and the assets they hold that are often not marked-to-market, an accounting system that values a company’s assets and liabilities at their current fair market value.“When these assets become impaired, it’s a surprise to markets, because there hadn’t been a gradual updating of information,” House says, “and because we don’t have great transparency on the location and concentration of where these assets are being held. And that can often have knock-on effects that are unanticipated.”So Wall Street got too clever for its own good, again. Why should I care?The worry is that the collapse of an obscure car parts company is the first domino, and that if more dominoes collapse, it could spread across the financial system, eventually triggering a wider crisis.Severe problems in the financial markets caused not by macro-economic conditions, but by the intricacies of capital management have happened before – the collapse of a high leveraged hedge fund,Long-Term Capital Managementin 1998, that required a $3.6bn bailout, or the subprime mortgage loan crisis of 2007 that caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of severe financial recession.Such analogies may not be exact, since the problems now being unearthed relate to private debt markets that expanded significantly after banks tightened lending standards after the 2008 crash.“The risk may sit in the balance sheets of funds and other asset managers that may create counterparty risk for large financial institutions that can cause reverberations from relatively obscure small funds hitting problems and create a cascading effect through the financial system that gets amplified by the structure of different asset classes and is unanticipated because of a lack of transparency,” says House.“It effectively means that unregulated parts of the debt and asset management market may hold risks that have implications for the entire financial system.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

If you’re as contrary asRobbie Williams, you play a gig in a shoebox. This late-night show at the 600-capacity Dingwalls, the smallest venue of his career to date, is a rum event. It was originally a launch evening for a new album, Britpop, now postponed to February. Williams makes no bones about why. “It’s because of Taylor Swift,” he admits, in a week where her new album The Life of a Showgirl is outselling the rest of the UK Top 20 put together. “I could pretend it’s not, but it is. It’s selfish. I want a 16th No 1 album.”Bounding on stage just as the pubs are closing, a grinning Williams clearly relishes the intimate environment. “I’m not doing all that stadium bravado and pointing,” he vows, launching into a full, stripped-down run-through of his 1997 debut album, Life Thru a Lens, with lengthy between-song reminisces of the circumstances of its making.These are characteristically candid. His heart firmly on his brawny, tattooed arm, Williams recalls quitting Take That to find himself £300,000 in debt: “I took EMI’s money to the Groucho Club and did loads of cocaine. Oh, and I was about to get dropped. Thenthishappened.” Cue a heartfelt Angels, the ubiquitous national anthem of the 90s.This clear-eyed look back at a highly confused time is captivating because Williams, all nods, winks and twitches, is a ferociously skilled entertainer. Closeup, his star wattage is blinding. And this quirky, vibrant intensity doesn’t drop as he segues into playing the imminent Britpop – on first hearing, a rocky, hefty affair – in full.Our host mock-worries that one track, Spies, may be too indebted to Oasis’s Champagne Supernova: “But don’t have a brass neck and sue me, Noel! Not after everything you’ve nicked!” He plays a jaunty number called Morrissey, co-written with Gary Barlow, about the “isolated, deserted and friendless” former Smiths singer. “It’s weird as fuck, innit?” he admits at the end, not incorrectly.Williams announces that he is to play more of these intimate shows – billed as Long 90s – in February. “I knew this would be an incredibly special gig,” he smiles, as he tips us out into the street at 1am. It’s impossible to disagree.Explore more on these topicsRobbie WilliamsPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The City of Lights has been the stage and stomping ground of French architecture’svieux terriblesince the early 1980s. Yet the building that first made his name – the Institut du Monde Arabe, a glittering, delicate, metallic creation inset with mechanical lenses to regulate light – is a lifetime away from the bemusement that met his last Parisian project, completed a decade ago.That was the ill-starred Philharmonie, a gargantuan trophy concert hall,described in the Guardianas resembling “a pile of broken paving stones” and “a greatest hits mashup of dictators’ icons”. Nouvel may well concur, since he boycotted the building’s inauguration, dismayed by budget cuts and design tweaks (“value engineering” as it is known in the trade), describing his project as “sabotaged” and the half-finished concert hall as “counterfeit”.Retractable rails around the perimeter prevent visitors from plummeting to their doomDefiantly weathering critical opprobrium, Nouvel is an auteur who revels in creating architecture that is always theatrical and never the same. There is nole style Nouvel.“I’m not a painter or a writer,” he once said. “I don’t work in my room. I work in different cities with different people. I’m more akin to a movie-maker who makes movies on completely different subjects.”So what are we to make of Nouvel’s latest movie: a new home for the Fondation Cartier, a private art foundation established in 1984 that’s dedicated to the accumulation, display and creation of contemporary art? It is now headquartered in a remodelled 19th-century building in the heart of bourgeois Paris, right across theruefrom the Louvre.View image in fullscreenRadically reconfigured … Nouvel had free rein with the interior.Photograph: Marc DomageFrom the outside, there’s not much to see. Occupying an entire city block, the building is a slab of classic, Haussmann-era Paris, a colossal, five-storey hulk of honey-coloured stone with a mansard roof and colonnade that yomps monotonously along the Rue de Rivoli.Opened in 1855, this began life as the Grand Hôtel du Louvre, designed to accommodate visitors and exhibitors to the first Parisian Exposition Universelle, a world’s fair conceived by Napoleon III as a rival to London’s Great Exhibition of 1851. The hotel was then transformed into a department store, the Grands Magasins du Louvre, fuelling the demands of France’s emerging consumer society. As a teeming city in microcosm and forerunner of the modern shopping mall, it operated for almost a century, shaping Parisian cultural and social life.In terms of kerb appeal, this must rank as Nouvel’s lowest-key building to date, distinguished solely by the gold Fondation Cartier logo discreetly strung across the main facade on the Place du Palais-Royal, like an expensive necklace. An elongated steel and glass awning, a silver counterpoint to the gold, extends down Rue Saint-Honoré, a modern version of the historic colonnade. The honey-coloured stone has been meticulously cleaned and buffed, and elegant new windows added at street level. It all has a tasteful, seamless, stealth luxe refinement, in the manner of an Apple store or five-star hotel.View image in fullscreenSimply red … Jean Nouvel’s trademark rouge space.Photograph: Martin Argyroglo/© Jean Nouvel/ADAGP Paris 2025Nouvel’s relationship with Cartier dates back to the early 1990s, when he first designed a watchmaking plant in Switzerland. He was then tasked with the more glamorous project of creating a new arts centre for the Fondation on a site in Montparnasse, down in Paris’s 14th arrondissement – social Siberia compared with the latest plum locale.Nonetheless, Nouvel responded with a crystalline confection of steel and glass, subtly subverting the “white cube” aesthetic as the default setting for contemporary art. Galleries, it seemed, were no longer blind boxes, but glazed display spaces, opening on to a garden and the wider city. Characterised by an uncharacteristic formal restraint and precision, it’s still seen as one of his most memorable buildings.For the Fondation’s latest incarnation, while being presented with an architectural fait accompli in the form of an existing historic building, Nouvel has still managed to indulge his subversive tendencies.View image in fullscreenAn exhibit in the opening exhibition.Photograph: Marc Domage“Here, it is possible to do what cannot be done elsewhere,” he says, “by shifting the act of showing.” Behind thepolitesseand sobriety of the facade, the interior has been radically reconfigured around five modular, movable platforms, offering the potential to instantly restructure space and transform how objects are displayed.Nothing like this has ever been attempted before on such an ambitious scale. It upends the idea of galleries as static boxes or an enfilade of rooms, creating tantalising possibilities for curators and artists alike, in how they respond to “the act of showing” and orchestrate changes of scale, juxtapositions and through views.Occupying the footprint of what was originally a sequence of internal courtyards, platforms vary in size between 200 and 340 sq metres. Each can be adjusted to a different height, over three storeys, through cable mechanisms positioned at the corners. Retractable guardrails around the perimeter prevent visitors from plummeting to their doom. In line with the general tenor of the project, the platforms are not ostentatiously steampunk creations, but instead are rather elegant. Most of the time, you are hardly aware of them. Their inherent drama is as a mechanism for shaping space, architecture in the service of art.View image in fullscreenVieux terrible …Nouvel.Photograph: Jean-Paul Pélissier/Reuters“The platforms are very much in line with the historical spirit of the building,” says Béatrice Grenier, who co-curated the opening exhibition. “They play on this idea that the mid-19th century marks the beginning of mechanical modernisation of the city at large: the Eiffel Tower, the invention of elevators, the integration of mechanical mobility into brick and stone architecture.”Much of the original 19th-century fabric was destroyed when a Lancaster bomber ploughed into the building in 1943, so Nouvel had a relatively free hand to gut the interior. Still standing are a row of massive concrete columns, left over from a previous remodelling in the 1970s, which now loom like archaeological relics within the voluminous space.To inaugurate its new home, the Fondation will revisit pivotal moments in its history, through landmark works, fragments of exhibitions and the key projects that have shaped and consolidated its identity. The show’s title, Exposition Générale, alludes to exhibitions of the latest fashions, textiles, appliances and accoutrements – highly anticipated cultural events in themselves – that were organised by the Grands Magasins du Louvre in the 19th and early 20th centuries.View image in fullscreenHard at work … part of the pulley system.Photograph: Martin Argyroglo/© Jean Nouvel / ADAGP, Paris, 2025.The same visual connectivity, experiential richness and concern with display that enabled the building to play such a significant role in Parisian cultural life are reprised in Nouvel’s transformation. In many ways, Andy Warhol’s famous dictum that “all department stores will become museums” has come to pass.“The Louvre,” says Grenier, “is object-focused and encyclopaedic, showing the world in terms of a material manifestation of culture. We’re saying something very different: that exhibition-making is at the centre of culture, a succession of ideas elaborated with thinkers, artists and architects, and subject to constant change.”The Louvre also turns its back on the street. From the Rue de Rivoli, passersby might catch a glimpse of the backsides of sculptures through the odd window. The Fondation, by contrast, is extroverted and inviting, harking back to its origins as agrand magasin. Strolling along the colonnade, people can enjoy its displays through what were, and still are, shop windows.From this vantage point, you might be drawn to the ecstatic, chromatic installations of Bolivian architect Freddy Mamani or the minimalist maquettes of Japanese designer Junya Ishigami. The spectrum of creation encompasses outsider art and work by established practitioners (Patti Smith rubbing shoulders with the Yanomami community of the Amazon), connecting visitors to an aesthetic and mindset that could not be more divergent from that of the Louvre.The flexibility of the platforms means that all scales, from the monumental to the minute, can be easily accommodated. Exhibition spaces are augmented by a public cafe and lecture theatre, the latter saturated in Nouvel’s signature blood red; walls, floor, ceiling and seating as an eye-poppingly incarnadine ensemble.Architects are fond of gnomic pronouncements. “The future of architecture,” declared Nouvel in 1980, “is no longer architectural.” Though sounding suitably abstruse, it simply meant that, rather than remaining a closed discipline, “architecture needed to seek its sources in the culture of today”. Now, as Nouvel enters his ninth decade having turned 80 this year, and the Fondation Cartier opens its doors, it seems curiously apt. And he’ll still always have Paris.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both look defanged.Freud’s sensational Naked Portrait 2002 is a nude study of the supermodel, to whom he had been introduced by his daughter, the fashion designer Bella Freud. Moss was pregnant when she sat for him – which lent a fierce, additional frisson to the painting’s candour and intimacy. Ellie Bamber plays Kate and carries off the unclothed moments with great directness and aplomb. Freud is played with Germanic R sounds by Derek Jacobi (who incidentally played Freud’s contemporary Francis Bacon in John Maybury’s Love Is the Devil in 1998) and he has Freud’s buzzard-like look but not quite the sharpness and severity.She was 28; he was 80 and his reputation as a Lothario led to all sorts of tabloid gossip about a possible relationship – though the film, for which Moss is executive producer, is burdened with the killjoy task of solemnly making it clear that this wasn’t true, while also trying to convey a kind of compensatory eroticism elsewhere – all sorts of bohemian raciness and an impossibly stylish meeting of super-hip creative minds. Yet, all too often Moss looks like a dippy trustafarian and Freud like her soppy old grandpa with whom she gets out of it on opium in the garden of his west London home while the pair of them throw back their heads, laughing life-affirmingly. Their tiffs are infrequent and unexciting.Of course, no film can live up to the painting itself: that is where the drama and the seduction actually happened. Perhaps there was an amazing rapport between Moss and Freud or perhaps it was a businesslike arrangement – with no more of a quasi-erotic spark than there was between Freud and the more age-appropriate Queen Elizabeth II when she sat for him, fully clothed. (Maybe Jacobi and Helen Mirren can now do that film.)This film implies that Freud got Moss to grow up and turn away from shallow partying and drugs. Well … maybe. It is on stronger ground at hinting at the selfishness of artist and model – and in fact there is a very shrewd scene when Freud turns up for Moss’s birthday party and both hurt the feelings of Bella (Jasmine Blackborow) by hardly talking to her. Both are capricious: Freud is using Moss, of course, and she is using him (and both might well have been aware of how very expensive the resulting picture was likely to be, although nothing so vulgar is explicitly mentioned).The crunch comes when Kate sees the finished picture and is, quite understandably, lost for words. The film is too, in a way. Freud’s image is not like a fashion photo – it is utterly different from the way she has learned to see herself. It is not unflattering exactly, it has something uncompromisingly physical and sensual. And it upstages the film’s careful, legacy-controlling blandness.Moss and Freud screened at the London film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmLondon film festivalLondon film festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

But the pure cinematic testosterone that sustained it may have disappearedBen ChildFri 10 Oct 2025 08.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 09.04 EDTShareThere is a longstandingHollywood urban myththat the original 1987 Predator movie was inspired by a joke doing the rounds about Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky series. The idea was that after the Italian Stallion beat up Dolph Lundgren’s towering Soviet superman Ivan Drago in 1985’s Rocky IV, the only opponent he could fight next would be an alien. Supposedly, screenwriters Jim and John Thomas heard this jape and wrote Predator – which, after a few rewrites, a new lead (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and a change of title from their original spec script, became one of the most enduring sci-fi action films of the 1980s.In truth, the timeline doesn’t add up. The Thomas brothers were already shopping their script around in 1983, long before Rocky IV hit cinemas, suggesting the “Rocky v alien” story is probably a post hoc myth. Yet the original film is such a perfect example of the brutally linear B-movie-esque 80s creature-feature that the story has been handed down through the decades – not because it’s true but because it feels as if it should be.Predator is such a gloriously boneheaded concept that it ought to have spawned 20 increasingly terrible straight-to-video sequels starring progressively more ersatz versions of Schwarzenegger, each battling rubbery mandible-sporting foes against ever cheaper and more cheerful backdrops. Instead, we have been handed a series of pretty middling follow-ups: 1990’s Predator 2, the execrable Alien vs Predator films, Predators (2010) and The Predator (2018). These were never quite bad enough to achieve cult infamy, but were not good enough to justify anyone watching them again.But this weekwe got a new trailer for Predator: Badlands, from director Dan Trachtenberg; this is the film-maker who has been quietly doing for the saga what Christopher Nolan once did for Batman, with the stripped-back, brilliant Prey (2022) and the gleefully deranged anime spin-off Predator: Killer of Killers earlier this year. It made me think of the old Rocky story, partly because the new film’s protagonist, teen predator Dek, sounds as if he has spent a few winters in Vladivostok. But more pertinently because this movie no longer resembles anything close to that original, beautifully simple premise. Its plotline is no longer “Rocky v alien (in the jungle)” but something more akin to “existentially conflicted space crustacean forms uneasy alliance with android twin on a sentient death planet while being hunted by his own species”.This tells us everything we need to know about mainstream sci-fi film-making in the modern era. Star Wars was once an elevated matinee adventure serial with space monks and hero starfighters, but has morphed into a vast intergalactic genealogy project in which everyone’s grandad turned out to be evil. Terminator started out as the pulpy tale of a cyborg that came from the future to kill you, but wound up as a muddled loop of rebooted timelines in which the killer robots keep coming back, mostly to apologise for the last sequel. Alien began life as the story of something hellish from outer space that would cheerfully murder you from the inside, before somehow switching to demon androids quoting romantic poetry in candlelit laboratories.View image in fullscreenGet to the choppa! Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBy contrast, Predator has generally stayed true to its B-movie roots – though maybe no longer. Badlands does not seem to be about Predators facing off against humans – in fact, there don’t appear to be any humans in the film. It is ostensibly the tale of a young Yautja warrior who finds himself stranded on a planet full of monsters even worse than he is, with only a Weyland-Yutani android (Elle Fanning) to provide running commentary. It’s hard to imagine that we won’t learn more about the Predator race, their honour code and the reason they want to kill everything that moves. Finally, after nearly 40 years of thermal-vision carnage, this sci-fi saga is about to start universe-building – just like all its peers.Then there is that Alien link. You would have thought Trachtenberg would be too smart a film-maker to find himself deep into creation myths and android philosophy. Rumours suggest Badlands is set so far in the future that the events of Disney+’s wonderfully cerebral series Alien: Earth will have zero connection here. But even so, it’s hard to imagine that some of that existential radiation won’t seep into the new movie: can it be a coincidence that the evil corporation is once again snooping around on a planet filled with the worst extraterrestrials in the cosmos? Because otherwise, what is the point of tying the two sagas together?Perhaps, in the end, the real question isn’t whether Predator: Badlands can evolve – it’s whether we want it to. The original movie worked because it was pure cinematic testosterone, a 107-minute flex of Reagan-era id. Maybe we don’t need to know what the Yautja do at weekends, or whether they have a word for love. Perhaps the beauty of Predator was that it was never meant to grow up. If Trachtenberg’s film ends with our young extraterrestrial hero learning compassion, self-knowledge and the futility of endless conflict, that’s fine. But part of me will still be rooting for him to scream: “If it bleeds, we can kill it,” before punching an alien dragon to death.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekScience fiction and fantasy filmsHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you don’t need to be much of a history buff to know that that this particular crime would be on the JFK level of momentousness if it had actually succeeded. As it is, we follow Bogusław Linda as Konstanty “Bruno” Brusicki, a former intelligence agent who is offered a compelling carrot and threatened with a nasty stick by the men who want PJP2 dead. Brusicki has also been diagnosed with terminal cancer, which in the view of the conspiracists makes him the perfect murderer; they won’t have to subsequently get rid of him to cover their tracks.True life stories have a way of being a bit messier and wrinklier than their fictional counterparts, leaving scriptwriters with some decisions to make around how much to tidy up a set of events to suit the narrative demands of fiction. For around the first hour of this film, Bruno’s mission isn’t actually to shoot the pope, it’s to shoot the man who shoots the pope. Unbeknownst to the assassin, Bruno is supposed to be lurking to tidy up the loose ends and actually takes quite a bit of time to make it to the point where Bruno gets to say: “You want me to shoot the pope?”, which in a glossy Hollywood version would probably happen somewhere in the first 10 minutes.There are pros and cons to this: on the one hand it all feels messily real and pedantic and annoying in the way that real life can be, and presumably is, even in the world of high-stakes espionage. On the other hand, there is that sense that you’ve been watching an hour of preamble that could easily have been streamlined – though your mileage may vary. It does mean that the occasional flourishes in the film’s technique stand out: the bullet’s-eye-view perspective, for example, is a lovely bit of business, while occasional flashes of bone-crunching violence in the second half register like a hammer to the head.Operation Pope is in UK and Irish cinemas.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillerPolandPope John Paul IICatholicismChristianityEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Terrifying in a lovely way’: Colin Farrell and Tilda Swinton on taking a gamble with their new dramaThe actors star in Edward Berger’s woozy casino film Ballad of a Small Player. Amid the opulence of a Macau hotel, they talk risk, addiction and Fabergé eggsRyan GilbeyFri 10 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTShareOn a humid morning in Macau, a blue-and-orange phoenix embellished with more than 60,000 flowers is hatching from an enormous pink Fabergé egg in the lobby of the Wynn Palace hotel. The haughty bird basks in the attention of onlookers as it rotates on a diamond-encrusted perch to the triumphant sound of clarions, before returning to its shell. Chancing upon this spectacle, you think to yourself, “How lucky that I was passing at that precise moment!” Stick around and you will be disabused of your sense of good fortune: the hatching occurs every 15 minutes without fail.It is summer 2024, and Colin Farrell and Tilda Swinton are guests here while shooting Ballad of a Small Player, directed by Edward Berger (Conclave) and based on Lawrence Osborne’s clammy 2014 novel about ghosts, guilt and gambling. Farrell plays Brendan Reilly, an Irish thief who affects an English accent, goes by the name Lord Doyle and hides out at the Wynn Palace, where he clings to a precarious life of enervated luxury. Having fled to Macau with a stolen fortune, he whiles away his nights betting at baccarat, a high-stakes game of chance no more complex than a coin toss. Swinton is the gauche investigator, also labouring under dual identities (one minute she’s Betty, the next Cynthia), who has been hired to find Reilly and retrieve the loot.“The place is a bit of a headfuck,” says Farrell. “Kind of like living inside that giant Fabergé egg.” He is referring to the hotel, which reserves for its casino’s high-rollers an entire wing of elite accommodation. When I am shown around one of these opulent villas, which features in the movie and has its own private hairdressing salon, massage room, outdoor pool and butlers’ quarters, I feel as if I’m being waterboarded with Dom Pérignon.View image in fullscreen‘Colin is a wonder of boundless energy and nonsense’ … Farrell and Tilda Swinton in Ballad of a Small Player.Photograph: NetflixBut that “headfuck” remark could just as easily apply to Macau itself. After 400 years as a Portuguese colony, this port city south of Guangzhou became a special administrative region of China in 1999. Like Las Vegas, its gambling hub carries an intoxicating air of kitsch. The Cotai Strip is lined with looming replicas of the Rialto Bridge, the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben. Parked outside the fake Houses of Parliament is a Routemaster bus in which David Beckham – or rather, his digital self – is yoo-hooing from the upper deck in his capacity as ambassador of the Londoner hotel. “Have you been inside?” Swinton asks excitedly. “There are beefeaters doingjazz hands!”Despite what this might suggest, Macau, which has been little-seen in western cinema, is a more serious proposition than Vegas. Razzle-dazzle stage spectaculars never really took off here, and its gamblers are too stern to get sloshed. Servers carry trays of tea or milk, rather than cocktails, across the casino floors. Spirits of a different kind, though, are an integral part of the culture, as Ballad of a Small Player demonstrates. In one scene, Reilly is turned away after the management checks CCTV footage of his latest win and spots a ghost loitering behind him.The novel likens one casino to a “Hans Christian Andersen fairy palace imagined by a small child with a high fever”. That is reflected in today’s location: the Rio, an abandoned former hotel and casino adjacent to a shop offering “coffee, plants and lifestyle”. It has been dressed by the production designer Jonathan Houlding (Poor Things) to amplify its shabby-chic grandeur: gaudy chandeliers, mirrored pillars with floral decals, archways parenthesised by tasselled, cherry-coloured curtains and potted plants.The place is a bit of a headfuck. Kind of like living inside that giant Fabergé eggFor his first day on set, the book’s author Osborneis wearing a brimless cap on the back of his head, and pincering along on crutches after a motorcycle accident in Bangkok, where he has lived since 2012. The novelist stations himself in a canvas chair and gazes admiringly at the Rio’s interior, its gaming tables surrounded by extras whom Berger is busy whipping into a frenzy before the next take. There is a near-constant hiss as the smoke machine fills the room with its hazy breath.The fakery feels appropriate for a movie where most of the characters are posing as someone else. “Guys I used to meet in Macau would call themselves barons and counts,” says Osborne. “No one questioned it. Like Lord Stow, who sold his egg tarts here. Was he even a lord?” He was not: Macau’s renowned baker, who died in 2006, was a Boots pharmacist from Ilford in Essex.We watch a few takes of Farrell riding the escalator down to the casino, then weaving in and out of the baccarat tables as the extras whoop and holler around him. He is dressed in high-waisted cream trousers, a striped shirt and braces, and a spiffy tomato-coloured jacket. The alternating red and green lighting has a clashing, contradictory effect, as though warning him to stop while encouraging him to go. The colours also introduce a hint of sci-fi into the chintzy surroundings: a reminder that Wong Kar-wai shot parts of In the Mood for Love and its futuristic semi-sequel 2046 here in Macau.The Brylcreemed hair and pencil moustache that affords Farrell a note of raffish, retro charm was inspired, Berger says, by a tradition of gentleman stars: Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, David Niven. Have they informed his performance? “No,” the actor tells me. “But I’m aware that everything I’ve seen or read or heard inevitably ends up in my work. People have asked me about The Penguin and whether I was inspired by Jimmy Gandolfini in The Sopranos. I still haven’t seen The Sopranos! But I know that every gangster I’ve ever seen has found its Rolodexian way into what I did in The Penguin. The same with Reilly, whether it’s characters with addictions or people living lives of abject artifice.”Farrell’s own former addictions are well documented, though gambling was not among them. Some of his insights into Reilly’s psychology have come from chatting to casino managers here. “One told me the house was up $24m the previous night from two gentlemen. I said: ‘I imagine they were pretty depressed.’ He said: ‘Yeah. But when they win, they feel just as bad.’”The next scene to be shot involves Betty spotting Reilly for the first time as he dashes among the tables. She is gazing out at him from inside the casino’s jade-green smoking room, which resembles the booth in a recording studio. Pale and motionless behind the glass, she looks like a mannequin waiting to be freed from a shop window.View image in fullscreenEdward Berger, centre, with Isabella Rossellini, left, and other members of the cast and crew of Conclave, accepting the best film award at this year’s Baftas.Photograph: Stuart Wilson/BAFTA/Getty Images for BAFTAThe character doesn’t appear in the novel. “We needed to put more pressure on,” says Berger. “So Colin is being pursued in a not-entirely serious manner by Tilda. She fits with the ridiculousness and over-the-topness of Macau, as you can see from her look.”Well, quite: patterned stockings, pink raincoat, zany specs. “Ed was clear that he wanted Betty to be part of the madness of the visual overload,” says Swinton. “We began by identifying a silhouette that would mark her out in the throng of the chase sequences through the casino.” Her frizzy wedge of hair was inspired by the 1970s children’s cartoon Crystal Tipps and Alistair, while Swinton and the costume designer Lisy Christl came up with the nerdy ensemble. “We had fun imagining what this suburban pen-pusher might deck herself out in to blend into Macau, and all the ways in which she gets it wrong.”How does she see Betty fitting in to Reilly’s world? “I think of her as, possibly, another ghost. A fabrication of his imagination. Who would he conjure up to nail him? Someone from the banality of where he has escaped from, but dolled up to chime with the surreality of his hunting ground. Another potentially cracked and crooked soul, half-nemesis, half-company.”She and Farrell haven’t worked together since one of his earliest films, Tim Roth’s incest drama The War Zone, back in 1999. “Tilda plays, man,” he grins. “She’ll mix it up. She watches you and takes you in like very few other actors I’ve worked with. There’s nothing she doesn’t see. That’s terrifying in a lovely way because she’s paying attention. It’s like fencing with a close friend.” Swinton returns the compliment. “Colin is a wonder of boundless energy and nonsense, and we both enjoy being amused.”View image in fullscreen‘She needs to save herself but can’t figure out how’ … Fala Chen as Dao Ming in Ballad of a Small Player.Photograph: NetflixIf Betty is Reilly’s pursuer, then Dao Ming, played by Fala Chen, could be his salvation. A sex worker in the novel, she has been reimagined here as a loan shark who takes pity on him. What does she possibly see in this mess of a man? “I think she needs to save herself but can’t figure out how,” says Chen. “Helping him enables her to express that towards someone else. They both need redemption. That word came up a lot in my conversations with Edward.”Berger reflects on their relationship. “He is addicted to gambling and alcohol. But it is consumption that drives him. He needs something to fill that hole inside because he’s lost his spiritual core. When he meets Dao Ming, it helps him redefine his path towards a higher meaning.”The director hopes this serious side will come through amid the film’s comic mayhem, its banquet of excess. “The world is falling apart, yeah? Reilly is the epitome of that, and Ballad has turned out to be very much a fable of what we are all going through: this pursuit of the individual at the expense of the communal experience and common decency.”He is addicted to gambling and alcohol. But it is consumption that drives himFarrell agrees. “It’s a fool’s errand,” he says. “Reilly is looking in all the wrong places for meaning and context and worth. We meet him at a time when he’s lost, but I imagine he was just as lost when he got on the plane in London to fly to Macau. The chaos was already inside him.”Near the end of the day, I find Berger eating potato salad from a paper plate. He is seated at one of the deserted baccarat tables, so now seems an opportune time to ask about the similarities between film-making and gambling. “I hadn’t thought of that,” he says, looking mildly spooked. “But you’re right. It’s probably the most unpredictable, expensive enterprise you can go into. You can have the best actors, the best script, but it still doesn’t guarantee a good movie. It’s a huge gamble.”To the usual risks, you can add a history of indifference to films on this topic. Croupier, California Split, Mississippi Grind and Hard Eight are all fine movies, but they hardly represent a winning hand commercially. It would take more than a little fear, however, to deter Berger. “I don’t like making the same thing twice,” says the man who came to the papal intrigue of Conclave directly from the trenches ofAll Quiet on the Western Front. “Iwantto be scared. Iwantto be absolutely terrified.” Should he end up with egg on his face, it will at least be the Fabergé variety.Ballad of a Small Player is in cinemas from 15 October and on Netflix from 29 OctoberExplore more on these topicsColin FarrellTilda SwintonConclavefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I couldn’t bounce around, so I blinged the brace up instead. That was a great gig.”Loughead is part of a growing movement of women redefining punk. WhenRiot Women, Sally Wainwright’s new BBC drama spotlighting female punk, airs this Sunday, it will reflect a scene that’s already thriving far beyond television.That energy is being felt most viscerally in Leicester, where Ruth Miller’s 2022Unglamorous Music project– now known as the Riotous Collective – lit the fuse. Loughead was there from the start.“When we began, there were no all-women garage punk bands here. Within a year, there were seven. Now there are 20 – and counting,” she said. “There are Riotous groups across the UK and the world, from Finland to Australia, recording, gigging, playing festivals.”View image in fullscreenViv Peto and her punk band.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianThe explosion isn’t limited toLeicester. Across the UK, women are reclaiming punk – and changing the landscape of live music while they’re at it.“There are music venues across the UK thriving thanks to women punk bands,” said Longhead. “So are rehearsal studios, music teaching and coaching, production spaces. That’s because women are in all these roles now.”They’re also changing who shows up. “Women-led bands are playing every week. They’re bringing in more diverse audiences – ones that see these spaces as safe, as for them,” she added.Carol Reid, programme director at Youth Music, said the rise was no surprise. “Women have been sold a dream of equality. But gender-based violence is at epidemic levels, the far right is using women to peddle hate, and we’re gaslit over issues like the menopause. Women are fighting back – through music.”Toni Coe-Brooker, from the Music Venue Trust, sees the movement reshaping local music scenes. “We’re seeing more diverse punk scenes and they’re feeding into local music ecosystems, with grassroots venues booking more inclusive bills and building safer, more welcoming spaces.”Later this month, Leicester will host the first Riot Fest, a three-day event featuring 25 all-women bands from the UK and Europe. In September, Decolonise Fest in London celebrated punks of colour.And the scene is edging into the mainstream. The Nova Twins are on their first headline UK tour. The Lambrini Girls’ debut album, Who Let the Dogs Out, hit No. 16 in the UK charts this year.Panic Shack were nominated for the 2025 Welsh Music Prize. Problem Patterns won the Northern Ireland Music Prize in 2024. Hull-based newcomers Wench played the BBC Introducing stage at Reading Festival.It’s a movement born partly in protest. In an industry still dogged by misogyny – where all-women acts remain underrepresented and live venues are closing at crisis levels – female punk bands are creating something radical: space.At 79, Viv Peto is proof punk has no age limit. The Oxford-based washboard player in horMones punk band picked up her instrument just a year ago.“Now I’m old, all constraints are gone and I can do what I like,” she said. One of her recent songs includes the chorus: “So shout out, fuck it / It’s my time! / The stage is mine! / I’m 79 / And in my fucking prime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

I didn’t get to rebel when I was younger, so I’m doing it now. It’s great.”Kala Subbuswamy from the Marlinas said she hadn’t been allowed to rebel as a teenager. “It’s been really major to be able to let it all out at this late stage.”Chrissie Riedhofer, who has toured globally with Boilers and Virginia’s Wolves, also sees it as catharsis. “It’s about exorcising frustration: being invisible as a mother, as an older woman.”View image in fullscreenDina Gajjar of Burnt Sugar. ‘Being on stage is a release you didn’t know you needed.’Photograph: Lee AllenThat same frustration led Dina Gajjar to form Burnt Sugar. “Being on stage is a release you didn’t know you needed. Girls are taught to be compliant.Punkisn’t. It’s loud, it’s imperfect. It means when bad things happen, I think: ‘I’ll write a song about that!’”But Abi Masih, drummer for the Flea Bagz, said the punk woman was every woman: “We’re just ordinary, professional, brilliant women who enjoy subverting stereotypes,” she said.Maura Bite, of the Folkestone band She-Bite, agreed. “Women were the original punks. We had to smash things up to be heard. We still do! That badassery is in us – it feels ancient, primal. We’re a bloody marvel!” she said.Not every band fits the stereotype. Julie Ames and Jackie O’Malley, part of The MissFitsisters, try to keep things unexpected. “We don’t shout about the menopause or swear much,” said Ames. O’Malley cut in: “Well, we do have a bit of a ‘raah’ moment in every song.” Ames laughed: “That’s true. But we like to keep it interesting. Our last track was about how uncomfortable bras are.”Explore more on these topicsPunkWomenLeicesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 23-year-old US songwriter couldn’t be much further from his brand of hypermasculine evangelism. Her debut album, The Hermit, recalls the rich 90s scene of offbeat North American female singer-songwriters who would go on toshare the stage at Lilith Fair: Shawn Colvin’s acoustic breeziness, Fiona Apple’s earnest blues, Indigo Girls’ strident joy. (Similar era, very different scene: Patterson’s voice has an expressive skippiness that also channels Life Without Buildings’ Sue Tompkins.) Her songs – and I say this as the greatest compliment – could easily have lived on the soundtrack tocosy mother-daughter drama Gilmore Girls. Fittingly, God wonders whether she should have a baby, and Hey Mama pays tribute to her own mother, pairing the scrappy triumph of Tom Petty’s Free Fallin’ with impressionistic vocals that feel like a singer nudging her way towards revelation.Patterson grew up in North Carolina and moved to Los Angeles as a kid, in part so the family could support her brother’s dreams of becoming an actor. She studied at the starry LA County High School for the Arts (alumni include Phoebe Bridgers and Haim) and also wanted to act – until music became her thing, her taste evolving beyond the family’s soul records and church background when she discovered Radiohead and Nick Drake. After her brother and grandmother died, she scrapped her plan to study acting, no longer able to pretend to be other people, and threw herself into music. Since then, she’s supportedCameron Winterand soon heads out on a US tour withJens Lekman.

A trio that formed a decade ago over interests in post-rock and drone (their name means “around” or “widely” in their native Slovenian), they list more than two dozen instruments in the liner notes of their fifth album, from the Persian gheychak to the Mongolian morin khuur. They create a palette that’s kaleidoscopic in its textural, dynamic and melodic explorations of sound.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for In the Wind of Night, Hard-Fallen Incantations WhisperŠirom’s work is improvisatory, energetic and tuneful. Album opener Between the Fingers the Drops of Tomorrow’s Dawn merges repetitive, buoyant patterns on the balafon (a West African xylophone) with chiming lyres and bowed passages on the guembri (a Moroccan string instrument, which here recalls the work of the late double bassistDanny Thompsonat his most agile). Tiny Dewdrop Explosions Cracking Delightfully has a title like a lost Cocteau Twins B-side, but comes across like a soundtrack to the movement of a gnarly, chirrupping sprite. Frame drums and violins accelerate us towards the track’s cacophonous climax, perfect for a headbanging hippy having a spiritual conversion to metal.In her hums and ululations, Ana Kravanja’s voice brings deep emotion to Hope in an All-Sufficient Space of Calm, a rare short track at just under four minutes. The longest, The Hangman’s Shadow Fifteen Years On, stretches to a more ominous 19 minutes. Sparse string phrases lead us to the manic blowing of a fipple flute, suggesting a life at its limit, that then slowly decays.An acoustic resonator guitar and the clatter of “various objects” point to the present day, but the mix of traditional instruments, gnashing and clashing, also swirls us into a vortex of time travel. Be brave and embrace this uneasy, intense album for the ages.From Kate Bush to Pentangle to T-Rex, the late Danny Thompson’s musical brilliance knew no boundsRead moreAlso out this monthU’s Archenfield (Lex) is a hauntological exploration of the folklore of Herefordshire through regional songs and poems, school recordings, spooky experiences of local historians, and snippets from film and TV.Hannah Sanders an& Ben Savage’s The Stranger’s Share (Sungrazing) is the atmospheric, lush product of the duo spending five days around one mic, playing traditional songs, covers and a few originals. The best tracks are their take on Lal Waterson’s Fine Horseman, with Sanders’ vocals giving it softer, sweeter edges, and a version of Bob Dylan’s North Country Blues in which they become Cambridge’s Gillian Welch and David Rawlings.United Bible Studies’ Strange Is the Coastline (Talking Elephant/Hobby Horse) teems with bushy-tailed folk-rock about Albion and Ireland, as well as brutal, bracing songs about singer Alison O’Donnell’s experiences with a former stalker, such as the startling You Often Hid.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

But she’s drawn into danger when she agrees to help a man whose wife, an artist skilled in the new art of “vivid dreaming” – using AI and virtual reality to allow her live audience into her stories – has disappeared. He has seen a video from someone claiming to have kidnapped her and hopes Julia can tell him who sent it. The near-future setting is convincing, and the story is rich in interesting ideas about potential developments in the use of AI and social media. Julia is a strong, complex character, and there’s a suggestion there could be a series of novels about her. Action-packed as well as thought-provoking, this is one of the best science-fiction books of the year.View image in fullscreenWhen There Are Wolves Againby EJ Swift (Arcadia, £20)Like Swift’s previous novel,The Coral Bones, this book is powered by a passionate love of nature and deep concern for the planet’s future. Beginning with the character-forming effects of major events during the childhoods of the two main characters – Covid lockdowns for Lucy, the Chornobyl disaster for Hester – the novel tracks their separate journeys in climate activism and documentary film-making as both make their own contribution towards a better world, until 2070, when they meet at last. Evocative and beautifully written, this character-driven novel also inspires as an argument for rewilding in Britain.View image in fullscreenThe White Octopus Hotelby Alexandra Bell (Del Rey, £18.99)Eve has grown up feeling responsible for the death of her little sister, and her only escape is through art and music, especially tunes composed in the 1930s by Max Everly, a mysterious figure who vanished from history. In 2015 an elderly gentleman gives Eve a small ornament – a white octopus with a black tip on one tentacle. How does he know it’s her birthday, or that she’s obsessed with octopuses? Eve’s quest for answers leads her to the legendary White Octopus Hotel in the Swiss Alps, fallen into ruin since it closed in 1935, but still hiding objects with magical powers, including a key that lets Eve travel in time. This is an absorbing magical mystery, the story of two wounded people given the chance to save one another.View image in fullscreenDarker Daysby Thomas Olde Heuvelt(Bantam, £18.99)The latest from the author ofHextakes place in a small town in Washington state, on Bird Street, where all the residents are fantastically successful, healthy and happy – except in November, when the “Darker Days” arrive. Then the adults must pay the fee and sacrifice one human life. They seek out elderly, terminally ill people who are ready to die, but one year their best-laid plans fail, and for the Lewis-da Silva family, the darker days turn especially dark and gruesome. This masterly work of horror, gripping and terrifying on more than one level, is probably Heuvelt’s best novel yet.View image in fullscreenRemainby Nicholas Sparks with M Night Shyamalan(Sphere,£22)Author Sparks and film-maker Shyamalan jointly developed the premise and characters for this romantic supernatural mystery. Tate is an emotionally repressed architect recovering from a nervous breakdown when he wakes up to find a strange woman, Wren, living in the house he’s rented for himself alone. Unsurprisingly, she’s a ghost who doesn’t know she’s dead, unable to “move on” until a mystery connected to her death is resolved. Realising that some things he had never believed in are real – and he’s in love with one – Tate determines to set Wren free by finding out how she died. There’s nothing very original about this formulaic story, but it’s smoothly done: a warm-hearted, sentimental tale of the expected.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFantasy booksHorror booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Harvey is a muskrat with a grievance against his awful sibling. His sister Mildred feels just the same way. I read this at four or five curled up on a yellow beanbag next to the radiator, in Bournville, where I grew up. I honestly don’t think there is a better reading spot anywhere in the world.My favourite book growing upPeanuts. I loved Snoopy long before I became an author. But he is an inspiration to all writers, sending a novel to his publishers with an immortal covering letter: “Gentlemen, enclosed is the manuscript of my new novel. I know you are going to like it. In the meantime, please send me some money so I can live it up.”The book that changed me as a teenagerThrasymachus, by CWE Peckett and AR Munday. There were newer Greek textbooks, so I have no idea why we used this. It had been written for prep school boys, I think, so the stories centred on a little boy named Thrasymachus, wandering about the Underworld, using simple constructions until we got the hang of the alphabet and the many, many verb endings (perfect, imperfect and pluperfect not enough for you? Let us throw in the aorist to keep you on your toes). I was terrible at Greek for ages, but it all worked out in the end.The writer who changed my mindAnyone who has ever written an instruction manual, for anything from a boiler to a board game. It took me many years to accept that I would honestly rather sit being cold than read the instructions to anything. There’s something about turning the first page that makes me feel as if I’ve been buried alive.The books that made me want to be a writerCynthia Heimel. Her collected columns were so smart and funny, with their pop art covers and excellent titles – If You Can’t Live Without Me, Why Aren’t You Dead Yet?!, Get Your Tongue Out of My Mouth, I’m Kissing You Goodbye etc. I was about 20 when I first read her, and just starting to do standup, which would go on to be the next decade of my life. She made me see a different way of being funny, in print. I still think of her often when I’m writing.Theauthor I came back toHomer. I hated the Iliad when I read it at school: all those loathsome, posturing men, and endless descriptions of people dying. And now I know it has worlds contained within it, about war and loss, anger and grief, love and fear.The book I rereadOvid’s Metamorphoses. It never migrates back from my desk to the bookshelf. We have unfinished business, I assume. I just don’t know what it is yet.The book I could never read againAnything by a Brontë. I just don’t need that much torment in my life, and if I do, there’s always Catullus.The book I discovered later in lifeBleak House. The Turning Point by Robert Douglas Fairhurst – which charts the year when Dickens wrote it – made me want to read Dickens for the first time since school.The book I am currently readingThe Politics of Apollonius Rhodius’ Argonautica by Anatole Mori.

For having the temerity to lecture his creditors on the folly of austerity, he was treated as the villain of the piece. Yet for all his swagger, he has always been a surprisingly sober thinker: Keynesian at heart, internationalist in instinct, he has built a reputation as a critic of dollar hegemony and Fortress Europe, a defender of both the precariat and refugees. You wonder if he’s experienced some schadenfreude in watching Germany’s economic miracle go bad of late – an implosion largely brought about by administering to itself the austerian medicine it once prescribed to the Greeks.His latest book, the 10th since 2010, departs from his usual sober fare. This time, he offers a collective portrait of five unyielding women in his life who, in their different ways, thumbed their noses at patriarchy and autocracy. Written after thugs beat him up in 2023 in what hedescribedas a “brazen fascist attack”, this is a therapeutic enterprise that doubles as a counter-history of postwar Greece.First comes his mother, Eleni, raised in poverty having pigeons for supper, yet among the first women to study chemistry at Athens, despite the professors who urged her to trade equations for children. We then meet her brother Panayis, once a Siemens director and Nazi sympathiser, who became radicalised during the colonels’ dictatorship of 1967-74 and wound up behind bars for trying to blow up the ministry of industry. One of Varoufakis’s earliest memories is of a harrowing visit to one of the junta’s prisons to see Panayis; an argument with a soldier earned Eleni a slap across the face.Varoufakis’s paternal grandmother Anna, a Cairo socialite turned feminist radical, scandalised her gilded expatriate circle by learning Arabic, joining underground movements, and urging dockers to boycott fascist ships bound for Spain; her 1951 funeral drew thousands of Egyptian women, an ironic tribute in a land that became a hostile environment for foreigners under Nasser a year later.Varoufakis’s maternal grandmother, by contrast, was illiterate until her 60s. Though she was confined to inner-city Athens, Trisevgeni’s story allows him to take the full measure of the civil war, which lasted from 1946 to 1949. His ire falls predictably on American meddling, while Britain’s “white terror” – Churchill sending up to 75,000 troops to crush communism – earns only a half rebuke. Through her he also evokes the 50s with flair, a time when reading even “centrist newspapers, the Greek equivalent of the Guardian”, could cost you your livelihood.Georgia, grandmother of Varoufakis’s first wife, Margarita, supplies the book’s most novelistic chapter. Married to a sadistic ex-collaborator who once presented Varoufakis with a copy of Mein Kampf, she maintained that communist partisans had murdered her first husband. Some sleuthing reveals the reverse: the man had been a card-carrying communist himself, betrayed in memory in order to ensure survival in a postwar Greece crawling with fascists. Georgia denies it – until, one evening, she belts out a partisan song, sly confirmation from a widow who had played her role with aplomb.Finally comes Varoufakis’ second wife Danaë Stratou, textile heiress and conceptual artist, charting and condemning borders from Belfast to the West Bank. Varoufakis abandons the ivory tower to join her in these journeys. Not long after, politics recasts him as the famous half of the power couple. They do a photoshoot for Paris Match at their Acropolis flat, with Danaë leaping into his arms. Later, he is upset when the press paints her as a “glamorous, blonde, haute bourgeoisie trophy wife of a controversial motorcycle-riding minister”.These profiles allow Varoufakis to shoehorn in his own autobiography, from reading mathematical economics at “Red Essex”, where he improbably became spokesperson of the Black Students Alliance, to his later mission to “stop the rot in Greece”. The book works as microhistory but is marred by his bloviating style and schlocky prose: moons that heed prayers and so on. A character is described as “a contrarian’s contrarian”, and a few lines later as “a thinking radical’s thinking radical”. Worse, his subjects appear less as people than as ideological stand-ins: his father, Yorgo, the unreconstructed communist, Eleni the democratic socialist, Anna the feminist internationalist. He even sidesteps the juiciest rumour – thatDanaë inspired the Pulp hit Common People, about a Greek student who enjoyed slumming it in London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It is a coming-of-age tale about an initially unlikable teenage boy growing up in the 00s, who matures through six graphic novels that deftly reference everything from Japanese manga to western superheroes, video games and Tintin. It is also, of course,a hit movie, a 2022 Netflixanime series, and a2010 video game– the last two of which were soundtracked by New York City-based indie rock band Anamanaguchi.‘My favourite scene in the Scott Pilgrim anime is where Knives and Kim are just jamming in a room together, and almost nothing happens,” laughs Peter Berkman, one of the lead songwriters and guitarists in the band. “It’s just one of those slice-of-life moments where you remember why you love music in the first place. It really struck a chord with me. No pun intended.”View image in fullscreenSex Bob-Omb in Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.Photograph: Album/AlamyAnamanaguchi gained some notoriety for using video game hardware in their early, instrumental music, becoming one of the pioneering bands in thechiptune genre– all while they were still at college. During the band’s first self-funded tour, during which Berkman slept on the couch of the band he was supporting, he got amessage out of nowhere.“I got an email from somebody working at Ubisoft about a video game for a universal IP tie-in, and they didn’t go any further than that. ‘Could that be the new Alien vs Predator game or something like that?’, I thought. But I knew that – no matter what – when I brought that back to the band, we would say yes to whatever it was … we had all grown up loving video game and movie soundtracks.” It turned out to be an invitation to compose music for the first Scott Pilgrim video game, which was released in 2010.Now, Anamanaguchi is in the midst of a renaissance: in 2022, when the game was re-released as a Complete Edition, the band embarked on the Scott Pilgrim vs the World: The Game Soundtrack tour. Last year, the band wrote and performed music for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, a Netflix spin-off that acts as a meta commentary on Scott’s life. Anamanaguchi supported Hatsune Miku in her Fortnite festival appearance this year, a perfect fit for a band whose identity has always rested at the intersection of video games and live music, and in August, they launched Anyway, their first record in six years, which trades in the band’s synth-based bleeps and blorps for something decidedly more alt-rock, though the 8-bit influences of its members still remain if you listen hard enough. And they’re also working on the soundtrack for a new Scott Pilgrim game, due out next year, another playful beat-’em-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a direct link between Anamanaguchi’s return to the series and the new voice they’ve found on their records. “Doing the soundtrack for the new game, Scott Pilgrim EX, allowed us to see what it would be like to dampen that aspect in our own record world, knowing that we were going full in, soundtrack-style, on the game,” says Berkman.Berkman says that in the 15 years between games, the band have matured when it comes to their approach to music. They have gained experience as producers, they have grown “as listeners of music”, and they have become even more excited by the range of styles that video game music represents.“You need to feel that connection between what you’re experiencing as a player and - even in a beat-em-up! - what the story is trying to do at that moment,” says Berkman. “If a situation calls for a dark, gothic industrial thing, we can make that happen – and we can make it happen in a way it never has before… [Scott PilgrimEX developer Tribute Games] has let us be a hands-on with the audio mix. and with the musical cues we want. That freedom is extremely important to us. The flow of the music, the way it makes you feel… you can really feel the authorship in video game soundtracks.”View image in fullscreenOn the beach in Scott Pilgrim EX.Photograph: Tribute Games IncHaving played a demo of Scott Pilgrim EX, it seems that Tribute Games’ trust in the band has paid off. The music is playful and toys with convention, setting up prompts or expectations, only to surprise you with how sound effects or motifs become part of a level’s texture. It actually reminds me of Sea Power’s work on Disco Elysium, strange as that comparison may seem to anyone who knows their music. Sea Power were given lot of creative control in adapting their sound to fit the morose world of Revachol, and Tribute Games has done the same here, even if the with pixel art, neon colours, and buoyant adolescence of it all deliver a completely different tone.“Tribute Games has given us a level of freedom that can only be matched by a company just … not knowing what you’re doing,” laughs Berkman. “We’ve been able to be a part of the development process in a way that we weren’t in the last time, you know? We’re getting nightly builds, and we’re able to ask: ‘Is this stagnant? Do I need to add a part here?’ It really helps with the arrangement, and in understanding the feel. This is the soundtrack we’ve wanted to make.”Scott Pilgrim EX will be out in 2026.

This might be a work of outlandish genius, or a devised end of year A-level project featuring world-class actors (led byRalph Fiennesand Francesca Annis). It is very funny, although perhaps it doesn’t always mean to be, and well acted, despite the ropey material.Written byRebecca Lenkiewicz, the story – more a fever dream – is of a fading TV show host, Larry (Fiennes), stranded in a liminal space with a luminous bar and a Liverpudlian waiter with an eye-patch (Rachel Tucker). His life seems to be flashing before him, or rather circling around him, on Bob Crowley’s stage revolve.The last in a trio of productions in Fiennes’ season at this theatre, it is a puzzle too strange to solve. Larry is haunted by memories of an overbearing mother (Annis, poisonously brilliant); a teenage lover, Marianne (Rosalind Eleazar, a cool cat) with whom he is reunited 20 years on; and a twin brother (also hilariously played by Fiennes who mostly appears in that role as an enlarged projection).View image in fullscreenDarkly surreal … Fiennes and Francesca Annis.Photograph: Marc BrennerIn a production directed by Holly Race Roughan, screens with crackling static conjure a world of black-and-white film, as do the bursts of tap dance. It seems very much an ode to Hollywood screen classics, but also combines a darkly surreal musical dream world reminiscent of Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective with the limbo universe of A Matter of Life and Death.Beyond that, it is all open to interpretation, especially when randomly declaimed haiku are thrown into the mix. Mother-son tensions bubble dangerously, a romance between Larry and Marianne steams up again and the dancing continues apace. There is a great satirical scene in which Larry interviews Marianne, live on TV. She has become a hotshot Hollywood movie star, but it is rather a stretch to believe she is drawn back to Larry, who has all the energy and charisma of a punctured tyre. It might, of course, be a middle-aged man’s fantasy in this warp of dreams, hallucinations and reality.Just when you think the last tap dance is done, there is the strangest of Beckettian endings. This is less a play than an experience of sheer, hypnotising madness.AtTheatre Royal Bathuntil 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreRalph FiennesRebecca LenkiewiczTheatre Royal BathreviewsShareReuse this content"

The priest Imhotep is credited with designing the step pyramid of King Djoser at Saqqara about 4,700 years ago, and so starting the sublime aesthetic achievements of the ancient state that straddled the Nile.Yet ancient Egyptians did not imagine creativity as an individual achievement or see artists as celebrities – unless they were literally gods. Imhotep was believed to be the son of the creator god Ptah and was deified as a god of wisdom and knowledge, patron of scribes. Most Egyptian artists were no more likely to be remembered by name than Stonehenge’s builders. “Art” was not an idea. Golden mummy masks and statues of spear-wielding pharaohs were not made to be admired but to help dead people on their journeys through the afterlife. As for individual creativity, there wasn’t much place for it in art that conserved the same style, with only superficial changes, for 3,000 years.Or was that really the case? When you study wall paintings in Egyptian tombs, says Helen Strudwick of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, you sometimes see outbursts of individualism, when the painter breaks out of the formalised Egyptian style. “You’ll find a little snippet where it’s really quite free … sketchy stuff.”Strudwick is the curator of the Fitzwilliam’s Made in Ancient Egypt exhibition, which aims to let the artist step out from behind Egyptian art. Unlike most exhibitions that are transfixed by the magical purposes and magnificence of this art, Strudwick wants to explore how and by whom it was made: “Their skills, how they lived, their practices.”They didn’t call themselves artists, for one thing. “The term they used is ‘hemut’, someone who knew how to do things in a skilled way with deep knowledge.”These highly skilled workers were “predominantly men” and their knowledge was passed on through families, father to son. It was valued work and their lives were fairly comfortable. In the Valley of the Kings, there was a special village for the artists who worked at this remote desert location, with a canteen and servants. A typical day involved four hours work, then a meal break, then another four hours. It seems a long way from the stereotype of ancient Egypt as an oppressive top-down society where overseers with lashes extracted forced labour.“Slaves didn’t build the pyramids – they were built by a skilled workforce,” says Strudwick. In general in ancient Egypt, “Slaves were less of a thing than people tend to think.”We see ancient Egypt so much through its tombs and their furnishings, not to mention the mummies, that it’s easy to picture it as more alien than it was. Made in Ancient Egypt wants to get at the real life behind some of the world’s greatest art. As Strudwick says: “These people were not mysteriously weird but human just like the rest of us.”Made in Ancient Egyptis at theFitzwilliamMuseum, Cambridge, to12 April.Pyramid schemes: five artworks from the exhibitionHead end of the inner coffin of Nespawershefyt c. 1000BC (main image, above)Every ancient Egyptian’s hope was to have a happy afterlife. But that would entail a dangerous journey and judgment, so every spell and charm helped. All the beauty of the gold-decorated coffin of Nespawershefyt, a supervisor of scribes’ and craftsmen’s workshops, is intended to speed him on his quest. The painters and woodworkers who created this coffin were surely under extra pressure to do a good job – or maybe motivated by affection and respect, who knows? – for Nespawershefyt, their boss.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: National Museums ScotlandCommemorative stela of the faience maker Rekhamun 1295-1186BCIt’s very possible Rekhamun made this himself, to preserve his name and help him succeed in the afterlife. Ancient Egyptian faience, made with quartz and other minerals, was a brilliant blue, glazed ceramic that was believed to be magical. Against this supernatural blue, Rekhamun is drawn in clear black lines standing in front of the god Osiris, who ruled the afterlife. His gesture of supplication and worship is a personal plea for protection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Animals are depicted in flat profile, in the formalised way they appear in tomb paintings. Artists are literally being shown how to see like an ancient Egyptian. When the 14th-century BC pharaoh Akhenaten overturned religious and artistic conventions, artists switched immediately to the realistic, expressive style he wanted. When he died they went back to drawing like this.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christian Décamps/Musée du Louvre/ GrandPalaisRmnDecorative spoon with an elaborate handle and swivel lid 1327-1186BCThis exquisite object of carob wood shows how creative Egypt’s craftspeople could be. It’s a long container for cosmetics: the jar the woman appears to carry is a makeup pot with a movable lid. The portrayal of her near-naked body under the tottering jar, still with its bright yet delicate painted colours, has a sense of sheer artistic playfulness. It’s a glimpse not only of the maker’s skill but the joy ancient Egyptian artists could find in their work.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumGlass vessel in the form of a fish 1550-1292BCIt used to be thought that the ancient Egyptians didn’t know how to make glass so imported it. Now this is known to be untrue. “There’s clear evidence that they were making glass in a really skilled way,” says Strudwick. That skill glows in this gorgeous sculpture of a fish. It is also proof that Egyptian artists could see and imitate nature in the round: their paintings’ formality was dropped when they made three-dimensional objects.Explore more on these topicsArtEgyptologyExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Floods in art are usually biblical. Artists including Uccello, Michelangelo and Poussin painted the deluge as a divine punishment by God, leaving sinners drowning or scrambling for tiny rocks while Noah survives in the Ark. But there is no such sacred meaning here. Monet is simply observing a bit of bad weather. Stranded at his home in Giverny by local flooding in autumn 1896, he used the time to paint this gloomily entrancing view of a water-covered field. Barren trees rise like spectres from the grey swamp as the drowned earth merges with mists above. This is a starker, grimmer version of Monet’s waterlily paintings: as in those dreamy decorations, he melts and mirrors one reality into another, sky reflecting water, but here the effect is haunted, even nightmarish.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in TouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s an abstract painting, a minimalist one even, yet there’s a rawness suggesting heartfelt narratives, barely contained feelings, kept just about in check behind the blue facade.In this little essayistic exhibition, Blue Wall’s creator, the abstract artistSean Scully, lets you into his life with unguarded passion. At the other end of the room, he exposes what his abstract art sublimates and transfigures in a recent self-portrait. It’s an innocent, honest attempt to look in the mirror and see himself, sitting at home in front of one of his big striped canvases, the colours of his clothes bouncing against it. Scully seems to be in a state of artistic flux and a mood of self-scrutiny, not just “mirroring” himself, as the exhibition title has it, in that self-portrait, but imagining a counterlife in which an artist famous for a very recognisable style of abstract painting is a drawer of cups and a portraitist of family life.I don’t think about it. I just do it, with no thought about ambition or result … it’s pure feelingSean ScullyHis model for this foray into small pictures of the big thing we call everyday life is the Italian still life artist Giorgio Morandi. A wall of prints and drawings by Morandi faces a wall of Scully works in a room the size of a large bedroom. You can see why he loves Morandi and identifies with him: the Italian painted with precision and restraint, repeating slight variants on arrangements of bottles and cups at his quiet home in Bologna from the 1920s to the 1960s. Works here include one in which Morandi dares to draw a bunch of broccoli.There is no getting to the bottom of them. And in the same way, if you find the regular fields of rectangular colour Scully has been painting for more than four decades tranquil, you haven’t been looking closely enough. They flow with sensitivity, blaze with memory. Whether you see them as ploughed Irish fields (he was born in Dublin) or metropolitan structures (he grew up in London), his lines, his trenches or planks of colour, are hard won, dug up. Here he lets you see where he digs, in sketches full of fierce, free emotion.View image in fullscreenInnocent and honest … The Artist by Sean Scully.Photograph: Courtesy Estorick Collection of Modern Italian ArtThere is a loving watercolour of his son and a beach scene of a mother and child entitled Madonna. Among these small slices of Scully’s life, and heart, are designs for abstract compositions in which you can see the process by which his heaving passion is transformed into disciplined painting.Both Scully and Morandi seem to follow Cézanne’s advice to “treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone”. That pull of geometry is plain to see in Morandi’s works, such as his 1931 etching Various Objects on a Table. It also emerges in Scully’s 2025 ink sketch of a glass on a table: while the base of the glass is barely curved at all, its top rim shapes a near perfect circle, as if it is slipping before your eyes from the real world of observed appearances into the abstract realm of absolute geometries. Now that’s what Cézanne was talking about. The rim of a mug, also drawn last year, becomes an even more perfect and unhesitant circle.Jewels of the Nile: how a new exhibition finally gives Egyptian artists their dueRead moreYet when I once asked Scully about Cézanne, he made it clear he loves and reveres Van Gogh more. It’s not just his commitment to expressing raw feeling through colour, nor the echo of Vincent in his intense, uninhibited self-portrait. He also provides, above a sketched abstract square, a scribbled manifesto for his art: “I don’t think about it. I just do it, with no thought about ambition or result … it’s pure feeling.” His forceful, thickly drawn landscape sketches nearby have the authenticity of Van Gogh, or Constable, or Auerbach. You look from these ardent rough drawings to his abstract designs and see, and feel, the poetry of memory, all the suffering and desire that a nest of rectangles can hold.If you still need convincing, Scully takes the transformation the other way and adds figuration to one of his abstract works. In his 2023 print White Rose, against layered rectangles of black and greyish white, lies a flower thrown down as if at a funeral. It could be corny but isn’t, as the modernist painter confesses the sheer universality and heartbreaking directness of what he wants to say.There’s only one problem with this honest, intimate show. Scully kills the artist he loves. The freedom and restlessness of his living art makes Morandi’s work seem almost sterile. On this occasion, there’s no comparison between the finished works of a dead artist and the flowing energy of one who is still making it anew.Sean Scully: Mirroring is at the Estorick Collection, London, until 23 NovemberExplore more on these topicsSean ScullyArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

But more than 35 years since his death in 1988, would the New York artist have been flattered or horrified by the mass marketing of his art?Basquiat’s premature death at 27 means that questions will remain as to whether he would have signed off on things likebathmats on Redbubbleor Ligne Bath’sTrumpet candle. How would he, for example, have felt about a Basquiat collaboration with MeUndies underpants – with the tagline: “Jean-Michel Basquiat … taught us all to look inward and find our authentic self. MeUndies always strives for authenticity.”A new book,Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Making of an Icon, by Doug Woodham, the former president of Christie’s auction house in the US, hopes to answer this question and unpack the neo-expressionist’s journey to becoming one of the most famous artists in the world.“I think comparing [him] toKeith Haringis a good way to try and understand it,” he said.Haring was a contemporary and friend of Basquiat’s and, according to Woodham, “was the first contemporary artist to realise he could put his motifs on a keychain and sell it at pop-up shops, knowing that it wouldn’t hurt his market value”. While Woodham believes Basquiat would be “excited and happy” about how the estate has marketed his artworks, he is unsure the artist would like all the merchandise upon which his work appears.Friend and artistic collaborator Al Diaz, who co-created Basquiat’s Samo graffiti tag, is more definitive. He believes the merch dilutes the meaning and message of the art in the process. “It’s abusive at this point. It’s demeaning to the artist, offensive and disrespectful,” he says over the phone from New York. Was there anything Basquiat would have categorically hated, I ask? “There was that Barbie doll they did and a door mat. It seems so over the top and thoughtless,” he says. “It’s like, ‘OK, let’s print this on everything and anything’.”View image in fullscreenKeith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat in December 1987.Photograph: Irving ZuckerAnd yet the spectre in the popular consciousness of Basquiat as the starving junkie punk artist is complicated by Woodham’s portrayal in The Making of an Icon. Once the artist started making money, he is characterised as “loving cash”, his ambition leading him to make a beeline to a friendship with Andy Warhol and even self-branding in a costume of designer suits flecked with paint. He had seen his fellow artist Julian Schnabel garnering attention for showing up to parties wearing pyjamas. “He chased fame very strategically and deliberately,” says Diaz. “He was very, very clever and had a special charm.”The book posits that three key traumas shaped the artist: a near-fatal car crash during childhood; the sometimes violent breakdown of his parents’ marriage, which led to his mother, Matilda, having a nervous breakdown; and finally his mother’s wish for his father, Gerard, to raise him and his two sisters alone.Gerard Basquiat was born in Haiti, but fled the country because of civil unrest, first going to Miami before ending up alone in New York. The artist’s father only spoke French, but after learning English, he became an accountant. “He’s really impressive,” says Woodham, “he’s also very domineering”.Gerard Basquiat often butted heads with his son. “Everybody wants to be recognised and supported by their parents,” says Diaz. “He had a lot of anger and disdain and disappointment because he never received that from his dad … having a bisexual, art-orientated son was not in [his father’s] playbook.”After Basquiat’s death, his estate was taken over by his father, and their layered relationship bled into our modern understanding of the artist. In The Making of an Icon, Gerard is portrayed as savvy – he partnered with Keith Haring’s legal team who taught him about licensing – but also, understandably, controlling of his son’s narrative.Woodham spoke off the record to gallery curators who said that Gerard Basquiat would lean on them to omit certain parts of the biography (his mother’s role in his life, the effects of his childhood trauma and the depths of his drug habit and bisexuality), so a more “heteronormative” narrative would be promoted. A narrative, one would assume, that would make him more palatable to both the elite art market and the wider public.View image in fullscreenGerard Basquiat and his partner, Nora Fitzpatrick, in the living room of their Boerum Hill brownstone in Brooklyn, March 1978.Photograph: Dinanda Nooney, courtesy of the Photography Collection, the Miriam And Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs, the New York Public LibraryThere was a uniformity to how all the museum and gallery catalogues were written, says Woodham. And yet, he says: “I think all these strands add a richness to the guy’s character. I think it makes him more compelling and interesting.”The reach of Basquiat’s art is undeniable. And for a younger generation, many of whom only know him through this merch, it simply doesn’t matter that his art is omnipresent.“It’s fascinating to talk to 30-something collectors,” says Woodham. “For them, Basquiat has always been in the pantheon. And the first time they ever heard of him was from a Uniqlo T-shirt.”Explore more on these topicsJean-Michel BasquiatArtKeith HaringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He used an image of himself taken on the day of his diagnosis clutching his knees and looking defiantly into the camera, then placed it, using Photoshop, between the bars of the M25 bridge crossing, which look as though they’re imprisoning him. “It was the day my life changed,” he says.“Photography was a great tool for therapy,” Gupta says, and collaging “was very freeing, to get rid of those boundaries and put elements together.” On his new Apple computer, he merged low-resolution photographs he’d taken of posters and graffiti in Berlin; a zoomed-in picture of a 1930s gay bar the Nazis closed down; self-portraits and scans from books. He explored queer relationships, migration and his concerns around Thatcher taking Britain into Europe. “All of the messaging at the time, very similar to now, was about being a stranger in a strange land,” says Gupta. “I’ve been here since the 70s and I’m seventysomething but I still feel precarious.”His resulting series, Trespass (1992-95), forms the anchor point of a new exhibition about collaging,I Still Dream of Lost Vocabularies, at Autograph gallery in London, which looks at how images can be deconstructed and reappropriated to give them new meaning. In more than 90 works by 13 contemporary artists, photographic truth is called into question.View image in fullscreenDigital overconsumption … Qualeasha Wood’s Influencer [detail], 2025.Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Pippy Houldsworth GalleryPopularised by artists in the early 20th century, collage got its name from the French termpapiers collésto describe pasting paper cut-outs on to surfaces. But curator Bindi Vora wants to dispel the “misconception that collage can simply be a cut-and-paste type of practice.” She has included tapestries by American textile artist Qualeasha Wood, whose self-portraits reference Ozempic and digital overconsumption; and Kenyan artist Jess Atieno’s woven pictures, which challenge east Africa’s colonial archives by using postcards, maps, and images of agriculture where photographs don’t exist.Indigenous Australian artist Brook Andrew’s sapele wood sculpture unites images from queer and colonial histories. Henna Nadeem’s newly commissioned photomontage links landscape imagery with Islamic patterns; while Sim Chi Yin’s glass lantern slides from the late 19th and early 20th centuries show scenes from British Malaya that she has digitally altered to include her socialist grandfather, who was executed, and her son, who was born during the pandemic.View image in fullscreenGlass lantern slides … from the series The Suitcase is a Little Bit Rotten, 2022, by Sim Chi Yin.Photograph: Courtesy the artistA 22-minute silent film by Wendimagegn Belete gives faces to the freedom fighters in Ethiopia who fought against Italian colonisation between 1935 and 1941. “There are so many pockets of these histories that are just not talked about,” says Vora. “I think it becomes quite important in the conversation around what is propelled into the spotlight and what histories are marginalised.”Collaging becomes a means of disrupting the status quo. Kudzanai-Violet Hwami distorts her figurative paintings with visual fragments – classical and religious subjects as well as images of nature (she found family members posing beside plants in her family albums) – to figure out her identity as a Black, queer woman. Glitches and areas of pixelation express changes in consciousness and the forging of a digital identity.Sabrina Tirvengadum keeps mistakes in the AI-modelled photographs of her ancestors that explore the fractured history of Mauritius, which was shaped by indentured labour. In rose-tinted portraits, her family sometimes have six fingers, while the Aapravasi Ghat staircase – which was the arrival point in Port Louis for more than 462,000 labourers, who worked for free or a low wage in a similar style after slavery was supposedly abolished – has two more steps than it should have done. “What I love about AI is that it gives me the glitches, like in history, when things are not quite right,” says Tirvengadum.View image in fullscreenRose-tinted … Sabrina Tirvengadum’s Happy Birthday to You, 2025.Photograph: Courtesy the artistThe artist had to overcome AI’s racial bias to create imagined portraits of her family where images don’t exist. When she started using the tool in 2022, “I noticed that it wasn’t able to generate people that looked like me when I typed in ‘Indian’, it would come up with Native Americans and they were very racist, stereotypical images,” says Tirvengadum. She says that this has since changed.Tirvengadum visited Mauritius, during the pandemic, for the first time in 14 years “to reconnect with my family by taking photographs of them.” In albums, “I got to see photos that I hadn’t seen, I saw what my grandfather looked like for the first time.” Using AI to collage, the artist found a vocabulary when words weren’t always available.Historical maps play an important role in the exhibition: Reena Saini Kallat draws on her family’s experience with partition in India, looking at political borders and the power of a passport; while Arpita Akhanda threads colonial maps through family photographs, to represent the missing time when her politically active grandfather would cross from West Bengal into India. Meanwhile, Sheida Soleimani, who runs a wildlife rehabilitation centre, links political exile from Iran with the care of injured migratory birds.View image in fullscreenDouble meanings … Thato Toeba’s Man on Fire, 2017.Photograph: Courtesy the artistTo understand the impact of diamond mining in southern Africa, Thato Toeba turned to public records where he found Horace Nicholls’s photographs of the second Boer war. Nicholls was obsessed with horses, which he captured over the bloodshed and violence, contributing to the erasure of Black people in the archives.Toeba’s collages are full of double meanings: Man on Fire reflects on the brutal death of Ernesto Alfabeto Nhamuave, a church-going Mozambican man, who was burned to death during a rise of xenophobic violence in a Johannesburg township in 2008. Several men hold their hands up to the sky in a gesture of surrender but also to praise. In the centre is the portrait that was circulated by Nhamuave’s family to remember him, not for the devastating death that he succumbed to, but to think about who he was as an individual.It is a show that considers the missing chapters and histories in the archives, and how they might be brought into being – a debate that the curator says is very much alive. “We’ve seen a lot of shows historically that have dealt with works made by artists in the 1940s and 50s, but this is very much a kind of contemporary conversation,” says Vora. “We go right up until this year.”I Still Dream of Lost Vocabularies is atAutograph, London, 10 October to 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the Guardian music desk’sexcellent round table on the album, just about every panellist expressed a wish that Swift would take a break from the constant churn of releasing records, in order to recapture a lost spark.And it has been quite the churn. Since 2019 Swift has on average released an album a year, and that’s not counting the Taylor’s Version re-records of her older albums. All of this managed alongside a certain billion-dollar-grossing, 20-month stadium tour, too. No wonder the word “burnout” is being thrown around liberally. The Guide will leave it to more knowledgable Swiftheads to decide whether that’s the case, but The Life of a Showgirl backlash does raise an interesting question: how much music is too much? How frequentlyshoulda band or artist be releasing albums?You likely have an answer in your head already, and it’s probably two years or thereabouts. That sounds about right to me too: it gives the band/artist long enough to get the creative juices flowing, not to mention properly tour their last record, but it’s frequent enough to remind everyone they are still a going concern. That two-year cycle has not always been the norm: in the 1960s or 70s a year was the norm, the standard release schedule of everyone from the Beatles to Abba.Streaming seemed to disrupt the model again: freed, to some degree, from the lengthy cycle of production and distribution around physical releases, artists were able to release as much music as they were able to churn out; the more the better to stay fresh in the algorithm and chase streaming services’ meagre royalty payments. Soalbums became longerand arrived more frequently: a2015 Guardian articlepondered whether more than one album a year was becoming the norm. If that hasn’t quite come to pass it might have something to do with streaming’s shift, over the past decade,towards older music. Rather than churn out new albums, established artists can rely on their back catalogue to rack up streaming numbers and power their tours (you suspect that had Oasis included any new music in the setlist of their reunion tour, it would have, if anything, served as adisincentive). And of course some artists have recognised that scarcity too has value, building anticipation for long-awaited releases.For Swift though there are other considerations at play. She operates in the mostcompetitive corner of the music industry, where massive new stars are minted at a rapid clip. With the generation below her, and perhaps even the generation below that too, nipping at her heels, perhaps she believes that sitting a year or two out is not an option. She simply must keep up with the Rodrigos. Moreover, would a period of absence suit her diaristic, overshare-y brand of pop? Some artists operate best by putting it all out there.Clearly there are limits to that style of writing, as a glance at thelyrics to Woodwill confirm. But, for all the brickbats being thrown in the direction of The Life of a Showgirl, its author can point to thestaggering first week salesas evidence that her fans haven’t had too much of her just yet. And for anyone hoping that Taylor’s output might slow after this latest success, there’s bad news. As our resident Swift cryptologist Laura Snapes notes in the roundtable piece: “Next year is the 20th anniversary of her debut album, and her next record will be her 13th – her lucky number. There’s no way she won’t mark that.” See you this time next year, then.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s fantastic, and I can stick it in my gym bag for a quick protein hit after a workout.Leon PoultneyGo retro with an MP3 playerView image in fullscreenSnowsky Echo Mini£49.99 at AMP3£66.99 at eBayI’m a big fan of the Snowsky Echo Mini from my list of thebest MP3 players. It’s a great (re)introduction to portable music players, and the fact that it’s shaped like a cassette tape gives it a whole extra layer of charm.Alan MartinMix it up with cordless blendingView image in fullscreenKitchenAid cordless hand blender£219 at KitchenAid£219 at AmazonI really liked the rechargeable battery concept of the KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender that I tested forbest blenders– not being tied to a plug socket makes all those little jobs so much easier.Rachel OgdenBeach campfire, in a candleView image in fullscreenSmoky sea salt candle£28 at Cornish Sea SaltI hugely enjoyed testingscented candlesanddiffusers. But the one I’m obsessed with is the Smoky Sea Salt candle by Cornish Sea Salt: it makes you feel like you’re sitting around a campfire on the beach. I can’t get enough of it.Kate JacobsSleep aids for a blissful 40 winksView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid mattressFrom £499.99 at OttyTheOtty Original Hybridmattress is my lone five-star review of the year, and the only one I subsequently bought for keeps. It continues to slay the competition.Jane HoskynFor more, read our guide tothe best mattressesView image in fullscreenMyHalos blackout sleep mask£9.99 at Amazon£12.99 at eBayThe best thing I’ve tested is the MyHalos blackout sleep mask, which costs less than £15 and romped to victory in my roundup of thebest sleep aids. I now have four, such is my fear of losing one to holiday baggage handlers or the eye mask fairy.JHCosy socksView image in fullscreenHeattech cable socks£7.90 at UniqloWe featured a pair of Heattech socks last Christmas that quickly became the most popular item ever on the Filter (since overtaken by theOtty mattressanda sub-£10 mascara, among other things). I finally succumbed to curiosity and bought myself a pair towards the end of winter, and they were just perfect for the shoulder season, keeping me warm even with bare legs. I’ve since developed a full-blown obsession with Uniqlo technical fabrics (Heattech scarves, Airism shorts …), but I don’t think I can hold the socks fully responsible.Monica HorridgeLovely booze-free bubblyView image in fullscreenL’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre£13.45 at Wine at HomeI was surprised to discover there are some really goodnon-alcoholic winesout there that taste like the real deal. The L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre was my favourite: with fine bubbles and depth of flavour, it’s a convincing alternative to real bubbly. I’m planning to get in a few bottles for Christmastime to moderate the intake a little and offer booze-free imbibers something tasty.Sophia LonghiA forever dressView image in fullscreenReiss Atelier maxidress£428 at Reiss£428 at NextThis Reiss Atelier dress was one of the most expensive things I’verecommended, and I hesitated to include it, but it is a truly beautiful piece that I will wear for ever. Also – it’s on offer now!Jess Cartner-MorleyA boot to hike forView image in fullscreenSorel waterproof sneaker boot£139.49 at Sports Shoes£155 at SorelAnd I never get tired ofrecommendingmy Sorel hiking boots. Sturdy but lightweight, ridiculously comfy, not stupidly expensive – and they actually look nice too.JCMPitch-perfect campingView image in fullscreenMSR Hubba Hubba NX tent£474.99 at Cotswold Outdoor£560 at Go OutdoorsI take my MSR Hubba Hubba tent wild camping all the time: it’s quick and intuitive to pitch and has two roomy porches, so it’s easy to share with another camper. And ourBoutique Glamping bell tentcomes to weddings, festivals and family camps with us; I love having headroom.Sian LewisFor more, read our guide to thebest tentsA knife made for gardensView image in fullscreenNiwaki hori hori knife£32 at Niwaki£32 at BurfordMy green-fingered aunt bought me a hori hori knife from Niwaki (as recommended in our piece ongifts so good we buy them on repeat) and I’m obsessed: it makes weeding really fast – and fun!SLJoggers to pep up the WFH wardrobeView image in fullscreenAdidas Originals Firebird track pants£60 at Adidas£60 at AsosI bought the Adidas Firebird joggers in green after Peter Bevan highlighted them in his50 men’s summer wardrobe updates. I wanted to update my work-from-home attire, so I don’t feel like such a slob when I pop out on my lunch break. These fit the bill perfectly: they’re comfy to sit in all day, but they also look good – plus they add a nice pop of colour to my wardrobe.Lily SmithSteamed rice microwave-styleView image in fullscreenSistema rice steamer£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonI’ve always wanted a rice cooker, but I don’t have the counter space. So when I saw Joanne Gould recommend this affordable microwave version in herreview of the best rice cookers, I gave it a go. It produced much more delicious and less starchy rice than I’d ever managed in a saucepan, and all for £7.99.LSThe perfect hot brushView image in fullscreenGHD DuetBlowdry hairdryer brush£379 at GHD£379 at LookfantasticI thought nothing would make me part with my well-tried and very trustedRevlon One Step hot brush, but the GHD Duet Blowdry I tested forbest hot brushesreally did blow me away. A new favourite.Lise SmithThe great kickstart coffee machineView image in fullscreenDe’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine£419.99 at Lakeland£580 at ArgosMy family loves our De’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine (a kind house-warming gift), which takes the sting out of waking up by brewing fresh barista-style coffee at the touch of a button. It’s quick, easy to clean, and has a handy milk steamer for lattes and cappuccinos. I can’t face the morning without it.LSFor more, read our guide to thebest coffee machinesBrilliant slow cookingView image in fullscreenGreenPan stainless steel slow cooker£215 at CurrysView image in fullscreenNinja 8-in-1 slow cooker£149 at John Lewis£150 at ArgosTwo of the snazzyslow cookersI tested during my epickleftikosaga were particularly brilliant (the GreenPan and Ninja Foodi Impossible 8-in-1).Joanne GouldMicrowave toastiesView image in fullscreenMorphy Richards Mico£19.99 at Morphy Richards£19.99 at AmazonIntesting toastie makers, I came across a nifty microwaveable version from Morphy Richards that will have to be prised out of my cold, dead hands when the time comes to pass it on to the lovely people atGratitude Upcyclein Barnet. However, shout out to theMcGuigan Mid shirazred wine – which I tested for my piece onthe best mid-strength drinks– as it’s the most surprising thing I keep buying; at 7% it just about tastes like the stronger stuff and is a good Sunday option. It’s in loads of supermarkets, too.JGSmash the potato mashingView image in fullscreenOxo Good Grips smooth potato masher£12 at Dunelm£12 at AmazonI included the Oxo Good Grips potato masher in myFather’s Day gift guide, and it has revolutionised my mashing game. Light, fluffy and sorting your mash in seconds, it beats a wire-based design hands down and its ergonomic hand position is much easier to use. It’s also a doddle to clean: you won’t find old bits of potato stuck in the curves next time you go to mash.Charlie AllenbyBig props to no-drops food-catcherView image in fullscreenHighchair food catcher£39.95 at AmazonI’ve got a nine-month-old, and there are an awful lot of things you throw cash at in the pursuit ofmaking your life easier. One thing I couldn’t live without, though, is the Catchy. It’s essentially a bit of plastic that you fit beneath a highchair, and it catches any food, cutlery, plates and cups tossed over the side. They can then be plonked back in front of your baby because they haven’t hit the deck.CAHydrogen hydrationView image in fullscreenEcho water flask£283.99 at Healf£299 at AmazonI was sceptical about the hydrogen-infused water bottle (the price, the price!) in my test of thebest water bottles, but became a convert – chug a bottle of it and I find I’m less dehydrated the morning after boozing.Zoë PhillimoreJuice on the goView image in fullscreenAnker Nano power bank£19.99 at Anker£19.99 at AmazonAs someone who uses my phone for everything, from paying for things to unlocking my front door, it cannot be without battery. The Anker Nano – rated best for portability in Pete Wise’stest of the best power banks– gives me peace of mind that I won’t lock myself out of the house if my phone dies.ZPThe rise-and-shine alarm clockView image in fullscreenLumie Bodyclock Spark 100 sunrise alarm clock£99 at Argos£99 at BootsI had modest expectations when I started writing the Filter’s guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocks, but the Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100 dazzled me with its natural-feeling sunrise simulation. It often woke me pleasantly before the alarm went off.Pete WiseBudget-but-still-the-best child’s bike seatView image in fullscreenPolisport Bubbly Maxi Plus child seat£45 at HalfordsA dirt-cheap Halfords child bike seat. I tried frame-mounted bike seats from a number of leading brands, from £35 up to £140. In the end, it was the cheapest of the lot that caused the fewest headaches.Paddy Maddisonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I also had the confidence to invest in Fussy deodorant: it’s expensive, and too much to spend when you aren’t sure if it works –but you were correct, it does!PippaNice ice, babyView image in fullscreenLékué ice cube box£17.50 at John Lewis£8.93 at AmazonIn a bid to become the adult I always wanted to be – someone who always has ice in the house – I bought the Lékué ice box from one of ourgift guideslast Christmas. The abstract-shaped cubes are sharp and stylish, and were small enough to fit in my daughter’s water bottle this heatwave summer.Hannah BoothUltimate camping mattress for oneView image in fullscreenColeman Supercomfort single camping mat£124.95 at Outdoor ActionMy wife caught sight of Linda Geddes gamely testingcamping matsand was taken by the write-up of the Coleman Supercomfort. She ordered a single mattress immediately, and tells me it’s excellent. I’m not allowed anywhere near it.Andy ShawThe anytime massage gunView image in fullscreenBob & Brad Q2 Pro massage gun£89.99 at AmazonI tested dozens ofmassage gunsand was impressed by the Bob & Brad Q2 Pro – a small-but-mighty pummeller that’s portable. I packed it in my 100-mile ultra drop bag and, with 17 miles to go, its soothing muscle mashing turned me from the Tin Man to skipping Dorothy. Well, almost.Kieran AlgerBye chub rub, hello comfy run shortsView image in fullscreenLight control thigh slimmers, two-pack£20 at M&SMy Marks & Spencer chub rub shorts were featured inour guide to keeping cool in hot weather. They’ve saved me for many summers now.Rhiannon EvansA game for all agesView image in fullscreenMarble run£15 at Argos£20 at John LewisI also bought my son the marble run he asked forlast Christmas. Both my kids loved it, actually … as did I.REStylish twist on the waterproof coatView image in fullscreenPatent faux leather coat£36 at Sainsbury’sInspired by the Filter’s feature onhow to look good in wet weather, I upgraded my waterproof jacket. It hadn’t occurred to me that a faux patent leather jacket could work just as well as a traditional waterproof.Sabine WieselOpen your eyes to the swim maskView image in fullscreenDefy Ultra swim mask£115 at Aquasphere£97.55 at AmazonThe Aquasphere Defy Ultra swim mask – which I included in my roundup ofcold-water swimming essentials– is the most expensive pair of goggles I’ve bought, but worth every penny. I’ve swum multiple long-distance events in them. I look a bit like I’m wearing ski goggles and often get comments, but for comfort and field of vision in open water, they’re excellent.Ella FooteBrilliant babygrows with two-way zipsView image in fullscreenTwo-way zip baby sleepsuits, four-packFrom £19 at NextI was pregnant when Paddy Maddison’s article onbaby gear parents wouldn’t go withoutcame out, and soon discovered that it should beillegalto make newborn babygrows or sleepsuitswithouttwo-way zips. I love these ones from Next. If you have a pregnant friend, do them a favour and get them a pack.Laura PotterShoes to climb high inView image in fullscreenVeloce climbing shoe£110 at Nevisport£140 at Go OutdoorsAfter writing myclimbing kit article, I bought some Scarpa Veloce climbing shoes that were recommended by the coach I spoke with. They’re now my favourite ever climbing shoes.Tom BruceAn actually leak-proof water bottleView image in fullscreenIon8 water bottle£12.99 at Decathlon£13 at ArgosThe Ion8, voted top budget option in Zoë Philimore’stest of the best water bottles, is the only leak-proof bottle I’ve used. It’s managed to survive in both my daughters’ school bags without an incident.Rebecca GoodmanCamping loveseat for outdoor comfortView image in fullscreenKelty low loveseat£114.95 at Wildbounds£148.95 at AmazonTheKelty loveseat camping couchwon me brownie points when I bought it for my other half’s birthday. Well made and robust, it comfortably sits two people in a slouchy, relaxed manner. Perfect for evening campsites with a glass of beer in hand.DeborahFor more, read our guide to thebest camping chairsThe frying pan that’s chemical-freeView image in fullscreenDe Buyer steel round pancake pan, 30cm£59.98 at Nisbets£57 at AmazonI’m a convert to frying pans with no coating that you season with oil instead. Having researchedPfas-free pans, I decided that even if the health risks are uncertain, I want to try to minimise the number of products I buy that contain forever chemicals because of the potential environmental cost. So I’m gradually replacing our pans with stainless steel and carbon steel ones. I’ve also discovered the joys of cooking with a crepe pan: as well as turning out excellent pancakes, my De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan is great for toasting wraps, and makingokonomiyaki (Japanese fritters).Linda GeddesThe truly magic wand (vibrator!)View image in fullscreenDoxy die cast wand£131.55 at Secrets Shop£154.99 at BootsI named the Doxy Die Cast as my No 1 wand vibrator in my test of thebest vibrators, and I stand by that decision. It’s unapologetically loud and hefty, and packs so much power that I’ve witnessed it make women climax through thick jeans.Alix FoxMust-have beauty gadgetView image in fullscreenZiip Halo£379.99 at Ziip BeautyThere are so many beauty gadgets with high-ticket prices that it’s hard to know what’s worth investing in. The Ziip Halo microcurrent device, which I featured in my piece onat-home beauty treatments, is one of the unicorns. I’ve been using it for six months, a few times a week, and my skin looks more glowing, firmer and more snatched around the jaw. It’s so small that it fits in my makeup bag for holidays, too.Hayley SpencerElectric toothbrush with pearly serviceView image in fullscreenSuri 2.0 electric toothbrush£105 at Suri£105 at BootsI bought aSuri toothbrushand, while it’s definitely more of a pleasure to use than my previous one and is more sustainable, the thing I was most impressed with was the customer service. It stopped working, but I received a prompt response, and a replacement handle was posted to me straight away.Lisa ForemanThe pregnancy pillow you always neededView image in fullscreenDreamgenii pregnancy pillow£37.99 at Robert Dyas£53.99 at DebenhamsA lot ofpregnancy pillowsare good at supporting your tummy while elevating the legs, but they’re less good at looking after your back. The Dreamgenii did both beautifully, keeping me in a stable position without waking at 3am to stuff cushions behind my lower back. The flat section joining it together also meant nothing moved about in the night – other than the baby, and me getting up to pee. It saw me through two pregnancies, as well as being a handy feeding pillow after each of my sons arrived. My husband tried (unsuccessfully) to pinch it for himself.Lucy PaviaElevate your home diningView image in fullscreenDelouis mayonnaise£3.25 at Ocado£3.30 at WaitroseAfter testing so many delicious foods for thefood filter, I’m slowly building a shopping list of my favourites. Here are a few standouts: Delouis mayonnaise (incredible, minimally processed dijon mustard),Ollie’s kimchi(a fiery, funky and lively local ferment),Cauldron authentic organic tofu(clean, complex and well priced) andM&S pitted green queen olives(delicious chunky gordal olives).Tom HuntSecateurs that are a joyView image in fullscreenNiwaki GR Pro secateursFrom £84 at Niwaki£99.99 at CrocusIt was love at first snip with Niwaki’s GR Pro secateurs. I’d seen them about, but never before had the pleasure of taking a plant to task with them; the experience of testing a pair out for the Filter’s roundup of thebest secateurswas a joy. The cut is more of a glide, and they sit so comfortably in the hand that it feels like being reunited with a favourite jumper.Matt CollinsThe gorgeous gunk-free cafetièreView image in fullscreenEspro P7 French press£85.09 at AmazonOf the products I’ve tested, I’ve developed something of a soft spot for theEspro P7 French Press. The Espro has gone on a camping trip and a holiday to Scotland, and it’s been a godsend. It’s insulated so we could brew a litre of gorgeous-tasting coffee and work our way through it without it going stone cold, and the filter prevented 99% of the sludge from getting into our mugs. Spending almost three figures on a cafetiere may sound a bit bonkers, but when it makes great, gunk-free coffee and keeps it warm for an hour in the middle of a Welsh field, it almost seems like good value.Sasha MullerThe ultimate office chairView image in fullscreenHerman Miller Aeron chair£1,385 at Herman Miller£1,399 at John LewisThe Herman Miller Aeron chair, from mytest of the best office chairs. I loved it, my wife loved it, and the courier was mildly horrified when we sent it back, as he barely ever had to return one. Sadly, we can’t afford it.Stuart AndrewsHats off to the best capView image in fullscreenOriginal Pirate Material cap£45 at ScrtI bought my husband the Original Pirate Material cap from Peter Bevan’s50 men’s summer wardrobe updatesjust in time for Glastonbury. He loves the Streets and is never without a hat, so it was the perfect fit. Judging from the number of people we saw wearing the cap around Worthy Farm, I think a fair few Filter readers had the same idea.Ella JinaduHair care, honey pot styleView image in fullscreenGisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy mask£19 for 75ml at Cult Beauty£19 for 75ml at SpaceNKThebest thing I’ve testedthis year, hands down, is the Gisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy hair mask. I had tried the brand’s original mask before, and found it pretty average, but this new formulation somehow made my glossy hair dreams come true without weighing my hair down. It’s an investment, but if you have long, thick hair you want to look after, it’s a brilliant choice.Sarah MatthewsStirring stuff from a great fanView image in fullscreenLume air circulator fan£149 at LumeThe best product I tested for the Filter this year was the AirCraft Lume fan. It’s so well made that it’s practically silent, so the biggest challenge is forgetting it’s on. It has a cute backlight, too. Unsurprisingly, it’s been on preorder ever since we recommended it.Caramel QuinFor more, read our guide tothe best fansDo you have a favourite Filter buy?

Beside us are a small dipping pool, some mulberry trees and a whitewashed house crawling with purple bougainvillaea, from which two dogs drift in and out to inspect our work.“This is pretty therapeutic, isn’t it?”someone says above the clattering of tools, as flower-dappled light dances on a canopy that’s shielding us from the hot Andalucían sun.We’re on a four-day wild clay ceramics retreat atLas Mecias, a regenerative farm in Spain’s Alpujarras, an idyllic valley just over an hour and a half south-east of Granada in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The course is a collaboration between Las Mecias’s Dutch owners, Laura and Nina, and Spaniards Milena and Julia fromTierra de Arcillas, a local ceramics studio. They connected through Instagram and things evolved from there.The aim is to teach guests how to find, forage, process and fire ceramics from locally sourced wild clay in a more sustainable approach to pottery. They run a handful of workshops in spring and autumn when temperatures are more bearable.I found Las Mecias while looking for pottery retreats in Spain, already hooked after one wheel-throwing workshop months earlier. That class came towards the end of a debilitating bout of depression and anxiety that had left me unable to work or function properly for months. At the wheel, I felt the dark cloud lift temporarily and anxious ruminations evaporated like water on a hot stove.View image in fullscreen‘We test the quality of the clay by removing stones, adding a drop of water, making a ball, then a tiny sausage, then a ring.’Photograph: Tierra de ArcillasThis time I’d be hand-building pottery for the first time. Las Mecias is located in exactly the kind of place those tired of the city long to escape to. Set off a dusty track, a few minutes from the picturesque mountainsidepueblo(village) of Cástaras, the 2-hectare (5-acre) off-grid organic farm and retreat space is a natural haven dotted with olive and fruit trees, wildflowers and vegetable gardens.The accommodation comprises a tiny home (a dinky caravan with a sundeck), a good-sized Mongolian-style yurt, and a minimalist Mediterranean two-bedroomcasita(small house) with a kitchen, living room and terrace. All have spellbinding views over the low Sierra de la Contraviesa, which is speckled with vines andcortijos(farmhouses).Las Mecias is exactly the kind of place those tired of the city long to escape to – a natural haven dotted with olive trees and wildflowersOur group includes a model from Taiwan, a Spanish project manager, a French yoga teacher, a Polish AI expert and a clarinettist from High Wycombe. My girlfriend and I are staying off-site atEl Huerto de Lobras– a collection of bucolic apartments run by an endearingabuela(grandmother) named Ana.The first day begins with introductions followed by a lesson on clay theory and a foraging mission led by Milena and Julia. The warm, spirited couple, who met in Barcelona and now live together in Almería, run Tierras de Arcillas in the foothills of the Alpujarras Almeriense.Sick of being stuck behind a screen, Julia, a graphic designer, took a ceramics course in Barcelona where she became fascinated with the origins of clay. Lighting designer Milena was converted later when trawling the hills of Almería, charmed by the earth’s colours and textures.View image in fullscreenThe retreat sits in an idyllic valley in the AlpujarrasArmed with pick-spades, we all set off to roam the marbled hills, searching for good clay.“See those cracks? That’s a good sign,”Julia says, leading us to a jagged, light-grey shard of mountain. We test the quality by removing stones, adding a drop of water, making a ball, then a tiny sausage, then a ring. The ring is the goal as it means the clay is 70% pure. After a positive test, we hack away frantically in clouds of dust, filling buckets like middle-class miners.Back at the farm, Laura and Nina prepare dinner. Between them, the couple have worked in kitchens across the UK, Australia, Denmark and the Netherlands, so meals at Las Mecias are exceptional. For breakfast, there’s freshly made sourdough loaves, homemade quince, strawberry and plum jams and plates of watermelon, mango and loquat. Lunches feature Ottolenghi-worthy salads, while dinners span Indonesian, Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cuisine – served with their own olive oil and natural wine.Between meals, we wander the grounds, flop in deck chairs and hammocks staring out to snow-capped peaks, and work on our pieces. One of the group – me – makes an ugly olive dish, which looks like a flower that’s been stamped on. Others craft impressive vases, plates, cups, trays and bird feeders.View image in fullscreenMealtimes at Las Mecias are an added delightThe workshop is well structured and flows naturally. Each part feels like a therapeutic technique. Foraging becomes my grounding ritual. Processing clay by removing impurities echoes filtering out negative beliefs. Deep discussions replace the rawness of therapy. And nutritious meals, quality sleep and abundant nature restore the soul.Over the days, my mind quietens. It’s not a resounding silence. I’m not cured from the mental health issues that have plagued me for two decades, but I feel calmer. I’m attuned to the hum of bees and the crunch of stones underfoot. Inconveniences morph into joyful moments: getting stuck behind a farmer herding goats on a winding mountain road, having no phone signal anywhere, and being woken by the local church choir.Over the days, my mind quietens. It’s not a resounding silence, but I feel calmerThe four-day workshop culminates in a final ritual, where we fire up the handbuilt kiln and load it with our pieces. Between shifts gathering sticks and stoking the fire, we take turns dipping in the pool.After sunset, Laura makes a pizza while Nina glides around with homemade wine and jugs ofshrub– a refreshing drink made from fruit and vinegar.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no telling what’s survived: the fire decides’.Photograph: Tierra de ArcillasPerching on hay bales, swigging wine and sharing stories, we cheer as the kiln’s temperature hits its century milestones, before reaching a high of 917F (492C). Sealing the oven, Milena and Julia chant a symbolic blessing,“protectora, ponle lo que falta y quitale lo que le sobra”, roughly translated to,“protector, provide us with what we lack and remove what isn’t needed”,before we retire to bed.The Spanish camping brand that’s big on nature immersion, cool design and creature comfortsRead moreThe next morning, we gather around the kiln and remove bricks, one by one. There’s no telling what’s survived: the fire decides. Perhaps a final reminder that acceptance and letting go is part of the process. Cheers erupt and compliments are exchanged as the first pieces emerge intact.As we say our goodbyes, one member of the group leaves us with a final moment of reflection.“Honestly, I didn’t really care what mine turned out like. It didn’t matter if it cracked or exploded. I just enjoyed the process and would’ve accepted whatever happened.”The retreat was provided byLas MeciasandTierra de Arcillas, which offerthree-night, four-dayintroduction to wild clay workshops, includingaccommodation,three dinners, three breakfasts and two lunches, and over15 hoursof theory and practical instruction.

Food styling assistant: Chloe Glazier.The sweet spotDessertHelen Goh’s recipe for pumpkin cheesecake with maple pecan brittleA warming slice of creamy autumn sweetness, offset with a nutty crunchHelen GohFri 10 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareSilky, spiced and just sweet enough, this pumpkin cheesecake is a celebration of autumnal comfort. I’m not a fan of tinned pumpkin – it’s watery and flat-tasting – so I’ve taken the extra step of roasting some butternut or Kent squash; the oven’s heat coaxes out its natural sweetness while evaporating excess moisture, resulting in a smooth, flavourful puree that gives the cheesecake real depth. The maple pecan brittle provides the final flourish: golden, nutty and with just the right amount of crunch to offset the cheesecake’s creamy softness.Pumpkin cheesecake with maple pecan brittleTo make 200g pumpkin puree, chop 350-400g peeled, deseeded pumpkin into chunks, then roast, loosely covered, at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 until soft but not browned. Puree in a high-speed blender.Prep10 minCook1 hr 45 minCool1 hrChill6 hr+Serves8-10For the base200g ginger nut biscuits70g unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing⅛ tsp fine sea saltFor the filling500g cream cheese150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orange200g pumpkin puree(see introduction)2 tsp cornflour¾ tsp ground cinnamon½ tsp ground ginger¼ tsp ground nutmeg⅛ tsp ground cloves2 large eggs, at room temperature100mlsoured cream1 tsp vanilla extractFor the maple pecan brittle topping2 tbsp maple syrup1 tbsp caster sugar90g pecans, roughly chopped1 large pinchflaky sea salt150ml double creamHeat the oven to 185C (165C fan)/365F/gas 4½, and lightly grease the base and sides of a 20cm round springform tin with the extra melted butter. In a food processor, blitz the biscuits to fine crumbs, then tip into a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and salt, and mix so the crumbs are evenly damp. Tip into the greased tin, press down firmly, bake for 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool.Turn down the oven temperature to 175C (155C fan)/355F/gas 3¼. Meanwhile, put the cream cheese, sugar and orange zest in the bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with the paddle attachment on medium-low until smooth and creamy (about 30 seconds). Add the pumpkin puree, cornflour and spices, and beat on medium-low until combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in well between each addition, then add the soured cream and vanilla, and beat until fully incorporated.Pour the pumpkin filling on to the cooled biscuit base and smooth the top with a small spatula. Tap the tin gently on a worktop to dispel any air bubbles, then bake the cheesecake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes, until the edges are set and the centre is slightly wobbly. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave the cheesecake to cool for an hour. Once it’s at room temperature, chill for at least six hours (and up to three days), until completely set.Meanwhile, make the pecan brittle (up to three days ahead). Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line a small oven tray with baking paper. Combine the maple syrup and sugar in a small saucepan and stir gently over a low heat for about a minute, until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the pecans and sea salt, then remove from the heat and scrape into the lined tray. Bake for about eight minutes, until golden and bubbly, then remove and leave to cool. Once the brittle is completely hard, chop into irregular pieces and store in an airtight container in the freezer.Release the cheesecake from its tin and transfer to a platter. Whisk the cream to soft peaks, then spoon into the middle of the cheesecake, leaving a 3-4cm border all around. Scatter most of the pecan brittle on top, then serve with extra pecan brittle alongside.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodAutumn food and drinkBakingVegetablesCheeseCakerecipesShareReuse this content"

They might stop trying to involve youRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 9 Oct 2025 21.37 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 01.40 EDTShareMy brother and sister are really angry at my parents. They say that we had a terrible childhood because my dad was absent a lot and my mum used to play us off against each other to keep control. There was a lot of arguing.But this is just half the story. I know my parents loved us all a lot and tried to give us a good childhood. We always had home-cooked food and stories. Nowadays my parents are trying to make amends, but my brother and sister just don’t see it. They’re so critical and to be honest I think they’re a bit ungrateful. I feel caught in the middle. What can I do?Eleanor says:Doesn’t one of us have to be wrong?is the plea on both sides of a family disagreement like this, I think. One person says “this was totally unacceptable”, the other says “it wasn’t”; we know we can’t both be right, so the disagreement feels like an accusation that we’re the one seeing things incorrectly.I have a crippling fear of being judged. How can I overcome this? | Leading questionsRead moreSometimes when you try to talk that impasse through with other people, they’ll fall back on “family things are all subjective”. That’s fine, but it doesn’t go very far. The whole problem is you and your siblings both feel as if you’re telling the truth, the rap-your-knuckles-on-it truth. This was or was not acceptable parenting, same as it was or was not raining yesterday. The facts of your childhood are important, which means getting them wrong is important too.One thing that can help break that impasse is to ask whether you’re disagreeing about what happened or you’re disagreeing about how to weigh those things in the moral accounting.For instance, do you think that parents ought to be judged by whether they tried their best or by what they actually did? Are we talking about degree of difficulty or absolute performance? Yes, they shouted that horrible thing, but how many jobs were they working? How much support did they have, how hard was life on them, what tangles in their heads did they inherit from their own parents?Another big split is whether we focus on what parents are like now or what they were like then. Some people look at a memory from 20 years ago and see a hazy, sepia moment, like an interaction between acquaintances we used to know. Others see it in high resolution, because the pain feels as though it happened today.And one really huge split is over how much you think you even get to be in the business of evaluating your parents. For some people, that’s how to name important patterns and problems. For others, it feels like hypocrisy or judgmentalism.These kinds of macro disputes can be why the conflict feels so intractable. Your siblings say, “Don’t you see, they hurt us badly.” You say, “Don’t you see, they were trying.” Both of you are telling the truth, but neither feels heard; cogs are turning but not meeting up.I am very wary of my five-year-old stepdaughter. Am I a bad person? | Leading questionsRead moreYou asked what you can do. One threat here is you wind up being played off against each other again, whether by accident or not. To avoid becoming a middleman or a conflict manager, you might want to pick phrases to repeat like a broken record to either side.To your siblings; a phrase that expresses “I disagree with you” without saying “your memories are false”. Maybe something like, “I’m not asking you to forgive them, I’m just asking you to allow that I feel differently.”And to your parents, something that expresses that you won’t pass on messages or weigh in on conflicts, such as: “I love you, I don’t want to be the adjudicator.” If you don’t produce any reaction besides those phrases when the topic comes up, you might become enough of a dead-end that they all stop trying to involve you.The truth of any family is so long and tangled that it’s very hard for any one person to see all of it at once – if ever. You and your siblings could each be telling the truth about the parts you’re looking at. If you want to maintain a relationship with everyone here, the trick might be not disputing the events, but saying you’re allowed to weigh them differently.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here you can walk across the rare grassland called the machair to the white, three-mile longWest Beach, which looks out into the North Atlantic, and marvel at the immense space and colour of the sea. We stayed at aGatliff Hebridean hostel, which consists of two converted crofts where for about £20 a night for a bunk you will be staying in probably one of the most peaceful locations in the world. Berneray is between North Uist and Harris.Nik FerneeAncient and modern digs in the HighlandsView image in fullscreenBrochs of Coigach are stone dwellings north of Ullapool in Scotland’s far north-west.Photograph: John PaulPerched above the sea in remote Achiltibuie, theBrochs of Coigachare two stunning stone dwellings that blend ancient design with modern luxury.

The main town, Chora, is beautiful, with buildings leading up a hill to an old castle. We rented a small apartment and spent our days on quiet pebble beaches that we had almost to ourselves. It’s a genuinely peaceful place where you can properly switch off from the noise of modern life. This Dodecanese island is the focus of a scheme for emission-free transport, with generous grants to replace petrol and diesel vehicles with electric ones.RoyProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Hearing its story of being created from local forests was as fascinating as the walk through the tall woods that surround it. We watched red kites soar over the valley before stargazing under a sky free from light pollution. Such tranquility and connection with nature is hard to find in the UK these days, but the benefits are palpable – we left rested and refreshed, more so than any recent holiday.HannahMagical Irish castleView image in fullscreenAnnes Grove Miniature CastleWe stayed at theAnnes Grove Miniature Castlein Castletownroche, County Cork, near to the ruined AugustinianBridgetown Prioryand Blackwater Castle, in what felt like the middle of nowhere. It was magical. The Irish Landmark Trust has renovated it for people to stay in, complete with a wood-burning stove and comfy gothic bed.

Expertly guided by Tora tours, I endured a dreadful but thankfully short sea crossing to Mykines to see puffins, visited the beautiful villages of Saksun (population: eight) and Gjógv (a metropolis of 31 inhabitants) and explored Tinganes, location of the islands’ parliament. It was the most wonderful, wild and remote August week, shrouded in fog and empty space.AbigailOff-grid in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenThe River Coquet in Northumberland national park.Photograph: David Taylor Photography/AlamyLast October we had a wonderful week in the most remote part of Northumberland – theUpper Coquetvalley. Our stay was an off-grid, simple bunk barn called Nightfold at the top of the valley. We spent a week living like woodland creatures in autumn – eating heartily, keeping ourselves warm (thanks to the wood-burning stove) and sleeping. In the daytime, we did long walks where we didn’t see a single other person – only sheep, deer, birds and squirrels. At night there were endless stars, the Milky Way and reading by candlelight. Bliss.BenFree camping in Portugal’s mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Serra da Estrela mountains.Photograph: ARoxo/Getty ImagesThe sleepy villages of continental Portugal’s highest mountain range, the Serra da Estrela, are a world away from the coastal honeypots of Lisbon and Porto. In Vila Cova à Coelheira there is a free campsite on the banks of the Alva river, reached via an old Roman bridge that you can swim under (or jump in from if you’re feeling brave). Even better, there is a bar at the river beach that serves excellent pica-pau – pork braised in wine, with onions and pickles. During my stay there I never encountered more than one or two others camping.DavidCroatia’s Mljet island is not for the jet setView image in fullscreenA monastery on a lake on the island of Mljet in Croatia.Photograph: Vedrana2701/AlamyAway from Dubrovnik’s cruise-ship crowds, Mljet island feels like another world: pine forests dipping into turquoise bays, an ancient monastery on a tiny islet in the middle of a saltwater lake, and hardly a sound beyond cicadas and the wind. I stayed in a simple family-run cottage just outside the national park gates, where evenings meant grilled fish on the terrace and nights under skies thick with stars. Days were spent kayaking across mirror-still water and walking through pine-scented trails where I rarely met another soul. It felt like stepping into a slower rhythm of life, a corner of Europe the 21st century has politely passed by.Mark AdamsonView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I bought it as a souvenir on holiday in my 30s. Twenty-five years later, I’ve got thousands of boxes stacked away in a warehouse, four Guinness World Records and have made several TV appearances.When Guinness visited my warehouse last year, they spent a whole day counting my collection. By the end, they confirmed I had4,379different sets. That was the fourth time I’d broken the record.There are many variants of Monopoly, and countries and businesses are constantly releasing their own versions. For me, it’s about the chase, finding the rare ones: a special anniversary edition, a limited production run, or just something incredibly hard to find. I’ve even got the Park Hyatt Sydney hotel edition, which you can usually get only if you stay the night there. I managed to track down a guest online, who bought it for me.I’ve probably spent about £400,000 on my collection over the years. I’ve been lucky to have a job at DHL for more than three decades, which has helped me keep up with my hobby. The most expensive set I own is a silver edition from London, which would have been worth £2,500 brand new – it was limited edition and used real silver. Luckily, I found mine much cheaper on eBay.To me, the fun in Monopoly isn’t really in playing it. Once you open the box, you lose about 90% of its value. I keep nearly all my sets sealed. If I had a flashy Rolls-Royce, I wouldn’t drive it through the mud – that’s how I see my collection.People often ask me: why Monopoly? Why not postcards or stamps?People think it’s mad – my girlfriend especially. She gets wound up because the sets take up space and cost money. But I couldn’t give them up. People often ask me: why Monopoly? Why not postcards or stamps? I think it’s because Monopoly is so recognisable.The hunt is a huge part of the fun. In the early days, I would scour car-boot sales. I began in 2000 and, back then, finding a set meant rummaging through boxes at a market or secondhand shop. The internet opened up a whole new world. I’ve bought sets from Japan, Brazil and the US. Sometimes I’ll spend months tracking down a rare edition. I wonder if I’m keeping the Post Office, Evri and Amazon running. Of course, storage is a challenge. I live in London, but have rented out a warehouse in Ashford, Middlesex, to keep them all.People assume I never play Monopoly, but I’m always up for a game. It doesn’t take away from the collecting. In fact, it reminds me why I started in the first place. I’ve met so many wonderful people through the game: other collectors; friends I used to outbid on eBay; the man who runsWorld of Monopoly, an online archive. People who have heard about my collection have got in touch and offered to bring me a set. Some of them have even flown to the UK from abroad. We’ll take pictures together with the new set and my Guinness World Records certificate, and sometimes even spending the day sightseeing in London. It’s surreal, but it’s brilliant.I’ve also been on TV shows, such as Bargain Hunt, and radio stations around the world, and visited the factory where the game is made. The record has brought me so many opportunities and friendships I’d never have imagined when I bought that first box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That would be nice to get but, really, every set is exciting. The dream is to hit 4,500, maybe even 5,000. But the big milestone will be Monopoly’s 100th anniversary in 2035 – the board game wasdesigned by Elizabeth Magieas The Landlord’s Game in 1903, though it was first commercially released in 1935. Maybe someone will give me a big space in the city to show off the collection. That would be something.Until then, I’ll keep hunting. There’s always another set out there – a zoo edition, a special anniversary, another release that hardly anyone knows about. If I could go back to my very first set, would I start collecting all over again? I absolutely would.As told to Sundus AbdiDo you have an experience to share?

But there’s a lot to be said for negligence; I returned from holiday to find a sunflower had appeared in the back corner.This week, though, sees some necessary firefighting. I’m six months pregnant and horribly overwhelmed, so I’ve enlisted the help of a local gardener to tackle the more pernicious intruders (such as green alkanet, which leaves my ankles feeling bitten whenever I hang out the washing, and some of the many robinia saplings that have appeared from the neighbour’s great big, beautiful tree) while leaving the good stuff behind. Then, in the patches that open up, I’ll be sowinggreen manure.Green manure are superheroes when it comes to improving soil healthA riot of colour, loved by bees and easy to grow – why sedums are perfect perennialsRead moreMy beloved column companionClaire has addressed the matter of green manurein these pages before, because they play an important part in the broader crop rotation of a working edibles plot. But the only thing I’m eating from the garden at the moment is a scrumped apple or two and some woody herbs.My ambitions for the garden are simple and steady – and improving the soil is top of the list. (And an update for those kind readers who are concerned I’m frittering away the roof fund on fencing: the scaffolding is for the roof, and the fences remain waving perilously in the wind. The neighbours are on board with us replacing them.)Green manure issuperheroes when it comes to improving soil health. Ground likes to be covered – that’s why “weeds” turn up. But you can help defeat weeds, bring in biodiversity through pollinators, offer shelter to other pest-eating creatures and fix and hold nitrogen in your soil by sowing crops that grow just as vigorously as weeds.Green manure plants may not look that interesting – although some, such as lupins ‘Blue Sonet’ (Lupinus angustifolius)andbird’s foot trefoil, have lovely flowers – but the point is for them to grow, rather than be admired. Once they have, you either dig them into your soil, cut them down for compost or leave them on the surface for the worms to pull down. Their work is done beneath the ground.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It could eventually reach a weight of about 250kg.Photograph: Chris Tagg/Nature SeychellesThe researchers said the successful trial could help to stave off an extinction crisis for other threatened species.“This is a huge leap,” said Alessia Lavigne, a Seychelloise based at the University of Sheffield, in England, who was the lead author of arecent studyrelated to the project. “It shows what conservation can do.”The study examined the reproduction rates of five turtle and tortoise species, which revealed that 75% of undeveloped eggs had been fertilised but contained embryos that died at an early stage.Those findings cast new light on why the Aldabra giant tortoise, which is classified as vulnerable by the International Union forConservationof Nature, appears to have very low hatching success in wild nests. The failure rate is considered more likely to be due to environmental factors than to any genetic trait of the tortoises.Giant tortoises were wiped out from most other Indian Ocean islands in the 19th century as a result of hunting by sailors, but the population on the Aldabra group of islands in the Seychelles was saved thanks to their isolation. They, along with 400 other endemic species and the extraordinary colours of the landscape, were the reason why the atoll was listed as a world heritage site by Unesco in 1982.As a hedge against extinction, some individuals were moved to other islands, including Cousin, in the hope that they could establish backup populations in the event of new threats. This has proved prescient because at least one island is being developed as a luxury tourist resort, funded with Qatari money, as the Guardianrevealedlast year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But the priority for research will be how to improve the conditions of wild nests.“It’s wonderful that these eggs have been shown to be viable but artificially incubating eggs is not a long-term solution,” said Nicola Hemmings of the University of Sheffield’s School of Biosciences. “We now need to identify the variables that are impacting survival in the natural nest environment, and then see if there are ways to improve them.”View image in fullscreenAn Aldabra giant tortoise on Curieuse Island, Seychelles.Photograph: cinoby/Getty ImagesThe team says it would like to share its results with scientists in the Galápagos islands, which are home to the only other species of giant tortoise.Explore more on these topicsConservationReptilesSeychellesEndangered speciesAfricaAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

But deadly attacks on civilians have continued and a deadline to reach a peace agreement was missed in August.Last year a group of UN experts said up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside M23 and that the Rwandan military was in “de facto control of M23 operations”. Rwanda has long denied backing M23 and says its forces act in self-defence.View image in fullscreenAn internally displaced family loads belongings on to a motorbike as they leave a camp in Bulengo, DRC.Photograph: Jospin Mwisha/AFP/Getty ImagesThe DRC president, Félix Tshisekedi, on Thursday appealed to his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, to stop supporting militants in the DRC at a Brussels event attended by both leaders, drawing a rebuke from Kigali that he was “completely mistaken” about the roots of the conflict.Saying he was stretching out his hand to make peace, Tshisekedi told Kagame: “This requires you to order the M23 troops supported by your country to stop this escalation, which has already caused enough deaths.”‘I was terrified’: refugees who fled DRC to Burundi recall deadly river crossingRead moreThe Rwandan foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, later responded on X, saying Tshisekedi was “completely mistaken” and accusing him of abusing the platform at the Brussels event.Speaking before the meeting, Wagner drew parallels between Rwanda’s violation of DRC territory and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU had adopted a catalogue of sanctions against Russia, but made only “very timid progress” over the conflict in eastern DRC.The eastern DRC, a region bordering Rwanda with abundant natural resources but plagued by non-state armed groups, has suffered extreme violence for more than three decades.The EU has placed sanctions on 32 people and two entities – a militant group and a Rwandan gold refiner dealing in illegal supplies of the metal – for their role in fuelling the conflict. Setting out justifications for these sanctions, the EU said the Rwandan Defence Force in eastern DRC had violated the DRC’s territory and “sustains the armed conflict … [and is] also responsible for serious human rights abuses, including collective punishment”.Despite this finding of human rights abuses by the Rwandan army in the DRC, the European Commission hasbrushed off calls to suspend a 2024 minerals deal with Kigali, which is intended to boost the supply of raw materials to power Europe’s electric car batteries and microchips.Wagner said the memorandum of understanding with Rwanda was “void of any credibility in a context where it has been established that Rwanda has been siphoning off Congolese resources” extracted under brutal conditions of forced labour, involving children.The US and many others have raised concerns about illegal trade in gold and tantalum in eastern Congo, extracted via forced labour, then trafficked to Rwanda for export to benefit armed groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It remains one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with more than 7.8 million people internally displaced in eastern DRC and 28 million facing food insecurity, including 4 million at emergency levels, according to the UN.As the DRC’s chief diplomat, Wagner signed the agreement with Rwanda in the White House in June, which also aims to give the US greater access to Congolese natural resources.View image in fullscreenThérèse Kayikwamba Wagner (right) at the White House in June, where a deal was signed that includes giving the US greater access to Congolese natural resources.Photograph: Ken Cedeno/ReutersShe said the US was still engaged in the peace process and she rejected suggestions that Trump’s sole motivation was the DRC’s vast mineral wealth, while adding: “It is just a reality ... that this potential is currently untapped.”She was in Brussels to take part in a conference onthe global gateway, Europe’s lower-budget answer to the Chinesebelt and road initiative, which aims to finance infrastructure projects around the world.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, opened the conference on Thursday, saying the EU wanted “partnerships based on common interests and respect for sovereignty”. She highlighted the Lobito corridor – rail, road and water transport links – connecting the mineral heartlands of the DRC and Zambia to Angola’s Atlantic coast.Wagner said the EU and DRC had a strong foundation in the Lobito project, but “a lot has been overshadowed by the situation in eastern DRC”.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoEuropean UnionRwandaAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast in recent weeks, which some suspect could bea prelude to some kind of regime change operation.1:51Who is María Corina Machado,'Venezuela’s Iron Lady' and new Nobel peace prize winner? – videoMachado reacted to her Nobel prize in a video that González posted on social media in which the pair celebrate the news. “I can’t believe it! My God!” an incredulous Machado tells her ally. “It’s fucking incredible!” replies González.The Norwegian Nobel Instituteshared a videoof the moment its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, woke up Machado with the news. “Oh my God!” she said. “I have no words … But I hope you understand that … I am just one person, I certainly don’t deserve this.”“It caught her totally by surprise,” said Pedro Mario Burelli, an opposition politician and friend of more than four decades. “She’s very moved. She’s very concerned about what impact this has on the last phase of the struggle. She’s tearful,” he added, shortly after speaking to Machado on Friday morning.Writing on X, Machado dedicated the prize to “the suffering people ofVenezuelaand to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”She said the prize was “an impetus to conclude our task: to conquer freedom”. “We are on the threshold of victory and today more than ever we count on President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve freedom and democracy.”View image in fullscreenMachado in Caracas during the 2024 election campaign.Photograph: Alexandre Meneghini/ReutersThe Nobel committee celebrated Machado’s long struggle for democracy in a statement that called her “one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times”.It also paid tribute to the Venezuelan opposition’s “innovative and brave, peaceful and democratic” push for change during last year’s election, when hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised to observe the election andcollect detailed tallies showing that González had won.Venezuela on edge over Trump regime change whispers: ‘If it does happen we are ready’Read more“But the regime refused to accept the election result, and clung to power,” the committee said, painting a dire picture of life in Venezuela, which has gradually sunk into dictatorship since Maduro was democratically elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez.“Venezuela has evolved from a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal, authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis,” the committee said.“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty, even as the few at the top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against the country’s own citizens. Nearly 8 million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution and imprisonment.”Machado, who many Venezuelans know simply as MCM or María Corina, has been involved in politics for more than two decades and was a member of Venezuela’s national assembly from 2011 to 2014. Shefamously clashedwith Chávez over Venezuela’s economic tribulations in 2012, earning the rebuke: “Eagles don’t hunt flies.”But it was in touring the economically devastated country by car and motorbike in the lead-up to the 2024 election that she cemented her reputation as Chavismo’s most effective and influential adversary.Her rallies drew huge, ecstatic crowds, with many supporters declaring an almost religious devotion to the charismatic Catholic politician, who promised to reunite millions of Venezuelan families separated by the mass migration triggered by Venezuela’s economic meltdown under Maduro.“She connected with people on the one issue that matters to people – which is family,” said Burelli, noting how Machado’s relatives had also been forced to flee abroad. “Everybody understands that she is in the same boat.”View image in fullscreenMachado addressing supporters at a protest in January.Photograph: Leonardo Fernández Viloria/ReutersMachado had originally hoped to run for president, but Venezuela’s pro-regime supreme court banned her from doing so, leaving González, a little-known former ambassador, to fill her shoes.“She will go down in history as the great opposition leader of our times … whether she makes it to the presidency or not,” said Carlos Lizarralde, the author of Venezuela’s Collapse: The Long Story of How Things Fell Apart​.The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who had kept “the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. It also celebrated her as “a key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided”.For all her popular support, however, Machado is not universally liked. Some Venezuelans distrust her as a result of thinly veiled calls for a foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro in the past. She argued in 2019 that only a“a real, credible severe and imminent threat”of the use of international force would convince Maduro to leave power.David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela specialist, said: “María Corina Machado has shown incredible courage in fighting for democracy. In 2023-24 she heroically mobilised the Venezuelan population for presidential elections. However, much of her fight before then and since then has been through non-democratic means, seeking to generate international military intervention.”Others are suspicious of her ties to radical rightwing politicians such as Trump and Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro, andher supportfor Trump’s widely discredited claim that a Venezuelan gang, the Tren de Aragua – has launched an “invasion” of the US.Trump and top officials such as Stephen Miller have used that spurious claim as justification for its campaign against Venezuelan migrants – scores of whom were deported to a high-security prison in authoritarian El Salvador – and forstrikes on alleged “narco-boats”in the Caribbean that have killed at least 21 people.Maduro and his allies mockingly refer to Machado as “La Sayona” [“the sackcloth woman”] – the name of a hideous female ghost from Venezuelan folklore who roams the country taking violent revenge on unfaithful husbands.Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House, said Maduro would be furious at the Nobel committee’s decision. “The question is, what now? Will it prompt public demonstrations in favour of María Corina Machado that [heap] some sort of public pressure on the government? Perhaps,” he said.“I think they would be hard-pressed to crack down with the international community [watching], but they did it in July 2024.”Burelli said he believed the award would shield his friend from possible arrest or persecution as she continued her fight for change. “This now truly protects her,” he said, arguing that the cost of targeting her would be “unbearable” for Maduro’s regime. “Now, I think she is bulletproof.”Explore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaNorwayEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate.The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added.“I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase ofTariffson Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president.The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago he described US relations with the country as “excellent” aftersigning off on a tariff reduction deal.Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%.But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%.The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%.Shares in the tech giant Nvidia – the world’s biggest public company, with a market value of almost $2.5tn – were hit particularly hard, dropping almost 5%.Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London.China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines.Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues.“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.“But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.”Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda. He has claimed higher taxes on imports from across the world will strengthen the US economy and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government.But tariffs are also often passed on to consumers, lead to higher prices. After years of heightened inflation, Trump has repeatedly claimed there now is none in the US. In reality,price growth has been rising.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaTariffsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The deaths were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre.Footage shared on social media after the first quake showed students fleeing in panic from their classrooms, radio anchors leaving their seats mid-air and people crouching and bracing themselves on all fours as the ground shook violently. Motorcycles were knocked over by the force of the tremor.mapThe governor of Davao Oriental said people panicked when the first earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told the broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”Evacuation orders were issued in affected areas, with schools suspending classes for the day.Damage to infrastructure, including cracks in the structure of the Magsaysay Bridge in Butuan city, were reported. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the Philippine president, said authorities were assessing the extent of the damage and search and rescue efforts being prepared. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said.The energy secretary, Sharon Garin, said officials were monitoring four electric companies in Mindanao after power supply in some areas tripped. It was not immediately clear whether the shutdowns were caused by the earthquake or were a precautionary measure.View image in fullscreenStudents are evacuated in Mindanao after the powerful earthquake.Photograph: Golden Cornucopia - Davao de Oro State College/AFP/Getty ImagesChristine Sierte, a teacher in the town of Compostela, near Manay, told Agence France-Presse she was in an online meeting when the violent shaking started.“It was very slow at first then it got stronger … That’s the longest time of my life. We weren’t able to walk out of the building immediately because the shaking was so strong,” she said. “The ceilings of some offices fell, but luckily no one was injured.” She said some of the school’s 1,000 students “suffered panic attacks and difficulty in breathing”.Kath Cortez, a journalist based in Davao city, said the ground floor walls of her family’s house were showing small cracks. “I was surprised by the strength,” she said, adding members of her family ran out of the house.The quakes hit just 10 days after a deadly 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit Bogo City in Cebu province, which killed 71 people. Aftershocks are still being felt in the area.Neighbouring Indonesia also issued an earlier tsunami warning for its regions of North Sulawesi and Papua, according to its geophysics agency.The Philippines sits on the Pacificring of fireand experiences more than 800 quakes each year.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsEarthquakesPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece.This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck in the middle of a trade war between the US andChina, the biggest purchaser of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs.“We are gonna have to find a home for them soybeans some time soon,” said Matt Purfeerst, a fifth-generation farmer on the family’s land. “They won’t stay in our bins for ever.”No other country comes close to purchasing as many American soybeans as China – last year, it was more than $12bn worth. This year, the country has not purchased a single dollar’s worth, cutting off the country that makes up about half of US soybean exports.While Trump has said he intends some sort of payment to go to soybean farmers hurt by tariffs, an announcement of a specific plan ison holdwhile the government is shut down. He said in a Truth Social post last week that he would be meeting with the Chinese president soon and “soybeans will be a major topic of discussion”.The White House cast blame on Democrats for the government shutdown for the delay in a response to the Guardian on Wednesday, erroneously claiming they were prioritizing healthcare for migrants over farmers.View image in fullscreenSoybeans are planted near Waverly, Minnesota.Photograph: Mark Vancleave/AP“President Trump, [Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent, and [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the president’s November victory,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have stalled progress on this issue with their prolonged shutdown to serve illegal immigrants instead of America’s farmers. No decisions have been made, but we look forward to sharing good news soon.”Purfeerst’s family farm grows soybeans and corn, and has some beef cattle. The job is a round-the-clock combination of engineering, business, manual labor, environmental science. And it’s increasingly hard for family farms to make it. Costs for propane, fertilizer and seed have gone up, he said, and the prices for the goods they are selling don’t make up for the increased costs.Soybean farmers have become the “poster child out there right now of how this one particular segment’s getting hurt”, he said. The farm recently welcomed the Democratic US senator Amy Klobuchar for a visit to talk about how the tariffs were playing out, but Purfeerst said political affiliations didn’t matter.“Only 1% of the population is even involved in [agriculture] any more,” he said. “And what gets really challenging is this perception of ag out there, whether it’s on tariffs and prices or environmental issues, farmers kind of seem to be the crosshairs of a lot of it.”Farming areas voted for Trump in 2024, as did much of rural America. One analysis,by Investigate Midwest, showed Trump growing his support among farming-dependent counties in 2024 despite a trade war during his first term that negatively affected farmers.“I’m not gonna get into who I voted for particularly, but I would just have to say, at the time, you got to make decisions who you think is going to be the best leader of the country, and go on with life,” Purfeerst said. “And in four years, you get to vote again. That’s the beauty of our society. It’s not an 80-year regime. It’s a four-year cycle. It’s hard to say what’s gonna come about. I mean, everyone’s got their pros and cons.”View image in fullscreenA soybean harvest at a farm outside St Peter, Minnesota, last month.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesPurfeerst has options for his soybeans: because of his farm’s location, he can sell domestically to soybean crush facilities in nearby towns, sell on the rail market, or sell in Minneapolis and put product on barges down the Mississippi River. Other soybean farmers, especially those in more remote parts of the midwest where soybeans are mostly produced, aren’t as lucky.Stories from all parts of the country where soybeans are grown have surfaced in recent weeks – in Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, the Dakotas. Farmers face higher costs for inputs like fertilizer and equipment. They rely on China as a purchaser. Soybeans sitting in bins too long is subject to weather and pests. The prices fluctuate, so it’s a gamble to hold on to it that sometimes can pay off, or sometimes lose money.“Let’s say tomorrow we get a trade deal with China, and it’s favorable to soybeans. All of a sudden you might see this market jump from $10 to $12 in three, four days,” Purfeerst said. “So it makes it extremely challenging from a risk management standpoint of: when do you market your crop, and how many eggs do you put in that basket? The potential is $12, but if we don’t get a trade deal, it could go to $9 … There’s a huge volatility in soybeans.”The soybean industry has been warning for months that China’s exit from the market would be devastating, calling on the Trump administration to come up with a trade deal that spares farmers. The American Soybean Associationwrote a letterto Trump in August, saying the country’s soybean farmers were “standing at a trade and financial precipice” and “cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer”.Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, declared the first week of October as soybean week, saying in the announcement that “our soybean farmers are confronting a crisis they haven’t seen since the 1980s”.“They’ve produced a bumper crop this year, just to find out they have nowhere to sell their harvest thanks to Trump’s trade policies,” Walz said. “Minnesota’s got the best beans in the world – I encourage Minnesotans to stand with our farmers and continue to advocate for federal trade reform.”It’s not the first time a Trump trade plan has hurt soybean farmers: in 2018, a trade war led to significant reductions in soybean exports to China. Since then, the market has rebounded, though China hasramped upsoybean purchases from Brazil and Argentina, stockpiling imports earlier this year.Republican lawmakers have said they are sympathetic to the farmers and want to find a way to help them. James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, said this week that soybean farmers were not to blame for the problem they are facing.“They planted that crop assuming that those foreign markets were going to be there,” Comersaid in a recent TV appearance. “I think we need to do something to help the soybean farmers.”A bailout is “really just a Band-Aid”, though it’s one that many farmers would welcome as they are getting squeezed right now, Purfeerst said. Most farmers would prefer an open market, without tariffs, for their products, letting the market dictate prices. They don’t want the trade war now to affect a long-term relationship that makes up a significant chunk of market share. There also should be more emphasis put on increasing domestic uses of soybeans, though a long-range plan like that won’t help the farmers who are stuck right now, he said.“There’s farms that are struggling to make money on soybean acres, and you’ve got to remember: whatever payment we’re getting, whatever that dollar amount might be, if we get anything, it’s not just going in our back pocket,” he said. “We’ve got a fertilizer bill. We’ve got to pay the seed bill. There’s a lot of payments. So really, that money might be in the farmer’s hands for a month, until it gets spent on inputs for next year.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsFarmingMinnesotaUS foreign policyChinaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In south-east China, temperatures have climbed steadily since late September under the influence of higher than average pressure to the north-east, reaching the mid-to-high 30Cs during a period when conditions would normally be cooling from about 30C to the mid-20s. Inland areas have neared 40C (104F), with Xiushui, in Jiangxi province, recording 38.9C on Wednesday, about 13C above average for early October.Overnight warmth has also persisted. In Hong Kong, further heat on Wednesday brought October’s tally of “very hot days” – defined by temperatures remaining above 28C throughout the day – to four, the highest ever recorded for the month. Models suggest the unusual heat across south-east China will last for another eight to 10 days, before colder air pushes in from the north.In northern China, a much colder air mass clashed with the warmth to produce stubborn, heavy rain. There had been at least 36 hours of continuous rainfall in Beijing as of Thursday afternoon, averaging 68.8mm (2.71in) across the city, with one Daxing district station recording 140.4mm since Wednesday. The persistent rain kept temperatures unusually low; Thursday was Beijing’s coldest early October day since 1951, with a maximum of just 10.6C – about 10-15C below average.View image in fullscreenPedestrians in Beijing.Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesChina has experienced numerous extreme rainfall events this year, an increase that can be linked to a warming global climate. For every 1C increase in global temperature, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture.Meanwhile, typhoon activity continues over the Pacific. Tropical Storm Nakri, which formed on Wednesday, has tracked north-east towardsJapanover the last few days. However, it is expected to veer east, following a similar path to Typhoon Halong, which is now travelling out into the northern Pacific.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The wildlife conservancy works with state national parks staff at both sites on projects that have been reintroducing the species in predator-free areas.Brad Leue, the videographer and photographer who captured the footage at Mallee Cliffs, said he watched the animals exploring outside the family den, which has an opening about the size of a coffee cup.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“I was lucky enough to observe them for a couple of days and get an idea of their routine, which involved sharing a den with mum overnight, venturing out around 8am, and playing within 50 metres of their home while mum hunts for termites,” Leue said.Rachel Ladd, a wildlife ecologist with AWC, said babies were always a special find, “particularly for a species as difficult to spot in the wild as the numbat”.“Seeing seven young numbats lets us know that the population is breeding in favourable environmental conditions and becoming more established.”Numbats are one of Australia’s rarest marsupials and are listed as endangered under national laws.View image in fullscreenNumbat quadruplets emerge from their den at Mallee Cliffs national park.Photograph: Brad Leue/Australian Wildlife ConservancyView image in fullscreenA curious young numbat at Mallee Cliffs.Photograph: Brad Leue/Australian Wildlife ConservancyUnlike other Australian marsupials, they are active during the day and feed exclusively on termites.Numbatswere once foundacross much of arid and semi-arid Australia, but by the 1970s had disappeared from most places except for isolated parts of south-west Western Australia due to predation by feral animals, such as foxes and cats, and habitat destruction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is being held in a government facility in Cairns, more than 250km south, awaiting transfer to a crocodile farm.After his removal, the Queensland environment department said they had been monitoring Old Faithful due to reports from the public and observed him “displaying concerning behaviour” in the prized barramundi fishing hole on the Normanby River that has been his territory for decades. So, the department said, the crocodile was “removed to ensure public safety”.View image in fullscreenOld Faithful is being held at a government facility in Cairns after his removal from the wild.Rangers also removed a smaller saltwater crocodile, between 3metres and 3.5m metres long. The department said the decision to remove both crocodiles was made after consultation with traditional owners.But in his letter, Lyall wrote that “key information” was “withheld” from traditional owners by the department during that consultation in what he now believes was “the hope of gaining our approval and expediting the removal process for their own agenda”.“We have reason to believe that Old Faithful was not the crocodile targeted for removal and that the animal reported by the public as the ‘problem crocodile’ was the smaller, emaciated crocodile, also caught during the trapping process,” Lyall wrote in a statement.“Our board have engaged with many stakeholders and we strongly believe Old Faithful was caught as a wrongful arrest.”The Kuku Yalanji man wrote that the “simulated fishing test” where a crocodile is lured with bait was “designed to elicit the behaviour needed to warrant removal” and likened it to “constantly throwing bananas at a cassowary at Etty Bay until it feeds, or kicking adingo on K’gariuntil it bites”.“If you throw a barramundi out on a piece of rope and drag it back in and throw it out again and drag it back in and throw it out … You’re gonna get that crocodile’s attention sooner or later,” Lyall said.The Rinyirru Aboriginal Corporation chair said that big crocodiles like Old Faithful were a major tourist drawcard – but the attraction had proved a double-edged sword.crocodile on a river bed and in the waterWhile some were “just happy to see that crocodile on the bank”, others wanted the crocodile “right in front of them”.“If all of these people are feeding these crocodiles so they can take a photo of it, it makes that crocodile become lazy … it depends on hand outs,” he said. “Then our iconic crocodiles become the problem, because they are just sitting there waiting to be fed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He doesn’t belong to the Queensland government. He belongs to Rinyirru, and Rinyirru belongs to him.”The Environmental Defenders Office, acting on behalf of advocacy group Community Representation ofCrocodiles(Croc), has requested and is awaiting a statement of reasons from the department to explain Old Faithful’s removal.A department spokesperson responded to questions with a statement saying “public safety is our top priority” and that the department “extensively monitored the crocodile after reports from the public raising safety concerns”.“We understand people were using food to lure the animal from the water to take photos,” the spokesperson said. “Habituating crocodiles is detrimental to the animal and dangerous for people.“The crocodile was displaying repeated and concerning behaviour that was escalating. It was ultimately removed to keep people safe.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandCrocodilesWildlifeReptilesnewsShareReuse this content"

At Friday’s hearing they sought interlocutory relief, requesting an urgent temporary injunction to stop Wilson pursuing a countersuit in California, where she is being sued for defamation by the producers.The hearing came as the producers announced overnight that they had finally secured a distributor for The Deb after months of delays due to the escalating legal battle now raging on two continents, with each side accusing the other of deliberately sabotaging the film’s release.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailChrysanthou told the court that if a temporary injunction was not given, the plaintiffs and witnesses would be forced into a costly battle defending themselves in California, where legal costs cannot be recovered. Wilson’s bid to have her cross-complaint heard in a no-cost jurisdiction was “plainly scandalous and vexatious”, Chrysanthou said, and the issues ought to be determined by courts in NSW, where the movie was filmed.Wilson served an amended cross-complaint on Wednesday on The Deb producers Amanda Ghost, Gregor Cameron and Vince Holden and their company AI Film in London, raising claims of financial misconduct, coercion and harassment against the producers.Chrysanthou said these issues were already being litigated in Australia and that Wilson previously agreed they should be resolved under NSW jurisdiction.View image in fullscreenA scene from The Deb which was directed by Rebel Wilson.Photograph: John PlattThe Pitch Perfect actor is being sued in the supreme court by AI Film on the grounds her actions allegedly broke several contracts, including agreements relating to her role as a shareholder, director, producer and actor in The Deb. They also accuse her of misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law and of making harmful false statements on her Instagram account.Wilson’s legal team has submitted a defence denying the allegations that she sabotaged the release of The Deb, and asserting that she had raised legitimate concerns about the producers’ alleged misconduct and financial mismanagement.Wilson posted on Instagram earlier this year, saying: “I want nothing more than to have this film released and have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to get this to happen.”Lawyers acting for Wilson did not appear at Friday’s interlocutory hearing.The Guardian has sought comment from Wilson.In the US defamation case, the producers allege Wilson’s decision to ignore MacInnes’s repeated denials of abuse showed Wilson acted with knowledge and malice, to promote a narrative that harmed both MacInnes and Ghost. Court documents also allege that Wilson orchestrated a smear campaign involving malicious websites targeting both women, portraying Ghost as an “Indian Ghislaine Maxwell” and MacInnes as complicit, with Wilson implying MacInnes denied being a victim in exchange for a lead role and a record deal.MacInnes has strongly denied these claims and on 22 September filed a defamation lawsuit in the federal court, arguing Wilson’s statements were false, malicious and damaging to her reputation and career.On Thursday AI Film announced that Rialto Distribution has acquired the rights for The Deb in Australia and New Zealand, with plans for a wide theatrical release in January.Explore more on these topicsRebel WilsonEntertainment TVNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The outgoing centrist education minister, Élisabeth Borne, said Lecornu could “build compromise for France”.But it was seen by opposition parties as a sign that Macron, who has 18 months left until the end of his presidential term, refused to broaden the government to other political views that reflected the divided parliament.Lecornu is now under pressure to quickly form a government of new faces with a range of political views, but this is looking increasingly difficult.Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, wrote on social media that Lecornu’s reappointment was a “bad joke”, a “shame on democracy” and a “humiliation for the French people”. He said his party would back a vote of no-confidence in Lecornu at the soonest opportunity.Parties on the left expressed surprise and criticism. The Socialist party said it had made “no deal” not to join a no-confidence vote in Leconru. “Incredible,” wrote the Green party leader, Marine Tondelier, of Lecornu’s appointment.Macron is facing the worst domestic crisis since he first won the presidency in 2017. On Monday Lecornu dramatically resigned only 14 hours after he appointed a new government. He quit after facing fierce criticism from opposition parties that he was refusing to broaden the government to different political groups and viewpoints that reflected France’s divided parliament.He resigned before he had even attended his first cabinet meeting or made his first policy speech to parliament. Weeks earlier, his predecessorFrançois Bayrou was ousted over his proposed budget cuts.Lecornu, 39, has previously served as defence minister and was known for his work on increasing French military spending. Last month, he became the third French prime minister in only one year as the country has lurched from one political crisis to another since Macron’s gamble on aninconclusive snap electionlast year.The parliament remains divided between the three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, with no clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads and there has been no stable government for weeks.The reappointment of Lecornu came at the end of a day of high drama in which several opposition parties were invited to the presidential palace for talks with Macron and many left saying they had not felt listened to. One attender said it was like “talking to a wall”.Julien Aubert, a vice-president of the right’s Les Républicains, which had until now propped up Macron’s centrists in government, said: “Reappointing the same prime minister after such a circus is a provocation – the messaging is terrible.”Others were more reconciliatory. Vincent Jeanbrun, the spokesperson for Les Républicains in parliament, said: “Reappointing Lecornu gives a chance for stability.”Macron’s approval ratings have dropped to a historic low. Alain Minc, an essayist and commentator, told BFMTV Macron was now so unpopular, he was “politically radioactive”.Lecornu must now attempt to appoint a government this weekend in time for a first cabinet meeting on Monday, in order to begin the lengthy process of getting parliamentary agreement on the 2026 budget.France’s central bank chief, François Villeroy de Galhau, forecasts that the political uncertainty that France has seen in recent weeks would have an impact on business, consumer confidence and economic growth. “Uncertainty is … the number one enemy of growth,” he told RTL radio.Under the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

She was informed of her win at 10.50 Norwegian time by Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Nobel Institute.But two Norwegian newspapers, Aftenposten and Finansavisen, later found unusual movement in the online betting markets ahead of the announcement.Until Thursday, Yulia Navalnaya, the economist and widow of former Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, led the odds against all other prospective winners on Polymarket.The site has become a popular place in recent years to wager on political events, with the vast majority of bets focused on American politics. Many of the more niche wagers rely on rumors and speculation skewing the odds that determine a payout.Shortly after midnight Norwegian time, Machado’s odds were 3.75% on the site, trailing both Navalnaya and Donald Trump. Less than two hours later, however, they had surged to 72.8%, suggesting a surge of bets on her victory.In one case, a user won more than US$65,000 placing a bet on Machado: another winner used a profile which was created the same day the bet was placed, according to Finansavisen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the first month, only coaches and HGVs will be checked at Eurotunnel and Dover, and until January, only a minority of passengers will be asked to register at Eurostar.The European Commission said on Friday it expected the system would mean “travelling will become smoother and safer for all”, with databases automatically giving border officials across the EU instant access to irregularities.During the rollout, EU member states would be able to decide when and where they started deploying the system. It would allow them to “start benefiting from the new system, while ensuring that border authorities, the transport industry and travellers can adjust to the new procedures,” the commission said.The UK government is expected to remain in close contact with EU authorities to monitor its introduction and has launched an information campaign for travellers. It said that while checks should only take up to two minutes for each person, there could be longer waits on arrival in the Schengen area.Keir Mather, a UK transport minister, said: “Our priority is to minimise disruption for travellers and hauliers, particularly at our busiest border crossings.“We’ll continue working closely with European partners and local resilience forums to keep traffic flowing and journeys smooth.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An Abta spokesperson said: “It should eventually make travel easier. But those breaching the 90-day rule will be automatically detected.”The freight industry has urged the government to secure an exemption for professional drivers, who may also have been waved through the border until now.The trade body Logistics UK welcomed the phased introduction but said “disruption was inevitable”, and called on the government to work with France to develop an app to allow drivers to register away from the border.The EU expects passport stamping to be phased out before 10 April ahead of the busy summer period, with travellers advised to goto the official websiteif they are unsure of the requirements.EES requirements will apply to countries in the Schengen area, which include the non-EU states of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, but not Ireland and Cyprus.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionTransportEuropeAir transportRail transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Macron’s office has repeatedly said he will not resign before his second term ends in spring 2027.The centrist Macron is facing theworst domestic crisissince he first won the presidency in 2017. On Monday, the prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, a Macron ally, resigned only 14 hours after appointing a new government, amid fierce criticism from opposition parties that he was refusing to broaden the government to different political groups and viewpoints that reflected parliament.Lecornu quit before he had attended his first cabinet meeting or made his first policy speech to parliament. Weeks earlier, his predecessor François Bayrou was ousted over his proposed budget cuts.Lecornu was the third French prime minister in a year as the country lurched from one political crisis to another after Macron’s gamble on aninconclusive snap electionlast year. The parliament remains divided into three blocs: the left, the far right and the centre, none of which has a clear majority. A budget for next year must be agreed within the coming weeks, even though the political parties are at loggerheads and there has been no stable government for weeks.Macron is searching for his sixth prime minister in less than two years and will need to find a figure who can find some kind of compromise or non-aggression pact between very different political parties in order to steer a budget through a fractured parliament.Lecornu has said a revised draft budget for 2026 could be presented at a cabinet meeting on Monday, the deadline for the bill to pass parliament by the end of the year. Macron has promised to announce a new prime minister by Friday night, but that nominee would then have to form a new government by the end of the weekend in order to meet early budget deadlines.France’s central bank chief, François Villeroy de Galhau, forecast that the political uncertainty would have an impact on business and consumer confidence and economic growth. “Uncertainty is … the No 1 enemy of growth,” he told RTL radio.Under the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropeNational RallyJean-Luc MélenchonMarine Le PenThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

It was from Christopher Harborne, one of the UK’s biggest and most private political donors.Harborne, whose millions helpedbankroll Brexit, made the payment to a private company Johnson set up after resigning as prime minister. Now leaked files show that Johnson, a champion ofUkrainein office and since, was accompanied in September 2023 by his benefactor on a two-day visit that included meetings with top officials.What the files do not explain is why. And neither the former prime minister nor his backer will say.Boris Johnson after No 10: files reveal troubling secrets of the ex-PM’s pursuit of profitRead moreThe organisers of the high-level gathering they attended in Kyiv say Harborne was registered as “adviser, Office of Boris Johnson”.Harborne has wide expertise: a self-described “digital nomad”, hisholdingsrange from cryptocurrency and a wellness centre to jet fuel and stakes in at least three military contractors. His only apparent connection to Ukraine is as the biggest shareholder in a British weapons manufacturer whose robots and drones are reportedly supplied to its armed forces.TheBoris Files, leaked documents from Johnson’s private office, have exposed how the former PM has sought to enrich himself since leaving office by sitting down with aVenezuelan despotand courting Mohammed bin Salman, theSaudi crown princeaccused of ordering the murder of a journalist.The Ukrainian cause, by contrast, is “sacred” to Johnson, one political consultant says, an enduring source of moral authority for a politician who was forced out of Downing Street amid scandal.The leaked files raise questions about whether, even here, he has blurred the lines between public service and money-making.View image in fullscreenBoris Johnson (front left) and Volodymyr Zelenskyy (centre) during Johnson and Harborne’s trip in September 2023.Photograph: Sergey Illin/Victor Pinchuk Foundation©2023In an extraordinary statement to the Guardian when asked about his relationship with Harborne, Johnson said: “Your pathetic non-stories … seem mostly to be derived from some illegal Russian hack job. You should be ashamed of yourselves.”Distributed Denial of Secrets(DDoS), the US-based transparency group that obtained the leaked files, said it did not know their provenance.Johnson added: “Why don’t you just change your name to Pravda? Your stories are rubbish and you are doing Putin’s work.”‘Boris and Chris only’In Downing Street, Johnson rallied western powers as Vladimir Putin’s armies poured into Ukraine in February 2022. Since resigning, he has continued to travel there, pledging to maintain allies’ commitment, and remains so popular that he is cheered in the streets.When he disembarked from the night train in Kyiv on 8 September 2023, Johnson had time for a quick shower at his hotel before heading for the Yalta European Strategy (YES) forum, an itinerary in the leaked files indicates. According to a published list of participants, Ukrainian ministers, spymasters and military chiefs mingled with foreign diplomats, politicians, industrialists and executives.What are the Boris Files and what do they reveal about former PM’s conduct?Read moreThe itinerary has “Boris and Chris [Harborne] only” down to attend the opening session of the high-level gathering.

Thank you for your energy, friend!”Johnson’s itinerary says he had further meetings scheduled that day with Zelenskyy’s foreign minister, who said he could not recall whether Harborne attended, and the oligarch who runs the forum.The next day Johnson headed west to Lviv to lay flowers at war graves, visit the wounded and receive an honorary degree.Footageshows Harborne standing nearby as Johnson greets troops.

Although he has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years, holds a Thai passport and sometimes goes by a Thai name, Harborne has put considerable money into British politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And Johnson seems to have nurtured the beneficial relationship while he was in No 10.Harborne visitedChequers at least twice during Johnon’s premiership. Once, he arrived at the prime ministerial retreat by helicopter. The second time was for a Tory megadonor barbecue in August 2022.Within days, Johnson’s tenure was over, but his relationship with Harborne endured, and the £1m personal donation followed. A copy of the financial advice Johnson received soon after leaving Downing Street raises questions about it.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy: “Thank you for your energy, friend!”Photograph: Volodymyr Zelenskyy/TelegramWhile Johnson was still an MP he set up a private company, The Office of Boris Johnson Ltd. The financial advice reveals that he was expecting a “payment to fund the company’s first few years”. He was advised to consider whether this would represent a political donation or if it “might be simpler for the company to invoice the donor’s company for services”.The following month, in November 2022, Johnson’s entry in the register of MPs’ interests records a £1m donation to his company from Harborne. The payment does not appear on the Electoral Commission’s donation database of money “given towards the recipient’s political activities” as an MP. This appears to suggest it may have been a contribution towards Johnson’s money-making activities.The lucrative secrets of Boris Johnson – podcastRead moreThe month of the £1m payment, Johnson and Harborne dined together twice in Singapore. A January 2023 entry in Johnson’s schedule set aside half an hour for a call with his backer. It was labelled “Ukraine readout”. That September, by which time Johnson had quit parliament, he and Harborne stepped aboard a Dassault Falcon at Stansted airport, the leaked files indicate. The private jet, apparently operated by Harborne, carried them to eastern Poland to catch the sleeper to Kyiv.Harborne’s lawyers said: “Mr Harborne’s donation was given to enable Mr Johnson to stay actively engaged in mainstream UK politics. It is and was a donation, and its reporting as such is appropriate.”They added: “Mr Harborne had and has no expectation of personal gain whatsoever. Any suggestion otherwise is completely without evidence and materially and knowingly false.”The letterHarborne’s lawyers did not give substantive answers to questions about why he went on the trip to Ukraine, beyond saying they “appear to have little to no basis in reality”. But there are possible clues in the leaked files.The itinerary features a “closed meeting at the military-tech R&D centre”. It does not say whether Harborne attended, but this is an area he knows well. While his position as the largest shareholder in QinetiQ, with 13%, does not give him a role in the day-to-day running of the privatised research unit of the UK armed forces, his financial stake in its operations is significant.QinetiQ has interests in Ukraine, albeit not its biggest. Ukraine’s forces reportedly use the company’s Banshee drones and bomb-disposal robots. In April 2025, the UK Ministry of Defenceannounced QinetiQ would help Ukraine’s militarymake kit with 3D printers.Johnson refers to the trip in one of the Boris Files’ more mysterious documents. Dated 23 October 2023, the month after the visit, it is a letter carrying his signature. “I write in support of Christopher Harborne,” Johnson writes. “He is both a friend and a supporter of my office … He came with me on a recent trip to Ukraine and I know him to be a passionate opponent of the Putin regime.”Johnson states in the letter that he is “aware of no suggestion or evidence whatsoever that Christopher is in any way supportive of the Russian government, or has links to Russia commercial or otherwise”. There is nothing to indicate why anyone might think otherwise. No such connections have emerged and Harborne’s lawyers say none exist.The lawyers would not say who the letter, addressed only to “Dear Sirs”, was written for. “Mr Johnson provided a character reference for Mr Harborne in response to attacks on Mr Harborne’s character,” they said. “Mr Harborne is grateful to Mr Johnson.”Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe Boris FilesUkraineEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

We can still remember him very well after destroying Iraq and Afghanistan.Share"

The US president is expected to visit Israel on Monday to address the Knesset in Jerusalem.Netanyahu also threatened a return to violence. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt the sword resting on its neck and it is still on its neck … Hamas will be disarmed andGazawill be demilitarised … If this is achieved the easy way, so much the better. And if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” he said.Officials from Hamas appeared equally sceptical. Basel Naim, a senior leader of the militant group, said in an interview with Sky News on Friday that it would not disarm, contrary to the Trump plan.“Our weapons are going to be handed over only to the hands of a Palestinian state, and our fighters can be integrated into the Palestinian national army,” Naim said.In a joint statement issued later on Friday evening, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestinerejected any “foreign guardianship” over Gaza, stressing that its governance was a purely internal Palestinian matter.But they expressed their readiness to benefit from Arab and international participation in the reconstruction of the territory.Officials have said Israeli forces will remain in control of 53% of Gaza in the initial withdrawal phase before the hostages are released, and Israeli bombing in Gaza had intensified on Friday morning up until the ceasefire began. However, Israeli troops were seen pulling back from areas such as the eastern part of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, and the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.With the announcement that a ceasefire had begun, thousands of Palestinians began heading north towards Gaza City, the territory’s biggest urban area, mostly on foot. Nearly half a million Palestinians living in north Gaza were displaced by Israel’s military advance into Gaza City, and many were eager to return to their homes.View image in fullscreenPalestinians gather their belongings and make their way back towards their homes after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Khan Younis.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersFootage showed huge crowds on the coastal road, which had been closed to returnees just days prior.“On the road, I saw someone returning. When he saw his house still standing from a distance, he began to run and shout with joy,” Asmaa Zuheir said. “At that moment, I felt pain because I was returning to my area knowing my house was already completely destroyed.”In the south of Gaza, thousands left the crowded coastal strip of al-Mawasi to travel inland to the partly ruined city of Khan Younis. Ahmed al-Brim pushed a bicycle loaded with wood through row after row of buildings crumpled by bombardment and streets strewn with rubble. “We went to our area – it was exterminated,” he said. “We don’t know where we will go after that.“View image in fullscreenIt is the first time in six months that fighting has not raged in the strip, and residents are keen to check on their neighbourhoods.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersAnother Khan Younis resident, Muhannad al-Shawaf, said it used to take him three minutes to reach a nearby street from his house. Now, it took over an hour as he picked his way through piles of debris. “The destruction is huge and indescribable – indescribable,” he said. “It is almost all in ruins and not suitable for living in.”The conflict has destroyed or damaged more than 90% of homes in Gaza and almost all infrastructure. Almost everyone in the territory has been displaced many times. Malnutrition is rife across all of Gaza, and there is famine in parts, according to UN-backed food experts.The ceasefire is meant to be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza through all five crossings from Israel, though it is unclear how and when this will happen. Israeli army radio said Israel would allow 600 aid trucks into Gaza each day. Aid agencies say such quantities are grossly insufficient.Leading international agencies, including the UN Palestinian refugee relief agency, Unrwa, said they had yet to receive details on what role they would be able to play during the ceasefire. Unrwa, which has been banned from operating in Israel, urged Israeli authorities to allow it to take 6,000 trucks’ worth of aid into Gaza, including enough food to feed the population for three months, from Jordan and Egypt.View image in fullscreenMuch of Gaza lies in ruins after two years of Israeli bombardment.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPA“We’ve not had any progress to move those supplies into Gaza … and this is absolutely critical in controlling the spread of famine,” Juliette Touma, the spokesperson for Unrwa, said.Care International said on Friday it still had not received clearance for its supplies to enter. “We still need clarity on how we’ll be able to get supplies into Gaza that have been stuck outside for months,” said Jolien Veldwijk, Care’s Palestine director.More than 67,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed during Israel’s offensive, and the toll is expected to rise. Medical workers announced that they would use the ceasefire period to start recovering bodies trapped under rubble. Thousands of bodies are though to lie under the debris of ruined buildings, as fighting made excavation and recovery difficult.Israel launched the war in response to a Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage.View image in fullscreenAid deliveries are expected to surge, in a relief to those in the population enduring famine and malnourishment.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APThough there is much relief in Israel and in Gaza at the ceasefire, there is anxiety too. Trump’s ambitious 20-point proposal calls for the disarmament of Hamas, further Israeli withdrawals, the creation of an international stabilisation force and a new technocratic Palestinian administration which would answer to Trump.Little of this has been discussed in detail during the frantic negotiations in recent days, and securing agreement from all parties on the thornier issues will be extremely difficult.Already disagreements have emerged over the makeup of the body that will take power from Hamas in Gaza. The US has said Trump and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair will lead the body, while Hamas has called for a Palestinian led-entity to oversee administration of the strip.Naim rejected the involvement of Blair in particular.Bringing the war in Gaza to a close would mark the biggest foreign policy achievement so far for Trump, who took office in January promising to quickly end the conflict there and in Ukraine, only to be confronted with obstacles and complexities he had apparently not foreseen.The war has evolved into a regional conflict, drawing in countries such as Iran, Yemen and Lebanon, and reshaping the Middle East.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And if not, it will be achieved the hard way,” Netanyahu said.The deal signed early on Thursday and implemented on Friday will lead to Hamas releasing20 living hostageswithin 72 hours, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza, and freedom for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Further steps are still unclear.In his address, Netanyahu said achieving security forIsraelmeant “breaking the Iranian axis, of which Hamas is a central component”, suggesting he had achieved this over the 24 months of relentless conflict.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Netanyahu (centre); the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff (left); and Jared Kushner, son-in-law of Donald Trump, attending a government meeting in Jerusalem on Thursday.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockAnalysts described it as an election speech. “He is always campaigning. In every speech it is ‘I ordered this’, ‘I ordered that’. It’s always me, me, me … That’s what he does best,” said Yossi Mekelberg, a specialist in Israeli politics at London’s Chatham House thinktank.Netanyahu’s popularity has not recovered substantially since the 7 October 2023 Hamas raid that triggered the war in Gaza. The attack killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, with another 250 taken hostage.Since then, even slight boosts for Netanyahu and his Likud party – after military campaigns against Hezbollah in Lebanon last year and Iran in June – have come only at the expense of other members of the current ruling coalition, the most rightwing in Israel’s history.Elections in Israel are due within about a year and most observers expect them within six months. The most recent survey, published on Friday by Ma’ariv, an Israel newspaper, showed widespread support for the ceasefire and hostage release among Israelis had boosted Likud by only two seats, and that the current coalition would still face defeat by a wide margin.Far-right ministers, who have long sworn to collapse the current government if the war was brought to an end without thetotal destruction of Hamasand Israeli control of all of Gaza, have so far yet to make good their threat. In the Ma’ariv survey, almost half of respondents wanted a vote as soon as possible.Anshel Pfeffer, the Economist’s Israel correspondent and a biographer of Netanyahu, said: “Bibi [a widely used nickname for Netanyahu] has been forced to accept this is the end of the war, even if he won’t use those specific words … so now he is going to make the best of the situation. Everything is good for Bibi.“Even at 75, he cannot conceive of life outside the prime minister’s office … and [to hold on to power] would be a vindication as the man who destroyed the Iranian axis, not the man responsible for October 7. I don’t think there is a scenario where he goes off to look after his rosebushes.”The coming weeks will bring further challenges for Netanyahu, who has held power in Israel for 18 years in total, longer than David Ben-Gurion, considered the country’s founding father. He faces corruption charges that could lead to a ban on public office or even jail, and will also face new calls for a full judicial inquiry into the failures that allowed for Hamas’s 2023 raid. Any ceasefire in Gaza is likely to be fragile, and implementing thornier parts of Donald Trump’s plan, including many elements that favour Israel, will be extremely difficult.The key for Netanyahu will be to convince Israelis that he remains “Mr Security” despite the worst security disaster in the country’s history occurring on his watch. The ringing endorsement Trump is expected to offer when he speaks to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, on Monday will help.Udi Tenne, a strategic adviser and international campaign manager who has worked with top leaders in Israel, said: “Netanyahu is the central story of this war … Today, Israel finds itself in the strongest security position in its history: there is no Syrian threat, Hezbollah has suffered a severe blow and so have Iran and Hamas. Netanyahu’s likely message will be: we fell asleep, but we rose in full force – and we defeated all of Israel’s enemies.”Despite the costs of the war in Gaza,Israel’s international isolationand domestic divisions, the broader political landscape may still favour Netanyahu. Any opposition is fragmented.Lahav Harkov, a senior political correspondent at the US-based Jewish Insider, said Israel and its politicians had shifted to the right. “Israelis don’t seem to have much of an appetite for the peacenik stuff at the moment,” Harkov said. “It may not seem logical, but the central question in Israeli politics is still the same as it has been for a long time: yes Bibi, or no Bibi?”Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He was found guilty of murder on Thursday.Ahmad,who fled war-torn Homsafter being injured in a bombing, had been living in the West Yorkshire town for only a couple of weeks when he crossed paths with Franco, who had been for a jobcentre appointment that day and was going to buy eyelash glue with his girlfriend.View image in fullscreenAhmad Al Ibrahim.Photograph: West Yorkshire police/PALeeds crown court heard that Franco – who had consumed cannabis, cocaine, diazepam, ketamine and codeine – took “some petty exception” to Ahmad “innocuously” walking past his girlfriend in the street.CCTV footage showed Franco saying something to Ahmad, and calling him over after a short verbal altercation. As Ahmad walked over, Franco opened the blade on a flick knife he was carrying in his trousers and drove it into the boy’s neck.Franco denied murder, but was found guilty by a jury who deliberated for just over three hours. He pleaded guilty to possessing a knife in a public place.While handing Franco his sentence on Friday, judge Howard Crowson said that upon seeing Ahmad, Franco “identified him as a target and lured him to within your range to strike before killing him”. He said Franco’s claim to have seen a weapon in Ahmad’s waistband was “a lie”.Crowson said of Ahmad that “it is a testament to the medical personnel trying to save his life and his will to live he even made it to the hospital alive, but in truth his wounds were unsurvivable”.Reading out a statement drafted by Ahmad’s uncle Ghazwan Al Ibrahim, with input from his parents, Richard Wright KC told the court that the teenager’s father had suffered a heart attack upon hearing the news of his son’s death, causing him to require surgery.“I am unable to describe the impact of their heinous crime and the impact it had over everyone,” the statement read. “His mother still cries over his clothes as they smell of him.”Ghazwan, who said Ahmad was like a son to him and he felt ashamed he could not protect him, went on to state that Ahmad had thought he had found “the land of peace and the fulfilment of dreams” in Britain, but instead was “cruelly taken away by the senseless and unprovoked act”.“As Ahmad’s uncle, I will always carry the guilt that Ahmad had come to the UK, and I could not keep him safe,” he said in a statement after the sentencing. “Ahmad we love you, we miss you and we will do for ever.”The court heard Ahmad had travelled for three months to reach the UK from Syria, stopping in a refugee centre for teenagers in Swansea and attending college in the Welsh city before arriving in Huddersfield. The teenager had aspired to be a doctor, driven in part by a desire to look after his mother, who suffered from a chronic medical issue.Explore more on these topicsHuddersfieldSyriaCrimeMiddle East and north AfricaKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in hospital.Cordons are in place around the property, and the public is being asked to stay away from the area.“The incident is contained and there is no wider threat to the public,” the spokesperson said.The matter has been referred to the Directorate of Professional Standards, who in turn made a mandatory referral to the IOPC.An IOPC spokesperson said: “We can confirm that we have started an independent investigation into the actions of the Met police during an incident at an address in Walthamstow, east London, where we understand a man was shot by police this afternoon and taken to hospital.“After being notified by the Met police we declared an independent investigation at 4.13pm this afternoon and have sent investigators to the scene and to the post-incident procedure to begin gathering evidence.“Our investigation is in the very early stages.”Assistant commissioner Matt Twist said: “Our thoughts at this time are with the injured man and his family.“I know this news will be concerning for the community in Walthamstow and the wider public in London. However, I want to reassure you, incidents where officers discharge their firearms are incredibly rare.“It is right that there is a full investigation into the circumstances around this incident, and the Independent Office for Police Conduct is leading this. This process must take its course and while that is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.“Armed officers do a difficult job for London, they respond to 4,000 calls a year, placing themselves in danger to protect others. They make split-second decisions in incredibly difficult and challenging circumstances, and I am grateful to all of them for their professionalism and bravery.”Explore more on these topicsLondonIndependent Office for Police ConductMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

His responses led Acoba’s chair, Isabel Doverty, to find him in breach of the rules.On 15 September, Johnson responded to Acoba’s queries to say the stories were “based on material illegally hacked by a hostile state actor. That may explain why they contain so many assertions that are either false or misleading.”He added: “The committee may rest assured that Acoba rules were followed at all times.”The Guardian has seen no evidence that the files contain false or misleading information. The data was obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. It has said it does not know the provenance of the leak.Acoba sent Johnson five specific questions about his relationship with Better Earth, the consultancy firm looking for work with the Saudi government, and his relationship with Bia Advisory, the venture seeking the UAE’s billion-dollar investment.The watchdog wanted to know if he had mentioned the companies when he had spoken with the Saudi ministers, including the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chief executive of one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds.Johnson said he had not started work with Better Earth until Acoba had given the green light for him to join it, and that Bia Advisory had never been set up as a company. He did not address their questions about whether he might have mentioned the ventures to the foreign government representatives.Acoba was frustrated by Johnson’s refusal to give straight answers. The watchdog tried to give him another week to answer and appealed to his standing as a former prime minister and a “reasonable expectation that you would respond fully and factually to my questions to dispel the suggestion that you acted in a manner contrary to your obligations under the rules”.When he was prime minister, Johnson issued his version of the ministerial code. It included the very rules he has now been found to have repeatedly breached.His foreword to the code said: “The precious principles of public life enshrined in this document – integrity, objectivity, accountability, transparency, honesty and leadership in the public interest – must be honoured at all times.”Johnson, however, opted not to engage with the watchdog’s substantive questions.Doverty, the Acoba chair, said it was “highly disappointing” that Johnson refused to substantively deny the allegations he had breached the rules.It adds to a litany of earlier violations by Johnson. They include him asking Acoba to approve a retrospective application asa £275,000-a-year columnist for the Telegraph; asking Acoba to approve an application asa £500,000-a-year columnist for the Daily Mail, 30 minutes beforeit was announced; and refusing to answer Acoba’s questions abouta meeting with Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela, and a hedge-fund manager wholater paid him £240,000.Acoba has used the sole mechanism it has to enforce the rules: a letter to the Cabinet Office.Writing to Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, Doverty said: “Mr Johnson is aggrieved that Acoba sought to investigate these allegations, given how the information behind them was obtained.” But she said there was a public interest in investigating any breach of the rules and a duty to do so.She concluded: “Mr Johnson’s lack of cooperation with Acoba and failure to deny the allegations has led me to report this to you as a breach of the government’s rules.”A government spokesperson said: “As announced in July, new arrangements for the administration of the business appointment rules will take effect from Monday 13 October, as part of our commitment to restore trust and ensure the government is in the service of working people.“As part of the new arrangements,Acoba will be closed, and former ministers found to have seriously breached the rules may be asked to repay any ministerial severance payment.”However, a source indicated that no further action would be taken against Johnson, who is no longer subject to the business appointment rules, for the breach.Johnson has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe Boris FilesConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The party promised to declare China’s systematic repression of its Uyghur Muslim minority as a genocide. Its MPs united to support a genocide amendment to a 2021 trade bill, voting with Tory rebels andonly failing to defeatBoris Johnson’s government by 11 votes.But in the past week recriminations have swirled after the prosecution of two Britonsaccused of spying for China was dropped. A refusal by the government to describe China as a national security threat has reinforced Labour’s already softened approach to Beijing and sharpened focus on the figure at its heart: Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell.Critics sayLabouris hastily pursuing a return to the “golden era” rapprochement led by David Cameron in 2015, when China’s president, Xi Jinping, came on a state visit and Beijing was given approval to build nuclear power stations in the UK.That collapsed afterChinacrushed the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and repeatedly engaged in cyber espionage against British targets. Beijing then became a “decisive enabler” in supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine with critical components.“In opposition, there was a strong sense of moral conviction on Labour party policy on China,” said Luke de Pulford, director of the International Parliamentary Alliance on China, a cross-party group of China-sceptic legislators. “Now that seems to have fallen by the wayside in favour of a focus on trade, investment, sacrificed at the altar of perceived economic gain.”In the run up to the election, Labour had already lightened the policy load inits manifesto, promising “a long-term and strategic approach” to China that would be generated by an “audit of our bilateral relationship”.At the same time, threats from China continued. The chief executive of the Electoral Commission said last month that it took three years to recover from a Chinese hack between 2021 and 2022 in which the details of 40 million voters were accessed.An estimated 20,000 Britons have been approached byChinese state actors on LinkedInin the hope of stealing industrial secrets, the head of MI5 warned in October 2023. Over a quarter of a million military payroll records were compromised by hackers from China in May 2024.Powell, Tony Blair’s chief of staff between 1995 and 2007, arrived in November as national security adviser – in effect the prime minister’s most important geopolitical adviser. A political appointment, he is the first special adviser, reporting to Starmer, to hold the post.A veteran of the Northern Ireland peace negotiations, Powell had set up Inter-Mediate, a charity aimed at promoting dialogue between parties to a conflict. “If we ever want to secure lasting peace then we have to engage with our enemies, not just with those we like,” he said in a Guardian articlein September 2021.Other figures were also trying to exert influence on China policy after Labour’s election victory. A couple of months before his nomination (and short-lived appointment) as UK ambassador to the US,Peter Mandelson– the only Labour peer tovote against the genocide amendment– said Britain had gone too far in its falling out with China. In September 2024, he also told the South China Morning Post “we need a relationship that enables us to cooperate with China when desirable and necessary”.Labourbacktracked on its commitmentto label Uyghur repression as a genocide in October 2024 before a visit to Beijing by then foreign secretary David Lammy.The month after, Starmer met Xi at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, the first time leaders from the two countries had met since 2018. Other engagements followed. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, visited in January, and said the UK should have “a pragmatic and good relationship” with countries around the world.She returned with pledges of £600m of investment over five years, though some specialists argued that was a poor return. “She shouldn’t have been getting out of bed for less than a billion,” said Sophia Gaston, a senior research fellow at King’s College London.Powell himself visited Beijing this July, meeting China’s foreign affairs minister, Wang Yi, in an announcement placedon the Chinese embassy’s website. “Powell expressed the UK’s willingness to enhance dialogue,” the Chinese statement said. Starmer will visit China, perhaps as soon as next year.Meanwhile, China was left off the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (Firs) when it launched in July. It is only occupied by Russia and Iran.The enhanced tier requires anyone in the UK acting for a foreign power or entity across a full range of political and economic activity todeclare their activities to the governmentor face sanctions. Even a proposal to only designate China’s military and espionage apparatus in the higher tier has not been implemented,amid Beijing’s threats of retaliation.The promised China audit never publicly materialised, with experts arguing it was too difficult to publish a frank document. Instead it was subsumed into a UK national security strategy published in late June by Powell’s team in the Cabinet Office, which promised “greater robustness and consistency” in dealing with Beijing.View image in fullscreenChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash leaving Westminster Magistrates’ Court,  where they were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act.Composite: Jeff Moore/PAIt is against this backdrop that Stephen Parkinson, the director of Crown Prosecution Service, revealed this week that for “many months” before August, he had tried and failed to get an assurance he thought necessary to prosecute Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary aide to backbencher Alicia Kearns, and his friend Christopher Berry. Both men were accused of spying for China,passing information from Westminster to the country’s ruling politburo– though they denied the charges.Parkinson had wanted Matthew Collins, a UK deputy national security adviser, to testify that China was currently “a threat to the national security of the UK”. But when it was clear the statement was not forthcoming, he abandoned the case.On Thursday, while visiting India, Starmer said he could “be absolutely clear no ministers were involved” in decisions relating what evidence to submit. Downing Street aides were emphatic that denial covered Powell as well.The allegation that China was seeking to obtain information from Westminster was novel, unlike accusations of hacking or industrial espionage. Yet, due to a still unclear set of circumstances, the trial of Cash and Berry did not begin, because the director of public prosecutions could not obtain what he wanted from the government machine.Whoever was at fault, it amounted to “pusillanimous judgment over what would upset the Chinese”, according to one former senior Whitehall insider.Gaston, a foreign policy expert, argues that any engagement with Beijing should always be undertaken from a position of confidence. “The last thing we want when the government is pursuing a relationship reset with China is to send a message that there were any constraints in its capacity to defend national security, and that we might not have all the right tools to sufficiently protect our democracy,” she said.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyChinaKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Chernukhin has previously stressed that she and her husband have no links to Putin’s regime and that she has condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine.View image in fullscreenLubov Chernukhin, left, leavng a Tory fundraiser at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2022.Photograph: Eleventh Hour Photography/AlamyAccording to Companies House, the couple set up a new company called Satellite Energy Systems in January of this year, with Chernukhin, who is resident in the UK, listed as a director and her husband, Vladimir Chernukhin, who is resident in Italy, as the owner. On LinkedIn, the company describes its purpose as: “We provide net zero energy where it is needed. We are in our customer’s orbit.”Labour said Tice’s decision to accept the hospitality from Chernukhin was “troubling” and questioned why the Reform deputy leader was listening to “vested foreign interests” on the subject of UK gas power.Asked why he accepted the hospitality, Tice told the Guardian: “We’ve got a shortage of electricity in this country, and we face the risk of rationing and blackouts and what we need is more gas power plants and Lubov is interested in developing such a thing and wanted to talk to me about it.”He said if people wanted to invest in the UK energy system with reliable and cost-effective generation, creating jobs in the process, “then I’m going to push that and promote that as much as I can”.He added: “Frankly, my diary is so busy here that it’s the ability to do that, to spend some hours talking about it … I don’t have meetings in the UK more than an hour and a quarter with anybody. So the ability in recess is just to take a bit of time out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also highlighted that the Chernukhins are British citizens.“If Labour criticise it, I might just remind them of that when we face higher energy bills and rationing because we haven’t got enough electricity in this country,” he said.Tice said he was not expecting Lubov Chernukhin to start donating to Reform as she was a Conservative, and added: “This is about getting people to invest money in the UK as opposed to invest elsewhere.”A spokesperson for Lubov Chernukhin said: “Luba is a British businesswoman, philanthropist and investor focused on promoting inward investment, local economic growth and charitable initiatives both in the UK and abroad.

If they can do it, of course me and Jeremy can.“The only difference between us is that Jeremy still thinks Arsenal are still going to win the Premier League, and we know that they will always come second place with a second-place trophy.”The status of the new party, also billed as a grassroots membership organisation, has been in doubt for weeks after Sultana and Corbyn, the former Labour leader who was re-elected last year as an independent MP, fell out bitterly over its organisation.This reached its lowest point last month when Sultanasaid she hadconsulted defamation lawyers after a very public spat with Corbyn about her decision to set up a paid membership system for the party.Corbynsaid the payment sitehad been set up without approval, describing it as a “false membership system” that collected money and data without authorisation. He said he had referred the matter to the Information Commissioner’s Office.In response, Sultana said she had been frozen out of the new party by a “sexist boys’ club” consisting of Corbyn and four pro-Gaza independent MPs.Sultana swiftly rescinded the threat of legal action,saying she wasin talks with Corbyn and wanted to reconcile.A subsequent video message by Corbyn to the mailing list of 750,000 people who had expressed interest in the party apologised for events butmade no mentionof Sultana, while the video showed her only fleetingly.The leftwing World Transformed event used to run in parallel with the Labour conference, but is taking place this year after Labour’s event ended in Liverpool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Polanski recently told his party conference that the Greens were going to challenge Labour because Keir Starmer would “hand this country on a plate” to Nigel Farage.Speaking at the event on Friday, Sultana accused Farage of “peddling racism” to distract people from other events.“The truth is, Reform is just another wing of the political establishment,” she said. “Funded by billionaires and aristocrats, fronted by a millionaire stockbroker, an ex-public schoolboy, Nigel Farage. He is peddling racism to distract us from the real agenda: more privatisation, more deregulation, more handouts for the rich, more cuts for everyone else.”Corbyn said his new party would need to work with the Greens and local independent parties.He said: “There are going to be opportunities and points where we need to work with the Greens. There may be points where sometimes we don’t agree with the Greens. So we have our identity, we have our principles, and we have our position, but we’re anxious to make progress in our society, and that will mean working with a lot of different people – nothing wrong in that.”Explore more on these topicsZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, who was in attendance, said that during tough negotiations to reach a deal, Trump and his team of officials had “really kept me up at night”.The deals set a framework the White House will use to try to reach its goal of lowering US prescription medicine prices. The president sent letters to 17 leading drugmakers in July telling them to slash prices. Pfizer and AstraZeneca are the first two companies to reach a deal with the administration.Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid, while guaranteeing such pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations.“For many years, Americans have paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, by far,” Trump said, adding that the new deal may cut prices to “the lowest price anywhere in the world. That’s what we get.”Trump went on to repeat the wildly false claim that the discounted prices for American consumers would reduce the price of prescription drugs by up to 1,000%.As Daniel Dale of CNNexplained: “Cutting drug prices by more than 100% would mean that Americans would get paid to acquire their medications rather than paying for them.” A health economist, Timothy McBride, told the network Trump’s claims are “just not logical”, since a 500% price reduction would mean that a drug that now costs $100 would be available for free, with consumers given a $400 rebate.The actual deal with AstraZeneca includes cutting prices for the government’s Medicaid health plan for low-income Americans and discounted prices through a “TrumpRx” website, the president said.Pfizer previously agreed to drop prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program for lower-income Americans to what it charges in other developed countries in exchange for relief from tariffs threatened by Trump.More than 70 million people are covered by Medicaid, the state and federal government program for low-income people. Drug spending in that program is dwarfed by that of Medicare, which covers people aged 65 and older or those with disabilities and is not included in Friday’s announcement.The Medicaid program already receives the lowest drug prices in the US, so the additional savings may be modest, said Craig Garthwaite, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.Pfizer agrees to offer discounted drugs through new federal website, Trump announcesRead more“If you look at AstraZeneca’s portfolio, I don’t think there are a bunch of drugs that exist where that’s going to involve them giving a very big discount to Medicaid,” Garthwaite said.Americans currently pay by far the most for prescription medicines, often nearly three times more than in other developed nations, and Trump has been pressuring drugmakers to lower their prices to what patients pay elsewhere or face stiff tariffs.Last month, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on drugmakers, increasing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to agree to price cuts and shift manufacturing to the US.“The tariffs were a big reason he came here,” Trump said of AstraZeneca’s CEO Soriot.AstraZeneca’s Pfizer‑like deal may spare it tariffs, but will not move the needle on US rising health insurance premiums and out‑of‑pocket drug costs, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University.“It’s good for the companies, and has very uncertain if any benefit for Americans struggling with the affordability of prescription drugs,” Conti said.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcarePharmaceuticals industryMedicaidDrugsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A local resident filming the incident asks her name while she is face-down on the street being handcuffed.“Debbie Brockman,” she replies. “I work for WGN. Please let them know.”In another video, onlookers shout at the agents and call them “fascists”, telling them to “get out of our neighborhood, get out of our city”. The agents get in the van and scrape the side of another car, whose driver is still inside, as they speed off, tearing off part of its bumper.A homeland security official said Brockman stood accused of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer by throwing objects at a vehicle.The incident took place in Chicago’s Lincoln Square neighborhood, as immigration agents – at the behest ofTrump officials– have been scouring the city for people to deport.The ramped-up immigration enforcement inChicagohas been met with protests.Local resident Nancy Molden told the Chicago Sun-Times that “it was absolutely horrifying” to see Brockman’s arrest in person.“That was the most frightening thing I have seen in Chicago, living here 20-odd years,” Molden said.Witnesses told local media the agents were targeting a small group of landscapers, though that was not immediately confirmed. A second person, a man, also appeared to have been detained.In one video, the man can be seen handcuffed in the back of the vehicle while Brockman is being arrested. The person filming asks him in Spanish for his name.Tricia McLaughlin of the homeland security department said: “US border patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations and when several violent agitators used their vehicles to block in agents in an effort to impede and assault federal officers.“In fear of public safety and of law enforcement, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening. As agents were driving, Deborah Brockman, a US citizen, threw objects at border patrol’s car, and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer.”WGNsaidthat the border patrol released the employee from federal custody as of 3pm on Friday, and no charges have been filed in her case. The network is still in the process of searching for and obtaining video showing the moment leading up to the employee’s detainment.Brockman’s arrest came days after prosecutors were forced to drop charges against anti-Ice protesters accused of assaulting federal agents while carrying weapons outside a Chicago immigration detention facility – with the move coming after grand jurors refused to hand down an indictment in the case.On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents from using certain forceful tactics to suppress protests or to impede journalists from covering those protests.The order restricts federal officials from arresting, threatening to arrest or deploying physical force against journalists unless the authorities have established probable cause to believe the journalists have committed a crime.Explore more on these topicsChicagoUS immigrationPress freedomNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

This would happen on 1 November “or sooner”, he said, hinting that the move could be accelerated should Chinese officials opt to retaliate.The US will also introduce export controls on “any and all critical software”, he added.“I never thought it would come to this but perhaps, as with all things, the time has come,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, claiming: “Ultimately, though potentially painful, it will be a very good thing, in the end, for the U.S.A.“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase ofTariffson Chinese products coming into the United States of America. There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”A planned meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month may no longer happen, Trump suggested, saying “there seems to be no reason” to meet with the Chinese president.The US president’s threat sets the stage for another escalation in his volatile dispute with China. Just four months ago he described US relations with the country as “excellent” aftersigning off on a tariff reduction deal.Trump repeatedly hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods in the spring, amid spiraling tensions between the two countries, to a peak of 145%. Beijing hit back, raising its own tariffs on US exports to 125%.But talks between officials, amid widespread concern over the impact of such exorbitant duties on the world economy, led to a fragile detente. US tariffs on Chinese products fell to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods dropped to 10%.The president’s latest online attack on Beijing alarmed investors on Friday. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.7%, suffering its worst day since April, and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 1.9% in New York, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite sank 3.6%.Shares in the tech giant Nvidia – the world’s biggest public company, with a market value of almost $2.5tn – were hit particularly hard, dropping almost 5%.Other leading global markets also came under pressure. The FTSE 100 dropped 0.9% in London.China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths, producing more than 90% of the world’s processed rare earths and rare-earth magnets. The 17 elements are critical for manufacturers of everything from electric cars to plane engines.Earlier this week, Beijing significantly expanded its export controls over rare earths, adding five new materials to its control list. Its last expansion of controls, back in April, prompted supply shortages around the world before a series of diplomatic deals helped resolve some of the issues.“I have always felt that they’ve been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!” Trump claimed on Friday. “There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least.“But the U.S. has Monopoly positions also, much stronger and more far reaching than China’s.”Trump’s aggressive tariff strategy is a key pillar of his policy agenda. He has claimed higher taxes on imports from across the world will strengthen the US economy and raise trillions of dollars for the federal government.But tariffs are also often passed on to consumers, lead to higher prices. After years of heightened inflation, Trump has repeatedly claimed there now is none in the US. In reality,price growth has been rising.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpChinaTariffsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The silver grain bins are full of about 100,000 bushels of soybeans, which grab about $10 a piece.This year, though, the fate of the soybeans, and the people whose livelihoods depend on selling them, is up in the air: America’s soybean farmers are stuck in the middle of a trade war between the US andChina, the biggest purchaser of soybean exports, used to feed China’s pigs.“We are gonna have to find a home for them soybeans some time soon,” said Matt Purfeerst, a fifth-generation farmer on the family’s land. “They won’t stay in our bins for ever.”No other country comes close to purchasing as many American soybeans as China – last year, it was more than $12bn worth. This year, the country has not purchased a single dollar’s worth, cutting off the country that makes up about half of US soybean exports.While Trump has said he intends some sort of payment to go to soybean farmers hurt by tariffs, an announcement of a specific plan ison holdwhile the government is shut down. He said in a Truth Social post last week that he would be meeting with the Chinese president soon and “soybeans will be a major topic of discussion”.The White House cast blame on Democrats for the government shutdown for the delay in a response to the Guardian on Wednesday, erroneously claiming they were prioritizing healthcare for migrants over farmers.View image in fullscreenSoybeans are planted near Waverly, Minnesota.Photograph: Mark Vancleave/AP“President Trump, [Treasury] Secretary [Scott] Bessent, and [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the president’s November victory,” spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. “Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress have stalled progress on this issue with their prolonged shutdown to serve illegal immigrants instead of America’s farmers. No decisions have been made, but we look forward to sharing good news soon.”Purfeerst’s family farm grows soybeans and corn, and has some beef cattle. The job is a round-the-clock combination of engineering, business, manual labor, environmental science. And it’s increasingly hard for family farms to make it. Costs for propane, fertilizer and seed have gone up, he said, and the prices for the goods they are selling don’t make up for the increased costs.Soybean farmers have become the “poster child out there right now of how this one particular segment’s getting hurt”, he said. The farm recently welcomed the Democratic US senator Amy Klobuchar for a visit to talk about how the tariffs were playing out, but Purfeerst said political affiliations didn’t matter.“Only 1% of the population is even involved in [agriculture] any more,” he said. “And what gets really challenging is this perception of ag out there, whether it’s on tariffs and prices or environmental issues, farmers kind of seem to be the crosshairs of a lot of it.”Farming areas voted for Trump in 2024, as did much of rural America. One analysis,by Investigate Midwest, showed Trump growing his support among farming-dependent counties in 2024 despite a trade war during his first term that negatively affected farmers.“I’m not gonna get into who I voted for particularly, but I would just have to say, at the time, you got to make decisions who you think is going to be the best leader of the country, and go on with life,” Purfeerst said. “And in four years, you get to vote again. That’s the beauty of our society. It’s not an 80-year regime. It’s a four-year cycle. It’s hard to say what’s gonna come about. I mean, everyone’s got their pros and cons.”View image in fullscreenA soybean harvest at a farm outside St Peter, Minnesota, last month.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesPurfeerst has options for his soybeans: because of his farm’s location, he can sell domestically to soybean crush facilities in nearby towns, sell on the rail market, or sell in Minneapolis and put product on barges down the Mississippi River. Other soybean farmers, especially those in more remote parts of the midwest where soybeans are mostly produced, aren’t as lucky.Stories from all parts of the country where soybeans are grown have surfaced in recent weeks – in Arkansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, the Dakotas. Farmers face higher costs for inputs like fertilizer and equipment. They rely on China as a purchaser. Soybeans sitting in bins too long is subject to weather and pests. The prices fluctuate, so it’s a gamble to hold on to it that sometimes can pay off, or sometimes lose money.“Let’s say tomorrow we get a trade deal with China, and it’s favorable to soybeans. All of a sudden you might see this market jump from $10 to $12 in three, four days,” Purfeerst said. “So it makes it extremely challenging from a risk management standpoint of: when do you market your crop, and how many eggs do you put in that basket? The potential is $12, but if we don’t get a trade deal, it could go to $9 … There’s a huge volatility in soybeans.”The soybean industry has been warning for months that China’s exit from the market would be devastating, calling on the Trump administration to come up with a trade deal that spares farmers. The American Soybean Associationwrote a letterto Trump in August, saying the country’s soybean farmers were “standing at a trade and financial precipice” and “cannot survive a prolonged trade dispute with our largest customer”.Tim Walz, Minnesota’s Democratic governor, declared the first week of October as soybean week, saying in the announcement that “our soybean farmers are confronting a crisis they haven’t seen since the 1980s”.“They’ve produced a bumper crop this year, just to find out they have nowhere to sell their harvest thanks to Trump’s trade policies,” Walz said. “Minnesota’s got the best beans in the world – I encourage Minnesotans to stand with our farmers and continue to advocate for federal trade reform.”It’s not the first time a Trump trade plan has hurt soybean farmers: in 2018, a trade war led to significant reductions in soybean exports to China. Since then, the market has rebounded, though China hasramped upsoybean purchases from Brazil and Argentina, stockpiling imports earlier this year.Republican lawmakers have said they are sympathetic to the farmers and want to find a way to help them. James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, said this week that soybean farmers were not to blame for the problem they are facing.“They planted that crop assuming that those foreign markets were going to be there,” Comersaid in a recent TV appearance. “I think we need to do something to help the soybean farmers.”A bailout is “really just a Band-Aid”, though it’s one that many farmers would welcome as they are getting squeezed right now, Purfeerst said. Most farmers would prefer an open market, without tariffs, for their products, letting the market dictate prices. They don’t want the trade war now to affect a long-term relationship that makes up a significant chunk of market share. There also should be more emphasis put on increasing domestic uses of soybeans, though a long-range plan like that won’t help the farmers who are stuck right now, he said.“There’s farms that are struggling to make money on soybean acres, and you’ve got to remember: whatever payment we’re getting, whatever that dollar amount might be, if we get anything, it’s not just going in our back pocket,” he said. “We’ve got a fertilizer bill. We’ve got to pay the seed bill. There’s a lot of payments. So really, that money might be in the farmer’s hands for a month, until it gets spent on inputs for next year.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS politicsFarmingMinnesotaUS foreign policyChinaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But the potentially multibillion-dollar financial crisis surrounding First Brands has them rattled.As ever in finance, it’s what investors don’t know that scares the most, and with First Brands, there appears to be plenty.What is First Brands?First Brands was founded by the Malaysian-born businessman Patrick James. Starting life as Ohio-based Crowne Group, James acquired Trico, best known for windshield wipers, and went on a debt-fueled acquisitions spree, snapping up auto-focused parts makers. James rechristening the company as First Brands Group in 2020. It now owns 24 automotive-related companies, according to thegroup’s website.“If your car is 10 years old, odds are good that parts from these companies are already on there,”notes the auto website CarBuzz.“And they were probably half the cost of original equipment parts sold through dealerships.”Seems like a sensible business. Why did it collapse?The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the southern district of Texas on 29 September due to creditor concern over the company’s use of opaque off-balance sheet financing, listing liabilities – what it owed – between $10bn and $50bn against assets – what it owned – of between $1bn and $10bn.But the speed of the First Brands implosion has spooked investors, and the more that’s known, the more they are spooked.The company had until recently had a decent cash buffer, but it was using private debt or “shadow banking” to borrow against invoices, in effect keeping debt off its balance-sheet disclosures, and turning a company with 26,000 employees into a finance company more than the supplier of auto parts.That system, known as factoring, is not unusual. But when the size of that debt, and who is holding it, becomes obscure, problems can rapidly accumulate, as the financial industry saw with the collapse of the UK fintechGreensillCapital in 2021 and London-listed firmCarillionin 2018.On Thursday, the technology group Raistone, which arranged some off-balance sheet financing, claimed that as much as $2.3bn had “simply vanished” as part of the bankrupt auto supplier’s failure.Jim Chanos, who predicted the Enron disaster in 2001,told the Financial Timesthat complex financial systems tend to flourish at the tail end of a boom when everyone wants in. “As long as everything works, nobody asks questions,” he said. “It isn’t until something stumbles, or the markets stumble, that people say, ‘Wait a minute, what are we doing here? This doesn’t make any sense.’”Why is Wall Street so worried?Just as in other financial crises – most recently the housing crisis that led to the 2008 financial meltdown – Wall Street is worried that the issues at First Brands are a sign of worse to come.The Texas auto lender Tricolor – which specialized in lending to low-income “sub-prime” lenders – collapsed last month amidfraud allegations.Ben Lourie, professor of accounting at the University of California, Irvine, says the issues at First Brands, and the collapse ofTricolor, connect because one was selling cut-price parts, and the other older cars, to consumers under economic pressure.“My guess is the companies went into bankruptcy because the market is not great and they started doing things they should not be doing. So they went into financial innovation with invoice financing,” Lourie says.“The fear is that the private debt market has been too hot, and [has been] giving out money, at high interest rates, to companies that just can’t pay it back, and especially to companies in the auto market,” he adds.Fears over what the failure of both companies portends are highlighting worries about what other issues the private debt markets may face.“The private debt market is much bigger than it used to be, and we can see that by companies pulling their IPOs because they are raising money in those markets,” says Lourie. “But there isn’t as much disclosure as there is in the public markets. So there is a disclosure issue because we don’t really know what’s going on.”He adds: “When there isn’t as much disclosure, there’s more risk, and there’s a fear of contagion, because somebody is going to have to take on these losses, and eventually it will reach up into the banks.”Jefferies, a midsized Wall Street lender, was advising First Brands, acting as lender against invoices through a specialist invoice-finance fund it manages, Point Bonita Capital, and placing billions of dollars of loans with other investors.Who those investors are, and how far the chain of debt stretches into the mainstream banking system, is an open question. Jefferies says it has $715m in exposure to First Brands. An investigation has been set up in part to examine whether invoices were pledged more than once.But it goes further, with concerns mounting that First Brands’ precarious arrangements could be found elsewhere.Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, says concerns are primarily about unregulated private debt markets and the assets they hold that are often not marked-to-market, an accounting system that values a company’s assets and liabilities at their current fair market value.“When these assets become impaired, it’s a surprise to markets, because there hadn’t been a gradual updating of information,” House says, “and because we don’t have great transparency on the location and concentration of where these assets are being held. And that can often have knock-on effects that are unanticipated.”So Wall Street got too clever for its own good, again. Why should I care?The worry is that the collapse of an obscure car parts company is the first domino, and that if more dominoes collapse, it could spread across the financial system, eventually triggering a wider crisis.Severe problems in the financial markets caused not by macro-economic conditions, but by the intricacies of capital management have happened before – the collapse of a high leveraged hedge fund,Long-Term Capital Managementin 1998, that required a $3.6bn bailout, or the subprime mortgage loan crisis of 2007 that caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the onset of severe financial recession.Such analogies may not be exact, since the problems now being unearthed relate to private debt markets that expanded significantly after banks tightened lending standards after the 2008 crash.“The risk may sit in the balance sheets of funds and other asset managers that may create counterparty risk for large financial institutions that can cause reverberations from relatively obscure small funds hitting problems and create a cascading effect through the financial system that gets amplified by the structure of different asset classes and is unanticipated because of a lack of transparency,” says House.“It effectively means that unregulated parts of the debt and asset management market may hold risks that have implications for the entire financial system.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

For Miller, the dismal job growth is largely due to the war against immigrants he has masterminded from his perch on the White House’s second floor.The cognitive disconnect ultimately stems from a stubborn misrepresentation preached across the administration about the impact of immigrants on the American economy: that every immigrant expelled from the workforce frees up a job to be readily filled by an unemployed American. InMiller’s words: “Mass deportation will be a labor-market disruption celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs.”View image in fullscreenTwo Mexican Laborers, Emptying Bags of Cotton on Wagon on Plantation, Perthshire, Mississippi in October 1939Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThis is what inspired the agriculture secretaryto proposethat farmers who lost their workforce to an Ice raid should have their crops picked by Medicaid recipients who need a job to keep their benefits. It explainsJD Vance’s smug moodin August when a government report suggested,implausibly, that there had been amomentous declinein the immigrant workforce and acorresponding increasein the number of Americans with a job, a pattern that turned out to be astatistical mirage.As economists repeatedly try to explain to the likes of Vance and Miller, the economy doesn’t work like that. A newly deported migrant does not yield an employed native. Indeed, the deportation is likely to cause employers to let go of American workers too. What deportations do achieve is to reduce the labor force. The native-born workforceshrank last year. Hiring is slow largely because kicking migrants out means there are fewer workers to hire.At the end of the day, the White House’s attempts to rid the labor market of immigrant workers will cripple American prosperity – damaging industries that rely on immigrant labor, from agriculture to hospitality and eldercare to healthcare. Businesses will shrink and even go under, punishing the American workers who toil alongside the foreign-born. American history keeps teaching us the same lesson: the prosperity of this land relies on immigrant work. Somebody let Trump know.Consider the previous attempt at mass deportation. About 424,000 undocumented immigrants were “removed” from 2010 to 2015 under the “Secure Communities” program during the administration of Barack Obama. Studying the impact on the workplace as the program was implemented county by county over four years, economists from the University of Coloradoestimated thatthe 3.5% fall in the employment of immigrants as Secure Communities rolled out was associated with a 0.5% decline in the employment of citizens.A few decades prior, the end of the“Bracero” programin December of 1964 excluded almost half a million Mexican seasonal farm workers, who had been coming to plant and harvest crops since the 1940s.According to another study, the demise of the Bracero program did nothing to raise the employment or wages of native farm workers. Farmers who could, mostly those growing tomato, beet and cotton, mechanized production. But they didn’t pay more.View image in fullscreenMexican farm laborers (also known as Braceros) line up as clerks fill out registration forms for temporary employment in the United States at the US-Mexico border, 1957.Photograph: PhotoQuest/Getty ImagesNor did the mass “repatriations” of hundreds of Mexican immigrants and their US-born children during the Great Depression improve the lot of American workers. Rather,economists foundthat the employment and wages of native workers declined in the most affected counties.On the flipside of this dynamic, economists studying immigration over the first two decades of this centuryfound thatthe inflow raised the wages of less educated native workers, those with at most a high school diploma. Theirconclusions resemblethose of studies of the immigration wave of the early 20th century that found it spurred industrial production and increased native employment. Native workers left immigrant-heavy jobs – manual laborers, waiters, blacksmiths and the like – and took higher-wage positions as foremen, electricians or engineers.After Congress passed the nation’s first-ever national immigration quotas in the 1920s, driving immigration down over the coming four decades, businesses in affected areas responded ina variety of ways– drawing workers from other states and other countries, introducing labor-saving technology or reducing production. The impact on native workers was, at best, ambiguous.These outcomes are not hard to comprehend. Whatever Trump, Miller and co are trying to spin, understanding the impact of immigration requires looking at its impact on businesses, which will invest to profit from the additional labor, as well as on the occupational decisions of native workers, who will move to better jobs out of immigrants’ reach.Barring immigrants from the economy will reverberate beyond the labor market. Just like during the second world war, when the exclusion of Japanese farm workersslashed agricultural productivityand output by pushing the most productive farmers off the fields, kicking out foreign graduates will strain America’s pool ofskilled workersand limit the number ofstartups. Limiting H-1B visas won’tcreate more jobsfor citizens but trimemployment, sales and profitsin technology firms.View image in fullscreenJapanese-American Farm Workers Working in Sugar Beet Field, Farm Security Administration FSA Mobile Camp in Nyssa, Oregon in July 1942.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesIt is true that immigration ispolitically unpopular. While Trump’s draconian treatment of immigrants and their communities might strike many as inhumane, many Americans have come to believe immigration amounts to a problem rather than an opportunity.This would not be the first time in history that this nation of immigrants turns against its most defining feature. It is, however, a perilous moment to do so. As the population ages and the domestic labor force shrinks, political leaders now claiming a mandate to rid the nation of its foreign labor force may be summoned to account for the consequences.Explore more on these topicsUS economyUS unemployment and employment dataUS politicsEconomicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpJD VanceanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the 24-year-old fumbled the ball and, instead of going to first for an easy out, he threw it wide of catcher JT Realmuto at home plate as Hyeseong Kim scored the winning run.“[The ball] just hit off my foot,” Kerkering said. “Once the pressure got to me, I just thought there’s a little faster throw to JT, little quicker throw than trying to cross-body it to Bryce [Harper at first].”A WALK-OFF TO MOVE ON TO THE NLCS.pic.twitter.com/JPveGti3Nu— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers)October 10, 2025The 2-1 win sealed a 3-1 series victory for the Dodgers, who will face either the Milwaukee Brewers or Chicago Cubs for a place in the World Series.Blood, bias and the Battle of Florida: how the NHL’s dirtiest rivalry exposed hockey’s old-boy rotRead moreKerkering slumped in despair after his error and was comforted by manager Rob Thomson.“He just got caught up in the moment a little bit,” Thomson said. “I feel for him because he’s putting it all on his shoulders.”Dodgers manager Dave Roberts also had sympathy for a player who had just helped his team advance.“It’s brutal,” Roberts said of Kerkering’s error. “It’s one of those things that it’s a PFP, a pitcher’s fielding practice. He’s done it a thousand times. And right there he was so focused, I’m sure, on just getting the hitter and just sort of forgot the outs and the situation.”The Phillies had gifted the defending champions their other run in the seventh when Jhoan Durán walked Mookie Betts with the bases loaded allowing Justin Dean to score. The Phillies had taken the lead at the top of the inning when Max Kepler scored off Nick Castellanos’s double.It was another frustrating end to a season for the Phillies, who were the No 2 seed in the National League after winning the NL East. Despite an excellent rotation and a strong batting lineup they have lost in the NLDS two years in succession; last year they were eliminated by NL East rivals the New York Mets. They also lost in the 2023 NLCS to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite at one point holding a 3-2 series lead.The Dodgers, meanwhile, are into the NLCS for the eighth time in 13 seasons.Explore more on these topicsMLBLos Angeles DodgersPhiladelphia PhilliesBaseballUS sportsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Anti-terror measures are in place throughout Oslo; a no-fly zone will be implemented in the skies above Ullevaal Stadium and through all the tension it could be easy to forget that the national team are within touching distance of a first World Cup appearance for 27 years. BeatingIsraelwould put them on the verge but the visitors’ presence has added multiple layers of complexity and controversy.That will be clear on Saturday afternoon, when a crowd of several thousand is expected to march peacefully from the centre of Oslo to a stage set up near the ground. It has been organised by the Palestine Committee inNorwayunder the slogan “Red card for Israel” and other bodies will be holding their own protests too. Outside Grønland metro station, posters of unclear provenance advertised a separate demonstration under the name “Stop the national match”. The authorities have been preparing for this occasion since the teams were drawn together more than a year ago.Israel in line for World Cup qualifying reprieve even if Uefa imposes banRead moreIsrael are used to this: they are more than accustomed to the heightened environment around their matches and the enhanced level of security. “Not much higher than usual,” said their captain, Eli Dasa, which in practice is understood to mean 16 Mossad agents will be present. Nonetheless the added edge around this particular fixture has been inescapable.It was evident in the grilling, much of it hostile, dished out by Israeli journalists to the Norwegian Football Federation president, Lise Klaveness, on Friday afternoon. The NFF’s stance that Israel should be banned from international football, repeated publicly by Klaveness, has been made more stridently than that of any other European nation and it is one reason for a souring of relations. A decision to donate the proceeds from Saturday’s game to Doctors Without Borders’ work in Gaza also drew an affronted response from the Israeli Football Association, which felt a point was being made.Uefa was close to voting on a ban for Israel, which would not have applied to Fifa-run World Cup qualifiers without the global governing body following suit, after the United Nations concluded damningly that the state has committed genocide in Gaza. That idea wasput on holdas Donald Trump’s peace plan gathered momentum last week. Klaveness repeated several times that she had not been the primary driving force behind those moves and reiterated, too, that the illegal presence of Israeli teams in occupied Palestinian territory is the reason for her position.“It’s not an effort to ban Israel [in particular], it’s about a rules-based system,” she said. “Like all people, we’re very happy there is a peace agreement. It’s more important than the game that the bombs stop and the hostages go home. When we’ve talked about sanctions it’s about breaches of Fifa law. That should be a continued discussion.”The NFF has never considered taking matters into their own hands and refusing to play Israel but campaigners such as Line Khateeb, who leads the Palestine Committee in Norway, believe this game should not be taking place. “Not at all,” she says. “Israel shouldn’t be included in an international football arena when they are violating international law and preventing Palestinian football players from playing. As long as Israel’s occupation withstands, Palestinians don’t have a chance to play football, to live, to learn or move freely.“We won’t disturb the game, we want Norway to win. We will protest, but after this game there will be other games involving youth teams or in European competitions. They should reject receiving Israel for Norwegian football teams.”View image in fullscreenMembers of the Action Group for Palestine demonstrate outside the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo on 17 September.Photograph: Gorm Kallestad/NTB/AFP/Getty ImagesThe tension between taking a political or moral stance and cheering Norway towards a historic achievement has been further highlighted by the decision of Norsk Supporterallianse, a vocal presence on the domestic scene, to step back from any involvement in protests or statements around the Israel game.An Israel side that entertain going forward but repeatedly leak goals must win to retain any realistic chance of qualifying. There was an extraordinary scene in their pre-match press conference when their manager, Ran Ben Shimon, requested a pause and donned a kippah before reciting the bible passage Jeremiah 31:16. It was in tribute to the agreement that Hamas’s 20 living Israeli hostages must be released by 10am BST on Monday. Long-serving observers of the national team said it was the first time an Israel manager had made such a public intervention.This week’s events will be used as motivation. “It’s a lot of excitement, it helps us a lot,” said Dasa. “Since 7 October 2023 we haven’t attended a game with the feeling of hope that something will happen, but now they are on their way home and we would like to give them a nice present.”A small group of protesters was stationed outside Ullevi while the Israel team trained on Friday night. Fewer than 200 Israel fans will be present to see the match. Norwegian supporters will be 3,000 fewer in number than normal, with small sections of the 28,000 capacity closed to prevent possible pitch incursions. That will be just one visual reminder, while proceedings unfold on the turf, of the context off it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersIsrael (Football)NorwayIsrael (World news)Middle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dart finished 17 of 25 for 195 yards passing and 13 carries for 58 yards after getting a concussion test following a big hit, while Skattebo rushed 19 times for a career-high 98 yards.“Quite honestly, nobody really expected us to put up a performance like this,” said Dart. “We felt confident.

But Hurts’ miscues combined with the defense faltering contributed to their first back-to-back losses since three in a row to end the 2023 regular season, then eliminate them from the playoffs.“I got to be better,” Hurts said, calling his interception a bad throw and criticizing himself for missing Smith. “Another opportunity to keep attacking them and capitalizing.

His death at home on 14 September was mourned throughout the world, with a minute’s silence held during the Manchester football derby that was played later that day.Ricky Hatton obituaryRead moreHatton’s funeral cortege wound its way through Manchester, with a sea of mourners clapping loudly at every stop and turn on its two-hour route. The procession began at the Cheshire Cheese in Hyde, his favourite pub where he was a regular and a stone’s throw away from his home, before continuing through the area towards Manchester Cathedral. Along the way it also stopped at sites such as the Harehill Tavern, another favourite of Hatton’s, as well as Hatton’s gym. A mural of Hatton was unveiled at the Harehill Tavern when the hearse stopped there.Once the procession reached Manchester Cathedral, Hatton’s coffin was led into the building carried by family and friends, including his brother, Matthew Hatton, and son, Campbell Hatton, both also boxers, and Paul Speak, who managed the Hitman throughout his career.One of Manchester’s favourite sons, many famous faces associated with the city attended the service, including the Oasis frontman and fellow Manchester City supporter, Liam Gallagher, who, along with brother Noel, had carried Hatton’s championship belts into the ring during his 2008 clash with Paulie Malignaggi.Shaun Ryder and Bez from the Happy Mondays also paid their respects at the service, along with Manchester United great Wayne Rooney and some of the biggest names in British and world boxing, including fellow former world champions Tyson Fury, Tony Bellew, Amir Khan and Anthony Crolla.Mani and Liam Gallagher, Colleen and Wayne Rooney attend Ricky Hatton’s funeralMusicians Gary ‘Mani’ Mounfield and Liam Gallagher touch Ricky Hatton’s coffin, Colleen and Wayne Rooney arrive for Hatton’s funeral.Amir Khan and Tyson FuryFormer boxer Amir Khan arrives for Hatton’s funeral, Tyson Fury departs after the service.Giving an emotional speech during the service, Campbell called his father “the people’s champion” and said he looked up to him in “every aspect” of his life.“I can’t explain how much I’m going to miss you, Dad, and that we won’t be making any new memories,” he said. “But the ones we did I will cherish for ever.“Growing up I looked up to my dad in every aspect of life whether it be following in a career in boxing like he did or the way he carried himself out of the ring. But all of that was fuelled by the love I had and always will have for him.”From the cathedral, his coffin was driven to Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium for a private service. Hatton’s coffin was painted the same shade of light blue as his beloved City, the team he had supported his entire life and at whose stadium he defeated Juan Lazcano in 2008 in front of a then postwar British record 55,000 capacity crowd. The cortege carrying his coffin was led by the famous yellow Reliant Regal three-wheeler van from Only Fools and Horses, with Hatton, a fan of the comedy show, having bought the original van.Reliant Regal from Only Fools and Horses and funeral cortege passes the Cheshire Cheese pub in Hyde.Ricky Hatton’s Reliant Regal from Only Fools and Horses at the Etihad, Hatton’s funeral cortege passes the Cheshire Cheese pub in Hyde.WBC tribute and Hatton’s padsA tribute from the WBC and some of Ricky Hatton’s pads in the hearse.Outside the Cheshire Cheese pub Mike Lunney and Martin Taylor, two friends who had followed Hatton across the Atlantic to Vegas in 2007 paid their respects to a “boy from Manchester who became a hero” to many.“Look around you,” Lunney said. “There’s as many people here as there were in Vegas. Who else can do that? That many people following you over there at your best, and this many people paying their respects once you’re gone?”Taylor added that Hatton, who was known to people in the area on a personal level and loved being in the company of others, was a “humble and kind” person who was loved by everyone he met.“This is just a normal working-class place and he resonated with people because of who he was. He would talk to people, buy them a drink and talked to people like he was a nobody, but he was so much more than a nobody to so many people,” he said.“They say people only get their flowers when they can’t smell them,” Lunney added. “I hope he knew what he meant to people. Not just to the city or to his fans but to people he met. He was the people’s champion for a reason, he was the best person you could meet, he’d buy everyone a round and chat to you all night. He was the Hitman but he was also Ricky, and he’ll be missed.”Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

As he tried to find a way past Britain’s Cameron Norrie in the first round, the Russian simply did not feel comfortable striking the ball.With his prospects of advancing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world dwindling, the 29-year-old settled on a drastic solution. Medvedev requested completely different strings when he sent his rackets to be restrung mid-match, switching from a hybrid of natural gut and polyester strings to a full polyester setup.It is normal for players to alter their string tension during a match, but few would consider a change as dramatic as the actual string type. Medvedev has now made the switch many times this year: “Until 2023 I had never done it,” Medvedev says. “Something started to change on tour, I had to adapt. Now I’m never sure.”‘We rewatched an Ajax match’: What really happens when tennis anti-dopers callRead moreThe world No 18 is referring to the properties of the tennis balls on tour and how slight changes in recent years have left him uncertain how to optimise his game. The quality of balls across the tour has been one of the most significant talking points and sources of frustration among players around the world. “That’s probably the biggest difference I can notice, compared to maybe 10, 15 years ago,” Novak Djokovic says. “It’s the balls.”One of many significant challenges in elite tennis is adjusting to the differing conditions each week, including the constantly changing balls. Different tournaments have their own contracts with ball manufacturers, which present other issues. Injuries are often attributed to players having to adjust to different types of balls.There is a growing consensus that many different balls decay at a faster rate than ever before, which Emma Raducanu describes as difficult to navigate and another injury hazard: “I do think the balls are a big challenge for all of us,” says Raducanu. “The way that they deteriorate is really challenging. I think it gets very fluffy. You see a lot of wrist, elbow, shoulder injuries happening now. And it is hard because the dynamic of the points can be different from when they’re new to when they’re old.”New tennis balls are encased in a tight layer of felt but, as they make contact with the racket strings and court surface, it fluffs up, making them less aerodynamic. They travel through the air more slowly, meaning it is harder to hit winners as fluffier balls lead to more prolonged rallies. Many players believe they fluff up more quickly today. At least some of these issues can be attributed to production line problems in factories during the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the consistency and quality of the felt provided by the suppliers to the tennis ball manufacturing companies.View image in fullscreenDaniil Medvedev says since 2023 he is ‘never sure’ about how tennis balls will behave during a match.Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesAs players try to adjust, the sport itself is changing. Less powerful players such as Norrie now believe it is even more difficult to impose their game with some balls. “I think that the ball’s getting messed up easier in some tournaments,” he says. “For players like me and Daniil, it’s not easy to generate as much power as other players, and that’s cost me, or it’s easier for other players. But, to be honest, I’m never complaining about the balls.”Those who generate significant amounts of topspin have also felt the differences. A livelier ball accentuates the effects of heavy topspin, allowing the ball to bounce higher and rise further outside the opponent’s strike zone. Casper Ruud, who possesses one of the game’s most spin-heavy forehands, believes his strokes are less potent due to the balls: “I feel like the players are handling my heavy shots like way better now than when I came on tour, which was pre-Covid, and they’re able to just step in and rip the damn thing back and I’m kind of surprised how well people do it.”Many players have addressed their issues with the balls by incorporating natural gut strings in their rackets alongside polyester strings, which helps to generate more power. Others shift to a looser string tension when they feel they are struggling to generate pace with certain balls. As is often the case in tennis, however, a disadvantage for one player is another player’s asset. None of this has stopped Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner from dominating the sport this year. Both possess such destructive weapons that they can still generate massive speed off slower balls.Nobody has been more outspoken on this subject than Medvedev. Two and a half years after holding the No 1 ranking, he is trying to find a way through one of the most difficult periods of his career. The Russian, who has achieved one of his best results of the year this week by reaching the Shanghai Masters semi-finals, now sits at No 18 in the ATP rankings and he frequently describes the balls as his biggest obstacle.Medvedev says he does not want to be known as the player “crying” after every match, but says he is just being honest: “Some players will like this ball, so I get it,” he says. “I’m crying because it disadvantages me. But if you take six balls out of the new balls out of the can, if you look closely and you bounce them, there are going to be six different balls. I don’t think that’s how it’s supposed to be.”Explore more on these topicsTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Enner Valencia, the 35-year-old journeyman and the nation’s all-time scorer, sealed the win with a penalty in his 100th appearance. The Estadio Monumental roared with ecstasy and emotion.Both sides had already sealed qualification for 2026 and the visitors were playing without Lionel Messi, who had also said goodbye to qualifiers after his final game in Buenos Aires a few days prior. But none of these narratives mattered to Ecuadorian fans. They were acknowledging a magnificent campaign asLa Tricolorended second in the table, their best-ever finish since Conmebol qualifiers moved to a single table. And this despite starting the campaign with a three-point penalty due to the use of documents with false information to register Byron Castillo in the previous cycle.It was a campaign of total resiliency; Ecuador have also not lost a game since 6 September 2024, a tight 1-0 loss away at Brazil. In that timeframe, they have also only conceded one goal, with just five conceded over the whole of qualifying.Donald Trump will not move World Cup matches, says Fifa vice-presidentRead moreEcuador’s trajectory may be surprising to some, but it’s really a natural extension of the growth of the domestic game, an increase of players playing their trade in Europe, and a youth system that continues to produce stars. This is a national team that could make a run in next summer’s World Cup. Now, as they prepare for two friendlies against two hosts – the United States and Mexico – the aim and message from Ecuador’s standpoint is simple: keep going.“The challenge is to play these friendlies with the same level of intensity as official matches,” said head coach Sebastián Beccacece last week. “Both the US and México are very strong national teams and we want to beat them.”Beccacece, and Argentinian, became Ecuador’s head coach in August of 2024, replacing Félix Sánchez after losing to Argentina in Copa América quarter-final. At 44, he’s a fairly young manager, and has never been an international one. He has no history as a professional player either. In Ecuador, he took one one of the most coveted jobs in South American soccer, with a talented and hungry squad featuring Chelsea’s Moisés Caicedo and PSG center back Willian Pacho.Yet despite this supposed mismatch, Beccacece has instilled defensive discipline into a team that are now masters of the counterattack thanks to an abundance of poise and pace. Under Beccacece, the low block is their friend, especially when protecting a lead and to them, defense – like the saying goes – really does win championships. Due to this philosophy, there are some corners of Ecuador’s media that criticize the lack of offensive creativity. Out of the South American teams who qualified for the World Cup, Ecuador were the joint lowest scorers alongside Paraguay. But to the team, their stingy defensive unit is a symbol of pride. .View image in fullscreenSebastián Beccacece has instilled a solid, defensive mentality to Ecuador.Photograph: Marcos Pin/AFP/Getty Images“We don’t play with a back five,” said Àngelo Preciado, an important member of the squad, when asked on Ecuador’s popular show Marca 90about the need to play with such a congested line. “I’m a big winger [first] but I try to help the defenders. Maybe it’s seen as a defensive thing but we play a different kind of role.”The role Preciado alluded to is a collective responsibility to to protect the goalkeeper and ensure no one enters the box. This team has turned stubbornness into an art form.Becca’slack of history as a player means he has worked his way up through the coaching ladder, eventually working very closely with Jorge Sampaoli as his assistant for Universidad de Chile where they won practically every domestic title and the Copa Sudamericana in 2011. Eventually it led the pair to the national team during Chile’s golden years, which included the World Cup in 2014 whenChile eliminated Spain in the Round of 16. They were also the duo thatled Chile to win Copa Américaa year later. Afterward, he joined Argentinian club Defensa y Justicia before Sampaoli approached him once again, this time as part of the 2018 World Cup campaign for Argentina.Now he leads a national team that has grown in stature due to the continuous investment in domestic youth development and global awareness. Clubs such as Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito have implemented such strong projects from the youth level that the country is now seen as a hub for European scouts –especially when it comes to center backs. From the aforementioned Pacho to Piero Hincapié, the versatile defender who was part of Bayer Leverkusen’s historic Bundesliga title in 2023/24 and now plays for Arsenal.Gianni Infantino keeping ‘open mind’ about moving World Cups from summerRead moreEvery position, though, has up and coming stars. Independiente del Valle, for example, has one of the best academies in the continent and continues to produce talent such as the aforementioned Caicedo, Preciado, Pacho and Joel Ordóńez from Club Brugge. Then there are younger players such as 18-year-old Kendry Páez (on loan at Strasbourg from Chelsea) and 22-year-old Patrik Mercado. These clubs are now focusing so much more on infrastructure – analytically and technically – than ever before.For these upcoming friendlies against the USMNT and México, Ecuador won’t have Caicedo, Hincapié and Flamengo’s Gonzalo Plata in order to give them recovery time for their respective clubs as some are dealing with injuries. But it’s still a valuable chance for other members to prove why they deserve a place in next summer’s tournament.Regardless of the availability, Beccacece doesn’t care so much if these are just friendlies or not. In last week’s press conference, he ended it with a call to action and a warning to anyone who might underestimate his team.“We are focused on making the greatest World Cup in the history of the national team,” he said.Luis Miguel Echegaray is a writer, analyst and host specializing in soccer and sports content that also appeals to the U.S. Latino and young audience.

Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.AlgeriaVladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia on Thursday. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another.

Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit.South KoreaKorea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

I arrived with my parents, my agent, a small group, and he came straight to me, sat by me, rolled on the floor at my feet; that was very nice.”It was also the way he would have wanted it, part of the plan. “He’s a bit like yours,” the sporting director, Andrea Berta, offered as Win lent against the midfielder’s legs. Zubimendi’s dog, Lea, hadn’t made it to London – he’s hoping she will soon – but this was a good start. There was a letter from Mikel Merino and a video call from Martin Ødegaard, teammates at Real Sociedad, yet no friendlier face than this. That can help when you’re departing the city you were born in and the club where you have been since you were 12.View image in fullscreenZubimendi’s welcome at Arsenal included meeting Win, Arsenal’s therapy dog.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images“I hadn’t left home yet; going was a radical change,” Zubimendi says, and there is a glimpse of that here, at Las Rozas with theSpainteam, preparing for World Cup qualifiers against Georgia in Elche on Saturday and Bulgaria in Valladolid on Tuesday. When you’re away, he admits, you appreciate these moments even more. “The climate, the language, and above all it’s lovely being with these mates – the atmosphere is great,” Zubimendi says. “But the change was what I was looking for. I didn’t have too many doubts.”Arsenal consider Emirates Stadium expansion to 70,000 capacityRead moreNot any more, not by this summer. A year earlier, Zubimendi had chosen not to leave home, where he has had the same mates since he was three or four. Arne Slot admitted that Liverpool hadtried everything to sign himand he had listened but, unlike his teammates, friends and fellow European champions Robin Le Normand and Merino, he didn’t take the final step. Twelve months on, he did. Why wait? What changed?There is a pause. “When any proposal comes, the first question has to be whether to stay at la Real,” he says. “And it wasn’t the right moment [to go]. I stayed and it was a hard season but I learned a lot. I wanted to step forward, take that weight after others went.” Fans appreciated his staying. “Well, until you do decide to go,” he says, smiling. “But I’ve always tried to choose the right time and I’m happy with how it happened in the end.“I had watched Arsenal and I liked everything I saw, in terms of passion, youth, the feeling you got watching them. And when Mikel Arteta called me … Well, if you’ve ever spoken to him you’ll know that he can beveryconvincing. He’s mad about football, crazy about having everything under control, trying to get something from every little detail. He’s very clear on everything and the proposal he had was the best for me.”The leap wasn’t so great, not once he got the initiation out the way. “The worst thing in football,” he calls it; by his own admission, he is quite reserved, after all. “I had to sing: I did La Bachata, by Manuel Turizo.” And how was it? “Horrible, horrible.”Otherwise, it has gone well, although he misses Lea. Merino and Ødegaard are there. A footballer’s life is similar anywhere, Zubimendi believes, adaptation not so hard. He lives less than 10 minutes from the training ground, north of the city but with London only a train ride away. And he had studied English, even if it’s one thing tothinkyou understand the language and another to turn up and test that. On the pitch, theproposal fit perfectly, going to a different league good for him.View image in fullscreenZubimendi holds off Manchester City’s Erling Haaland during September’s 1-1 draw.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThere is a confidence about him too, born of continuity at the highest level: a stability, a maturity, recognition now too. He will be at the heart of the Spain team this week. He came on at half-time in the final of Euro 2024, with everyone fearing that Rodri’s injury was a disaster – in the directors’ box, one Basque member of the delegation rounded on Spanish colleagues unable to believe that they didn’t have more faith – and ran the game. He scored the champions’first goal back on Spanish soil. And he has started 10 of Spain’s past 11 games.“I always felt that Luis [de la Fuente, the Spain coach] trusted me but when you’re on the pitch [regularly], when you can contribute, you feel more involved in everything. And I do feel that. At half-time, there were nerves for sure. But doubts? None. It also happened so fast, and was so unexpected that I didn’t have time to think. Often the issue is [mental]. There are players who have the level but the hardest thing is taking that step, finding a way to be yourself.”Zubimendi may be the best in the world in a position where even what it is called says something about how it is conceptualised: the defensive or deep midfielder is apivotin Spain, the piece upon which it all hinges. When Rodri got injured, De la Fuente said the City midfielder was thebest in the worldbut, not to worry, he had the second best too. If few followed him then, the debate now may be only about the order. Inside the game, it had already been seen. Slot had little doubt; Arteta had even less. Arsenal’s manager, after all, is from the same city and played for the same team as his new signing: not just Real Sociedad but theirlocal club Antiguoko.View image in fullscreenZubimendi (left) poses with Rodri after Spain’s Euro 2024 final victory over England – his international coach believes the pair are the two best midfielders in the world.Photograph: Pablo GarcíaArsenal, Premier League runners-up three years in a row, a feeling growing that this yearhasto be their year, were determined to build strength in depth. “From what teammates have said to me, the problem was the injuries, that when someone got injured, the team came undone,” Zubimendi says.“This year the club has invested a lot in having two players in every position.” In having different types of solutions, too. As for the 26-year-old, he was the central piece, a qualitative leap towards a title challenge, his profile one they didn’t have.“Actually, I don’t agree with that,” he says. “Because the midfield there was already very strong.”As for the demands of his position, he says: “The pivot has to be someone who is very complete; he has to have the best qualities with the ball and without it, plus the physical capability. He has to be able to do everything. It completes you [to move]. It would be easy to stay in my comfort zone. But I wanted to leave that environment where I was with Real Sociedad and grow in a personal sense, to see another culture, another football.

The mentality is: be a man. Go into clashes hard. It’s more direct. In Spain when you get the ball, it’s more about keeping it; [in England], whenever you win it, it’s straight on to the attack. Transitions are unavoidable, it’s harder to control. But [handling] that is not about ability as such, it’s getting your mind used to it. That’s different to La Liga but the thing that has most struck me is the dead ball, how important it is. I’m seeing loads of goals from that and they’re often what opens up the game.

I have to adapt my play a bit in terms of playing faster, more direct. I’m a pivot, but in this structure I have the chance to take that step forward and Arteta insists a lot that I can play that final pass and make the difference. But I think my profile doesn’t change much.If they have signed me it is because they like what I do. They know this is what I can contribute to the team. If I changed my profile it would be an error.”Brought, like Win, to make everyone else feel better, putting them at ease. “Totally reliable,” in De la Fuente’s words, someone who “thinks more about his teammates than himself,” according to Xabi Alonso,his idol first and his coach later. It’s in the person, and the player. The son of teachers, a little less timid as time passes, he is engaging, warm company but there is no show, no desire to be noticed, just to help.Saka sends Arsenal top with victory over West Ham in Arteta’s 300th gameRead moreAs Spain’s coach put it: “Martín doesn’t get nervous, even if he’s walking along a high-wire without ropes. He’s always so calm, so in control.”“Well, I look like it, at least,” Zubimendi replies, laughing again. Inside, you’re terrified?“No, I try to be calm because I think in that emotional state I’m going to make better decisions. When it comes to the ‘caffeine’ level I’m cautious.Overstimulation isn’t good. I’m naturally calm. Away from football, too, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see me out of control or overexcited. But it’s also the confidence and trust I have in my teammates that gives me the tranquillity to know we’ll be fine.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalSpaininterviewsShareReuse this content"

Tracking back? Not for us, thanks. Too many wanted to do their own thing and itground Tuchel down in the end. The German is a coach who wants structure, identity, sacrifice and energy. At PSG, though, he saw how individualism can bring a dressing room down. How could Tuchel make his mark when he had players who would moan if a teammate looked at them the wrong way?And so to the question of England, celebrity and the power of the collective. It was with a good sense of timing that Steven Gerrard analysed the failures of the“egotistical losers” of the golden generationthis week. Club rivalries were a problem and the English obsession with star names was a hindrance. It is not a surprise that Tuchel, unafraid to risk bruising the odd ego or two, wants to create something different as he plots how to end England men’s long wait for a trophy at next summer’s World Cup.‘The stadium was silent’: Tuchel critical of England support during Wales winRead more“We are building the best team” has been a regular refrain from Tuchel over the past week. There has been no backtrackingover the omission of Jude Bellingham, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden. “The radical statement is that we don’t collect the most talented players,” Tuchel said beforeEngland’s friendly victory against Waleson Thursday. “We collect the guys who have the glue and cohesion to be the best team.”Tuchel’s career offers pointers about his apparent power play with Bellingham. Having Neymar, Kylian Mbappé and Edinson Cavani at his disposal did not make PSG stronger in the crunch Champions League games, and there were problems at Bayern Munich with certain key players. At Chelsea, though, Tuchel’s greatest triumph –winning the Champions League in 2021– came with a counterattacking and defensively brilliant team. The key player during that run was N’Golo Kanté. Thiago Silva, a model professional, and the selfless, counterpressing Mason Mount were also vital.Chelsea were defiant, unflinching. WithEngland, Tuchel’s mission is to forge a brotherhood. He shrugged off questions about whether leaving out his best creative players before the Wales game was a gamble too far. He backed his calls and was rewarded when England destroyed Craig Bellamy’s side with goals from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka during a brutal first half.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel won the Champions League with a Chelsea team that were defensively solid and threatening on the counter.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAWe are starting to see Tuchel’s England take shape. Dynamic full-backs overlap, there is pace on the flanks (a crucial element if Harry Kane is to thrive at the World Cup) and balance is provided by Elliot Anderson’s emerging midfield partnership with Declan Rice. “We are getting there,” Tuchel said after the 3-0 win. “In Serbia it looked like club football and today it looked like club football.”Leaving aside whether England will be able to replicate the physicality of a Premier League style in the heat expected at many of the venues in the US, Mexico and Canada, it is worth considering the role of Rogers in the position usually occupied by Bellingham. “A humble player, a physical player … a very talented player,” was Tuchel’s verdict on the 23-year-old. More talented than Bellingham, though? Obviously not. Nobody doubts Bellingham’s ability. The 22-year-old is one of the best in the world. How do you leave out a player who, with disaster fast approaching, can keep his team in a tournament with alast-minute overhead kick?The answer lies in looking at the wider picture; in remembering that Bellingham was often playing his own game at Euro 2024. Tuchel calls him a special talent. But while he haswithdrawn the infamous “repulsive” remark, he has not taken back what he said about Bellingham needing to channel his edge towards his opponents and not to intimidating teammates or referees. None of this feels accidental. Pointing to Bellingham only just returning from shoulder surgery is convenient. Tuchel has talked about players needing to accept “the hierarchy within the team”. After the Wales game he said the door is open for “top quality, top characters” to return.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bellingham can come back but if he does there will be no special treatment. It is a fascinating situation. The smart money remains on Bellingham going to the World Cup but Tuchel has created a world in which he stays at home. The challenge is balancing the pros and cons. Bellingham would undoubtedly be an asset if he accepts Tuchel’s tactical demands and does not try to win the tournament on his own.But this is not going to be the Bellingham team. If anything this is still the Kane team. The captain reports for duty every time, fulfils his media duties without complaint and leads by example. Vincent Kompany, Kane’s manager at Bayern, talks about the forward’s work ethic off the ball. The goals are inevitable; the effort out of possession sets the standard for others to follow.This is what Tuchel craves. He would not be drawn into imagining whether he could possibly leave Bellingham, Foden and Cole Palmer on the bench in a World Cup game. He threw the focus on to the players who are performing for him now. England have played well without Bellingham in successive fixtures. Tuchel is fashioning a team, with Rogers as an updated version of Mount. His time at Bayern and PSG showed him what happens when it is every man for himself.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is understood Pezzolano and his staff were surprised and dismayed, having secured successive league victories at Vicarage Road after a slow start to the season.Watford sack Pezzolano after 10 games and bring back Gracia as managerRead moreSources close to Pezzolano’s staff have alleged that his reluctance in his final three weeks to select players linked to Bayat resulted in him becoming the 11th managerWatfordhave moved on from since the start of 2020. The players are understood to include the former France midfielder Moussa Sissoko, who is represented by Bayat’s agency, and the Danish forward Luca Kjerrumgaard and Belgian forward Pierre Dwomoh, who joined in the summer in deals brokered by Bayat.It is understood Pezzolano was never directly told he must select certain players, but sources close to the Uruguayan have told the Guardian that he and his staff were regularly questioned by senior executives, including the sporting director, Gianluca Nani, and his deputy, Valon Behrami, about why some were not used more.Sissoko started the first five league games, each as captain, but only one of Pezzolano’s final four matches and was an unused substitute once. Kjerrumgaard’s use by the coach was identical. Dwomoh was initially unavailable because of a thigh injury and returned with an hour for the under-21s on 29 September. He did not make the first-team squad for either of the games that have followed.“Around the club, the different persons who are there would say: ‘Why is this player not playing or this one or the other? He has to play, he is better,’” the source said. “After each match, when Paulo didn’t bring on a player they would always say something and it was always a player linked to this agent [Bayat]. I think they decided to sack them for this reason because the recent results had been good.”View image in fullscreenMoussa Sissoko started Watford’s first five league games but only one of the four since.Photograph: Toyin Oshodi/ProSports/ShutterstockBayat was the registered intermediary on four of Watford’s transfers last season, including Dwomoh’s move from Antwerp, according to the Football Association’s records. It is alleged he was seen at the club’s training ground in Hertfordshire on at least three occasions while Pezzolano was in charge. Bayat has strongly denied the claims that he has any influence on team selection at Watford.“Such involvement from agents is not standard practice within a professional club,” added the source close to Pezzolano. “Paulo consistently demanded higher standards across all areas. His approach was rooted in full commitment and accountability. When he realised that some of the club’s priorities were not purely football-related, he made it clear to the ownership that he could not work under those conditions.”Those familiar with the situation at Watford have denied Pezzolano was under pressure to pick any player linked to Bayat or otherwise and insist he was given free rein in team selection and tactics. They say Bayat, who lives in Italy, has visited the training ground twice since April and attended three matches this season.Bayat has been facing charges in Belgium that include money laundering and fraud, having been arrested in 2018 as part of the Operation Clean Hands investigation that led to 57 administrators, referees and coaches in Belgium being summoned to appear in court. Bayat was released on conditional bail and has denied all the charges, which also include conspiracy and the suspected forging of documents in several transfers, but is yet to stand trial and it is unclear whether the case will come to court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also claimed some players were unconvinced by his ability to get the best out of a squad many at the club believe is the strongest since they were relegated in 2022.“We wish Paulo the very best in his career and thank him for his efforts. We are extremely comfortable with the decision we have taken and the appointment of Javi Gracia,” said Watford chair and chief executive, Scott Duxbury. “Javi brings stability to the club, is an excellent communicator and has made an immediate connection with the players in his desire for unity, harmony and mutual respect. We fully expect the squad to respond positively to those qualities.”The source close to Pezzolano’s camp said: “In any squad of 30 players, there will always be some who are unhappy with limited playing time – that is part of football. However, the core group responsible for the team’s recent performances was united, motivated and increasingly optimistic. After his dismissal, Paulo received numerous messages from players thanking him and his staff for their work and dedication.”They have also claimed that the high-pressure environment at Watford, who have had 22 managers since the Pozzo family bought the club in the summer of 2012, made it difficult to fulfil their ambitions. “Everyone is under a lot of pressure to get results and it’s not a happy place to work,” said the source. “It’s hard to achieve the goal of promotion because it is very difficult to implement your ideas with so much interference from outside.”Explore more on these topicsWatfordChampionshipFootball LeagueShareReuse this content"

Gary Neville may not be Orwell but he is a very English type of patriotBarney RonayAn easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy, Neville has at least tried to address an issue that has everything to do with aggressively flag-draped and militarised modern sportFri 10 Oct 2025 12.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShare“At the far end of the food counter a group of men were pledging allegiance to the flag, with trays balanced in one hand, in order to be allowed to take seats at the table. A group that had arrived earlier was singing The Star-Spangled Banner in order that they might use the salt and pepper and ketchup there.”Welcome to our own Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, another real-time demonstration of the fact every satirical absurdity described in Catch-22 has become, yeah, pretty much totally plausible. The nation is now fully hostage to bad actors and phoney rage. And as ever football must act as a key amplifier of all this, a public echo chamber for the anxieties of what we must, out of a sense of duty, still call the real world.Gary Neville says he took down union flag being ‘used in a negative fashion’Read moreIt took eight minutes for the crowd at Wembley on Thursday night to demonstrate that they have finally moved on from chanting Keir Starmer is a wanker. Instead they chantedGary Nevilleis a wanker. Two days earlier Joey Barton, who exists in the public consciousness solely because of football, published a video to his 2.7 million X followers in which he said he would punch a disabled person in a wheelchair if they suggested a union flag should not be flown over a building site.To be fair, this does seem an unlikely scenario. Perhaps there could be an interim stage where the two of them try to have a chat about it first. But no. Joey would rather cut straight to the real business of violently vetting disabled people for patriotism, out there furiously overturning wheelchairs like Indiana Jones weaving through the souk looking for Marion inside a laundry basket. Sometimes, you just get the heroes you need.Here are two pretty sound ideas. First, if anyone ever asks you to take a flag seriously, they’re immediately to be distrusted. A flag is just some colours. A flag has no inherent fixed meaning. Flags are groupthink, a suspension of independent thought. The civil rights movement wasn’t defined by a flag. The fall of the Berlin Wall didn’t have a flag. The peace movement didn’t have a flag, just flowers, hair and chauvinistic sex.And second, there are few things more un-English than brandishing the flag like a weapon. For this reason alone I am proud of Gary Neville forspeaking up this week about flags, for trying to make the point that it is un-patriotically un-English to go around insisting on English patriotism.View image in fullscreenThe reaction to Gary Neville’s video message about flags and patriotism shows he was on to something, even if he did not articulate it well.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianNeville is of course an easy target for accusations of luxury hypocrisy. He can be a doofus and a chop, thehammer of Qatarwho will also work for the state broadcaster at Qatar’s propaganda World Cup, a Lineker-level degree of cognitive dissonance.And yes, in his speech Neville rambled widely, exposing the contradictions of pretty much every fixed position you may choose to take right now. He should also have condemned acts of Islamic terrorism, something people on the left often seem unable to do. He shouldn’t have focused solely on “angry white middle-aged men” in the wake of a double murder at a synagogue.It is also a ducking of what he seemed to want to say. Which was to talk specifically aboutNigel Farage, who does need to be challenged openly, who is a deeply cynical threat to the public discourse, a campy and theatrical nihilist posing as a Real Person, who uses fear and division to manipulate people into voting for him.But I am still proud of Neville for speaking up. It is good that a sportsperson is addressing this, an actual issue in his hometown, and doing so with genuine feeling, unafraid of the violent reaction that will follow. This is his parish. He is an angry middle-aged white man, and has spent a lot of time around flags. For all his easily gotcha-contradictions Neville feels it, is well- intentioned and is worth a million Farages. And while it is easy to say Stick To Sport VAR-boy, the reality is this has everything to do with sport, a place that has been aggressively flag-draped and militarised, where even a radio interview in midweek with the deeply mild Chris Woakes ended with the phrase “Thank you for your service” as though Woakes has been out there killing the Taliban for the last 10 years.Above all the reaction to Neville’s video message proved he was on to something. Before long a Traitor Scum banner had appeared outside Old Trafford. On the internet Neville was pilloried over old video clips of him not singing God Save the Queen, a genuine moment of salt and pepper flag-pledge madness.The Daily Telegraph has had a permanent hate-erection for the last four days, and can only be a small step away from giving away Gary Neville wicker dolls for your children to burn with its weekend editions. Rumour has it four leader writers have already been hospitalised by rage.Most tellingly the same paper published a response from Farage that suggested Neville should be fired by his private sector employer for not wanting to fly a flag, an idea so absurd, so unpatriotic, so wilfully ignorant, it seems impossible nobody inside this mighty engine of English free speech didn’t feel uneasy about projecting it as a serious political message.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hesaid the messaging is getting dangerous. He said Brexit has had a terrible effect (see: the steel industry). He said we shouldn’t be pulled right and left. He said we must stop promoting abusive hate speech. He said he had ordered one of his building sites to take down a union flag because they had never previously flown one, and, like, it’s also just a building site.The best thing he said was that “the union flag being used in a negative fashion is not right”, something that is, intentionally or not, very George Orwell in its understanding of patriotism. Orwell gets marched around the place in a headlock all the time these days, dragged randomly into every debate. But he knew about symbols and flags and about Englishness and its values.View image in fullscreenFlags are prevalent at sporting events these days, but George Orwell said that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging was a key ingredient of English resilience and character.Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty ImagesIn The Lion and the Unicorn, a love letter in support of the war against German fascism, he writes that a lack of reflexive flag-wagging is a key ingredient of English resilience and character. He speaks with pride and affection of the fact “the working man’s heart does not leap when he sees a union jack”, that “the patriotism of the common people is not vocal or even conscious”, and thatEnglandis above all a compromise, “a strange mixture of reality and illusion, democracy and privilege, humbug and decency”.Neville is groping for something similar, the fact the best kind of freedom is the freedom not to give two hoots about a square of fabric, or browbeating notions of patriotism. Pointedly, Orwell also preaches vigilance, the need to let your heritage grow and change, that England “has to be true to herself”, and that “she is not being true to herself while the refugees who have come to our shores are penned up in concentration camps”.Famously Orwell also hated sport because of its weaponising of nationalism, its glorification of physical victory, and has been proved right in this now more than ever before. England football didn’t traditionally have flags in it right through to the 1980s, when they would occasionally appear daubed with National Front slogans. Right now the last two hosts of the men’s World Cup, and also the next one, are involved in a bloody conflict of some kind. Orwell was half right. Sport is now war plus the shooting.There are two last things worth saying. Neville may be correct in his sense of a more nuanced idea of traditional English patriotism. But he is also out of time. The hive mind, shout-politics, algorithm life have trampled over lots of things. The idea that the best kind of Englishness can stay separate from this seems out of date. Britain itself is more than ever like a strange, small, damp archipelago marooned at the jumping-off point between the continents.On the other hand, it doesn’t mean this is fixed either. In Catch-22, The Great Loyalty Oath Crusade comes to an end when the largely silent Major de Coverley walks into the mess hall, scowls at the absurdity of flag-hugging and anthem-singing, and says three words: “Give Everybody Eat.” At which point the whole thing evaporates in its own absurdity. Someone has to say something, and keep saying it, however garbled or easily shot down. Neville may not be our George Orwell. But he is, for all his contradictions, a very English type of patriot.Explore more on these topicsGary NevilleEnglandJoey BartonNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Recruitment aside, one of Wilson’s first tasks in the role will be attempting to persuade Sandro Tonali to sign a new, improved contract, extending the Italy midfielder’s existing deal beyond 2028.Rangers condemn ‘shameful’ attack on Smith statue; Tuchel criticises England fans: football – liveRead moreEddie Howe has advocated for Wilson’s appointment sincePaul Mitchell stood downas Newcastle’s sporting director in June. It is understood the Scot is no longer performing an active role at Forest after agreeing to succeed Mitchell earlier this week.Prising Ross – who was part of the visiting contingent asNewcastle beat Ange Postecoglou’s sideat St James’ Park last Sunday – out of the City Ground has proved slow and complicated, particularly as Forest’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis was extremely reluctant to lose the highly regarded 41-year-old. Wilson may have feared the prospect of Edu treading on his toes after Marinakis hired Arsenal’s former sporting director as Forest’s global head of football this summer.After arriving in the East Midlands from Glasgow, where he had previously shone in an administrative role at Rangers, Wilson played a big part in shaping Forest’s recruitment strategy, while also supervising upgrades of the club’s academy, women’s team, medical department and general infrastructure. It did not go unnoticed that Wilson’s influence helped persuade key signings, including Elliot Anderson, Anthony Elanga, Nikola Milenkovic and Callum Hudson-Odoi to join Forest.Elanga was sold to Newcastle for £55m this summer, the deal representing a healthy profit on a player who cost Forest a relatively modest £13.5m when he joined from Manchester United in July 2023. Newcastle have traditionally been poor sellers and it is hoped Wilson will improve this aspect of their recruitment operation.He will become Newcastle’s third sporting director in two years and there is confidence at the club that he will remain in situ for considerably longer than his two immediate predecessors. While Mitchell never really bonded with Howe, Dan Ashworth’s head was turned by an offer from Manchester United.Wilson is expected to be heavily involved with the women’s team and plans for a new training ground. The idea is that he will enjoy a collaborative relationship with Howe that involves Newcastle’s manager having a final say on all signings and outgoings. Howe’s nephew, Andy Howe, is expected to continue to in a senior recruitment role.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is also the reason that, should Steve Clarke guide his country to the World Cup, the demand will be thatScotlandmake a proper impact rather than suffer the same miserable fate of the past two European championships. There is Scott McTominay, Andy Robertson and Billy Gilmour after all. Those demanding utopia ignore the third-choice goalkeeper at Nottingham Forest, Angus Gunn, and that the most reliable goal threat, Lyndon Dykes, is not guaranteed a start at Birmingham City.Another reality is that Scotland have not topped a World Cup qualifying section since they progressed to Spain 82. It would be bold to assert Clarke’s men will repeat that feat more than four decades on, but they suddenly have a huge opportunity. Victory over Belarus at Hampden Park on Sunday evening – and if they cannot achieve that, they do not deserve to feature in a World Cup – would take them to within two games of glory.If Scotland take three points and Denmark defeat Greece, a playoff spot will be secure. All evidence, though, is that they should aim higher. Their consistency is highlighted by only three losses in 23 World Cup qualifying games. A dozen years have passed since Scotland were beaten in a World Cup qualifier at Hampden. The variation in strength of playoff opposition provides an element of risk Scotland would rather avoid.Ferguson is Scotland’s hero as they fight back to steal vital victory over GreeceRead moreBashfulness was a backdrop to the3-1 defeat of Greece on Thursdaythat left Scotland level with Denmark at the summit of Group C. Greece could scarcely believe they lost, let alone by two goals. Yet in a truncated qualifying section, with the making of history on the line, Scotland have no reason to dwell on an underwhelming display. “Sometimes you don’t get what you deserve in football and sometimes you get a little bit more than you deserve,” said Clarke. “Football is a 96- or 97-minute game now. You have to work your way into it and control the game in your bad moments.”Scotland have been the victims of poor fortune, such as during their last World Cup attempt when the necessary rescheduling of a playoff game against Ukraine hampered them far more than Clarke was ever going to admit. As Greece pick through the bones of a hugely damaging result in Glasgow, a key element was that their centre-forward could not tap into an empty net from six yards. The Greece coach, Ivan Jovanovic, to his credit, dismissed any sense of lucky Scots when given opportunity to highlight that.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke admitted: ‘Sometimes you don’t get what you deserve in football,’ after the win over Greece.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersBut for a lack of efficiency in front of goal, Scotland would have opened their campaign with a win in Copenhagen. The point collected there looks increasingly decent given subsequent Danish displays.Greece’s role and attitude in this group is intriguing: they could help Scotland’s quest for automatic qualification by puncturing Denmark on Sunday. Yet if they do, they will also have much to play for when Scotland visit Athens next month. Greece are so erratic that it is impossible to call how their fixtures will go.Scotland will need to reshuffle against a Belarus team who have shipped 13 goals in three games. Lewis Ferguson and Ryan Christie are suspended and Aaron Hickey has an injury. Gilmour is certain to come into the midfield. There is a strong case for adding Dykes to the attack. Ben Gannon-Doak endured a frustrating evening against Greece but is worth persisting with for a match Scotland need to play firmly on the front foot. Denmark, who visit Glasgow to close the section, are five goals better off than Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A batch of the group seem acutely aware this is not only their best but perhaps their last chance to reach a World Cup. Dykes, John McGinn, Robertson, Christie and Grant Hanley are 30 or older. Clarke is on his leaving tour, with all expectation that he will call time whenever this World Cup run ends. Scotland’s manager has been underappreciated; if he becomes the first man to guide the country to three major finals, his legacy would be secure. Clarke would also become more appealing in the eyes of clubs.“Can the fans start to dream?” Clarke said as dust settled on the Greece clash. “They can do what they want; they normally do. Am I starting to dream? No, you know me better than that.”Indeed we do. All eyes are on Belarus. It just feels impossible not to ponder what follows.Explore more on these topicsScotlandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not against aNewcastleteam who surrendered so meekly during the opening 40 minutes that this clash was anything but the feisty northern derby it had been billed.Alex Sanderson’s side were 31-0 up and in total control at half-time after running in five tries, before adding another four after the break in front of a paltry 5,785 crowd. There will be far greater challenges forSale. There has to be. It cannot always be this easy.Exeter’s Brown-Bampoe in the fast lane for great things for club and countryRead moreStill, for Sanderson the nine-try blitz was a welcome antidote to last week’s defeat at champions Bath and a reminder of Sale’s strength on home soil with a second bonus-point victory of the season in Salford. For England coach Steve Borthwick, there were also plenty of reasons for optimism from a Sale perspective, with winger Tom Roebuck claiming centre stage with a clinical hat-trick.“Tom has been training with a sprint coach down at Loughborough and that’s not just him – a few of the squad go down,” said Sanderson. “It looked like it showed with how he stepped in off the right foot coming infield. I don’t think he’d hit his straps so far this season, so there were conversations with him this week about him actually stepping up. He trained really well and goes and performs like that.”For Newcastle, still in the early throes of their post-Red Bull takeover reconstruction, this was another night to forget as they slumped to a third straight defeat. They lie in familiar territory at the bottom of the table and have already conceded a whopping 134 points.Coach Alan Dickens defended his players after their abject first-half display, saying: “I would never question their desire. Every time they step on the field they put their bodies on the line.”View image in fullscreenSale’s Nathan Jibulu, advancing past the challenge of Newcastle’s Tom Gordon, made another big impact after coming on.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images for Sale SharksSale were missing the Curry twins through injury but Luke Cowan-Dickie made his first appearance since featuring in the British and Irish Lions’ summer tour of Australia.The England hooker will hope to feature in next month’s autumn internationals along with the likes of Joe Carpenter, Roebuck, George Ford, Bevan Rodd and Asher Opoku-Fordjour. They also started against Newcastle and quickly made their mark as Sale steamrollered into a ludicrously easy half-time lead.Borthwick is also keen to secure the services of Sale defensive guru Byron McGuigan for England’s autumn campaign and negotiations are continuing with the RFU.McGuigan prowled the touchline as Rob du Preez dived over from close range for the opening try before Roebuck scored his first after driving through the heart of a leaden-footed Newcastle defence.The Red Bulls struggled to escape their 22-metre line and, after centre Max Clark was sinbinned for persistent offending, Cowan-Dickie bustled over from close range for Sale’s third.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That drew a cheer from the small band of travelling supporters but normal service was soon resumed when Roebuck glided his way through another defensive gap to score his second.Replacement Nathan Jibulu then showed his growing importance to Sale with his third Prem try in as many games this season before brilliantly setting up Reed for his second.The hooker burst down the right flank and then showed intelligence to find Reed and the speedy winger did the rest to complete his brace before Roebuck squeezed over for his hat-trick score at the death.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbySaleNewcastleRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

All eight games in the semi-finals and final were halved, some in perfunctory fashion, as the GMs implicitly refused to risk their classical rating points and preferred to decide the event in rapid and blitz. The victor of the prestigious Sinquefield Cup, Wesley So, did not qualify for São Paulo.After winning in Brazil, Caruana flew to Arlington, Texas, for a USA v India match whose format was designed to bring chess into the sports mainstream. Its participants included women champions, influencers, and prodigies as well as top grandmasters.The time limit was just 10 minutes per player per game, with a one second per move bonus in the final minute. Draw offers were banned, as were resignations. Halved games were replayed with five minutes each, then with one minute. The US had White in all games, with the rationale that India would have White in a future return series on home ground.The audience in the Arlington Esports arena was encouraged to cheer and be noisy. Caruana opened with 1 c3 against the world No 4, Arjun Erigaisi, took control, and said afterwards: “The crowd knew I was winning, so I was happy to hear all the noise.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their third game was a rare case of one-minute bullet played over the board. Bullet is a familiar format in online chess, with regular tournaments and an annual championship, but it hardly ever happens across the board due to the hazards of knocked over pieces.Nakamura v Gukesh provided a frantic scramble of moves, at the end of which Nakamura grabbed his opponent’s king, stood up, and threw the checkmated monarch into the cheering crowd. Is this the future of international chess? Not very likely …It was also a successful weekend for English players and England teams in Rabac, Croatia, where GM John Nunn, 70, won the silver medal at the European over-65 championship with an unbeaten 7/9 score. Nunn had previously won gold in 2023, but the Georgian GM, Zurab Sturua, retained his title from 2024 by a superior tie-break.Nunn led by half a point at the start of the final round, but in one of his books he had identified last round nerves as a recurring weakness, and he opted for a complex drawing line against the Najdorf Sicilian. John Piggott finished fourth with 6.5/9, while Nunn’s wife, Petra Fink-Nunn, won bronze in the women’s over-50 championship with an unbeaten 6/9.In one of Nunn’s best wins, he smoothly and instructivelyoutplayed his Dutch opponentin a bishops of opposite colours ending.3993:1…Qd8! threatens both 2…Bb4+ winning the queen (White’s d5 knight is pinned) and 2…Qxd5+ and 3…Qxh1 when Black is two pawns up.

Tuchel’s stated aim is to build the best team, not collect the best talents, and his hand was strengthened by ­England excelling without Bellingham, Foden and the injured Cole Palmer in their3-0 friendly win over Waleson Thursday.England embrace a new frontier but Tuchel must be wary of hope and glory | Barney RonayRead moreThe German’s rationale is clear: he loved the spirit during last month’s camp and has seen no reason to make sweeping changes. At the same time, though, Tuchel is not ruling out the possibility of those who missed out this time returning next month for qualifiers against Serbia and Albania.“At the moment, it is only about the players who are in camp,” he said. “The competition is on. They deserve it also. And I am still ­absolutely ­convinced the guys who were in Serbia and against Andorra last camp deserve to be in this camp. This is where the focus has to be. They deserve the respect and they put out another great ­performance.“The door is always open for ­anyone to jump in. [Against Wales] we had four changes from the match in Serbia. We were forced to do four changes but it was seamless and ­everyone who started played with the same energy. We only had one and a half days to prepare so I am happy with the camp. Happy that we can prove another point. Next camp is the next nomination.”It was put to Tuchel that his logic in rewarding those who are ­performing for him now will make it hard for outcasts to earn recalls. “Let’s play a second game and then we decide,” he replied. “The nomination comes and then there is always an open door for top quality, top characters. We are in October now so we go step by step.”Tuchel was asked whether he could imagine putting Bellingham, Foden and Palmer on the bench at the World Cup. “You think too much,” he said. “You imagine too much. I am sorry but I don’t follow that mindset. With all of this I would say: ‘Let’s cross the river when we are at the river.’ It does not help anyone if we think in bubbles about what can happen and about what cannot happen.”Declan Rice, the captain against Wales, believes the big names will return. “Every time you play for ­England, you want to grab the shirt, you want to grab your chance,” the midfielder said. “But we do miss Jude, for sure. We miss Phil, we miss Cole, we miss loads of players for ­reasons that the manager’s ­obviously said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s not get away from that. What they’ve done in an England shirt is incredible. We’re looking forward to having them back next camp hopefully.”England would secure ­qualification if they beat Latvia in Riga on Tuesday and Serbia do not take maximum points against ­Albania on Saturday and Andorra on Tuesday. Harry Kane believes he will be fit to return from a minor foot injury and Ollie Watkins is confident he will be ready despite being forced off after colliding with a post against Wales.Tuchel sought to play down his comments about England’s fansnot being loud enoughduring the Wales game. The Football Association has sometimes taken the team round the country but Tuchel will not oppose Wembley hosting warm-up friendlies in March. “Don’t make a big thing out of it,” he said. “I am pretty sure we will play here.

According to some reports his entire series could even be in jeopardy.England beware: terminally obsessed Marnus Labuschagne has gone back to basics | Jonathan LiewRead moreAndrew McDonald, Australia’s head coach, looked to temper those fears on Friday but conceded that, with his captain needing at least “four, four and a half weeks” of bowling in the nets to get ready – something that is yet to get under way – it is getting “tight”.For Brook, whose England white-ball side fly to New Zealand this weekend in advance of the Ashes tour, the loss of a quick who has dominated recent encounters – including notable success against Joe Root – would clearly be significant.“Obviously he is an amazing bowler and has been for many years; he bowls at high pace with high skill,” said Brook, speaking at the Toyota Professional Cricketers’ Association Awards on Thursday. “With him out of their side for the first game, from [the reports] we’ve seen, hopefully that plays into our hands.“But they have a hell of a lot of good, quick bowlers out there. Guys who can come into the side and, when their tails are up, they can plough through teams. So we can’t take anybody lightly.”Scott Boland is the likeliest quick to replace Cummins and, having claimed 49 Test wickets on Australian soil at an average of 12.6, any drop-off with the ball should in theory be minimal. Thereafter Australia’s fast bowler stocks are untested, reflecting close to a decade of dominance by Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.Quick GuideCox and Lamb win awardsShowJordan Cox and Emma Lamb were the big winners at the Professional Cricketers' Association annual awards in partnership with Toyota, whille Davina Perrin and Rehan Ahmed were also recognised as rising stars of the game.After a prolific season with Essex and Hundred winners Oval Invincibles, Cox beat Test star Joe Root, Dom Sibley and Ed Barnard to be named Toyota PCA men's player of the year in a ceremony at London's White City on Thursday night.Cox, who is preparing for England's T20 series in New Zealand later this month and will also shadow the Ashes squad with the Lions, said: \"It's an honour for the players to vote for me, when it's your peers and your team-mates that really means the world. On the Lions trip I want to show the selectors I'm capable of playing Test cricket.\"I've got a crazy busy winter and there's a T20 World Cup coming up so hopefully if I continue performing I might get a chance.\"Lancashire batter Lamb, currently in Sri Lanka at the World Cup, claimed the Toyota PCA women's player of the year ahead of her captain, Nat Sciver-Brunt, as well as Georgia Elwiss and last year's winner Kathryn Bryce.Speaking at the PCA Awards in partnership with Toyota, she said: \"It was nice to find out I had won after our second game in the World Cup, so it was great timing. I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of weeks to see what we can achieve.\"The young player prizes went to Perrin, who lit up the Hundred with a stunning 42-ball century for champions Northern Superchargers, and Ahmed, whose career-best season helped Leicestershire to the Division Two title in the Rothesay County Championship.\"It's almost surreal, I'd never played in front of crowds as big as in The Hundred and when you've got a great team around you it makes it even more special,\" said Perrin.Ahmed, who took his batting to a new level with five first-class hundreds, also set his sights on higher honours after missing out on Ashes selection.He said: \"My red-ball season was great and I want to be a regular in the England team - it's more important to me than the white-ball stuff, so being given the opportunity to perform and then repaying the coaches with my form for Leicestershire has been great.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Matt Roberts/ICCWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.While Australia sweat on Cummins, England are growing increasingly confident that Ben Stokes will be ready from the start of the series following the shoulder injury that ruled him out of the fifth Test against India. The all-rounder has now returned to full training and has been building up his bowling both with Durham and at Loughborough.The question of Stokes’s fitness is particularly acute for Brook, having replaced Ollie Pope as vice-captain for this tour and thus an injury away from leading the team for the first time in an away Ashes Test. Part of his role as consigliere will be to step in when Stokes is attempting one of his marathon spells and potentially prevent this from happening.Brook said: “It’s an honour to have any leadership role. But it’s not something that I’m biting at the bit to do. If you want it too much, then it’s not a good thing. And I see Stokesy playing all five Tests, if I’m being honest. I think he’ll power through even if he has a little niggle.“Everybody in the world knows what he’s like, his character and the way that he just cracks on. That is the way that the team is built now; everybody keeps going. If you do have a little niggle, just power through – and that is what he does so well.“Because he wants to bowl long spells, that can sometimes be to his detriment. But he told us last year as a group that if he gets into a position like that again, then go up and have a word with him.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 26-year-old suspected it was coming his way and says he and Pope have been in contact since.“I dropped him a couple of messages a couple of weeks ago, talking about golf mainly,” said Brook. “I don’t think he’s too bothered; he’s just happy to still be in the squad. He is a vital part of the team, batting at No 3, and we all know how valuable his runs are.”As regards his own runs, once six white-ball internationals in New Zealand are out of the way, Brook will be playing his first red-ball cricket in Australia. A spell with Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League in 2021-22 returned only 44 runs from seven innings – an experience Brook described as going “horrendously” and one he is “trying to erase” from his memory.Brook added: “I haven’t had too much experience of the pitches out there, so I have to stay in the moment as much as possible and play what’s in front of me.“I don’t know what I’m stepping into. I know [an away Ashes] is a massive thing but I’m still trying to get over that India series. To play 25 days out of 25 days was mega. That was the most intense series I’ve ever been part of. If the Ashes tops that, I will be a very happy man.”Asked if England will be returning home with the urn, Brook replied: “I bloody hope so”.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025 - 26Harry BrookEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It could be the US. It could beGreta Thunberg.Over the past month, Thiel has hosted a series of four lectures on the downtown waterfront of San Francisco philosophizing about who the antichrist could be and warning that Armageddon is coming. Thiel, who describes himself as a “small-o orthodox Christian”, believes the harbinger of the end of the world could already be in our midst and that things such as international agencies, environmentalism and guardrails on technology could quicken its rise. It is a remarkable discursion that reveals the preoccupations of one of the most influential people inSilicon Valleyand the US.Peter Thiel’s off-the-record antichrist lectures reveal more about him than ArmageddonRead more“A basic definition of the antichrist: some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil,” Thiel said, kicking off his first lecture. “What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation of antichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the end times.”TimelinePeter Thiel's lectures on the antichrist, summarizedShowPeter Thiel divided his four lectures on the antichrist under loose banners of subject matter. After listening to recordings of his off-the-record talks, the Guardian has summarized each lecture by synthesizing them into a format easier to follow than his meandering musings. The timeline below consists of the title of each lecture, the question Thiel is attempting to answer within it, and the conclusion he comes to, accompanied by representative quotes.15 September 2025Lecture 1: “Knowledge shall be increased”Question:What is the antichrist’s relationship to Armageddon?Answer:The antichrist, whom Thiel believes is some sort of evil tyrant, will come to power by constantly talking about the existential threats of technology and science to the world. They will use this prognostication to gain some type of unifying global power and force the complete stagnation of technological and scientific progress which he says is already stagnant.Quote:“The antichrist comes to power by talking constantly about Armageddon, about rumours of wars and scaring you into giving him control over science and technology,\" said Thiel.\"We have sort of an answer in late modernity, which is that the antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon non-stop. Matthew 24:6: ‘You shall hear of wars and rumours of wars.’ If you think of it not in the timelessly eternal but in the one-time world historical way, it's sequence. The rumors come after the wars or they're escalations from the wars. In some ways, we got the answer already in Los Alamos,” he said.22 September 2025Lecture 2: “Empire and the antichrist’s relation to government”Question:What kinds of government are antichrist-like in nature?Quote:“Last time I talked about Daniel 12:4 – ’knowledge shall be increased in the end times.’ Tonight I will explore the other half of this prophecy, that ‘many shall run to and fro,’ which I read, much like Francis Bacon did, as a prophecy about globalization, empire, and the dangers of a one-world state,” Thiel said.Answer:There are several forms of either anti-science, pro-science, anti-Christian or pro-Christian governments represented in literature that show the various forms that an antichrist-like government can take. These dynamics change throughout modern history. He zeros in on four books: Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’s Watchmen, and Eiichiro Oda’s manga One Piece, which embody various stances in favor of or against science and Christianity.Quote:“You can at least identify the antichrist in literature. I'm going to try to illustrate this change in history through these four books,” said Thiel.29 September 2025Lecture 3: “How one person can take over the world and the velocity at which that person has to move to do so”Question:How can the antichrist, a single mortal person, achieve world domination?Answer:They can do it if they’re young – or – get rich young, since “money has this remarkable velocity”.Quote:“Tonight, I’ll continue this investigation by asking the seemingly narrow question of the velocity of the antichrist. What I mean by that is: the Bible says that one man will take over the entire world. He only has one lifetime to do that. How on earth can he achieve that?”6 October 2025Lecture 4: “The new Rome”Question:Where today might we find the antichrist's new Roman Empire?Answer:According to the Bible, the Roman Empire served as thekatechon, or the place that will restrain an antichrist figure, and provided law and order, which in turn prevented or delayed the coming of the apocalypse. Thiel says the modern-day katechon is likely in America. One possibility is San Francisco, partly because of its distance from Washington DC, which would make it harder for there to be a fusion of too many powers like the federal government and the technology industry. Ironically, though, he says America is also likely the place with the most markings of a future one-world order.Quote:\"It's just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate for katechon and antichrist, ground zero of the one-world state, ground zero of the resistance to the one-world state.”Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thiel was on the forefront of conservative politics long before the rest ofSilicon Valley took a rightward turnwithDonald Trump’s second term as president. He’s had close ties to Trump for nearly a decade, iscreditedwith catapultingJD Vanceinto the office of vice-president, and isbankrollingRepublicans’ 2026 midterm campaigns. Making his early fortune as a co-founder of PayPal, he has personally contributed to Facebook as its first outside investor, as well as to SpaceX, OpenAI and more through his investment firm, Founders Fund.Palantir, which he co-founded, has won government contracts worth billions to create software for the Pentagon, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the National Health Service in the UK. Now, with more attention and political pull than ever, the billionaire is looking to spread his message about the antichrist, though he is better known for his savvy politics and investments than his contributions to theology.“I’m a libertarian, or a classical liberal, who deviates in one minor detail, where I’m worried about the antichrist,” Thiel said during his third lecture.The meandering gospel of PeterThiel’s talks, which began on 15 September and ended on Monday, were long and sweeping, mingling biblical passages, recent history and philosophy and sometimes deviating into conspiracy theories. He peppered them with references to video games and TV shows along with musings on JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. He likewise recalled conversations with Elon Musk and Benjamin Netanyahu and spoke at length about how he thinksBill Gatesis “a very, very awful person”.Tickets for the series went for $200, selling out within hours. Attenders were told that the lectures were strictly off the record and that they were forbidden from taking photos, videos or audio recordings. At least one person who took notes and published them had his ticketrevoked by a post on X.Guardian reporters did not attend the lectures or agree to the off-the-record stipulation. Recordings were provided by an attender who gave them on the condition of anonymity.When reached for comment, Thiel’s spokesperson, Jeremiah Hall, did not dispute the veracity of the material given to the Guardian. Hall did correct a piece of the Guardian’s transcription and clarified an argument made by Thiel about Jews and the antichrist.The Silicon Valley heavyweight drew on a wide swath of religious thinkers, including the French-American theorist René Girard, whom Thiel knew at Stanford University, and the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, whose work he said helped create the core of his own beliefs. He credited the English Catholic theologian John Henry Newman as the inspiration for his four-part series, saying: “Newman did four, so I’m doing four. I’m happy about it.”The venture capitalist has hosted and attended events and lectured on the topic for decades, going back to the 1990s,according to a report by Wired. In recent months, he has spoken to theologians andpodcasters aboutthe antichrist both publicly and in private. His beliefs are diffuse, meandering and often confusing, but one tenet he’s steadfastly maintained over the years is that the unification of the world under one global state is essentially identical to the antichrist. In his talks, he uses the term “antichrist” almost interchangeably with “one-world state”.“One world or not, in a sense is the same as the question antichrist or Armageddon. So in one sense, it’s completely the same question,” he said.His version of history, and its potential end, posits technology as a central driver of societal change and takes a Christianity-focused, Eurocentric view that declines to engage much with other religious movements or parts of the world.On the day of Thiel’s final lecture inSan Francisco, as the mostly young and mostly male crowd lined up to get in, a group of about 20 protesters stood out front holding anti-Palantir and anti-Ice signs that said things such as “Predatory tech”, “We do not profit from people who profit from misery” and “Not today Satan”.View image in fullscreenPeople protesting outside a Peter Thiel event in San Francisco.Photograph: Dara Kerr/The GuardianA trio of self-described “satanists” dressed in black costumes with goth makeup walked up and down the line of attenders carrying a goblet of red liquid with a small plastic replica of a bone. “Will you bring our dark lordPeter Thielthis baby’s blood?” they asked. Then they performed what they called a “dark ritual”, dancing slowly in a circle to Mozart’s Requiem in D minor, which ended with them writhing on the city sidewalk, and yelling: “Take us to your personal hell … Thank you for being our dark lord.”What do Thiel’s lectures say?The Guardian is publishing substantial quoted passages alongside contextual annotations so that the public may be informed on what an influential figure in politics and technology was saying behind closed doors.He believes the Armageddon will be ushered in by an antichrist-type figure who cultivates a fear of existential threats such as climate change, AI and nuclear war to amass inordinate power. The idea is this figure will convince people to do everything they can to avoid something like a third world war, including accepting a one-world order charged with protecting everyone from the apocalypse that implements a complete restriction of technological progress. In his mind, this is already happening. Thiel said that international financial bodies, which make it more difficult for people to shelter their wealth in tax havens, are one sign the antichrist may be amassing power and hastening Armageddon, saying: “It’s become quite difficult to hide one’s money.”It’s because theantichrist talks about Armageddon nonstop. We’re all scared to death that we’re sleepwalking into Armageddon. And then because we knowworld war three will be an unjust war, that pushes us. We’re going hard towards peace at any price.What I worry about in that sort of situation is you don’t think too hard about the details of the peace and it becomes much more likely that you get an unjust peace. This is, by the way, the slogan of theantichrist: 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It’s peace and safety, sort of the unjust peace.Let me conclude on this choice ofantichrist or Armageddon. And again, in some ways the stagnation and the existential risks are complementary, not contradictory. The existential risk pushes us towards stagnation and distracts us from it.How does Thiel think Armageddon will happen?Thiel rarely gives a definitive answer about who exactly the antichrist might be or how Armageddon might come about – a central point across his lectures is that nothing is written in stone or inevitable – but he does give the contours of what a global conflict that could lead to Armageddon might look like.There’s all sorts of different ways,oneworld ornone,antichrist or Armageddon, that I’m tempted to think about this, and here’s one sort of application. In terms of how does one think about the current geopolitical moment. How does one think about the nature of the conflict between the United States and China, thewest and China. You don’t really know how it’s going to go. You can ask, are we heading forworld war three orcold war two? And if you sort of reflect on the history of the twoworldwars and the firstcoldwar. But first, if there ever was an unjust war,world war one is an unjust war. If there ever was a just war,world war two was probably a just war, with certain caveats. Worldwar one is really insane. Worldwar two was about as justified as a war can be. I think we can say that if you had an all-outworld war three or war between nuclear powers involving nuclear weapons, it would simply be an unjust war. A total catastrophe, possibly literalArmageddon, the end of the world. Soworld war three will be an unjust war. But then if you have acoldwar, you have to distinguish between – can you have a just peace and an unjust peace?Somehow, it’s very strange how the firstcoldwar from ‘49 to ‘89 ended. But it ended with roughly what I think of as a just peace, where somehow you didn’t have a nuclear war. And somehow our side, which I think was more the good side, basically won. And you ended up not with a perfect peace, but more or less a just peace. And so if we haveworld war three, it will be an unjust war. If we havecold war two, maybe it can end in a just peace or an unjust peace. Reflecting on this material and thinking about it, it’s obviously not written in stone and there’s a lot of different ways this stuff can go. But I keep thinking that, if you had to put odds on it, aren’t the odds that we’re trending towards the fourth quadrant this time. The fourth possibility thatcold war two will end an unjust peace.Thiel devotes a large section of his second lecture to a quote from the Book of Daniel that involves a prophecy about the end times, which he equates to modern advances in technology and globalization.Let’s go on to ‘many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased.’ It means science progressing, technology improving, globalization, people traveling around the world. Of course in some sense, I think these things … I’m not sure they’re completely inevitable, but there is some direction to it. Where there’s a linear progression of knowledge and something like globalization that happens. But of course, the details matter a lot. Knowledge increasing, science progressing, technology improving can be a very good thing. No disease, death, protect people from natural disasters. Then, of course, we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, bioweapons, etc. And similarly, globalization is … you have trade in goods and services. There’s certain ways to escape from tyrannical governments. And of course there is danger in theone-world state of theantichrist.As the antichrist is synonymous with a one-world state for Thiel, he also believes that international bodies including the United Nations and the international criminal court (ICC) hasten the coming of Armageddon. Throughout his lectures, he warns of what he sees as the danger of these bodies and the harms they have already caused. In the following quotes, he’s lamenting the actions of the ICC:They’ve started arresting more and more people.Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was arrested this year. They had arrest warrants out for Netanyahu and Gallant.When I met Netanyahu early in 2024, about a year and a half ago, we talked about what he’s doing in Gaza, and the one-liner he had was: ‘I can’t just Dresdenize Gaza – you can’t just firebomb them.’ So it’s like, come on, ‘I’m less of a war criminal than Winston Churchill. Why am I in so much trouble?’During a Q&A portion of one of the lectures, an attender asked specifically about Thiel’s thoughts on abolishing the ICC, saying: “If we get rid of the ICC or other organizations that exist to bring, in theory, justice, how can we right crimes? Should we not have prosecuted Nazi criminals?” Thiel responded:I think there was certainly a lot of different perspectives on what should be done with the Nuremberg trials. It was sort of the US that pushed for the Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union just wanted to have show trials. I think Churchill just wanted summary executions of 50,000 top Nazis without a trial. And I don’t like the Soviet approach, but I wonder if the Churchill one would have actually been healthier than the American one.Who could be Thiel’s antichrist?Thiel believes that the antichrist would be a single evil tyrant. He mentions several figures he believes are particularly dangerous and, while he never definitively says who the antichrist is, he makes suggestions about how some people could be antichrist-type figures.A basic definition of theantichrist. Some people think of it as a type of very bad person. Sometimes it’s used more generally as a spiritual descriptor of the forces of evil. What I will focus on is the most common and most dramatic interpretation ofantichrist: an evil king or tyrant or anti-messiah who appears in the endtimes.Specifically, he suggests the antichrist would be a “luddite who wants to stop all science”, referencing Thunberg, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Marc Andreessen.My thesis is that in the 17th, 18th century, theantichrist would have been a DrStrangelove, a scientist who did all this sort of evil crazy science. In the 21st century, theantichrist is aluddite who wants to stop all science. It’s someone like Greta orEliezer.It’s not Andreessen, by the way. I thinkAndreessen is not theantichrist. Because you know, theantichrist is popular. I’m trying to say some good things aboutAndreessen here, come on.During a question-and-answer session, Thiel was asked to respond to a quote from fellow investor Andreessen – a name he audibly bristled at. He said Andreessen was engaged in hyperbole and “gobbledygook propaganda” when it comes to the promises of AI.Where should I start? I’m tempted to be triggered in some nasty ad hominem argument, but I can’t resist so I’ll do that. I don’t know, this is just pure Silicon Valley gobbledygook propaganda. I wouldn’t give someone who said things like that too much money to invest.Later, he returns to these “legionnaires of the antichrist”.In late modernity, where science has become scary and apocalyptic, and the legionnaires of theantichrist like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostromand Greta Thunberg argue for world government to stop science, theantichrist has somehow become anti-science.Gates, the philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, is high on the list of people Thiel does not like.One of my friends was telling me that I should not pass up on the opportunity to tell those people in San Francisco that Bill Gates is theantichrist. I will concede that he is certainly a DrJekyll and MrHyde-type character. The public MrRogers, the neighborhood character. I saw the MrHyde version about a year ago, where it was just a nonstop, Tourette’s, yelling swear words, almost incomprehensible what was going on.Ultimately, Thiel concedes Gates cannot be the antichrist, bringing up the topic more than once:He’s not a political leader, he’s not broadly popular, and again, perhaps to Gates’s credit, he’s still stuck in the 18th century alongside people like Richard Dawkins who believe that science and atheism are compatible.I don’t think even someone like Bill Gates, who I think is a very, very awful person, is remotely able to be theantichrist.Pope Benedict XVI is someone who Thiel admired because he was one of the few popes who referenced the possibility of an antichrist:Thetl;dr: my belief is that Benedict literally thought that the historic falling away from the church during his papacy was a sign of the end times.However, Thiel said Benedict failed at spreading the message of the antichrist because he “was not very courageous”.I often like to say libertarianism and marijuana are both gateway drugs to alt-right, other ideas. The danger of the red pill is you move on the black pill. And somehow Benedict overdosed on red pills.Musk, a longtime friend and ally of Thiel, came up during one of the lectures in the context of theGiving Pledge, a pact Gates founded in 2010 where billionaires pledged to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. Here is Thiel recapping the conversation:If I had to pick a little bit on Elon – and I’m going to pick on him because I think of him as one of the smarter, more thoughtful people …This is a conversation I had with him a few months ago, and it was like: ‘I want you to unsign that silly Giving Pledge you signed back in 2012, where you promised to give away half your money. You have, like, $400bn. Yes, you gave $200mto MrTrump, but $200bn– if you’re not careful – is going to leftwing non-profits that will be chosen by Bill Gates.’And then I – one step ahead – rethought it and said: ‘You don’t think about this much because you don’t expect to die anytime soon, but you’re 54 years old. I looked up the actuarial tables: at 54, you have a 0.7% chance of dying in the next year. And 0.7% of $200bnis $1.4bn– about seven times what you gave to Trump. So MrGates is effectively expecting $1.4bnfrom you in the next year.’And to his credit, Elon was, well,pretty fluid on it. He said: ‘Actually, I think the odds of me dying are higher than 70 basis points.’ A shocking explosion of self-awareness. Then: ‘What am I supposed to do – give it to my children? I certainly can’t give it to my trans daughter; that would be bad. You know, it would be much worse to give it to Bill Gates.’When asked about the slain far-right commentatorCharlie Kirk’s memorial in reference to the role of Christianity in American politics, Thiel initially demurred saying it was “above his pay grade”. When further prompted, he described what he saw as two versions of Christianity on display at the event:I think, um – what to say – I was thinking about, you know, I had the chart: thekatechon pagan Christianity versus theeschaton – the Christianity of Constantine versus that of Mother Teresa. We had an illustration of that with Kirk’s wife saying that sheforgavethe murderers because that’s what Christ would do. This was an incredibly saintly form of Christianity. And then, you know, President Trump – I don’t know, I forget the language exactly – but, you know, Charlie was into forgiving, being nice to his enemies. He doesn’t believe in being nice to his enemies; he wants to hurt his enemies. And that’s sort of the pagan Christian view. And the problem – the naive view – is: there has to be something somewhere in between, right? But how do you concretize that? What’s the thing that’s in between Mother Teresa and Constantine – between forgiving the murderer and delighting in punishing your enemies?Perhaps, I don’t know, perhaps the in-between thing I thought was that maybe Trump and Elon were able to forgive each other.Thiel argues that, in order for the antichrist to be able to pull off the Armageddon in one lifetime, they need to be young today – he points to 33 as an auspicious number. In these quotes, he draws parallels to powerful figures who died at the age of 33, including Jesus, Buddha and some literary characters:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Theantichrist has to somehow outdo this. I don’t want to be way too literal on the 33 number – I’d rather stress theantichrist will be a youthful conqueror; maybe in our gerontocracy, 66 is the new 33. But something like these numbers do occur almost mystically through a number of different contexts.Buddha begins his travels at age 30 and experiences Nirvana, ego death, at age 33. But I had to be ecumenical and say something nice about Islam. One idea that’s pretty cool is, when you’re reborn into your afterlife, you’re born into your 33-year-old self. Your 33-year-old self is your best self.Livy’s – the Roman historian’s 33rd chapter of the 33rd book – it announces this 33-year-old conqueror. It’s like Alexander at the peak of his power. Or even in Tolkien, the hobbits have a coming-of-age ceremony at 33. That’s how old Frodo is when he inherits the ring.By the same token, people who are older cannot be Thiel’s antichrist. Here Thiel gives some examples:Trajan, a Romanemperor, wept when he reached the Persian Gulf in AD115 at the age of 65. He’s too old to beat Alexander the Great’s achievements in India. He died two years later. Hitler is 50 by the timeworld war two starts – he mimetically loses to Napoleon, who’s only 30 when he became first consul of the French Republic. That goes on to the same problem for a seventysomething Xi Jinping. Racist, sexist, nationalist, maybe the second coming of Hitler. But not even the second coming of Genghis Khan. Past the sell-by date.He frequently oscillates between talking about the antichrist and the katechon – a term very briefly used in the Bible that refers to something holding back the coming of the antichrist. In one example, he describes a post-cold war shift to embracing neoliberalism and bureaucracy as an example of antichrist-like government.Of course, you have all these examples where it’s one toggle switch fromkatechon to the antichristic thing. Claudius to Nero, Charlemagne to Napoleon, anti-communism after the Berlin Wall comes down, it gets replaced by neoliberalism. Which is, you know, the Bush 41newworld order, which you can think of as anti-communism where there’s no communists left. Or Christian democracy, which is sort of the European form of thekatechontic, transnational anti-communism. Once the communists are gone, it sort of decays into the Brussels bureaucracy. All kinds of different riffs one could do with this. Or to go even further, if something is not powerful enough to potentially become theantichrist, it probably isn’t that good as akatechon.In his last lecture, Thiel also responds during the Q&A portion to a question about potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they are antichrist or katechon. When asked aboutAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Thiel says that he worries about there being a “woke American pope”– Pope Leo XIV – and a “woke American president”, creating a “Caesar-Papist fusion”. He goes on to talk about Ocasio-Cortez in relation to Thunberg:One of the ways these things always get reported is, I denounce Greta as anantichrist. And I want to be very clear: Greta is, I mean she’s maybe sort of a type or a shadow of anantichrist of a sort that would be tempting. But I don’t want to flatter her too much. So with Greta, you shouldn’t take her as theantichrist for sure. With AOC, you can choose whether or not you want to believe this disclaimer that I just gave.What does he say about Trump and politics?Thiel is asked several times about Trump and how he fits into his imagination of what form Armageddon might take. In one instance, he is asked whether Trump’s opposition to global governance makes Thiel feel any relief about the hastening of a one-world order.At the very best, you shouldn’t have even the most fanatical Trump supporter. You know, no politician, not even Reagan, will solve all problems for all time. Maybe we both were sort of delusional about Reagan in the 80s. There was some moment in the 1980s when we thought that Reagan had permanently solved the deepest problems in the world for all time. And that’s too high a bar. That was too high a bar for Reagan. That’s an unfairly high bar you’re giving to MrTrump. You’re just trying to make a subtle anti-Trump argument and I’m not going to let you do that.One of Thiel’s longstanding political affiliations has been anti-communism, and in his fourth lecture, he suggests that opposition to communism following the second world war is something that held back the antichrist. At other times, he is critical of post-cold war presidents and government order.I always sort of wonder what functions as thekatechon in the world after 1945. This is Schmitt’s 1947 diary. ‘I believe in thekatechons, for me the only possible way to understand Christian history and find it meaningful. Thekatechon needs to named for every epoch for the past 1948 years.’ The way I interpret this is that sotto voce, Schmitt is saying he has no idea what thekatechon is. And maybe, the New Dealers are running the whole planet. Then of course, 1949 the Soviets get the bomb, and my sort of provisional answer is that thekatechon for 40 years, from’49 to’89, is anti-communism. Which is in some ways is somewhat violent, not purely Christianbut very, very powerful.I’ve argued that thekatechon, or something like this, is necessary but not sufficient. And I want to finish by stressing where one goes wrong with it. If we forget its essential role, which is to restrain theantichrist, theantichrist might even present himself or itself or herself as thekatechon, or hijack thekatechon. This is almost a memetic version. A similarity between theantichrist and thekatechon, they’re both sort of political figures. Thekatechon is tied in with empire and politics. If theantichrist is going to take over the world, you need something very powerful to stop it.Thiel also opines on modern-day Russia and offers his views on Vladimir Putin:In some sense, there are perhaps two candidates for the successors to Rome. For all sorts of reasons, I don’t particularly like the Russian theories of all these ways where you have Putin describing himself as thekatechon and the last Christian leader in the world. It’s hard to look into someone’s heart. I always suspect he’s more of a KGB agent than a Christian. And then, of course, to be akatechon, you have to be strong enough to possibly become theantichrist. And Russia is not nearly powerful enough to take over the world. It cannot simply be thekatechon or the new Rome.Thiel also comments on the relation between Jewish people and the antichrist. He argued against medieval theologians’ idea that the antichrist would be Jewish.There’s probably a lot I can say about the relation of the Jews to theantichrist. The philo-semitic rebuttal, just to get it on the table, is that the Jews in the Bible are described as a stubborn and stiff-necked people. Which is mostly a bug, but maybe in the end times, it is a feature because – this is sort of the way [Vladimir]Solovyov phrased it – that they’re too stubborn to accept Christ, they will be too stubborn to be charmed by theantichrist. And so, they become the center of resistance to theantichrist in theSolovyov narrative.In response, Thiel’s spokesperson said: “Peter was arguing against medieval, antisemitic theologians who suggested that the antichrist will be Jewish,” citing Solovyov.Thiel’s final lecture dedicates a large portion of its time to talking about empires and what role the US government plays in holding back or advancing the antichrist. He is characteristically noncommittal, describing the country as having characteristics of a one-world government and also being outside it:Now this is not meant to be an anti-British or anti-American lecture. It’s just that America is, at this point, the natural candidate forkatechon andantichrist, ground zero of theone-world state, ground zero of the resistance to theone-world state. The US world police is the one truly sovereign country. They always say the president is the mayor of the US and the dictator of the world. International law gets defined by the US. That’s sort ofNato’s prime, to see in some ways, coordination of the world’s intelligence agencies.Then of course, the global financial architecture we discussed is not really run by shadowy international organizations, it’s basically American. And perhaps always a very important feature is the reservecurrency status of the dollar, where it’s sort of the backstop for all the money. The petrodollar regime, there’s sort of crazy ways you have trade deficits, current account deficits, but then in all these ways, the money gets recycled into the US.Then of course, there’s sort of a way where from a certain perspective, the US is also the place that’s the most outside the world state. In many ways, it’s probably one of the best tax havens, at least if you’re not a US citizen. And then there are all these ways the US is a kind of ideological superpower. Christian, ultra-Christian, anti-Christian sense, woke Protestant liberation theology, social gospel, social justice. City on a hill, this institution serves as a beacon of light for other nations and honor.At another point in his final lecture, he seems to suggest that when things are codified or formalized they tend to lose their power or ability to operate. He selects Guantánamo Bay detention camp as an example:By 2005 in Guantánamo, you were way better off as a Muslim terrorist in Guantánamo, the liberal lawyers had taken it over by 2005, than as a suspected cop killer in Manhattan. In Manhattan if you were a suspected cop killer back in 2005, you know, there was some informal process they had for dealing with you. Guantánamo, it was formalized. Initially, they did some bad things and then very quickly, they weren’t able to do anything, any more. And this is again a sort of revelatory unraveling process.During the Q&A section, Peter Robinson talks about John Henry Newman’s description of the antichrist promising people things like civil liberty and equality. “He offers you baits to tempt you,” Robinson said, quoting Newman. Then, Robinson says to Thiel: “The antichrist is a really cool, glamorous hip operator. Is that Zohran Mamdani?” Thiel doesn’t directly answer the question, but does offer his take on the young, progressive mayoral candidate:I don’t thinkMamdani can be president because he’s not a natural-born citizen. So he’s capped out at mayor. I also don’t think he’s really promised to reduce my taxes.In his final lecture, Thiel was asked to comment on various potential 2028 presidential candidates and whether they’d be more of an antichrist figure or a katechon.Thiel says he is “very pro-JD Vance”. But he has some concerns about his allegiance to the pope.“The place that I would worry about is that he’s too close to thepope. And so we have all these reports of fights between him and thepope. I hope there are a lot more. It’s the Caesar-Papist fusion that I always worry about. By the way, I’ve given him this feedback over time. And you know with the sort of … I don’t like his popeism, but there’s sort of a way if I steel manned it. It’s always, you have to think about whether if you say you’re doing something good, whether it’s a command, a standard or a limit, or whether in philosophical language, is it necessary or sufficient. And so when JD Vance said that he was praying for Pope Francis’s health, it’s as a command, as a necessary thing.OK, that’s … if you’re a lot more if you’re a good Catholic. But what I hope it really means is that it’s sufficient, and that he’s setting a good example for conservative Catholics like you, Peter, who listen to thepope too much. And perhaps all you have to do to be a really good Catholic is pray for thepope. You don’t really need to listen to him on anything else. And if that’s what JD Vance is doing, that’s really good. I’m worried about the Caesar-Papist fusion.Thiel also spoke about San Francisco and his views on Gavin Newsom, the California governor.​​I would say that if we go to thekatechontic thing and the US is that, tech and politics are radically separate, Silicon Valley is really, really separate from DC in an extreme way. If these things could be fused,… someone like that perhaps represents a way to do that. That’s the part where, if there was a way to … you know, he was the governor of California, he was the mayor of San Francisco. In a way, San Francisco is more important than California. The world city is more important than just this sort of silly province called California. And if you could fuse Washington and San Francisco, that’s a very dangerous thing. It’s kind of, it’s sort of in a way the lastprecedent where such a fusion of sorts happened. I think it was FDR with New York and DC. So that’s the piece that would be tricky.And you know, by the way, these things have been very, very unfused historically. Back in 2008, one of my liberal friends was trying to get 75 tech-type people to endorse Obama and they got like 68, 69 and thought maybe they could get me. I told them, man, if there are only six or seven, you want to be in the minority. It’s more valuable to be one of the seven than one of the 68. And then his counterpoint was, well, you know, we need to all get on board with Obama because he’s going to win and then we’ll have an influence. And then, the really crazy … and then in a way, Obama … if you think about the primary in 2008, the Democratic primary, Obama had the students, the minorities, the young people. Hillary was the finance world in New York, the unions. Hollywood was sort of split 50/50 between Obama and Hillary.But Silicon Valley was the one sector of the economy that went all in for Obama. But it didn’t work at all. And then if you fast forward to the Obama cabinet, there were zero people from Silicon Valley. There was no representation at all. And so, even Obama was very far from anything resembling a fusion. And then the question is whether Newsom will be like that or different.Why is he fixated on stagnation?Chief among Thiel’s concerns about how quickly the world is hurtling toward an Armageddon is what he describes as a stagnation or slowing down of technological and scientific progress. He attributes part of that to the use of science and technology – once largely seen as a force for good, in his telling – for harm.The creation of the gun and the machine gun “wounded our faith in science and tech”, he said. “And then the atom bomb somehow blew it up entirely. And in some sense in 1945, science and tech became apocalyptic. It left us with a question.” This fear of tech is what the antichrist will seize on to gain power, he says.During the Q&A portion of the first lecture, Thiel is asked about howartificial intelligence(AI) – the much-hyped darling of his fellow Silicon Valley investors – fits into this larger narrative of technological stagnation. Thiel said AI was a symptom of the larger tech stagnation and that people including Andreessen needed to boost its promises because there’s nothing else going on.If we’re going to not have this sort of crazed corporate utopianism versus effective altruist luddism, luddite thing. If you try to have some more nuanced version of this, you try to quantify it. How big is the AI revolution? How much is it going to add to GDP? Add to living standards? Things like that. My placeholder is, it’s looking probably on roughly the scale of the internet from 1990 to the late 90s. Maybe it can add 1% a year to GDP. There are big error bars around that. And I think the internet was quite significant. People talked about the internet in very similar terms in 1999. That’s another way where it sounds like roughly the right scale.The place where it’s very different, where it feels both true of the internet and maybe it’s true of AI, maybe a place where I would agree with Andreessen. The negative part of the statement is: ‘But for AI, nothing else is going on.’ He’s not talking about going to Mars, so it doesn’t sound like he believes Elon’s about to go to Mars. I think there’s a negative part, if AI was not happening, wow, we are really stuck. Things are really stagnant. And maybe that’s why people have to be so excited about this one specific vector of technological progress. Because outside of that, to a first approximation, things are totally, totally stagnant. Maybe even the internet has run out of steam but for AI. So that’s another framing. Now, the thing that strikes me is very different from’99, if I had to give a difference, again I’m too anchored and rooted in the late 90s. But the late 90s, it was broadly optimistic. And there were a lot of people who thought about it just like Andreessen does. Nobody feels that personally. You can’t start a dotcom company from your basement in Sacramento. You can’t start an AI company, you have to do it in San Francisco. You have to do it in Silicon Valley. It has to be at an enormous scale. Most things aren’t big enough. And then there are layers and layers and layers where it feels incredibly non-inclusive. Maybe people just updated from the internet because maybe the internet turned out to have a lot of winner-take-all dynamics.In one of the lectures, Thiel plays a video of a60 Minutes segmentabout a German law that cracks down on online hate speech. He’s trying to show an example of where tech regulation goes too far – hence giving power to the antichrist:This kind of video is ridiculous but, of course, indicative of this larger trend. There is this crazy judge in Brazil who is arresting everybody. Australia has more or less ended internet anonymity with age verification required for all social media. The UK is arresting 30 people a day for offensive speech. I’m sort of always in favor of maximal free speech, but my one concrete test is whether I can talk about theantichrist. If I can’t, that’s too restrictive.In his fourth lecture, he also suggests that his beliefs about the end of the world informed his own work in tech at companies such as PayPal:I was working at PayPal at the time trying to build the technology to evade these policies of the world’s powers and principalities. So it was natural to think about theantichrist in the context of the world of financial architecture. I’llstill defend PayPal as more good than bad.References to pop culture and literatureThiel peppered his lectures with references to pop culture, calling out YouTube influencers likeMrBeastand throwing out terms like “libtard” – a rightwing slur for people with progressive political views. Sometimes these references pertained to the antichrist; at other times, Thiel was just giving his views on politics, modern society and Silicon Valley, like here:TheSuccessionTV show about the Murdochs is unthinkably retro in Silicon Valley. Only a 20th-century media company could be handed off to someone’s children. If you think about the tech companies, I don’t know, would anybody name a company after themselves? The last tech person who did this was, I think, Dell in the mid-1980s. This is like if you’re a retro Republican from Texas. It is so unthinkable to do this.In his second lecture, Thiel also explores the idea of the antichrist through four works of literature – Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, Alan Moore’s Watchmen graphic novel and Eiichiro Oda’s manga series One Piece. Thiel states that identifying the antichrist is possibly “hard to do in the present and always sort of controversial”, but that “you at least identify the antichrist in literature”.He describes the plot of Watchmen, a 1986 graphic novel involving superheroes grappling with moral questions about humanity against the backdrop of impending nuclear war:The antihero Ozymandias, theantichrist-type figure, is sort of an early-modern person. He believes this will be a timeless and eternal solution – eternal world peace. Moore is sort of a late-modern. In early modernity, you have ideal solutions, ‘perfect’ solutions to calculus. In late modernity, things are sort of probabilistic. And at some point, he asks DrManhattan whether the world government is going to last. And he says that ‘nothing lasts forever.’ So you embrace theantichrist and it still doesn’t work.Thiel later finds biblical meaning in the manga One Piece, discussing how he believes it represents a future where an antichrist-like one-world government has repressed science. He believes that the hero, Monkey D Luffy, represents a Christlike figure.In One Piece, you are set in a fantasy world, again sort of an alternate earth, but it’s 800 years into the reign of thisone-world state. Which, as the story unfolds, gradually gets darker and darker. You sort of realize, in my interpretation, who runs the world and it’s something like theantichrist. There’s Luffy, a pirate who wears a red straw hat, sort of like Christ’s crown of thorns. And then towards the end of the story, transforms into a figure who resembles Christ in Revelation.Thiel, along with a researcher and writer at Thiel Capital, explored these ideas at greater length in an essay for the religious journalFirst Thingsearlier this month.Do Thiel’s arguments make sense?In a word, no. For one representative example, look to his muddled, contradictory summation of who the antichrist may be:There is a way to think that theantichrist represents the end of philosophy – culmination, termination. He is the individual who gets rid of all individuals; the philosopher who ends all philosophers; the Caesar who ends all rulers; the person who understands all secrets. How is this possible in late modernity, where we don’t believe a philosopher-king, tyrantor ruler can come to power?Explore more on these topicsUS newsPeter ThielSilicon ValleySan FranciscoReligionJD VanceElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Friday’s announcement is the first time it has designated a tech firm with SMS.It has alreadyflagged a number of potential changesincluding giving internet users an option to choose a different search service via “choice screens”. One option for the screens could be to include AI-powered rivals in the search space, such as Perplexity and ChatGPT.‘Existential crisis’: how Google’s shift to AI has upended the online news modelRead moreThe CMA has also proposed ensuring fair ranking of search results and providing more control for publishers over how their content is used, including in AI-generated responses. Google’s artificial intelligence-powered AI overview and AI mode features are also included under the SMS designation.The CMA said its decision was not a finding of wrongdoing and would not result in immediate action. However, it will begin a consultation on potential changes to Google’s business this year.Will Hayter, the executive director for digital markets at the CMA, said promoting competition in areas such as search and search advertising – where advertisers pay to place an advert in a user’s search result – can unlock opportunities for businesses and drive investment across the UK economy.“We have found that Google maintains a strategic position in the search and search advertising sector, with more than 90% of searches in the UK taking place on its platform,” he said. “Having taken into account the feedback received following our proposed decision, we have today designated Google’s search services with strategic market status.”Oliver Bethell, the senior director for competition at Google, said the move could endanger UK users’ access to new products and services.“Many of the ideas for interventions that have been raised in this process would inhibit UK innovation and growth, potentially slowing product launches at a time of profound AI-based innovation,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One giant leap for Sam: for everyone else, not so muchFri 10 Oct 2025 10.55 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareTake a look at Sam Altman. I mean, actually do it. Go to Google images, where you can find countless photos of the OpenAI boss smiling in a kind of wan genius way, the humble lost puppy ofSilicon Valley. But I urge you to simply cover the bottom half of his face in any of these pictures, and you will immediately clock that Sam has the sad-psycho eyes of the lost woman’s boyfriend who the police have asked to front the missing person’s appeal. Please come home, Sheila – we’re all worried sick and we just want you back.If that joke seems off-colour, or crass, or some kind of manipulative stretch – please, don’t worry. I’m using the OpenAI gold standard of giving-a-toss, where the unwilling subjects of any generated content have to formally, time-consumingly and bureaucratically optoutof being used/abused/exploited any way anyone likes. I haven’t heard from Sam, so my assumption is that he’s fine with me saying that he knows exactly where Sheila is because he put her there. He is, after all, fast emerging as precisely the type to appear alongside the phrase “in plain sight”.The past fortnight for Sam has involved the release of AI video generator Sora 2 – a staggering upgrade on the Sora of barely 10 months ago – and its instant descent into a sludge of stolen copyrighted goods. We also saw the announcement of a further web of circular bargains between OpenAI and chip firms likeNvidiaandAMDthat brings OpenAI’s frenzieddeal tally to over $1tnthis year alone. That absolutely does not mean that in addition to enabling you to watch videos of meticulously created charactersget pixel-puppetedby aggressively bigoted and talentless losers, OpenAI will also enable you to lose your home in a financial crash if the bubble bursts badly.And look, no offence to Sora’s “creators”. I often walk through art galleries and realise the stuff on the walls would be so much better if I simply stole it and drew hilarious penises on it or whatever, and that they wouldn’t have made it publicly viewable if they didn’t want that. Furthermore, no tech titans have a cultural life, so they can’t possibly imagine what could be so creatively valuable you wouldn’t want a robot to desecrate it for cash. If you’ve seen Sam’s frequent reading recommendations, you’ll know they’re literally the “business philosophy” section of a second-tier airport bookshop. Mainly this week, he wanted us to know Sora 2 was all cool and fun. “It is way less strange to watch a feed full of memes of yourself than I thought it would be,”Sam posted reassuringly. So everything’s fine! Although, I guess it helps if you’re one of the most powerful people in the world and making untold billions off this stuff, not just getting revenge-porned in a Byzantium simulation because somehow historical prompts seem toconfuse the“guardrails”.It’s time to prepare for AI personhood | Jacy Reese AnthisRead moreI’ve seen it said that OpenAI’s motto should be “better to beg forgiveness than ask permission”, but that cosies it preposterously. Its actual motto seems to be “we’ll do what we want and you’ll let us, bitch”. Consider Altman’s recent political journey. “To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s,”Sam warned in 2016, “it’s chilling to watch Trump in action.” He seems to have got over this in time to attendDonald Trump’s second inauguration, presumably because – if we have to extend his artless and predictable analogy – he’s now one of the industrialists welcome in the chancellery to carve up the spoils. “Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president,” Sam simpered to Trump at a recent White House dinner for tech titans. “It’s a very refreshing change.” Inevitably, the Trump administration has refused to bring forward any AI regulation at all.Meanwhile, please remember something Sam and his ironicidal maniacs said earlier this year, when it was suggested that the ChineseAI chatbot DeepSeekmight have beentrained on some of OpenAI’s work. “We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more,” his firm’s anguished statement ran. “We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology.” Hilariously, it seemed that the last entity on earth with the power to fight AI theft was OpenAI.It was left to Hollywood talent agencies this week to extract some kind of momentary pause from Altman, whoposted some flannelabout trying to direct, if not hard cash, then certainly some “new kind of engagement” at those he openly called “rightsholders”. Many of us remember a time – about 15 minutes ago – when rightsholders meantthe people who hold the rights. I mean, the clue’s right there in the word. But Sam is post-rights. The question is: if he’s post creative rights, can we honestly believe he isn’t effectively post other kinds of rights?OpenAI wants what all loving platforms ultimately want: its users never to have to leave its confines. It’s clearly positioning towards being seen as the new default homepage of the web, as Meta once did.

Her own young daughter has suffered serious breathing problems, which at their worst involved the harrowing experience of having to pin her to the floor to administer an inhaler.It is 10 years since the scandal erupted, exposing cars that pumped out far more toxic fumes on the road than when passing regulatory tests in the lab. But Dieselgate is far from over.The excess pollution emitted has already killed about 16,000 people in the UK and caused 30,000 cases of asthma in children,experts have estimated. A further 6,000 early deaths will occur in coming years without action, they say.That action is taking an “outrageous” amount of time, say lawyers, leaving more than a million of the dirty diesels still on the road today. Unlike countries such as the US and Germany, the UK government has yet to fine any car manufacturer, or force them to recall and repair their vehicles. Instead, owners have had to seek justice by mounting the largest group action claim in English legal history, with 1.6 million claimants represented in a high court trial that starts on Monday.“I want the alleged deception of these manufacturers to be brought into the open and for them to be held to account,” says Adam Kamenetzky, from south London and one of the claimants. When buying a car in 2018 before the birth of his twin children, he chose his 2013 Mercedes ML250 specifically because of its low emissions in official tests. Now he says he feels he was deceived and was contributing, unknowingly, to deadly air pollution.View image in fullscreenAdam Kamenetzky chose this particular model of Mercedes car because of its low emissions credentials.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianCourt documents assessed for the Guardian, which the car companies hadsought to keep confidential, reveal an extraordinary array of alleged illegal “cheat devices”. These enabled many diesel cars to sail through official tests, only for the nitrogen oxides (NOx) in their exhausts to soar when used in real-life driving.Previous reportshave shown thatmost diesel carssold from 2009-19emitted more NOxon the roadsthan in official tests.The motivation for this deployment of engineering ingenuity was, the claimants lawyers argue, to save the car companies money and save drivers the inconvenience of having to top up tanks with AdBlue, a chemical used to reduce pollution. The carmakers deny the alleged defeat devices were illegal and say the claims against them are without merit, arguing the devices were necessary to protect the engines.A guilty verdict could see the carmakers having to pay billions of pounds in compensation, although the legal fight could take another three years to complete.Even then, while each diesel owner may receive thousands of pounds in financial compensation, judgments against the carmakers would not compel them to fix the cars. Ministers have had the legal framework needed to do this since 2021 but have yet to use it, and while 76 models are under investigation by officials, progress is agonisingly slow, say lawyers.‘Struggling to breathe’Concern over the impact air pollution was having, particularly on children, was the reason Hartshorn founded campaign group Mums for Lungs in 2017. But in 2022 that concern became deeply personal.View image in fullscreenFive years after founding Mums for Lungs, Jemima Hartshorn’s own daughter ended up in the hospital with breathing difficulties.Photograph: @CrispinHughes/Mums for Lungs/Crispin Hughes“My daughter, who was three-years-old at the time, became very ill,” she wrote in a witness statement related to the group claim trial. “She was struggling to breathe and our GP advised us to go immediately to the accident and emergency department. The severity of her condition was instantly recognised by a nurse. My daughter was given inhalers and steroids and, after five hours, was eventually discharged, with daily nurse visits scheduled from the following day.“I had to administer a spacer, which is a type of inhaler, to my daughter every two hours, over the next several days. My daughter found the spacer frightening. I had to restrain her in the ‘crucifix position’, pinning her arms with my legs, in order to force her to breathe through it. This experience was gruelling and deeply upsetting for us both.”Three days later Hartshorn’s daughter was back in hospital. “It was a very frightening time,” she wrote. Thankfully, her daughter’s respiratory health has improved recently. “However, children growing up in London, Manchester and other cities and towns across this country are sick because of diesel emissions,” she told the Guardian. “It is time the car manufacturers paid as well.”Prof Nick Hopkinson, a respiratory medicine expert at Imperial College London and medical director of Asthma + Lung UK, says: “Dieselgate isn’t just a corporate scandal – it is helping to fuel a toxic air emergency that has already cut short thousands of lives, and will continue to do so without urgent action. The UK government has been too slow to act, resulting in millions of high-polluting diesel vehicles remaining on our roads.”‘Still pumping out NOx’The car companies on trial have made the vast majority of cars on the UK’s roads, but the colossal scale of the case means the court has chosen five lead defendants to go first: Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, Renault and Nissan. Nine more companies face similar claims of using illegal defeat devices, including Vauxhall, Volkswagen, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW, Fiat, Hyundai-Kia and Toyota. These cases will be considered in the light of the result of the first trial.View image in fullscreenRenault is one of the five carmakers chosen to be lead defendants in the trial.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesBenjamin Croft, a partner at Leigh Day, one of the two law firms leading the case, sets out the claim: “Firstly, the claimants’ case is that these drivers were deceived into buying vehicles that were marketed as conforming with the legislation and being environmentally friendly and not pumping out NOx that is harmful to human health.”“The second point is that the expert evidence shows that these vehicles are still pumping out far more NOx than they should, and people’s health is being affected by it.”At the heart of the case are the alleged illegal defeat devices. Diesel car manufacturers had developed sophisticated technology to reduce NOx emissions. But, the lawyers argue, they deployed equally sophisticated ways to ramp the technology up when the cars were undergoing the official emissions test then ramp it down during normal driving on the road.UK electric car sales hit record high as taxpayer subsidies help attract buyersRead moreThis was possible because the test involved a fixed sequence of gentle accelerations, steady travel and braking, highly unlikely during real-world driving, and were conducted on rollers under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. When a car’s onboard computer spotted it was undergoing the test, it ramped up NOx control, cutting emissions. (A more realistic test, including on-the-road emissions testing, started to be introduced in 2019.)The court documents allege that the five manufacturers used dozens of single defeat devices between them. As well as the characteristic test pattern, documents say the vehicles used multiple other factors to identify the test conditions: the ambient temperature being outside the test requirement of 20C to 30C, engine torque being higher than needed in the gentle test, and even the atmospheric air pressure, which was also a test requirement.When test conditions were detected, the cars then adjusted the NOx control systems. One alleged illegal cheat device was cutting the recirculation of exhaust gas into the engine, which reduces the combustion temperature and lowers NOx production. Another affected the lean NOx trap, a unit that absorbs NOx like a sponge. Here the alleged illegal cheat device would purge the unit during the prescribed warm-up before the regulatory test, ensuring optimum performance during the test.The third major category of alleged cheat device altered the most effective NOx control of all: selective catalytic reduction (SCR). This works by injecting urea – sold as AdBlue – into the exhaust stream, but was reduced outside test conditions, the court documents say. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler werefined €875m in 2021by the European Commission for cartel conduct that restricted competition in SCR use.Cost and inconvenienceThe obvious question is why did the carmakers go to such trouble to allegedly cheat the NOx emissions test?“We say the automakers had the technology to limit NOx to legal levels but chose not to deploy it and instead used their expertise to prioritise cutting costs and inconvenience, eg. Ad Blu refills, for themselves and the drivers of their cars,” says Croft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But these are problematic, say experts, and only cover a small fraction of polluting vehicles.“There’s no easily accessible central database that we can search,” says Emily Kearsey, a lawyer at Client Earth, which has made three legal complaints about diesel NOx emissions to the UK government since 2023.“ So it’s incredibly difficult to get any sense of what is the actual fix? What is the timeline? What is the actual percentage of vehicles that have been fixed?”Yoann Bernard, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the group that first exposed the Dieselgate scandal, says doubts also exist about the effectiveness of some of the software updates after the EU Joint Research Centretestedsome updated vehicles and found no improvement in emissions.Bernard adds that Renault, for example, has saidits software updateshave no impact on vehicle performance or fuel consumption: “If manufacturers possessed a software solution capable of reducing NOx emissions without adversely affecting fuel consumption and performance, why was it not implemented from the outset rather than risking a scandal?”The carmakers largely accept that the vehicles operate as the claimants allege but say the alleged defeat devices are in fact legal technologies, in some cases necessary to protect car engines from damage and issues such as the build up of soot. They say the claims against them are unfounded and that the companies will robustly defend themselves in court.View image in fullscreenA Volkswagen Passat during emissions testing.Photograph: John Stillwell/PA“In our opinion, the emission control software functionalities in question are justifiable from a technical and legal standpoint,” said a spokesperson for Mercedes. The company has rolled out voluntary software updatesshown to be effectiveat reducing NOx emissions by 25-30%, she said, adding: “As a responsible vehicle manufacturer, we continue to take steps to mitigate the impact of vehicle emissions and to further climate protection and air quality.”“All Renault’s vehicles were type approved in accordance with the regulatory requirements applicable at the time,” a company spokesperson says. A spokesperson for Peugeot/Citroën’s parent company said: “Stellantis firmly believes that its vehicles and engines fully comply with all applicable emission regulations.” A spokesperson for Nissan said the company is committed to compliance in all markets and supportive of the evolution of emissions testing regimes and standards over time. Ford did not respond to a request for comment.Rulings by the court of justice of the EU since 2020 ruled that defeat devices that operate most of the time are not legal and, in any case, are only permitted if required to prevent extremely serious damage.The ICCT has continued to track the diesel emissions polluting Europe’s air and says there are still more than 1.3m diesel vehicles with “extreme” emissions of toxic pollution on the roads of the UK today, with a further 10m on EU roads.Extreme means at least three timesover the official NOx limit for the cars, which were sold from 2009 to 2019. “The issue therefore remains unresolved,” says Bernard.‘Huge deal’Some countries have held carmakers to account for Dieselgate. VW was the first company to be exposed and was hammered by the US Department of Justice. In 2016, the DoJ forced VW to pay about$10bn compensating driversand $5bn to support electric cars and cut air pollution, as well as compelling the recall and fixing of the dirty diesels.German prosecutors fined VW €1bnin 2018, and by 2020 the company said the scandal hadcost it $34bn. Smaller fines have been imposed in Italy, the Netherlands and Poland.Frailty in ageing populations worsened by air pollution, global review findsRead moreIn the UK, VW settled a 2022 court case brought by 91,000 drivers by agreeing topay them £193m, about £2,100 each. But the British government has yet to punish any car company.“Auto manufacturers have been trying to sweep the Dieselgate scandal under the carpet for too long,” says Kearsey.“[The group claim trial] is a huge deal and a very important part of securing justice for people who feel they were misled. But we are working in parallel to try to ensure the government takes the action it needs to ensure that these cars are taken off the roads. Even if the manufacturers are found guilty of wrongdoing and there is compensation for consumers, it wouldn’t necessarily result in the cars being fixed and the air being cleaned up.”The UK government has had the power since 2021 to implement laws allowing them to compel recalls. But it has yet to use that power, despitesaying in 2023: “Abuse of the system is not acceptable – we are looking to bring forward stronger powers.” It is investigating76 models of car.“These investigations seem to be taking longer than they should, especially given the gravity of the issue,” Kearsey says.A spokesperson for the Department forTransportsaid: “We acted quickly to set up an investigation into defeat devices. We are now considering what action we could take should manufacturers be found to be breaking the rules.”View image in fullscreenKamenetzky, along with other claimants, is determined to see the case through despite it being expected to take another three years.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile the three-month group claim trial begins on Monday, there is a long road ahead. Final submissions in the trial are due in March 2026, with a judgment expected next summer. If the claimants win, then another trial to determine how much the carmakers will have to pay is listed for autumn 2026. There may even be further legal wrangling, such as whether a time limit could rule out the oldest vehicles.Kearsey says: “It’s hugely frustrating and outrageous when you see the wealth of evidence over the past 10 years that strongly indicates that the original VW scandal was just the tip of the iceberg. [The damage to health] is shocking, really affecting people’s lives now, and it will do so into the future until action is taken.”Kamenetzky, a Mercedes driver, says he is determined to see the case through: “I’m not in this for a payout. I’m just staggered by the level of injustice.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringTransportAir pollutionPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Josh, there’s a lot of commentary online from runners and cyclists over Strava suing Garmin. I am a runner, but I must confess I run to get away from the world – not participate in more online discourse. What’s it all about?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Miles, Strava is the go-to app for runners and cyclists to track their exercise. It has a lot of social features that allow users to race against the times of other users in a sort of social competition, and find popular places to exercise.It’s the Instagram for exercise – if you feel like boasting about your workouts to the world.You can track your workouts with your phone and Strava’s internal GPS tracking, but a lot of people are wearing fitness watches because they think they are more accurate. That’s where Garmin comes in. Strava allows Garmin fitness tracking watches to record workout data on its app via its own platform, Garmin Connect.It’s been a fairly good partnership for both companies for several years, but Strava is now taking Garmin to court in the US, alleging Garmin has infringed on two of Strava’s patents: segments and heat maps.‘I just ran a lot’: the Strava user whose runs became a viral art phenomenonRead moreSegments and heat maps … I’m already lost.Segments allows users to track their time in a section of a workout on a particular route compared to other users, while heat maps allows users to see where popular routes are across the globe.Strava claims Garmin has copied these features in breach of the patent, and an agreement the companies made a decade ago for Garmin not to reverse engineer some of the features of Strava’s app for its own purposes.But why are runners so exercised (see what I did there) about this? Why is my Reddit feed filled with runners freaking out?You may have heard your insufferable friend say the words “if it’s not on Strava, it didn’t happen”. Runners are obsessed with their numbers, trying to have the fastest segment times. It’s almost a cult. There arecoffee mugs, T-shirts and even people uploading theirwedding photos to Strava.The rise of Strava is happening alongside arunning boom– and like any cultural phenomenon, it’s taking place both IRL andonline. Strava makes it extremely easy to share data, making it the natural home for fitness influencers.So while there has been a bit of an outcry over Garmin forcing people to watermark their workouts posted on Strava with Garmin device information from the start of November, a lot of the reaction has actually been against Strava for bringing the case – and potentially making it harder for people to share their runs.Some users are freaking out that the case will mean their planned workoutsare no longer tracked. Some users are saying that while they like the Strava app, they’re more tied into the Garmin device fortracking workouts.One user pointed out that much of the data included in heat maps on Strava is derived from Garmin users, and Strava stands to lose out more if that data suddenly disappears.So what does Strava want Garmin to do? Or stop doing?Strava’s chief product officer Matt Salazartook to Redditearlier this month to address some of the online discourse about it. He said the case was launched after Garmin ordered Strava to comply with this new watermarking requirement, or face being cut off from being able to use Garmin data by 1 November. The case is in part an attempt to resolve this issue.In the court docs, Strava is seeking to stop Garmin from selling devices that have the alleged infringing features.Salazar’s Reddit post was titled “setting the record straight on Garmin”. But in the comments underneath his post, users are saying they won’t keep using Strava if it is cut off, and have accused Strava of hypocrisy over claims they’re trying to protect user data.At the moment, Garmin has not responded to the claims or to our request for comments. The company has an investor call at the end of the month – crucially before the 1 November Strava cut-off deadline – so I imagine we will hear more then.What should runners do? What side of this battle should they be on?Remember that if you go for a run, and it is not on Strava or Garmin, it did happen. Log off, go for a run, and touch the grass.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyExplain it to me quicklyRunningexplainersShareReuse this content"

We’ve included a few of our personal favourites here on the Filter, too.From a slow cooker to a sleep mask, a highchair food catcher to a hot brush, here are 50 tried, tested and genuinely loved recommendations.The Filter products we (and you) love the mostA perfectly portable blenderView image in fullscreenNinja Blast cordlessblender£49.99 at Ninja£44 at AmazonAfter reading the Filter’sbest blendersarticle, I actually went out and bought the cordless Ninja Blast for making protein shakes. It’s fantastic, and I can stick it in my gym bag for a quick protein hit after a workout.Leon PoultneyGo retro with an MP3 playerView image in fullscreenSnowsky Echo Mini£49.99 at AMP3£66.99 at eBayI’m a big fan of the Snowsky Echo Mini from my list of thebest MP3 players. It’s a great (re)introduction to portable music players, and the fact that it’s shaped like a cassette tape gives it a whole extra layer of charm.Alan MartinMix it up with cordless blendingView image in fullscreenKitchenAid cordless hand blender£219 at KitchenAid£219 at AmazonI really liked the rechargeable battery concept of the KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender that I tested forbest blenders– not being tied to a plug socket makes all those little jobs so much easier.Rachel OgdenBeach campfire, in a candleView image in fullscreenSmoky sea salt candle£28 at Cornish Sea SaltI hugely enjoyed testingscented candlesanddiffusers. But the one I’m obsessed with is the Smoky Sea Salt candle by Cornish Sea Salt: it makes you feel like you’re sitting around a campfire on the beach. I can’t get enough of it.Kate JacobsSleep aids for a blissful 40 winksView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOtty Original Hybrid mattressFrom £499.99 at OttyTheOtty Original Hybridmattress is my lone five-star review of the year, and the only one I subsequently bought for keeps. It continues to slay the competition.Jane HoskynFor more, read our guide tothe best mattressesView image in fullscreenMyHalos blackout sleep mask£9.99 at Amazon£12.99 at eBayThe best thing I’ve tested is the MyHalos blackout sleep mask, which costs less than £15 and romped to victory in my roundup of thebest sleep aids. I now have four, such is my fear of losing one to holiday baggage handlers or the eye mask fairy.JHCosy socksView image in fullscreenHeattech cable socks£7.90 at UniqloWe featured a pair of Heattech socks last Christmas that quickly became the most popular item ever on the Filter (since overtaken by theOtty mattressanda sub-£10 mascara, among other things). I finally succumbed to curiosity and bought myself a pair towards the end of winter, and they were just perfect for the shoulder season, keeping me warm even with bare legs. I’ve since developed a full-blown obsession with Uniqlo technical fabrics (Heattech scarves, Airism shorts …), but I don’t think I can hold the socks fully responsible.Monica HorridgeLovely booze-free bubblyView image in fullscreenL’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre£13.45 at Wine at HomeI was surprised to discover there are some really goodnon-alcoholic winesout there that taste like the real deal. The L’Arjolle Zero sparkling equilibre was my favourite: with fine bubbles and depth of flavour, it’s a convincing alternative to real bubbly. I’m planning to get in a few bottles for Christmastime to moderate the intake a little and offer booze-free imbibers something tasty.Sophia LonghiA forever dressView image in fullscreenReiss Atelier maxidress£428 at Reiss£428 at NextThis Reiss Atelier dress was one of the most expensive things I’verecommended, and I hesitated to include it, but it is a truly beautiful piece that I will wear for ever. Also – it’s on offer now!Jess Cartner-MorleyA boot to hike forView image in fullscreenSorel waterproof sneaker boot£139.49 at Sports Shoes£155 at SorelAnd I never get tired ofrecommendingmy Sorel hiking boots. Sturdy but lightweight, ridiculously comfy, not stupidly expensive – and they actually look nice too.JCMPitch-perfect campingView image in fullscreenMSR Hubba Hubba NX tent£474.99 at Cotswold Outdoor£560 at Go OutdoorsI take my MSR Hubba Hubba tent wild camping all the time: it’s quick and intuitive to pitch and has two roomy porches, so it’s easy to share with another camper. And ourBoutique Glamping bell tentcomes to weddings, festivals and family camps with us; I love having headroom.Sian LewisFor more, read our guide to thebest tentsA knife made for gardensView image in fullscreenNiwaki hori hori knife£32 at Niwaki£32 at BurfordMy green-fingered aunt bought me a hori hori knife from Niwaki (as recommended in our piece ongifts so good we buy them on repeat) and I’m obsessed: it makes weeding really fast – and fun!SLJoggers to pep up the WFH wardrobeView image in fullscreenAdidas Originals Firebird track pants£60 at Adidas£60 at AsosI bought the Adidas Firebird joggers in green after Peter Bevan highlighted them in his50 men’s summer wardrobe updates. I wanted to update my work-from-home attire, so I don’t feel like such a slob when I pop out on my lunch break. These fit the bill perfectly: they’re comfy to sit in all day, but they also look good – plus they add a nice pop of colour to my wardrobe.Lily SmithSteamed rice microwave-styleView image in fullscreenSistema rice steamer£7.99 at Currys£7.99 at AmazonI’ve always wanted a rice cooker, but I don’t have the counter space. So when I saw Joanne Gould recommend this affordable microwave version in herreview of the best rice cookers, I gave it a go. It produced much more delicious and less starchy rice than I’d ever managed in a saucepan, and all for £7.99.LSThe perfect hot brushView image in fullscreenGHD DuetBlowdry hairdryer brush£379 at GHD£379 at LookfantasticI thought nothing would make me part with my well-tried and very trustedRevlon One Step hot brush, but the GHD Duet Blowdry I tested forbest hot brushesreally did blow me away. A new favourite.Lise SmithThe great kickstart coffee machineView image in fullscreenDe’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine£419.99 at Lakeland£580 at ArgosMy family loves our De’Longhi Magnifica Evo bean-to-cup coffee machine (a kind house-warming gift), which takes the sting out of waking up by brewing fresh barista-style coffee at the touch of a button. It’s quick, easy to clean, and has a handy milk steamer for lattes and cappuccinos. I can’t face the morning without it.LSFor more, read our guide to thebest coffee machinesBrilliant slow cookingView image in fullscreenGreenPan stainless steel slow cooker£215 at CurrysView image in fullscreenNinja 8-in-1 slow cooker£149 at John Lewis£150 at ArgosTwo of the snazzyslow cookersI tested during my epickleftikosaga were particularly brilliant (the GreenPan and Ninja Foodi Impossible 8-in-1).Joanne GouldMicrowave toastiesView image in fullscreenMorphy Richards Mico£19.99 at Morphy Richards£19.99 at AmazonIntesting toastie makers, I came across a nifty microwaveable version from Morphy Richards that will have to be prised out of my cold, dead hands when the time comes to pass it on to the lovely people atGratitude Upcyclein Barnet. However, shout out to theMcGuigan Mid shirazred wine – which I tested for my piece onthe best mid-strength drinks– as it’s the most surprising thing I keep buying; at 7% it just about tastes like the stronger stuff and is a good Sunday option. It’s in loads of supermarkets, too.JGSmash the potato mashingView image in fullscreenOxo Good Grips smooth potato masher£12 at Dunelm£12 at AmazonI included the Oxo Good Grips potato masher in myFather’s Day gift guide, and it has revolutionised my mashing game. Light, fluffy and sorting your mash in seconds, it beats a wire-based design hands down and its ergonomic hand position is much easier to use. It’s also a doddle to clean: you won’t find old bits of potato stuck in the curves next time you go to mash.Charlie AllenbyBig props to no-drops food-catcherView image in fullscreenHighchair food catcher£39.95 at AmazonI’ve got a nine-month-old, and there are an awful lot of things you throw cash at in the pursuit ofmaking your life easier. One thing I couldn’t live without, though, is the Catchy. It’s essentially a bit of plastic that you fit beneath a highchair, and it catches any food, cutlery, plates and cups tossed over the side. They can then be plonked back in front of your baby because they haven’t hit the deck.CAHydrogen hydrationView image in fullscreenEcho water flask£283.99 at Healf£299 at AmazonI was sceptical about the hydrogen-infused water bottle (the price, the price!) in my test of thebest water bottles, but became a convert – chug a bottle of it and I find I’m less dehydrated the morning after boozing.Zoë PhillimoreJuice on the goView image in fullscreenAnker Nano power bank£19.99 at Anker£19.99 at AmazonAs someone who uses my phone for everything, from paying for things to unlocking my front door, it cannot be without battery. The Anker Nano – rated best for portability in Pete Wise’stest of the best power banks– gives me peace of mind that I won’t lock myself out of the house if my phone dies.ZPThe rise-and-shine alarm clockView image in fullscreenLumie Bodyclock Spark 100 sunrise alarm clock£99 at Argos£99 at BootsI had modest expectations when I started writing the Filter’s guide to thebest sunrise alarm clocks, but the Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100 dazzled me with its natural-feeling sunrise simulation. It often woke me pleasantly before the alarm went off.Pete WiseBudget-but-still-the-best child’s bike seatView image in fullscreenPolisport Bubbly Maxi Plus child seat£45 at HalfordsA dirt-cheap Halfords child bike seat. I tried frame-mounted bike seats from a number of leading brands, from £35 up to £140. In the end, it was the cheapest of the lot that caused the fewest headaches.Paddy Maddisonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I also had the confidence to invest in Fussy deodorant: it’s expensive, and too much to spend when you aren’t sure if it works –but you were correct, it does!PippaNice ice, babyView image in fullscreenLékué ice cube box£17.50 at John Lewis£8.93 at AmazonIn a bid to become the adult I always wanted to be – someone who always has ice in the house – I bought the Lékué ice box from one of ourgift guideslast Christmas. The abstract-shaped cubes are sharp and stylish, and were small enough to fit in my daughter’s water bottle this heatwave summer.Hannah BoothUltimate camping mattress for oneView image in fullscreenColeman Supercomfort single camping mat£124.95 at Outdoor ActionMy wife caught sight of Linda Geddes gamely testingcamping matsand was taken by the write-up of the Coleman Supercomfort. She ordered a single mattress immediately, and tells me it’s excellent. I’m not allowed anywhere near it.Andy ShawThe anytime massage gunView image in fullscreenBob & Brad Q2 Pro massage gun£89.99 at AmazonI tested dozens ofmassage gunsand was impressed by the Bob & Brad Q2 Pro – a small-but-mighty pummeller that’s portable. I packed it in my 100-mile ultra drop bag and, with 17 miles to go, its soothing muscle mashing turned me from the Tin Man to skipping Dorothy. Well, almost.Kieran AlgerBye chub rub, hello comfy run shortsView image in fullscreenLight control thigh slimmers, two-pack£20 at M&SMy Marks & Spencer chub rub shorts were featured inour guide to keeping cool in hot weather. They’ve saved me for many summers now.Rhiannon EvansA game for all agesView image in fullscreenMarble run£15 at Argos£20 at John LewisI also bought my son the marble run he asked forlast Christmas. Both my kids loved it, actually … as did I.REStylish twist on the waterproof coatView image in fullscreenPatent faux leather coat£36 at Sainsbury’sInspired by the Filter’s feature onhow to look good in wet weather, I upgraded my waterproof jacket. It hadn’t occurred to me that a faux patent leather jacket could work just as well as a traditional waterproof.Sabine WieselOpen your eyes to the swim maskView image in fullscreenDefy Ultra swim mask£115 at Aquasphere£97.55 at AmazonThe Aquasphere Defy Ultra swim mask – which I included in my roundup ofcold-water swimming essentials– is the most expensive pair of goggles I’ve bought, but worth every penny. I’ve swum multiple long-distance events in them. I look a bit like I’m wearing ski goggles and often get comments, but for comfort and field of vision in open water, they’re excellent.Ella FooteBrilliant babygrows with two-way zipsView image in fullscreenTwo-way zip baby sleepsuits, four-packFrom £19 at NextI was pregnant when Paddy Maddison’s article onbaby gear parents wouldn’t go withoutcame out, and soon discovered that it should beillegalto make newborn babygrows or sleepsuitswithouttwo-way zips. I love these ones from Next. If you have a pregnant friend, do them a favour and get them a pack.Laura PotterShoes to climb high inView image in fullscreenVeloce climbing shoe£110 at Nevisport£140 at Go OutdoorsAfter writing myclimbing kit article, I bought some Scarpa Veloce climbing shoes that were recommended by the coach I spoke with. They’re now my favourite ever climbing shoes.Tom BruceAn actually leak-proof water bottleView image in fullscreenIon8 water bottle£12.99 at Decathlon£13 at ArgosThe Ion8, voted top budget option in Zoë Philimore’stest of the best water bottles, is the only leak-proof bottle I’ve used. It’s managed to survive in both my daughters’ school bags without an incident.Rebecca GoodmanCamping loveseat for outdoor comfortView image in fullscreenKelty low loveseat£114.95 at Wildbounds£148.95 at AmazonTheKelty loveseat camping couchwon me brownie points when I bought it for my other half’s birthday. Well made and robust, it comfortably sits two people in a slouchy, relaxed manner. Perfect for evening campsites with a glass of beer in hand.DeborahFor more, read our guide to thebest camping chairsThe frying pan that’s chemical-freeView image in fullscreenDe Buyer steel round pancake pan, 30cm£59.98 at Nisbets£57 at AmazonI’m a convert to frying pans with no coating that you season with oil instead. Having researchedPfas-free pans, I decided that even if the health risks are uncertain, I want to try to minimise the number of products I buy that contain forever chemicals because of the potential environmental cost. So I’m gradually replacing our pans with stainless steel and carbon steel ones. I’ve also discovered the joys of cooking with a crepe pan: as well as turning out excellent pancakes, my De Buyer Mineral B crepe pan is great for toasting wraps, and makingokonomiyaki (Japanese fritters).Linda GeddesThe truly magic wand (vibrator!)View image in fullscreenDoxy die cast wand£131.55 at Secrets Shop£154.99 at BootsI named the Doxy Die Cast as my No 1 wand vibrator in my test of thebest vibrators, and I stand by that decision. It’s unapologetically loud and hefty, and packs so much power that I’ve witnessed it make women climax through thick jeans.Alix FoxMust-have beauty gadgetView image in fullscreenZiip Halo£379.99 at Ziip BeautyThere are so many beauty gadgets with high-ticket prices that it’s hard to know what’s worth investing in. The Ziip Halo microcurrent device, which I featured in my piece onat-home beauty treatments, is one of the unicorns. I’ve been using it for six months, a few times a week, and my skin looks more glowing, firmer and more snatched around the jaw. It’s so small that it fits in my makeup bag for holidays, too.Hayley SpencerElectric toothbrush with pearly serviceView image in fullscreenSuri 2.0 electric toothbrush£105 at Suri£105 at BootsI bought aSuri toothbrushand, while it’s definitely more of a pleasure to use than my previous one and is more sustainable, the thing I was most impressed with was the customer service. It stopped working, but I received a prompt response, and a replacement handle was posted to me straight away.Lisa ForemanThe pregnancy pillow you always neededView image in fullscreenDreamgenii pregnancy pillow£37.99 at Robert Dyas£53.99 at DebenhamsA lot ofpregnancy pillowsare good at supporting your tummy while elevating the legs, but they’re less good at looking after your back. The Dreamgenii did both beautifully, keeping me in a stable position without waking at 3am to stuff cushions behind my lower back. The flat section joining it together also meant nothing moved about in the night – other than the baby, and me getting up to pee. It saw me through two pregnancies, as well as being a handy feeding pillow after each of my sons arrived. My husband tried (unsuccessfully) to pinch it for himself.Lucy PaviaElevate your home diningView image in fullscreenDelouis mayonnaise£3.25 at Ocado£3.30 at WaitroseAfter testing so many delicious foods for thefood filter, I’m slowly building a shopping list of my favourites. Here are a few standouts: Delouis mayonnaise (incredible, minimally processed dijon mustard),Ollie’s kimchi(a fiery, funky and lively local ferment),Cauldron authentic organic tofu(clean, complex and well priced) andM&S pitted green queen olives(delicious chunky gordal olives).Tom HuntSecateurs that are a joyView image in fullscreenNiwaki GR Pro secateursFrom £84 at Niwaki£99.99 at CrocusIt was love at first snip with Niwaki’s GR Pro secateurs. I’d seen them about, but never before had the pleasure of taking a plant to task with them; the experience of testing a pair out for the Filter’s roundup of thebest secateurswas a joy. The cut is more of a glide, and they sit so comfortably in the hand that it feels like being reunited with a favourite jumper.Matt CollinsThe gorgeous gunk-free cafetièreView image in fullscreenEspro P7 French press£85.09 at AmazonOf the products I’ve tested, I’ve developed something of a soft spot for theEspro P7 French Press. The Espro has gone on a camping trip and a holiday to Scotland, and it’s been a godsend. It’s insulated so we could brew a litre of gorgeous-tasting coffee and work our way through it without it going stone cold, and the filter prevented 99% of the sludge from getting into our mugs. Spending almost three figures on a cafetiere may sound a bit bonkers, but when it makes great, gunk-free coffee and keeps it warm for an hour in the middle of a Welsh field, it almost seems like good value.Sasha MullerThe ultimate office chairView image in fullscreenHerman Miller Aeron chair£1,385 at Herman Miller£1,399 at John LewisThe Herman Miller Aeron chair, from mytest of the best office chairs. I loved it, my wife loved it, and the courier was mildly horrified when we sent it back, as he barely ever had to return one. Sadly, we can’t afford it.Stuart AndrewsHats off to the best capView image in fullscreenOriginal Pirate Material cap£45 at ScrtI bought my husband the Original Pirate Material cap from Peter Bevan’s50 men’s summer wardrobe updatesjust in time for Glastonbury. He loves the Streets and is never without a hat, so it was the perfect fit. Judging from the number of people we saw wearing the cap around Worthy Farm, I think a fair few Filter readers had the same idea.Ella JinaduHair care, honey pot styleView image in fullscreenGisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy mask£19 for 75ml at Cult Beauty£19 for 75ml at SpaceNKThebest thing I’ve testedthis year, hands down, is the Gisou Honey Gloss ceramide therapy hair mask. I had tried the brand’s original mask before, and found it pretty average, but this new formulation somehow made my glossy hair dreams come true without weighing my hair down. It’s an investment, but if you have long, thick hair you want to look after, it’s a brilliant choice.Sarah MatthewsStirring stuff from a great fanView image in fullscreenLume air circulator fan£149 at LumeThe best product I tested for the Filter this year was the AirCraft Lume fan. It’s so well made that it’s practically silent, so the biggest challenge is forgetting it’s on. It has a cute backlight, too. Unsurprisingly, it’s been on preorder ever since we recommended it.Caramel QuinFor more, read our guide tothe best fansDo you have a favourite Filter buy?

And yet, in four recentoff-the-record lectureson the antichrist in San Francisco, the billionaire venture capitalist has made a good case for credentialing.In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown.Thiel has previously workshopped his talks on Armageddon at Oxford and Harvard, at various theology departments, and with a few unfortunate podcasters. For a man so vocal in his disdain of our institutions of higher education, he seems to spend an awful lot of time in them.Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks,helped returna sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxed, deported, drone struck. Whofunds far-right movementsthat seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy.Immanentizing the KatechonTo be fair, Thiel has blazed a successful path outside of the ivory tower. Ungodly rich by age 30, the founder and investor has since spread the gospel of not going to college. He believes that higher education is a bubble. In his first book, co-authored with his Sancho Panza, David Sacks, he attacked US universities as bastions of diversity group-think, with slipping standards. He has evidently stuck to this diagnosis, even though admissions rates, scholarly output and Nobel prize recognition would seem to contradict it. To Thiel, even then, Jerusalem was definitely not build’d here, among these dark Satanic diploma mills.In September, Falter in Austria published a long profile about the theologian Wolfgang Palaver, who is one of those academics Thiel used as beta testers on his antichrist material. Palaver says it makes sense to him that Thiel is seeking out academics: “It’s really difficult in his environment: who tells him the truth to his face?”There is something deeply funny imagining a rapt audience, cowed by Thiel’s legend and wealth, following the billionaire into the autodidact’s private cosmos, in lectures whose bullet points were certainly more robust at the start of lecture one than at the close of lecture three. Thiel is lost in a bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations. You picture the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck sitting politely through disquisitions about the manga One Piece, Alan Moore’s Watchmen, or gripes with specific effective altruists in Silicon Valley. In one lecture, Thiel identifies “the legionnaires of the antichrist”, such as the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and former Oxford professor Nick Bostrom. In another, he considers Bill Gates as an antichrist candidate. With enemies like these, who needs friends?But such is Thiel’s odd relationship to academia. For someone who dislikes universities and researchers, he has a hard time staying away. Thiel, who received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in 1989 and a JD from Stanford Law School in 1992, was deeply impressed with the thinking of Girard, his Stanford professor. He has spent decades promoting Girard’s “mimetic theory”, including attributing his famous investment in Facebook to “betting on mimesis”. His current “Whore of Babylon” tour started with a presentation at a Paris conference devoted to Girard’s work.Thiel clearly admired Girard not just for his arguments but for his style of argumentation. These lectures don’t so much feel inspired by Girard’s ideas. They feel like his attempt to do Girard.Mimetic style over substanceGirard’s books were breathtaking in their range. They were deeply eclectic, but managed to be a mad dash through the western canon. The connections the philosopher made could seem to come out of left field, but at times the absurd swerves were held together by the sheer force of his erudition. Most importantly, Girard was always having a conversation all his own: his work could look like theology, but it wasn’t ultimately that religious; his work could look like philosophy, but wasn’t really in dialogue with academic philosophy. In San Francisco, Thiel appeared to be cosplaying this kind of performance.One of the things he replicates is the airtight and airless insularity of Girard’s thought. Thiel seems to take on board objections only to then barrel ahead with his initial instinct. Palaver is quoted in Falter as saying that he is “no longer the professor, and he’s no longer the graduate student”. It’s a funny remark because watching Thiel take feedback makes him seem exactly like a graduate student about to crash out of his comprehensive exam.In his telling, Thiel is already a part of an intellectual community. He loves telling his audience what he “always” says, he refers to standard answers and even a “spiel” that he gives. He seems a little bored with himself. Based at least on the recording, the actual audience in San Francisco seemed puzzled by Thiel’s disquisitions.Like his inspiration Girard, Thiel is prone to speaking in absolutes that, in order to make any sense at all, have to be quite a bit less than absolute. “In all times and all places, people want to always scapegoat the Christian God for our problems,” he said in his second lecture. Big if true, as they say.What is Thiel actually arguing? He suggests that we live in an age obsessed with apocalyptic thinking (keep that “we” in mind, it’ll become important later). “It’s AI, of course, it’s climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war,” “maybe fertility collapse”, he says.His overall point is that the current fixation on the apocalypse gets it wrong in two different directions: we’re too apocalyptic and “not apocalyptic enough”. Not apocalyptic enough because we tend to think of the various plausibly forecast ends of days as mutually exclusive: either climate change will get us, or nuclear war. The antichrist is Thiel’s attempt to think about the end of the world holistically.But we’re also too apocalyptic: in each lecture, Thiel comes back to the idea that “the Antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon nonstop.” Or, as he puts it in the second lecture, “the Antichrist might present himself or itself or herself as the Katechon”, meaning that withholding element that forestalls the apocalypse. This lecture is more or less a gloss on Carl Schmitt’s assertion in Nomos of the Earth, that the Katechon was what allowed for the identification ofChristianitywith the Roman empire. The doubleness of Thiel’s apocalypse – that what halts the apocalypse might in fact bring about the apocalypse – allows the billionaire to tilt boldly at any number of big questions: empire, Christianity, progress, and Silicon Valley’s dominance. Each of these, to Thiel, is ambiguous, might stymie or accelerate Armageddon.Warring with windmills, confusion and contradictionSo who or what is the antichrist? Thiel is admirably and uncharacteristically specific on this matter in a scattershot sort of way. The antichrist wants to erect a one-world state, which largely seems to mean any kind of global regulatory regime. Longtime Thiel watchers will recall his preoccupation withsovereigntyandseasteading. The antichrist appears to be any force opposing that. The antichrist also is people who are against AI, especially those who seek to regulate it. If you were hoping for Al Pacino chewing scenery, this might be a bit of a letdown. It does lead, however, to the insight that the antichrist is “someone like Greta”, as in Thunberg, the climate activist, but “not Andreessen”, as in Marc, the venture capitalist.“I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because, you know, the antichrist is popular.” Respect where it’s due: that is a good line.But let me return to Thiel’s list of possible apocalypses: artificial intelligence, climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war, fertility collapse. The list is unintentionally revealing. Thiel is probably not wrong to say that people are pretty worried about the climate crisis. But the examples of AI, bioweapons and fertility collapse in particular suggest that Thiel has confused the world’s worries for those of a very recherché set of aging tech entrepreneurs he hobnobs with. And the antichrist, too, seems very Silicon Valley-coded. This suggests, I think, that in Thiel’s mind there are two cosmic forces warring over creation itself, and they both consist of Peter and his friends.Thiel thinks that by both increasing knowledge and particularizing knowledge, modernity has made thinking of the totality more difficult. He has observed there is “this sort of incredible fragmentation of knowledge”. We do more science than ever but without true insight. In the “post-modern multiversity”, “science continues to grow like a colony of rabbits”, but since the inputs, in terms of people, degrees awarded, investment, etc, keep increasing, “you have to suspect that there are diminishing returns,” he says.So for those playing along at home: Thiel is both a “classical liberal” who just thinks in terms of inputs and outputs and wants the university to be as efficient as it can possibly be. And he is a fire-breathing theologian who thinks that the university is failing at its job of considering the totality, venerating at the altar of hyperspecialization and postmodern deathworks. He is the libertarian offended at researchers “stealing money” and “not doing anything”, he says in one lecture. And he is the campus critic he was during his Stanford days, the one who refers to former Harvard University president Claudine Gay as “the DEI person”.How any of that mishmash fits together isn’t as important as why it goes together: it serves as a justification for Thiel’s own autodidactism.What does it all mean? Anything?It’s important to note that he holds himself to a vastly different standard than just about anyone else: he thinks just raising some questions about the antichrist might be useful in its own right – which may be true for all I know. But then he wants to quantify what everyone else contributes to knowledge in a way I can only describe as Doge-like. It would be difficult to count the monetary value of theorizing about Armageddon, as he is doing while pontificating about the cost-ineffective academic from the other side of his mouth. The rules appear to be different for Thiel, at least in his own mind. And such is Thiel’s odd relationship to power.One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. “Ain’t you?” Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is?If we want to look at Thiel as something he can’t seem to see himself as – as, in the end, a pretty standard specimen of homo siliconvalliensis – then what is interesting in these lectures is not the amateurish breadth and ambition. It’s the narrowness. Thiel’s vision of the antichrist may not be holistic enough. In the first lecture, where Thiel proposes that the catastrophes we see in the various end-of-days narratives in the Bible are threatening to play out literally in our day. He says we shouldn’t think of “the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible … in a mystical way”, but almost as “rational scientific calculations of what people will be able to do to themselves in a world in which human nature is not changed or improved”.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreBut that is surely not what Revelation is about: the end of days in the Bible is in there because it attests to a view of the cosmos, its alpha and omega, its entire meaningful constitution. Otherwise, it is just a bunch of trumpets and locusts and people who give suspiciously good speeches. In the end, it isn’t clear how meaningful these four lectures make the antichrist or indeed the apocalypse.It’s not even clear how they make meaning. During the Q&A after the second lecture, someone in the audience asked Thiel whether he was moving away from his erstwhile teacher Girard – which is the central question, though perhaps not for the reason the questioner thinks. It gets at what Thiel is aiming at with these lectures. Perhaps some of their surface strangeness is explained by the fact that Thiel is ultimately engaging in some kind of Girardian play with doubles, mirrors and imitation. Not least among those would be the fact that the description he gives of the antichrist might also apply to onePeter Thiel.So maybe getting stuck on the details means we are missing the hidden, esoteric meaning within? But in that case, what’s the point of these lectures? As he warns in his third lecture, “excessive esotericism means you don’t really think coherently enough about your ideas; they get lost and you communicate them too subtly”. It feels like Thiel is keeping both options open. He gets to tap dance between “I said what I said” and “you don’t understand what I’m doing here”. He seems to want to stand apart from his own immense power – apart from his own positions, apart from his own attempts to make himself understood – in something like bemused contemplation."

It is a coming-of-age tale about an initially unlikable teenage boy growing up in the 00s, who matures through six graphic novels that deftly reference everything from Japanese manga to western superheroes, video games and Tintin. It is also, of course,a hit movie, a 2022 Netflixanime series, and a2010 video game– the last two of which were soundtracked by New York City-based indie rock band Anamanaguchi.‘My favourite scene in the Scott Pilgrim anime is where Knives and Kim are just jamming in a room together, and almost nothing happens,” laughs Peter Berkman, one of the lead songwriters and guitarists in the band. “It’s just one of those slice-of-life moments where you remember why you love music in the first place. It really struck a chord with me. No pun intended.”View image in fullscreenSex Bob-Omb in Netflix’s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.Photograph: Album/AlamyAnamanaguchi gained some notoriety for using video game hardware in their early, instrumental music, becoming one of the pioneering bands in thechiptune genre– all while they were still at college. During the band’s first self-funded tour, during which Berkman slept on the couch of the band he was supporting, he got amessage out of nowhere.“I got an email from somebody working at Ubisoft about a video game for a universal IP tie-in, and they didn’t go any further than that. ‘Could that be the new Alien vs Predator game or something like that?’, I thought. But I knew that – no matter what – when I brought that back to the band, we would say yes to whatever it was … we had all grown up loving video game and movie soundtracks.” It turned out to be an invitation to compose music for the first Scott Pilgrim video game, which was released in 2010.Now, Anamanaguchi is in the midst of a renaissance: in 2022, when the game was re-released as a Complete Edition, the band embarked on the Scott Pilgrim vs the World: The Game Soundtrack tour. Last year, the band wrote and performed music for Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, a Netflix spin-off that acts as a meta commentary on Scott’s life. Anamanaguchi supported Hatsune Miku in her Fortnite festival appearance this year, a perfect fit for a band whose identity has always rested at the intersection of video games and live music, and in August, they launched Anyway, their first record in six years, which trades in the band’s synth-based bleeps and blorps for something decidedly more alt-rock, though the 8-bit influences of its members still remain if you listen hard enough. And they’re also working on the soundtrack for a new Scott Pilgrim game, due out next year, another playful beat-’em-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a direct link between Anamanaguchi’s return to the series and the new voice they’ve found on their records. “Doing the soundtrack for the new game, Scott Pilgrim EX, allowed us to see what it would be like to dampen that aspect in our own record world, knowing that we were going full in, soundtrack-style, on the game,” says Berkman.Berkman says that in the 15 years between games, the band have matured when it comes to their approach to music. They have gained experience as producers, they have grown “as listeners of music”, and they have become even more excited by the range of styles that video game music represents.“You need to feel that connection between what you’re experiencing as a player and - even in a beat-em-up! - what the story is trying to do at that moment,” says Berkman. “If a situation calls for a dark, gothic industrial thing, we can make that happen – and we can make it happen in a way it never has before… [Scott PilgrimEX developer Tribute Games] has let us be a hands-on with the audio mix. and with the musical cues we want. That freedom is extremely important to us. The flow of the music, the way it makes you feel… you can really feel the authorship in video game soundtracks.”View image in fullscreenOn the beach in Scott Pilgrim EX.Photograph: Tribute Games IncHaving played a demo of Scott Pilgrim EX, it seems that Tribute Games’ trust in the band has paid off. The music is playful and toys with convention, setting up prompts or expectations, only to surprise you with how sound effects or motifs become part of a level’s texture. It actually reminds me of Sea Power’s work on Disco Elysium, strange as that comparison may seem to anyone who knows their music. Sea Power were given lot of creative control in adapting their sound to fit the morose world of Revachol, and Tribute Games has done the same here, even if the with pixel art, neon colours, and buoyant adolescence of it all deliver a completely different tone.“Tribute Games has given us a level of freedom that can only be matched by a company just … not knowing what you’re doing,” laughs Berkman. “We’ve been able to be a part of the development process in a way that we weren’t in the last time, you know? We’re getting nightly builds, and we’re able to ask: ‘Is this stagnant? Do I need to add a part here?’ It really helps with the arrangement, and in understanding the feel. This is the soundtrack we’ve wanted to make.”Scott Pilgrim EX will be out in 2026.

Last month, that appeared to changeFri 10 Oct 2025 14.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 15.54 EDTShareAfter nearly nine months in office, Donald Trump seems to have had enough of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, undermining his ambition to establish himself as a global peacemaker. Over the past few weeks, the US president finally decided to use his leverage to force Netanyahu to accept a new ceasefire and stop two years of genocidal war in Gaza.On Thursday, Israel and Hamasagreed to the first phaseof Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, including an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory. It’s unclear what guarantees the US gave to Hamas and Arab mediators to ensure that Netanyahu would not resume the war after the hostage-prisoner swap – if negotiations on later stages of the deal are stalled. That’s what happened earlier this year, when Netanyahu accepted a truce that took effect in January, but then refused to move into the second phase of negotiations with Hamas, andviolated the ceasefireafter two months.Back in March, Trump was still enamored with hispreposterous ideafor the US to take control of Gaza and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, displacing 2 million Palestinians. He showed little interest inpressuring Netanyahuto negotiate with Hamas to extend the ceasefire. But in recent weeks, Trump has become personally invested in ending the Gaza war – and his ego might be the one thing that keeps him engaged in preserving a peace agreement that essentially carries his name.It’s been clear since Trump took office that he’s the only world leader who could effectively pressure Netanyahu to end Israel’s war, which has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and triggered a famine in parts of Gaza. The president has considerable leverage over the Israeli premier:billions of dollarsin American weapons and constant diplomatic support for Israel at the UN security council, including multiple US vetoes of ceasefire resolutions over the past two years. Like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Israel with a virtually unlimited supply of weapons after the October 2023 Hamas attack, Trump also refused to use his influence over Netanyahu. That allowed Israel to defy global outrage and isolation, and continue its onslaught.Beware Netanyahu: he is a master of self-interest – and that’s why he signed the Hamas ceasefire deal | Ben ReiffRead moreFor two years, Netanyahu has repeatedlysabotaged negotiationsand torpedoed potential deals by adding new conditions. He prolonged the war in an evident effort to avoid early parliamentary elections and block an inquiry into his government’s security failures that led to the Hamas attack. His clinging to power alsodelayed a corruption trialbased on an earlier stint as prime minister.Trump, who has faced his own series of charges and convictions in US courts, expressed empathy for Netanyahu, calling the legal case against the Israeli leader a “witch-hunt” that should be thrown out. Last year, the international criminal courtissued an arrest warrantfor Netanyahu on charges of using starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity – and the Trump administration recently retaliated byimposing sanctionsagainst four ICC officials.But Trump appears to have soured on Netanyahu last month, after Israel launchedan attack against Qatar, targeting senior Hamas leaders who were meeting in Doha to consider a ceasefire proposal submitted by Arab and US mediators. The Hamas officials, including the group’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, survived the airstrike on 9 September. But the attack outraged Qatar’s leaders, along with other US allies in the region, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These three wealthy Gulf petrostates have each spent tens of billions of dollars on US weapons and other military assistance over the past two decades. They also all happen to have ongoing deals withTrump’s family businessfor branded real estate projects, hotels and golf resorts worth billions of dollars.Two weeks after the attack on Qatar, Trump met with a group of Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the UN general assembly. The US administration then circulated a 21-point peace plan that emerged from that meeting, which included a ceasefire, a hostage-prisoner swap, a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a transitional government led by an international body. The proposal also envisioned creating a temporary governing board for the territory that would be headed by Trump and would include Tony Blair, the former British prime minister.Trump planned to host Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September, and started pressuring the Israeli leader to prepare for a joint announcement. In the days leading up to that meeting, Netanyahu spent hours negotiating with two Trump confidants who had taken a lead role in drafting the new plan: Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and Steve Witkoff, the president’s longtime friend and Middle East envoy.According to reports inthe Israeli press, Netanyahu managed to make significant changes to the plan that Trump had negotiated with Arab and Muslim leaders. The prime minister altered the timing of Israeli troop withdrawals, enabling Israel to temporarily keep its forces in more than half of Gaza’s territory, even after Hamas released all of the Israeli hostages. Netanyahu also won concessions on requirements for Hamas to disarm and Israeli troops being ableto control a “security perimeter”inside Gaza until the territory is “properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. That could mean Israel would keep its forces in a section of Gaza indefinitely.At their White House announcement, Trump and Netanyahu presented the plan as anultimatum for Hamasto release the hostages and lay down its weapons, or face even more severe Israeli attacks – it was framed more as a surrender than a ceasefire. In a video posted after his meeting with Trump,Netanyahu boastedthat he got everything he wanted out of the US president. “Now the whole world, including the Arab and Muslim world, is pressuring Hamas to accept the terms that we created together with Trump, to bring back all the hostages – the living and the dead – while the IDF stays in the Strip,” Netanyahu said in Hebrew, in a message aimed at a domestic Israeli audience. “Who would have believed it?”Indeed, some Arab officials worried that Hamaswould reject the plan, partly because of Netanyahu’s last-minute amendments that reduced Israel’s commitment to fully withdraw from Gaza and to end the war.Hamas, which was facing pressure from two allies, Qatar and Turkey, did not refuse Trump’s deal, but didn’t fully embrace it. On 3 October, the group announced that it accepted some elements of the plan, while downplaying several key provisions, including those requiring it to disarm and give up any future role in governing Gaza. Hamas’s response was a qualified yes that called for more negotiations – and Netanyahu tried to frame it as arejection of Trump’s proposal.But the president jumped on the Hamas statement and finally pushed Netanyahu into accepting that an agreement was within reach. After Hamas issued its response,Axios reportedthat Trump had a tense call with Netanyahu, in which Trump snapped at the prime minister: “I don’t know why you’re always so fucking negative. This is a win. Take it.”Trump’s willingness to strong-arm Netanyahu was the key to achieving the initial deal that is supposed to lead to the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners in the coming days. The president will need to sustain that pressure on Netanyahu to make sure he doesn’t blow up the ceasefire, as he did in March, and resume Israel’s brutal war.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

On the world’s TV news broadcasts, the screen was split on Thursday: celebrations in Gaza and celebrations inIsrael, the scenes of cheering and clapping mirroring each other, as if to confirm that this was a war the peoples themselves wanted over long ago – and which most never wanted to begin.The images were not unfamiliar. We had seen a version of them in January, when a ceasefire was announced to great jubilation. That held only until mid-March, when Israel broke the agreement and resumed its bombardment ofGaza, an experience that should temper, and caveat, the current hope with the knowledge that things can unravel at any moment. Still, this time, even the region’s most seasoned pessimists concede, the deal looks more durable.So how did it come about and who deserves the credit? Often a breakthrough such as this is the result of both parties shifting their positions, more or less equally. At first glance, it can seem as if that is what happened here. Hamas was clearly weakened, with Israel having eliminated its leaders and diminished its great patron, Iran. And Donald Trump ensured that those states with leverage over Hamas – Qatar, Turkey and Egypt – pushed the organisation to say yes. (He did that using tools uniquely held by the US, agreeing, for example,a defence pact with Qatarthat gives the Gulf state Nato-level protection.)Even so, and despitethe best effortsof Benjamin Netanyahu’s advocates to suggest otherwise, Hamas was not forced to make a major shift in its stance. Trump’s 20-point plan might call for the group to hand over its weapons, but Hamas has made no commitment on that and there is no mention of it in the current, fairly narrow ceasefire agreement billed as the first phase of the deal.From the start, the group said it would hand over the hostages it held once Israel agreed to release Palestinian prisoners, eventually withdraw its forces from Gaza and end the war. Sure, the withdrawal will be done in stages, but those three moves are what Israel has broadly agreed to. AsMichael Milstein, a former colonel in Israeli military intelligence widely regarded as the country’s foremost analyst of Hamas, put it to me when we spoke: “Let’s face it, Hamas didn’t really change anything dramatically in its basic positions.”In other words, the big shift has been in the Israeli stance. Just a few days before Trump unveiled his plan at the White House with Netanyahu at his side, the Israeli prime minister was telling the UN in New York that the war would not end untilHamaswas entirely destroyed. Now he has agreed to a deal that leaves Hamas in place. He has accepted what he had previously deemed unacceptable. What got him to do that?The concise answer is that Donald Trump at last wielded the full might of his office and called time on the war. He left Netanyahu in no doubt that his patience had run out, confident that the Israeli PM had nowhere else to turn. Over the past two years, Netanyahu has shown the middle finger to everyone else – including Israel’s historic friends and allies – leaving him dependent on Trump alone. If the US president said the war had to end, it had to end. As Trump himself told Netanyahu: “Israel cannot fight the world.”Most observers suspect that Trump decided to put his foot down after Israel’s 9 September failed attack on the Hamas negotiating team in Doha. Trump took that as a personal affront. Not only did Netanyahu give him insufficient warning that Israel was planning to kill the very people with whom it needed to discuss an agreement, he did it on the sovereign territory of a country with which Trump has personal and financial ties: recall that the Qataris had gifted Trump a new plane to use as Air Force One. It was an act of hubris by Netanyahu. And, like a mafia don insulted by an attempted hit on one of his business associates, Trump decided it was time to remind the Israeli PM who was boss.1:59'The mood is jubilant': Guardian journalist at hostages square in Tel Aviv – videoThe US president also noted the loud protests on Israeli streets, as the public there demanded an end to the war, and the global outrage caused by Israel’s shattering of Gaza, and calculated that brokering a ceasefire deal would bring him the kudos that, though he often affects to disdain international opinion, he craves. To say nothing of the Nobel peace prize, which he covets as the one priceless bauble that has so far eluded him. Such is the power of a US president that, once he decided to use it, the pieces swiftly fell into place.Does that, then, makeDonald Trumpthe hero of this hour? Those of us who have opposed him with such vehemence this past decade should swallow hard and give credit where it is due. His willingness to bully and twist arms, his command of global attention, his force of personality were all deployed, on this occasion, towards a noble goal: to stop the killing and to free the hostages.But any admiration has to be qualified by a single, hard fact. Trump could have done this so much earlier. When he returned to the White House on 20 January, a ceasefire deal not too different from this one was in place. When Netanyahu moved to break that ceasefire in March, Trump could have slammed his foot down then and said no. Instead, he gave him a green light – and what followed was, in many ways, the worst six months of the war. Trump had the power to stop it – and he chose not to.Of course, this same critique applies in spades to Netanyahu himself. Indeed, the offence is worse because a deal broadly similar to the one he agreed this week was on offer as early as June 2024. But he refused it, and others like it that followed, deciding at each turn that his personal and political interests were best served by ongoing war. True, Joe Biden deserves blame for not using US power to demand a halt (though his situation was harder than his successor’s, if only because Donald Trump does not have a Donald Trump in the wings, seemingly promising Netanyahu better terms). But Netanyahu’s culpability runs deep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Palestinian lives destroyed in Gaza since then; the hunger as Israel shut off aid. And from Israel’s own point of view: the hostages forced to endure seven months more in captivity; the soldiers killed in action; the demolition of Israel’s standing, especially over aid, turning the country into a global pariah. “It’s really a catastrophe,” says Milstein, “because it seems we made a very long voyage only to find ourselves once again at exactly the same point.” You can pass a similarly damning judgment on Hamas: it could have ended Gaza’s agony so much earlier by releasing all the hostages.As it turns out,Trump did not get his Nobel– not this year, at any rate. If he really wants it, it’s clear what he has to do. He has to stay as engaged over the coming months and years as he has been these past 10 days. Every one of his plan’s 20 points contains enough unresolved tensions to bring the entire thing crashing down.Above all, he has to stay on Netanyahu’s case, alert to the danger that Netanyahu will bank what has been agreed and never move on to what is meant to come next. Note the Netanyahu ally who starkly declared: “There’s no phase two.” Trump cannot tolerate that. He has to maintain the pressure, preventing Netanyahu from playing any of his usual games. If Trump really wants the prize of peace, there is no other way.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

And yet, in four recentoff-the-record lectureson the antichrist in San Francisco, the billionaire venture capitalist has made a good case for credentialing.In these meandering talks, Thiel is clearly aiming for the kind of syncretic thinking he so relished in the books and lectures of the philosopher and professor René Girard, whom he knew at Stanford University and whose work he has long admired. Unfortunately, more often than not, Thiel ends up with something that reads like Dan Brown.Thiel has previously workshopped his talks on Armageddon at Oxford and Harvard, at various theology departments, and with a few unfortunate podcasters. For a man so vocal in his disdain of our institutions of higher education, he seems to spend an awful lot of time in them.Overall, the picture of Thiel that emerges in these lectures is someone desperately trying to disidentify from their own power. “You realize,” he tells his audience when interpreting a particular Japanese manga, “in my interpretation … who runs the world is something like the antichrist.” Here’s a man who, together with a couple of fellow Silicon Valley freaks,helped returna sundowning caudillo to a presidency he is obviously unsuited for, and who uses the awesome might of the US government to remake society and the world. A man who funds the companies that harness your data and determine who gets doxed, deported, drone struck. Whofunds far-right movementsthat seek to remake the very face of liberal democracy.Immanentizing the KatechonTo be fair, Thiel has blazed a successful path outside of the ivory tower. Ungodly rich by age 30, the founder and investor has since spread the gospel of not going to college. He believes that higher education is a bubble. In his first book, co-authored with his Sancho Panza, David Sacks, he attacked US universities as bastions of diversity group-think, with slipping standards. He has evidently stuck to this diagnosis, even though admissions rates, scholarly output and Nobel prize recognition would seem to contradict it. To Thiel, even then, Jerusalem was definitely not build’d here, among these dark Satanic diploma mills.In September, Falter in Austria published a long profile about the theologian Wolfgang Palaver, who is one of those academics Thiel used as beta testers on his antichrist material. Palaver says it makes sense to him that Thiel is seeking out academics: “It’s really difficult in his environment: who tells him the truth to his face?”There is something deeply funny imagining a rapt audience, cowed by Thiel’s legend and wealth, following the billionaire into the autodidact’s private cosmos, in lectures whose bullet points were certainly more robust at the start of lecture one than at the close of lecture three. Thiel is lost in a bizarre thicket of his own references and preoccupations. You picture the theological faculty at the University of Innsbruck sitting politely through disquisitions about the manga One Piece, Alan Moore’s Watchmen, or gripes with specific effective altruists in Silicon Valley. In one lecture, Thiel identifies “the legionnaires of the antichrist”, such as the researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky and former Oxford professor Nick Bostrom. In another, he considers Bill Gates as an antichrist candidate. With enemies like these, who needs friends?But such is Thiel’s odd relationship to academia. For someone who dislikes universities and researchers, he has a hard time staying away. Thiel, who received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford in 1989 and a JD from Stanford Law School in 1992, was deeply impressed with the thinking of Girard, his Stanford professor. He has spent decades promoting Girard’s “mimetic theory”, including attributing his famous investment in Facebook to “betting on mimesis”. His current “Whore of Babylon” tour started with a presentation at a Paris conference devoted to Girard’s work.Thiel clearly admired Girard not just for his arguments but for his style of argumentation. These lectures don’t so much feel inspired by Girard’s ideas. They feel like his attempt to do Girard.Mimetic style over substanceGirard’s books were breathtaking in their range. They were deeply eclectic, but managed to be a mad dash through the western canon. The connections the philosopher made could seem to come out of left field, but at times the absurd swerves were held together by the sheer force of his erudition. Most importantly, Girard was always having a conversation all his own: his work could look like theology, but it wasn’t ultimately that religious; his work could look like philosophy, but wasn’t really in dialogue with academic philosophy. In San Francisco, Thiel appeared to be cosplaying this kind of performance.One of the things he replicates is the airtight and airless insularity of Girard’s thought. Thiel seems to take on board objections only to then barrel ahead with his initial instinct. Palaver is quoted in Falter as saying that he is “no longer the professor, and he’s no longer the graduate student”. It’s a funny remark because watching Thiel take feedback makes him seem exactly like a graduate student about to crash out of his comprehensive exam.In his telling, Thiel is already a part of an intellectual community. He loves telling his audience what he “always” says, he refers to standard answers and even a “spiel” that he gives. He seems a little bored with himself. Based at least on the recording, the actual audience in San Francisco seemed puzzled by Thiel’s disquisitions.Like his inspiration Girard, Thiel is prone to speaking in absolutes that, in order to make any sense at all, have to be quite a bit less than absolute. “In all times and all places, people want to always scapegoat the Christian God for our problems,” he said in his second lecture. Big if true, as they say.What is Thiel actually arguing? He suggests that we live in an age obsessed with apocalyptic thinking (keep that “we” in mind, it’ll become important later). “It’s AI, of course, it’s climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war,” “maybe fertility collapse”, he says.His overall point is that the current fixation on the apocalypse gets it wrong in two different directions: we’re too apocalyptic and “not apocalyptic enough”. Not apocalyptic enough because we tend to think of the various plausibly forecast ends of days as mutually exclusive: either climate change will get us, or nuclear war. The antichrist is Thiel’s attempt to think about the end of the world holistically.But we’re also too apocalyptic: in each lecture, Thiel comes back to the idea that “the Antichrist will come to power by talking about Armageddon nonstop.” Or, as he puts it in the second lecture, “the Antichrist might present himself or itself or herself as the Katechon”, meaning that withholding element that forestalls the apocalypse. This lecture is more or less a gloss on Carl Schmitt’s assertion in Nomos of the Earth, that the Katechon was what allowed for the identification ofChristianitywith the Roman empire. The doubleness of Thiel’s apocalypse – that what halts the apocalypse might in fact bring about the apocalypse – allows the billionaire to tilt boldly at any number of big questions: empire, Christianity, progress, and Silicon Valley’s dominance. Each of these, to Thiel, is ambiguous, might stymie or accelerate Armageddon.Warring with windmills, confusion and contradictionSo who or what is the antichrist? Thiel is admirably and uncharacteristically specific on this matter in a scattershot sort of way. The antichrist wants to erect a one-world state, which largely seems to mean any kind of global regulatory regime. Longtime Thiel watchers will recall his preoccupation withsovereigntyandseasteading. The antichrist appears to be any force opposing that. The antichrist also is people who are against AI, especially those who seek to regulate it. If you were hoping for Al Pacino chewing scenery, this might be a bit of a letdown. It does lead, however, to the insight that the antichrist is “someone like Greta”, as in Thunberg, the climate activist, but “not Andreessen”, as in Marc, the venture capitalist.“I think Andreessen is not the antichrist. Because, you know, the antichrist is popular.” Respect where it’s due: that is a good line.But let me return to Thiel’s list of possible apocalypses: artificial intelligence, climate change, bioweapons, nuclear war, fertility collapse. The list is unintentionally revealing. Thiel is probably not wrong to say that people are pretty worried about the climate crisis. But the examples of AI, bioweapons and fertility collapse in particular suggest that Thiel has confused the world’s worries for those of a very recherché set of aging tech entrepreneurs he hobnobs with. And the antichrist, too, seems very Silicon Valley-coded. This suggests, I think, that in Thiel’s mind there are two cosmic forces warring over creation itself, and they both consist of Peter and his friends.Thiel thinks that by both increasing knowledge and particularizing knowledge, modernity has made thinking of the totality more difficult. He has observed there is “this sort of incredible fragmentation of knowledge”. We do more science than ever but without true insight. In the “post-modern multiversity”, “science continues to grow like a colony of rabbits”, but since the inputs, in terms of people, degrees awarded, investment, etc, keep increasing, “you have to suspect that there are diminishing returns,” he says.So for those playing along at home: Thiel is both a “classical liberal” who just thinks in terms of inputs and outputs and wants the university to be as efficient as it can possibly be. And he is a fire-breathing theologian who thinks that the university is failing at its job of considering the totality, venerating at the altar of hyperspecialization and postmodern deathworks. He is the libertarian offended at researchers “stealing money” and “not doing anything”, he says in one lecture. And he is the campus critic he was during his Stanford days, the one who refers to former Harvard University president Claudine Gay as “the DEI person”.How any of that mishmash fits together isn’t as important as why it goes together: it serves as a justification for Thiel’s own autodidactism.What does it all mean? Anything?It’s important to note that he holds himself to a vastly different standard than just about anyone else: he thinks just raising some questions about the antichrist might be useful in its own right – which may be true for all I know. But then he wants to quantify what everyone else contributes to knowledge in a way I can only describe as Doge-like. It would be difficult to count the monetary value of theorizing about Armageddon, as he is doing while pontificating about the cost-ineffective academic from the other side of his mouth. The rules appear to be different for Thiel, at least in his own mind. And such is Thiel’s odd relationship to power.One is reminded of the scene in Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen’s character comes across a platoon and asks who’s in charge here. “Ain’t you?” Ain’t you running the world, Peter? If it isn’t you, who is?If we want to look at Thiel as something he can’t seem to see himself as – as, in the end, a pretty standard specimen of homo siliconvalliensis – then what is interesting in these lectures is not the amateurish breadth and ambition. It’s the narrowness. Thiel’s vision of the antichrist may not be holistic enough. In the first lecture, where Thiel proposes that the catastrophes we see in the various end-of-days narratives in the Bible are threatening to play out literally in our day. He says we shouldn’t think of “the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible … in a mystical way”, but almost as “rational scientific calculations of what people will be able to do to themselves in a world in which human nature is not changed or improved”.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreBut that is surely not what Revelation is about: the end of days in the Bible is in there because it attests to a view of the cosmos, its alpha and omega, its entire meaningful constitution. Otherwise, it is just a bunch of trumpets and locusts and people who give suspiciously good speeches. In the end, it isn’t clear how meaningful these four lectures make the antichrist or indeed the apocalypse.It’s not even clear how they make meaning. During the Q&A after the second lecture, someone in the audience asked Thiel whether he was moving away from his erstwhile teacher Girard – which is the central question, though perhaps not for the reason the questioner thinks. It gets at what Thiel is aiming at with these lectures. Perhaps some of their surface strangeness is explained by the fact that Thiel is ultimately engaging in some kind of Girardian play with doubles, mirrors and imitation. Not least among those would be the fact that the description he gives of the antichrist might also apply to onePeter Thiel.So maybe getting stuck on the details means we are missing the hidden, esoteric meaning within? But in that case, what’s the point of these lectures? As he warns in his third lecture, “excessive esotericism means you don’t really think coherently enough about your ideas; they get lost and you communicate them too subtly”. It feels like Thiel is keeping both options open. He gets to tap dance between “I said what I said” and “you don’t understand what I’m doing here”. He seems to want to stand apart from his own immense power – apart from his own positions, apart from his own attempts to make himself understood – in something like bemused contemplation."

But he has shifted gears before and may do so againFri 10 Oct 2025 09.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 11.19 EDTShareIn Gaza,children,journalistsandrescue workerswho have seen their peers and colleagues killed in front of their eyes for the past two years have started to rejoice at the prospect that their living nightmare could finally be over. So, too, have thefamilies of Israeli hostageswho thought they might never see their loved ones again. We can only share in their relief. And still, the reasons to be wary of the ceasefire’s long-term prospects are endless.We have been here before. I’m haunted bya videofrom back in January, in which 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif removes his press vest and helmet live on air before being hoisted aloft by a joyous crowd as he announces news of a ceasefire. That deal led to several successful exchanges of Israeli and Palestinian captives and brought two months of relative respite to Gaza – before Israel tore up the agreement by launching more than 100 airstrikes on the besieged territory in one night,killing more than 400 Palestinians. Five months later, Israel bombed a press tent outside a Gaza City hospital, killing Sharif andfive other journalists.A bad deal is better than no deal (and with Donald Trump and Tony Blair at the helm of Gaza’s future, this iscertainly a bad deal), but what is especially concerning is the shift in official discourse that suggests we may not even get that far. According to Trump’sannouncementon Wednesday night, what the parties have agreed to is, in fact, only “the first phase” – a term that does not appear anywhere in thetext of the agreement itself, and is more reminiscent of the January deal which Israel moulded to facilitate a resumption of the war after a few dozen hostages were released.This linguistic bait-and-switch was not arbitrary. As the journalist Amit Segal, considered one of Benjamin Netanyahu’s mouthpieces in the Israeli media,saidon Thursday morning: “There’s no phase two. That’s clear to everyone, right? Phase two might happen someday, but it’s unrelated to what’s just been signed. The deal signed now is a hostage release deal. It doesn’t imply anything about the future.”So should we take from this that Netanyahu is already planning to resume the war after the remaining hostages have been released, as he did last time? That is certainly one reading. But longtime observers of the Israeli prime minister will know that what has kept him at the top for so many years is his ability to spin multiple plates at once, juggling them as he works out which one will best serve his personal and political agenda at any given moment. And right now, his calculations appear to have shifted.To understand Netanyahu, you need to understand what influences his decision-making. The first major factor is his ongoing trial in an Israeli court after his 2019 indictment for bribery, fraud and breach of trust – charges that carry significant prison time. Since then, Netanyahu has been more determined than ever to retain the position of prime minister in order to drag out the trial and fend off the charges. This is what led him to throw his political weight behindmessianic fundamentalistsahead of the 2022 election in order to safeguard his return to the premiership, and it has been a key driver of hisgovernment’s crusadeagainst the independence of Israel’s judicial system.The second factor is the reason he got into politics in the first place: to thwart any meaningful progress toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. From driving a spear through the remnants of the Oslo peace process upon first taking power in the 1990s, to paying lip service to subsequent US peace initiatives while legislating piecemeal annexation of the occupied West Bank, Netanyahu has made it his life’s mission to ensure that no Palestinian state can ever come to exist between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.Since 7 October, these motivations have fused to devastating effect. After the deadliest attack on Israelis in the country’s history, Netanyahu’s approval rating slumped to an all-time low. His desperation to cling to power led him to dive head-first into a genocidal war with no clear aims in the hope that it would keep his government together long enough for him to restore some semblance of his prior prestige. This meantsabotaging ceasefire negotiationsat almost every turn, and cutting short the deal he signed last January when it suited him.1:59'The mood is jubilant': Guardian journalist at hostages square in Tel Aviv – videoHaving long pioneered a policy of “managing the conflict” in order to keep the Palestinians subdued, Netanyahu soon began spinning a different plate. Enticed by the prospect ofremoving 2 million Palestiniansfrom the demographic equation once and for all, and emboldened by Trump’s own sudden fascination with a “Gaza Riviera”, the Israeli prime minister embraced theeliminationist agendaof the extreme right. He pursuedvariousavenuesin an effort to ethnically cleanse the territory of Palestinians, but ultimately ran up against aresolute Egyptian borderand a lack of interest around the world in absorbing hundreds of thousands of starving refugees.Netanyahu has decided to shift gears once again and sign the new ceasefire deal. His efforts to empty Gaza of Palestinianshave failed. Israel is becoming a global pariah, with all the economic and cultural burdens that entails. His approval rating isn’t getting any higher – despite all of the military achievements heproudly proclaimedat last month’s UN general assembly – and there is an election on the horizon.Now, it seems, he believes he has more to gain fromdeclaring a comprehensive victoryin Gaza to launch his re-election campaign than from continuing the war. If he loses the messianic wing of his coalition, whose leadersare threateningto quit the government in response to the ceasefire, so be it; he’ll reach across the aisle in the name of “national responsibility” and find old-new partners.Photo ops with returning Israeli hostages and a triumphant Trump, who is set to visit Israel in the coming days, will do that campaign no harm. Nor would steps toward additional normalisation agreements which a ceasefire might make possible, perhaps with Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, or even Syria. As a result of his own calculations and a little more pressure from the White House than he is used to, Netanyahu is leaning into the deal,extolling its virtuesand stroking Trump’s ego – most recently bytweetingan AI-generated image in which he is placing a giant “Nobel peace prize” medal around the president’s neck in front of an adoring crowd.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s over!’ they shout, but people here in Gaza still fear what the future may bring | Hassan Abo QamarRead moreYet by splitting the implementation of the ceasefire into phases, the Israeli prime minister is once again giving himself the option of sabotaging it if he changes his mind. Certainly, he has no intention whatsoever of paving “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”, as the agreement stipulates. The rest of the international community, which has either stood by or given its backing for two years as Israel pulverisedGaza, simply cannot allow Netanyahu to subvert another deal, and should be intervening already to ensure that any deviation will be met with diplomatic might.Nor can the international community take its foot off the gas as Israel inevitably shifts its focus to the West Bank, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forcibly displaced over the past two years. Recognition of Palestinian statehood means nothing as long as Israel is allowed tocontinue devouring Palestinian landwith impunity. The annihilatory fervour that has taken hold among a large segment of Israeli society will not dissipate overnight, which is why the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem haswarnedthat the genocide could just as easily pivot to the West Bank.And even if the ceasefire holds, there can be no going back to an illusory pre-7 October “business as usual”. Crimes against humanity demand accountability and justice, most of all for those who didn’t live to see them end.

We must keep our eyes on MillerFri 10 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 11.37 EDTShareIn an interview on Monday,CNN’sBoris Sanchez asked Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, whetherDonald Trumpintended toabideby federal judge Karin Immergut’s order blocking the deployment of the national guard in Oregon.Miller said neither yes nor no. But the implication was no. Theadministrationhad already filed an appeal with the ninth circuit. He said: “I would note the administration won an identical case in the ninth circuit just a few months ago with respect to the federalizing of the California national guard.” Actually, it didn’t quite win. As I understand it (and lawyers, please correct me) the administration won a temporary stay on a temporary injunction against federalizing the California national guard in Los Angeles.Then Miller continued: “Under Title 10 of the US Code, the president has plenary authority, has–”There he abruptly stopped. The man whose entire head looks as if it’s covered by a stocking mask seemed to betray a feeling. Maybe regret, maybe embarrassment. Maybe:Oh shit, I just gave away the game.Miller blinked several times. Sanchez called his name and asked if he could hear him. Miller did not respond. Then Sanchez apologized for technical difficulties and cut to a commercial break. When the interview came back on the air, the wordsplenary authoritywere not uttered. The clip CNN posted to the internet deletedthat bit of the conversation, but it was widely posted and viewed anyway.Plenary authority, or plenary power, means absolute, unlimited, and unchecked power.The power of a king. The power of Caesar, of Hitler, of Stalin.Title 10 of the US Code, which covers the structure and laws of the military, refers little to the president, and most of that is about appointing secretaries and submitting a budget to Congress. There’s nothing in the code that remotely suggests absolute presidential power.The constitution gives the president only one unchecked power: the power of the pardon. Even theInsurrection Act, under which a president can impose martial law and overstep other laws and judicial orders, is restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Or so some commentators, sunnier than I, have reassured.In short, the executive branch is supposed to be checked and balanced by the other two branches of government. That the other two branches of government don’t feel like checking or balancing at the moment does not give the president absolute power.The meticulously lawyerly way in which Miller lied about the US Code is complemented by the vague, all-encompassing apocalyptic rhetoric with which he is preparing Maga for war against the domestic enemy.“We are the storm,” he thundered atCharlie Kirk’sfuneral, in aspeechsome listeners havecomparedto one the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels gave at a 1932 campaign rally. “Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion. Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry,” he continued. “We stand for what is good, what is virtuous, and what is noble.”And who are “our enemies”? They are both mighty – “the forces of darkness and evil” – and puny. Turning his address to “you”, the enemy, he went on: “You are nothing. You have nothing. You are wickedness, you are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing! You can build nothing, you can produce nothing. You can create nothing.“You have no idea the dragon you have awakened. You have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization. To save the west, to save this republic.”Miller referred to the future generations of “our children” and to the nothingness to which “you” will eventually come. Or rather, be delivered.AsTrump grows increasingly incoherentand emotionally labile, Miller grows more and more influential. He is the president’s brain, his discipline. Where Trump has no guiding principles, Miller is a resolute ideologue of white, western supremacy and a tactician of final solutions. Trump is easily lampooned, but Miller is the grimmest of reapers.Timothy Snyder, the historian and author of the influential book On Tyranny, posted avideoon his Substack, comparing Miller to Stalin. One thing he said is that Stalin gained power as Lenin’s health failed. Lenin’s leadership ran from 1917 to 1924, but he was incapacitated by strokes beginning in 1922. Stalin’s murderous reign lasted until 1953.In Stephen Miller, we see that Maga will not simply end with Trump. We must keep our eyes on him, contest everything he does and says. Because – while this may be hard to fathom – if the US ends up with Miller as its dictator, we are in even deeper trouble than we are with Trump, and it could last a lot longer.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, comes across as a weary grandpa, glasses perched halfway down his nose as he reads his script in sleep-inducing monotone. Quick – who’s the minority leader of the House? You get bonus points if you can identify Hakeem Jeffries. Charismatic he is not.What’s to be done?Democrats cannot afford to play possum and wait for Trump to implode, as onetime political guru James Carville urged in a New York Times opinion piece. That won’t be Trump’s fate – his boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters isn’t far off the mark.Barack Obama could go toe-to-toe with Trump. He’s the most popular living president – a YouGov poll, taken just before the last election, showed that over half of all Americans would most likely vote for him. Although the two-term president can’t run again, he’d garner the attention that Democrats badly need.But the former president has had next to nothing to say about Trump’s initiatives. While he has scolded Democratic politicians for not speaking out, he has gone silent. He hasn’t appeared at any public event staged by opponents of the president. Instead, he’s producing movies and documentaries, playing golf (as of 2016, he was an “honest 13”) and building an $18m mansion in Hawaii.What’s the alternative?Several presidential hopefuls have already hit the rubber-chicken circuit, making coy noises about their intentions for 2028, but that’s not nearly good enough. These desperate times demand boldness. Here’s my proposition:a leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now.Hear me out before you start laughing.For starters, the reign of theancien regimeand its timid successors like Kamala Harris is finally over. That’s the message delivered by 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, who trounced septuagenarian Andrew Cuomo, avatar of the past, in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary. Whoever runs for president should take a leaf from Mamdani’s playbook. No more tedious, repetitious TV ads. It is essential to reach voters where they are, knocking on doors, listening to what they say about what matters to them, then turning out a stream of TikTok and Instagram videos, delivering messages that resonate.Goodbye to laundry lists of forgettable nostrums, like the multipoint policy plans that Harris lugged around. My ideal candidate must have the skill to communicate ideas – bold ideas, not small-bore suggestions – in a non-wonky way. As former New York governor Mario Cuomo memorably put it: “You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.”While it’s hard to imagine any Democrat winning over the Maga diehards, Republican voters who held their noses and voted for Trump could be swayed by someone who concentrated on meat-and-potato issues, pledging to build millions of units of affordable housing, deliver universal preschool and affordable healthcare, picking up the bill with a fair tax law. That was Mamdani’s message, and a considerable number of Trump backers voted for him after hearing his pitch.My candidate should be prepared to take on some of the Democratic party’s sacred cows. Assailing Israel for the war crimes committed in Gaza comes to mind.The toughest hurdle is raising enough money to be taken seriously, but it isn’t impossible. Billionaires including the Democratic mega-donor George Soros, Bill Gates, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently formed a group called Billionaires Against Billionaires to do battle with Trump’s coterie of billionaires. Imagine the impact if these mega-donors join forces with grassroots groups nationwide.The Democratic Party has a deep bench, and there’s no shortage of politicians who could fill the bill. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear are among those who come to mind. And while the first profile-in-courage candidate will have first-mover advantage, others may well enter the fray.Let’s be clear – there isn’t a candidate, no matter how artful, who has a prayer of dislodging Trump from his imperial perch. But the presidential hopeful who decides that now is the time to present themself as a genuine alternative will attract attention, and right now, attention is what matters most. Unless someone steps up – and improbable as this scenario is, I haven’t come up with a better alternative – the Democrats will be giving Trump a free pass for the next three and a half years. Think about what this human wrecking ball can achieve in that time.David Kirp is professor emeritus at the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California-BerkeleyExplore more on these topicsUS politicsHow can Democrats win?DemocratsDonald TrumpUS CongressRepublicansTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

The fate of the US, and the poisonous entente of corporate media monopoly and far-right leadership, has made the prospect of anti-democratic contagion now impossible to ignore. Measures to protect the young have taken shape with relative speed, with Australia extolling its pioneering (and unproven)initiatives on age-verification and social network restrictiondue to take effect on 10 December.The relationship between transnational monopolies, mass media, sovereignty, human rights and democratic freedom has been placed on the national and global agenda. The nexus is almost invariably presented as a new threat, the perilous fruit of technological change, encountered for the first time without meaningful precedent.The US right claimed free speech was sacred – until the Charlie Kirk killingRead moreEvery age assumes the dislocations of its time are exceptional, but the present one seems particularly indifferent to earlier moments of technologically induced disequilibrium. Almost exactly a century ago, the League of Nations, precursor to theUnited Nations, devoted substantial energies to the international suppression of obscene publications, animated in part by the purported corruptive power of the motion picture. There was even an international ban on such “obscene” products, which Australia eventually signed.Maligned as it was, the League rapidly grasped the potential of the first truly transnational media form: the radio. Hopeful proposals for both radio and film in the service of peace, education and international understanding soon developed. Australia dutifully signed up to the relevant League treaty.But more impressive perhaps was the League’s comparative agility when the pitfalls of radio, rather than their promises, became apparent. As the shadow of Nazi ideology began to fall on Geneva in the 1930s, League intellectuals and jurists conferred over several years on the threat posed by what was termed at the time “false news”. League conferences on the subjectaffirmed that “the campaign against the spread of inaccurate news was one of the necessities of international life” and mapped out countermeasures.Their deliberations exemplified the prescient futility that characterised so much of the organisation:by the point at which propaganda radio broadcasts were formally banned in 1936, fascist forces were contesting not merely the airwaves, but the ground, the seas and the air.View image in fullscreenAdolf Hitler gestures during a speech. By May 1939 the propaganda broadcasts of Nazi Germany could reach Australian homes.Photograph: dpa/APEven then, though, the much-mocked League did show surprising energy,insisting that broadcasterstransmit corrections to fascist claims. Debate in the Australian Senate noted the propaganda potential of radio, though remained, almost on the eve of world war, inclined to optimism about the new medium. By May 1939, in the right conditions, the propaganda broadcasts of Nazi Germany could reach Australian homes – and some even directly addressed Australians.For Australian senator Macartney Abbott, this was a kind of paradoxical demonstration that radio could be used by others for international dialogue. As on disarmament and peaceful dispute resolution, the League’s experts were weak and correct – and appreciated much too late.Almost a decade of destruction later, the fledgling United Nations revisited many of the League’s same questions. Delegates recognised that early electronic and industrial-scale mass media, especially when forged alongside radically new armaments and hyper-centralised state power, demanded moderation and management.View image in fullscreenEleanor Roosevelt speaks at the United Nations in July 1947.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesFrom the very first days of the organisation in early 1946, the problem of “freedom of information” was among the most prominent items on the agenda for building what Eleanor Roosevelt would term “a world made new”. Well before the two signature achievements of the early UN – the genocide convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rghts – the assembled representatives were engaged with what seemed, for many, a more foundational challenge: media and the global information environment.Roosevelt explained that a solution here “wasthe one absolute necessity” for future success on human rights, because if public opinion and informed debate was compromised, all would be futile. Britain’s delegate warned that the world should “find some way in which we can restrain irresponsible perversion or suppressions of the truth”, and emphasised the role of “authorities who control the radio systems of the world”. Canada noted the triumph of Hitler’s “Big Lie”.Newer states, foremost India, which had just won independence from imperial control, were troubled by the massive technological and financial power of foreign media and the ways in which it threatened their own precarious sovereignty. India also warned that freedom of press should not be mistaken as “licence” to attack “nations and racial groups”. Liberated France spoke with fresh memories of fascist and collaborationist press, and lamented that without international agreement, “selfish interests” could prevail “under the guise of freedom”. A dedicated conference to draft a UN treaty was held in Geneva during the spring of 1948.Predictably, and clumsily, the Soviet Union sought to amend the proposals into a global compact for its own model of totalitarian information management. Undeterred, each of the more liberal powers tried to navigate a path that prevented abuse of freedom and its counterpart, abuse of “responsibility”. International mechanisms to sanction and punish the broadcast of deliberate falsehoods were seriously entertained. As technological progress had amplified the global power of the press, there was astute recognition of a corresponding accountability. Before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights even had an agreed final name, a convention on freedom of information had been drafted.The draft, however, never formalised into one of the UN’s instruments for securing human rights. By 1953, rightwing reactionaries in the US had ensured the convention’s failure. Over the half-century that followed, the US opposed every attempt at update and resurrection – notably the flawed and provocatively titled “New World Information and Communications Order” of the late 1970s. Rather than trying to build on the admittedly imperfect foundations of the 1940s vision, an aversion to confronting the powerful has been the invariable reflex of America’s allied governments in Australia and Europe.With the ruinous result of the US approach to freedom of information and media now apparent, the few remaining democracies may wish to reconsider whether they are well served by their long history of capitulation. Unrestrained misinformation and cynical professions of “freedom of expression” from fascist demagogues was a lesson briefly and bloodily learned in the age of the crystal oscillator and the vacuum tube. It is very grim to be learning it again in the age of the fibre optic cable.Dr Roland Burke is associate professor in history and ARC Future Fellow at La Trobe University.

For baffling reasons, soon after the general election a government with a sky-high in-tray of problems embarked on a gigantic local council reorganisation no one knew about.It didn’t feature in the manifesto, nor in the local government secretary Steve Reed’s conference speech last week – but England has plans to axe unknown numbers of local councillors –some estimatesput it at nearly 90%.Thewhite paperoutlining these plansactually boaststhat there will be “fewer local politicians”, pandering disgracefully to the general scorn for politics. Yet voters trustcouncillors twice as muchas they do Westminister politicians.For all the talk of localism and connecting to neighbourhoods, these are the unheralded foot soldiers of democracy. It is councillors who run political parties and much that binds their communities.Few people ever join political parties, yet the whole tottering democratic system relies entirely on those who do. Running the council and becoming a councillor is part of party members’ purpose and motivation. Abolishing so many will diminish democratic engagement over time.Many councils will be ordered to merge into unitary councils to serve apopulation of at least 500,000, todeliver all local services; this will entail the abolition of hosts of district councils. (There is some “flexibility” for some with populations of fewer than 300,000.)Some won’t go quietly. Some submit alternative plans, grouping together so more of them survive. County councils, the winners from enlargement, strongly support the plan: today they launched a salvourging the government to plough onand block their ears to the districts’ counter-plans.The budget approaches, a wretched brew of hard choices whichever way the chancellor turns. On all sides the beleaguered government faces bereft public services in need of money. The plight of councils is particularly serious: there is no money for social care’s escalating needs, Send children or the rising numbers being taken into care. There were smirks all round from other parties when Kent council, one of many captured by Reform, had to backtrack on nonsense promises for cutting of waste and taxes in its array of unicorn policies: within months Kent and the others declared defeat, finding few “net zero” and “equality” savings; it is likely toraise council taxby the maximum 5%.Council budgets have dwindled sharply as a proportion of all spending says Prof Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, and now councils’ democratic voice will shrink too. Hoping to save money with fewer councils “rationalised” under larger unitaries means some will be enormous. North Yorkshire will be a three-hour drive across; forget delivery close to home. Is there a perfectly efficient size of council? “No,” says Travers. “There’s no evidence that Hampshire, with its district councils, is better or worse governed than say, Shropshire or Buckinghamshire unitaries.” Will this save money? House of Commons libraryresearch finds: “It is not clear from available evidence whether unitary councils save money compared with a two-tier system.”Portsmouth, one of themany towns and cities resisting, protests that its 208,000 population is an adequate size: it already delivers all services well, has no debts, and no wish to be swallowed by Hampshire. Susan Brown, Labour leader of Oxford city council with 166,000 people, is struggling to avoid being eaten by Oxfordshire into a monster council unitary of 750,000. She tells me she’s bidding to enlarge the city’s border to include its green belt, and become a unitary controlling all their services. All these boundaries will be marked out finallynext Marchby the minister.Does anyone care much, when most are clueless about what councils do and few vote in local elections? Well they may sit up and take notice when it dawns on them that Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter, Reading and many more ancient towns and cities will be devoured by mega-county councils that feel distant, not local at all. It may dawn onLabourMPs that this is a reverse gerrymander, damaging parties of the left. Many of these lost town councils have been little islands of Liberal Democrat yellow and Labour red, amid deep blue counties, which will now outvote them. Besides, Reform will sweep through quite a lot more next May. Don’t lose these small strongholds.Britain already has fewer elected representatives than European countries of a similar size, says Travers. Cavalier map planners at Westminster never consider how reorganisations cause huge waste of time and effort. Council CEOs complain of time spent on this, amid all their other crises. What to do about contracts when the council may no longer be there? Who wants to absorb Thurrock with its£1bn debt? Oxfordshire county council just signed aneight-year highways contract: can that be unpicked if Susan Brown of Oxford city gets her way?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You may have fallen asleep by now: local authority politics rarely electrify. But when this actually happens, the government may find people care more than expected about losing their council. Councils need three vital reforms: the creation of a promised national social care service and an urgent reform of property taxation, starting with the preposterous council tax.

Jealous? Me?David BarnettWith the rise of TikTok and two-tier marketing budgets, something’s off in the world of publishing (and it’s not just the aroma)David Barnett is an author. His latest book is Withered HillFri 10 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 06.36 EDTShareFirst, a confession: I have not read Jennifer L Armentrout’s latest novel, The Primal of Blood and Bone. Nor have I sniffed it, or licked it. Which might be an odd thing to do, but for the fact that a special edition of the romantasy book has been released with garlic-infused ink.Armentrout is a hugely-successful “hybrid” author, both self- and traditionally published, and has made the New York Times bestseller list on numerous occasions. She writes in the currently insanely popular romantic fantasy market, and her new novel, the latest in a series, features vampire-analogy monsters called the Craven.Enter stage right: Hellmann’s, which despite having exactly the sort of name you might find in a romantasy novel, is in fact a purveyor of mayonnaise and other table-top squirty condiments. Hellmann’s has teamed up with Armentrout and her publishers, Blue Box Press, to release aspecial editionof The Primal of Blood and Bone which is printed with ink mixed with their garlic aioli – the Craven being vampires, remember, and so averse to a bit of garlic.This is, of course, is an attempt to grab the TikTok generation by the throat. Understandably so: the video-sharing social media platform has become one of thebiggest book marketing opportunitiesfor publishers in modern times.And it is here, dear reader, that I heave a world-weary sigh and reveal myself to be yet another grumpy, middle-aged, largely unknown author waving his fist at the clouds in the style of Grampa Simpson and raging against the dying of the light … or at least, against the shift away from the seemingly outmoded idea of publishers just trying to sell books because, y’know, they’re books, and they’re good.Just hold off typing that takedown in the comment box for one second and let me explain. Do I sound bitter? Of course I’m bitter. All writers are misanthropic sociopaths at heart. We’re bitter about everything. That’s why we make stuff up all the time, trying to imagine worlds we might not be quite as bitter about as this one.But in this case, I’m not bitter at Armentrout – may her book fly, garlic aioli-infused edition or otherwise – or at other writers, or at any of my publishers. Rather, I’m bitter at a publishing industry model that seems weirdly averse to selling the majority of books it puts out.Of course, marketing budgets are limited at even the biggest publisher. There’s only so much money sloshing around. But there seems to be an odd system at work where the books that don’t actually need much promotion get all the money thrown at them.You know the ones I mean. The ones that zoom to the top of the charts on the day of release, the ones written by pop musicians or reality TV stars or Strictly judges or whoever, who get a nice spot on the BBC Breakfast or One Show sofa to plug them.The irony being that these are the books that don’t need marketing – they’ll essentially sell themselves. It’s all the other books written by, well, by people like me, who don’t get the benefit of big PR campaigns that really need this marketing push. If people don’t know about a book, they can’t buy it.There he goes again, being all bitter and shaking his fist. I am a realist, though; nobody wants to see Dave from Wigan awkwardly trying to flog his latest horror novel on the BBC Breakfast sofa between Taylor Swift and Kemi Badenoch when they can book erudite, entertaining and – most importantly – recognisable faces such as Richard Osman and Bob Mortimer and that lad from the boyband.However, a little anecdote from a Facebook authors’ group I’m in (Misanthropic Sociopath Writers, if you want to join): an author gave her publisher a list of press reviewers, booksellers, fellow authors and social media book influencers who said they would be happy to receive an advance copy of her forthcoming book. When several messaged her to say they hadn’t received a copy of the imminent publication, she checked with her publishers who sheepishly admitted they hadn’t sent any out.Which is why using gimmicks to sell books somewhat irks me. I have to admit, putting garlic in your ink is quite a topper wheeze, though it’s by no means the first time someone’s had this idea. Back in 1977, Marvel released a comic bookabout the flamboyant rock band Kiss, which was marketed as “printed in real KISS blood” after the band members did indeed addvials of their own blood to the red ink vat at the printers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise, how will you, the reader, know about them?There’s also the danger of too much hype. Self-published author Audra Winter embarked upon a massive TikTok pre-release marketing campaign for her fantasy novel The Age of Scorpius. The anticipation reached fever pitch, with millions viewingher promotional videosand thousands placing pre-orders. Then when the book eventually came out earlier this year …people hated it. TikTok user and author LCGallagher posted a two-and-a-half minute takedown of the book with the words “a piece of shit with glitter on it is still a piece of shit”. On the book review site Goodreads, Age of Scorpius earned anaverage rating of 1.52 stars, with one user opining: “This is why when someone tells you your book isn’t ready, you don’t just dismiss it because it’s not something you want to hear.”And what had been a masterclass in TikTok marketing became an author’s nightmare as the platform’s users turned on Winter and her book.Still, it all does give me a bit of an idea. My next horror novel, out next year, is set in the coalfields of Lancashire. Most printing inks are carbon-based, aren’t they? So my book could be said to be “printed with real coal!”Now, can anyone do me aTikTok?David Barnett is the author of Withered HillExplore more on these topicsPublishingOpinionMarketing & PRTikTokcommentShareReuse this content"

Parliament must force Starmer to actFri 10 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 10.55 EDTShareWhile Keir Starmerfiddles in India, Rome burns. The British steel industry now faces a calamity so severe, insiders say it could be “terminal”. The vast majority – 80% – of itsexports go to the EU, which this week revealed plans tocut tariff-free steel import quotasby almost half. The remainder will be subject to a 50% tariff. The UK steel industry will be butchered. Thank you, EU. Thank you, Brexit.Whenever I meet politicians who championedBrexitnowadays, I ask them a simple question: do you still think you were right? A few fools mutter, “Yes, on balance” and “In the long term, perhaps.” The honest ones shrug and look uncomfortable. We can all accept that some day a new generation of British politicians will resume open trade across the Channel. It is normal for an island, and makes sense. So I ask the honest ones: why not go public? Make a headline, stand up, apologise and get the ball rolling? None has done so.In May, Starmer timidly negotiated a“Brexit reset”with Brussels. This injected pockets of sanity into increasingly chaotic border controls, especially on food. A few more EU students whom Brexit had crassly restricted may be admitted, along with a new e-gate for passport entry. There must still be checks – they start rolling outfrom this Sunday– to enforce the rule limiting Britons to no more than 90 out of any 180 daysinside the Schengen area. Further resets are mooted in coming years.According to the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, most industries just cannot wait. They are struggling to keep open markets, and if necessaryrealign themselves with the EUby the back door. The chemicals industry exports more than 60% of its output to the EU. Brexiteers boasted it would be liberated from EU regulation, but setting up the UK’s own regulator cost £2bn and has not worked. According to the Chemical Industries Association, output has fallen by 35-40% since 2021. Between 2021 and 2023, British exports to the EUfell by a serious 27%. Brexiteers boasted that leaving the EU would be worthhundreds of billionsa year. Cambridge Econometrics estimates that over the next decade Britain’s economy will be£300bn smallerthan if we had not left the EU. This is self-harm on a heroic scale.If you liked Brexit, you’re going to love what the Conservatives want next | Polly ToynbeeRead moreWhat matters is how to scramble out of the pit. For most politicians, Brexit was never a policy priority. It was a leadership stunt, conducted with the grain of Britain’s shambolic political climate in the mid-to-late 2010s. Parliament enacted what a majority of members on all sides of the Commons knew was wrong. Worse still, when a soft Brexit was a feasible least-bad option, the Labour party failed to unite with anti-Brexit Tories to retain trading links with Europe. A hugely critical national issue sank into a swamp of parliamentary infighting, on a level approaching that now beingrepeated in Paris.The excuse was that the public wanted it. There is no such excuse now. Voters have had the courage to look at the facts and admit the mistake. According to YouGov, 61%have concludedthat Brexit is a failure. Just 13% now regard it as more of a success. Almost half want another referendum within five years, and 63% oppose loosening ties with the EU any further.That figure should daub every public meeting staged by Nigel Farage.The need is urgent for some coalition of politicians to take the lead and state baldly that Brexit was an error. Of the many failings of parliament, its inability to rise to the occasion above party politics is the most glaring. Britain’s re-entry into some trading relationship withEuropeshould now be the subject of a crossparty forum or select committee. They should press Starmer towards an urgent and concerted bid to reassociate with the EU. It will not be cheap, but it will be worth it.The leadership of the Tory party may find it hard to get its head round the necessary U-turn. That is tough. Its failure to explain or justify other aspects of its performance in government is already not serving it well. To accuse Starmer last May of “betrayal” and“surrender”over his EU deal was idiotic. There must be Tories who know the truth: honest politicians who follow Keynes’ purported advice and allow circumstances to alter their views. At present, as with anti-Trump Republicans in the US, the question is, when do they have the guts to surface?The public is clearly ready to see Brexit reversed. There cannot be a single industry that would oppose it. The need is for leadership. This should not be a partisan matter, except insofar as it might isolate Farage’s Reform party – and perhaps be his undoing. It should become a consensus. Of course it will not be easy. But it will be right.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It leaves voters facing a dangerously unstable political orderFri 10 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 08.09 EDTShareMuch of democratic politics is about getting people’s attention. That’s a particular problem for struggling, less-than-compelling leaders. The further your party falls in the polls, the larger the temptation to launch dramatic, supposedly transformational policies. It’s like speaking more and more loudly to someone who has stopped listening.Thus this week’sConservative conferencein Manchester, with the party at historic lows in the polls, featured a frenzy of policy announcements, on once-successful Tory themes such as tax cuts, law and order, welfare and immigration, that were often made to half-empty rooms. Expanses of blue carpet had been installed in the huge, barn-like convention centre – as if to reassure delegates that the party still had an identity – yet much of the time they were eerily deserted. The Conservatives, famed and feared for their durability, seem to be disappearing before our eyes.Their current crisis, probably their worst ever, is not just one of popularity; but of leadership, political positioning, ideology and credibility. Within a few minutes of arriving at the conference, I overheard two delegates, both suited Tory Boys of the kind that traditionally express total confidence, having a conversation that would become very familiar, away from the fixed grins of the main stage events.“I don’t think theConservativesare in a position to win,” said one delegate, self-protectively referring to his party in the third person. “They’re in a position to stay alive.” The other interjected: “If you replace her [leader Kemi Badenoch] now, you’re polling at 10%. I think she should resign in 2028. Be a sacrificial lamb.” The other nodded. “We don’t have many [leadership] choices. A lot of good people have lost their seats …”Even more drastic solutions to the crisis are also being considered. According to a new YouGov poll, almost half the Conservatives’ shrinking membershipsupport a merger with Reform UK– the erasure of the Tories as an independent party after almost 200 or almost 350 years, depending on how you define their hazy origins. British Conservatives can be brutally pragmatic, and the defection of their voters, members and politicians to Reform may soon reach a tipping point. “As long as there’s a rightwing party,” another delegate told me who had been a Tory for decades, “I don’t mind which one it is.”Yet frequently in Manchester the Conservative crisis created not equanimity but feverishness. Each new policy or rhetorical trope seemed more rightwing, and often more authoritarian, than the last. Deporting migrants, deregulating business, disciplining schoolchildren, dumping net zero targets, detaining more minor criminals, dismantling the supposedly liberal judiciary: all the favourite preoccupations of modern rightwing populism and much older, free-market Conservatism were recited like articles of faith.Fringe meetings with hard-right themes were better attended than most events in the main hall, with chairs running out and sweat shining on speakers’ foreheads in fuggy rooms. At one gathering, Chris Philp spoke so fast, almost ranting, about the “scourge of illegal migration”, and how “many of those migrants in hotels commit crimes and work illegally”, that he sounded more like a hotel protester than the shadow home secretary.Elsewhere on the fringe, the Tory peer David Frost had an ominous explanation for why their party is radicalising. “A good chunk of the public is probably to the right of where [Nigel] Farage is.” The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, told a fringe event: “Public opinion is shifting very fast right now, on a whole range of issues.” In his speech from the main stage, he put itmore melodramatically: “The collapse of the old order is in sight. A new one is coming!”Offstage, his replacement of Badenoch as leader was constantly discussed. Yet the argument that more hard-right policies will revive the Tories, under him or anyone else, is undermined by the fact that Reform, and Tommy Robinson, are already catering to that market. Moreover, Badenoch has already moved the Conservatives sharply rightwards without halting their decline. After years of austerity, acute inequality and growing public anger at the privatised utilities, Reform’s promise to address these issues, however partially and cynically, makes their reactionary populism more in tune with the times than the Tory version, which is still stuck in the 1980s, dreaming of a small state and endlessly dynamic businesses. In the more depopulated zones of this year’s conference, there were sometimes as many cardboard cut-outs of Margaret Thatcher as delegates.Badenoch’s speech on Wednesday – her second of the conference, a break with precedent that suggested a desperation to be heard – pledged “a new approach” to Britain’s problems. But it stayed in the traditional Tory comfort zone of promising to liberate individuals and businesses while reining in the state. Even the speech’s supposed big surprise, a vow to abolish stamp duty, had a retro flavour: a tax cut that would mostbenefit the wealthiestin the old Thatcherite heartlands of southern England. Nothing Badenoch said suggested that she or her party were doing the self-questioning and fresh thinking that their dire position ought to prompt.If you’re not a Conservative, and have suffered from their decades of dominance, it’s tempting simply to relish their difficulties. But the attention-seeking in Manchester this week was just the most extreme and undignified version of a neediness that also afflicts other parties, in an era of tuned-out voters, low election turnouts and political fragmentation. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey’s cartoonish stunts and Farage’s hyperbolic press conferences, while seemingly more successful as political theatre, are also pleas to voters to notice their parties. Meanwhile Labour’s conference in Liverpool last week, which tried to useattacks on Reformto make the government’s underlying principles more compelling, has so far generatedno improvement in the polls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And now I carry those voices with me into the heart of the UNThu 9 Oct 2025 21.44 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 02.01 EDTShareIn its80th year, the UN headquarters in New York heard speeches that made headlines. One leader thundered threats of war. Another complained about an escalator. Meanwhile, outside the polished floors and gilded halls, children were starving in Palestine. Bombs fell. Borders closed. Budget cuts placed the very architecture of human rights under siege.This was meant to be a landmark gathering, a celebration of 80 years of multilateralism. Instead, it felt like a reckoning. Can the UN still serve the people it was built to protect, or has its promise begun to crack under the weight of politics?I am 22. I am not a politician. I am not a diplomat. I arrive without motorcade, without flags, without fanfare. But I carry something infinitely heavier: the voices of young people crying out for basic recognition – the ones who should be standing in these chambers, yet perhaps never will.For the past year,I have travelled across this country, leading one of Australia’s largest ever face-to-face youth consultations. From the Tiwi Islands to Tasmania, from city classrooms to remote detention centres, from town camps to refugee programs, I have listened to thousands of young people. And now I carry those voices with me into the heart of the UN, which is currently still in general assemblyproceedings, negotiations and debates.View image in fullscreen‘The struggles of young people are borderless’ … Satara Uthayakumaran at the United Nations.Photograph: Satara UthayakumaranAnd as I traveled Australia’s 7.7m square kilometres, time and again, I was asked:“What is the purpose of the UN?”This is the same question US president Donald Trumpposed to the general assemblythis year – but while his interrogation came from a hostile place, the question I heard came from the cries of children drowning in poverty. From families forced to choose between a child’s medicine and their own survival. From those terrorised by law enforcement. From young people trapped in modern slavery, sold into forced marriages, robbed of any hope for a future. From those who live every day with the silent weight of exclusion, of neglect, of invisibility.These children live at the sharpest edge of society, where survival is not a given. Ten-year-oldslocked in detentionlonger than they’ve ever known a home. Children ripped from family, from culture, from everything that should keep them safe. Young people go hungry, scrape by in poverty, watch their dreams wither under debt and neglect – all while the world looks away.So I started collecting letters. Thousands of them – to the prime minister, to Australia and to the world. From prisons, classrooms, foster homes, communities on Country, across every corner of the nation.From a youth detention centre, a 16-year-old boy wrote of being beaten, starved and denied his mother, begging for housing and a future beyond the walls. From Alice Springs, a 14-year-old boy wrote that crime is not a choice but survival for kids whose homes aren’t safe. And from Christmas Island, a 16-year-old girl described the trauma of boats being turned around and refugee families brutally locked away.These are the voices that should shake the walls of the United Nations; not handshakes for the media, not empty speeches.I write this as an Australian – but this is really about all of us.From the youth in Alice Springs who commit crimes just to survive to the children in Gaza who beg for bread and safety. From refugee families trapped on Christmas Island to the voices of displaced children across Lebanon and Jordan’s camps. From the hopelessness of a child in an Australian detention centre to the kids forced into armies in Sudan or trafficked across borders in south-east Asia.The struggles of young people are borderless.Walking the corridors of the UN, surrounded by history and power, I feel the weight of both worlds: the spectacle of photo-ops, and the unforgiving reality of lives breaking outside these walls.I believe the UN still has a vital role, but only if it truly hears the cries of the forgotten: refugees who never made it home, survivors of modern slavery rebuilding their lives, people with disabilities left without care, Indigenous families robbed of land and language, Pacific Islands and small nations drowning in the rising tide of climate disaster, those behind bars and the voiceless.

I couldn’t bounce around, so I blinged the brace up instead. That was a great gig.”Loughead is part of a growing movement of women redefining punk. WhenRiot Women, Sally Wainwright’s new BBC drama spotlighting female punk, airs this Sunday, it will reflect a scene that’s already thriving far beyond television.That energy is being felt most viscerally in Leicester, where Ruth Miller’s 2022Unglamorous Music project– now known as the Riotous Collective – lit the fuse. Loughead was there from the start.“When we began, there were no all-women garage punk bands here. Within a year, there were seven. Now there are 20 – and counting,” she said. “There are Riotous groups across the UK and the world, from Finland to Australia, recording, gigging, playing festivals.”View image in fullscreenViv Peto and her punk band.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianThe explosion isn’t limited toLeicester. Across the UK, women are reclaiming punk – and changing the landscape of live music while they’re at it.“There are music venues across the UK thriving thanks to women punk bands,” said Longhead. “So are rehearsal studios, music teaching and coaching, production spaces. That’s because women are in all these roles now.”They’re also changing who shows up. “Women-led bands are playing every week. They’re bringing in more diverse audiences – ones that see these spaces as safe, as for them,” she added.Carol Reid, programme director at Youth Music, said the rise was no surprise. “Women have been sold a dream of equality. But gender-based violence is at epidemic levels, the far right is using women to peddle hate, and we’re gaslit over issues like the menopause. Women are fighting back – through music.”Toni Coe-Brooker, from the Music Venue Trust, sees the movement reshaping local music scenes. “We’re seeing more diverse punk scenes and they’re feeding into local music ecosystems, with grassroots venues booking more inclusive bills and building safer, more welcoming spaces.”Later this month, Leicester will host the first Riot Fest, a three-day event featuring 25 all-women bands from the UK and Europe. In September, Decolonise Fest in London celebrated punks of colour.And the scene is edging into the mainstream. The Nova Twins are on their first headline UK tour. The Lambrini Girls’ debut album, Who Let the Dogs Out, hit No. 16 in the UK charts this year.Panic Shack were nominated for the 2025 Welsh Music Prize. Problem Patterns won the Northern Ireland Music Prize in 2024. Hull-based newcomers Wench played the BBC Introducing stage at Reading Festival.It’s a movement born partly in protest. In an industry still dogged by misogyny – where all-women acts remain underrepresented and live venues are closing at crisis levels – female punk bands are creating something radical: space.At 79, Viv Peto is proof punk has no age limit. The Oxford-based washboard player in horMones punk band picked up her instrument just a year ago.“Now I’m old, all constraints are gone and I can do what I like,” she said. One of her recent songs includes the chorus: “So shout out, fuck it / It’s my time! / The stage is mine! / I’m 79 / And in my fucking prime.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

But more than 35 years since his death in 1988, would the New York artist have been flattered or horrified by the mass marketing of his art?Basquiat’s premature death at 27 means that questions will remain as to whether he would have signed off on things likebathmats on Redbubbleor Ligne Bath’sTrumpet candle. How would he, for example, have felt about a Basquiat collaboration with MeUndies underpants – with the tagline: “Jean-Michel Basquiat … taught us all to look inward and find our authentic self. MeUndies always strives for authenticity.”A new book,Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Making of an Icon, by Doug Woodham, the former president of Christie’s auction house in the US, hopes to answer this question and unpack the neo-expressionist’s journey to becoming one of the most famous artists in the world.“I think comparing [him] toKeith Haringis a good way to try and understand it,” he said.Haring was a contemporary and friend of Basquiat’s and, according to Woodham, “was the first contemporary artist to realise he could put his motifs on a keychain and sell it at pop-up shops, knowing that it wouldn’t hurt his market value”. While Woodham believes Basquiat would be “excited and happy” about how the estate has marketed his artworks, he is unsure the artist would like all the merchandise upon which his work appears.Friend and artistic collaborator Al Diaz, who co-created Basquiat’s Samo graffiti tag, is more definitive. He believes the merch dilutes the meaning and message of the art in the process. “It’s abusive at this point. It’s demeaning to the artist, offensive and disrespectful,” he says over the phone from New York. Was there anything Basquiat would have categorically hated, I ask? “There was that Barbie doll they did and a door mat. It seems so over the top and thoughtless,” he says. “It’s like, ‘OK, let’s print this on everything and anything’.”View image in fullscreenKeith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat in December 1987.Photograph: Irving ZuckerAnd yet the spectre in the popular consciousness of Basquiat as the starving junkie punk artist is complicated by Woodham’s portrayal in The Making of an Icon. Once the artist started making money, he is characterised as “loving cash”, his ambition leading him to make a beeline to a friendship with Andy Warhol and even self-branding in a costume of designer suits flecked with paint. He had seen his fellow artist Julian Schnabel garnering attention for showing up to parties wearing pyjamas. “He chased fame very strategically and deliberately,” says Diaz. “He was very, very clever and had a special charm.”The book posits that three key traumas shaped the artist: a near-fatal car crash during childhood; the sometimes violent breakdown of his parents’ marriage, which led to his mother, Matilda, having a nervous breakdown; and finally his mother’s wish for his father, Gerard, to raise him and his two sisters alone.Gerard Basquiat was born in Haiti, but fled the country because of civil unrest, first going to Miami before ending up alone in New York. The artist’s father only spoke French, but after learning English, he became an accountant. “He’s really impressive,” says Woodham, “he’s also very domineering”.Gerard Basquiat often butted heads with his son. “Everybody wants to be recognised and supported by their parents,” says Diaz. “He had a lot of anger and disdain and disappointment because he never received that from his dad … having a bisexual, art-orientated son was not in [his father’s] playbook.”After Basquiat’s death, his estate was taken over by his father, and their layered relationship bled into our modern understanding of the artist. In The Making of an Icon, Gerard is portrayed as savvy – he partnered with Keith Haring’s legal team who taught him about licensing – but also, understandably, controlling of his son’s narrative.Woodham spoke off the record to gallery curators who said that Gerard Basquiat would lean on them to omit certain parts of the biography (his mother’s role in his life, the effects of his childhood trauma and the depths of his drug habit and bisexuality), so a more “heteronormative” narrative would be promoted. A narrative, one would assume, that would make him more palatable to both the elite art market and the wider public.View image in fullscreenGerard Basquiat and his partner, Nora Fitzpatrick, in the living room of their Boerum Hill brownstone in Brooklyn, March 1978.Photograph: Dinanda Nooney, courtesy of the Photography Collection, the Miriam And Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs, the New York Public LibraryThere was a uniformity to how all the museum and gallery catalogues were written, says Woodham. And yet, he says: “I think all these strands add a richness to the guy’s character. I think it makes him more compelling and interesting.”The reach of Basquiat’s art is undeniable. And for a younger generation, many of whom only know him through this merch, it simply doesn’t matter that his art is omnipresent.“It’s fascinating to talk to 30-something collectors,” says Woodham. “For them, Basquiat has always been in the pantheon. And the first time they ever heard of him was from a Uniqlo T-shirt.”Explore more on these topicsJean-Michel BasquiatArtKeith HaringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both look defanged.Freud’s sensational Naked Portrait 2002 is a nude study of the supermodel, to whom he had been introduced by his daughter, the fashion designer Bella Freud. Moss was pregnant when she sat for him – which lent a fierce, additional frisson to the painting’s candour and intimacy. Ellie Bamber plays Kate and carries off the unclothed moments with great directness and aplomb. Freud is played with Germanic R sounds by Derek Jacobi (who incidentally played Freud’s contemporary Francis Bacon in John Maybury’s Love Is the Devil in 1998) and he has Freud’s buzzard-like look but not quite the sharpness and severity.She was 28; he was 80 and his reputation as a Lothario led to all sorts of tabloid gossip about a possible relationship – though the film, for which Moss is executive producer, is burdened with the killjoy task of solemnly making it clear that this wasn’t true, while also trying to convey a kind of compensatory eroticism elsewhere – all sorts of bohemian raciness and an impossibly stylish meeting of super-hip creative minds. Yet, all too often Moss looks like a dippy trustafarian and Freud like her soppy old grandpa with whom she gets out of it on opium in the garden of his west London home while the pair of them throw back their heads, laughing life-affirmingly. Their tiffs are infrequent and unexciting.Of course, no film can live up to the painting itself: that is where the drama and the seduction actually happened. Perhaps there was an amazing rapport between Moss and Freud or perhaps it was a businesslike arrangement – with no more of a quasi-erotic spark than there was between Freud and the more age-appropriate Queen Elizabeth II when she sat for him, fully clothed. (Maybe Jacobi and Helen Mirren can now do that film.)This film implies that Freud got Moss to grow up and turn away from shallow partying and drugs. Well … maybe. It is on stronger ground at hinting at the selfishness of artist and model – and in fact there is a very shrewd scene when Freud turns up for Moss’s birthday party and both hurt the feelings of Bella (Jasmine Blackborow) by hardly talking to her. Both are capricious: Freud is using Moss, of course, and she is using him (and both might well have been aware of how very expensive the resulting picture was likely to be, although nothing so vulgar is explicitly mentioned).The crunch comes when Kate sees the finished picture and is, quite understandably, lost for words. The film is too, in a way. Freud’s image is not like a fashion photo – it is utterly different from the way she has learned to see herself. It is not unflattering exactly, it has something uncompromisingly physical and sensual. And it upstages the film’s careful, legacy-controlling blandness.Moss and Freud screened at the London film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmLondon film festivalLondon film festival 2025reviewsShareReuse this content"

But how convincing are they?Zoe WilliamsFri 10 Oct 2025 09.21 EDTLast modified on Fri 10 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn The Woman in Cabin 10, Netflix’s new potboiler, Keira Knightley plays a fearless justice warrior, a lone voice of dogged truth in a maelstrom of corruption, and this is not her first foray into such terrain: six years ago she played the whistleblower Katharine Gun inOfficial Secrets, the 2019 film about some pretty dicey US and UK behaviour before the Iraq war.This time round she’s a journalist, though – and not just any old hack, a Guardian journalist. Exhausted and possibly traumatised by a crusading investigation she has just finished about some bad people doing bad things, she accepts a trip on a billionaire’s yacht for a breather, only to discover that billionaires arealso bad. You cannot call that a spoiler, even though it technically is one. You’re reading the Guardian, for Pete’s sake.View image in fullscreenClose in mannerism … Toby Jones as former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in The Hack.Photograph: ShutterstockJournalists on screen are always idealised, whatever paper they’re from – film amps up the tenacity, intelligence, commitment and, often, cardiovascular fitness of hacks, which is fair enough: that’s its business, to filter out frailty. The only rose-tint that bugs me with print journalism, and this has been bugging me since Almost Famous came out a quarter of a century ago, is that all the drama happens in a situation where interesting things are going down and the key players actively want to include a journalist. It just isn’t true to life. Any time a billionaire, or a rock quartet, or some generals, or a prime minister, actively want to talk to you, it’s to tell you something boring, to keep you busy. But this is a pet peeve; back to Knightley, on her yacht, being told real things, when a murder happens.Box sets and films dealing specifically with the Guardian –Snowden, about the CIA whistleblower and the paper;The Hack, about Nick Davies’s hacking investigation;its role in The Bourne Ultimatum– idealise in bespoke ways. They always make the office look incredibly lively, people constantly leaping up and pointing at each other in a universally understood semaphore of hard news, whereas in real life people are disappointingly quiet and sedentary, often, en masse, remaining so still that the movement-triggered lights go off. Knightley in this film is exquisitely tailored. The stories always get into print incredibly fast, with nobody ever saying: “We won’t be able to say this until it’s been proven in a court of law, which will take roughly 18 months.”Why they used the Guardian in The Hack and Snowden is self-evident, it’s because those things happened here; in The Hack, the performances are so close in mannerism and bearing that you just have to hand it to them, they obviously were trying to work with what they had. David Tennant is spookily likeNick Davies, Toby Jones doesn’t physically resemble former editorAlan Rusbridgerbut almost shapeshifts. All other considerations (please stop saying “redacted”, it’s very distancing; is it too much to ask that the bad guys go down for something?) melt away. In Snowden, I was constantly distracted by the glamour of people being journalists, yet also being in the US, or Hong Kong or Russia. There was no gloss, here!Janine Gibson(now at the Financial Times, played with a Her-Own Girl Friday briskness and vim by Joely Richardson) genuinely was in New York at the time, this shouldn’t push at the boundaries of disbelief-suspension, and yet it does.View image in fullscreenBriskness and vim … Joely Richardson as Guardian journalist Janine Gibson and Nicholas Rowe as the paper’s assistant editor, in SnowdenWhen it’s an entirely fictional character, set in this newspaper that really exists, you have to wonder what the film is trying to say with that. Paddy Considine admitted straight to our faces that he’d had to“to wimp down a little bit” to play Simon Ross, security correspondent, and this is a) because he’s in this with Matt Damon, so has to be his opposite (a wimp); b) because he’s gonna die in a minute, so you mustn’t fall in love with him; and c) because he’s meant to embody the noblest search, for truth without ego.A mixed bag, then, for the newspaper as trope; very moral, not very sexy. There are some neat observational lines that approximate the trade pretty well – when Bourne is on his phone, directing him through Waterloo concourse, telling him to go “east”, he surmises correctly that he won’t know which way that is, adding “your left”. But then there are other lines like, “This isn’t some story in a newspaper, this is real. Do you understand me?”, to which Ross replies, “Yes” – whereas in real life, he would say, “Actually, all the stories in our newspaper are also real,” and then maybe Bourne would reply, “What about that time you told everyone to vote Lib Dem”, in the middle of which the CIA would shoot Ross in the head.View image in fullscreenSearch for truth … Paddy Considine, right, with Colin Stinton in The Bourne Ultimatum.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhy Knightley has to work here, forThe Woman in Cabin 10, could be to convey in shorthand her sense of civic duty, or it could be to give her a dusting of wholemeal flour (oh, there’s that pill of a woman again, who could be drinking champagne but instead is going on about the dead body she just saw), or it could be to give the whole thing aGaslight-y frisson, she’s a journalist that a bad guy could plausibly persuade everyone was totally insane.Sometimes the paper pops up on its own as just a thing people are reading – in Wallace and Gromit, in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – and I want to say it’s there to signify: “This is the baseline reading matter of the everyman.” Maybe in Wallace and Gromit it is, but I think in fact it’s a global-audience thing, they can’t use the Times because an American audience will go: “The New York is missing and the font is wrong.”In Killing Me Softly (2002) the Guardian is everywhere; its journalist interviewing one of the other characters, another character masquerading as a hack, all of them constantly reading it. It’s widely thought of asthe worst film of all time. It’s just a coincidence; no actual Guardian journalists were harmed in the making of that film.Explore more on these topicsFilmKeira KnightleyThe GuardianTelevisionNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But you don’t need to be much of a history buff to know that that this particular crime would be on the JFK level of momentousness if it had actually succeeded. As it is, we follow Bogusław Linda as Konstanty “Bruno” Brusicki, a former intelligence agent who is offered a compelling carrot and threatened with a nasty stick by the men who want PJP2 dead. Brusicki has also been diagnosed with terminal cancer, which in the view of the conspiracists makes him the perfect murderer; they won’t have to subsequently get rid of him to cover their tracks.True life stories have a way of being a bit messier and wrinklier than their fictional counterparts, leaving scriptwriters with some decisions to make around how much to tidy up a set of events to suit the narrative demands of fiction. For around the first hour of this film, Bruno’s mission isn’t actually to shoot the pope, it’s to shoot the man who shoots the pope. Unbeknownst to the assassin, Bruno is supposed to be lurking to tidy up the loose ends and actually takes quite a bit of time to make it to the point where Bruno gets to say: “You want me to shoot the pope?”, which in a glossy Hollywood version would probably happen somewhere in the first 10 minutes.There are pros and cons to this: on the one hand it all feels messily real and pedantic and annoying in the way that real life can be, and presumably is, even in the world of high-stakes espionage. On the other hand, there is that sense that you’ve been watching an hour of preamble that could easily have been streamlined – though your mileage may vary. It does mean that the occasional flourishes in the film’s technique stand out: the bullet’s-eye-view perspective, for example, is a lovely bit of business, while occasional flashes of bone-crunching violence in the second half register like a hammer to the head.Operation Pope is in UK and Irish cinemas.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillerPolandPope John Paul IICatholicismChristianityEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

But there are gaps showing warm woody red beneath calming waters. It’s an abstract painting, a minimalist one even, yet there’s a rawness suggesting heartfelt narratives, barely contained feelings, kept just about in check behind the blue facade.In this little essayistic exhibition, Blue Wall’s creator, the abstract artistSean Scully, lets you into his life with unguarded passion. At the other end of the room, he exposes what his abstract art sublimates and transfigures in a recent self-portrait. It’s an innocent, honest attempt to look in the mirror and see himself, sitting at home in front of one of his big striped canvases, the colours of his clothes bouncing against it. Scully seems to be in a state of artistic flux and a mood of self-scrutiny, not just “mirroring” himself, as the exhibition title has it, in that self-portrait, but imagining a counterlife in which an artist famous for a very recognisable style of abstract painting is a drawer of cups and a portraitist of family life.I don’t think about it. I just do it, with no thought about ambition or result … it’s pure feelingSean ScullyHis model for this foray into small pictures of the big thing we call everyday life is the Italian still life artist Giorgio Morandi. A wall of prints and drawings by Morandi faces a wall of Scully works in a room the size of a large bedroom. You can see why he loves Morandi and identifies with him: the Italian painted with precision and restraint, repeating slight variants on arrangements of bottles and cups at his quiet home in Bologna from the 1920s to the 1960s. Works here include one in which Morandi dares to draw a bunch of broccoli.There is no getting to the bottom of them. And in the same way, if you find the regular fields of rectangular colour Scully has been painting for more than four decades tranquil, you haven’t been looking closely enough. They flow with sensitivity, blaze with memory. Whether you see them as ploughed Irish fields (he was born in Dublin) or metropolitan structures (he grew up in London), his lines, his trenches or planks of colour, are hard won, dug up. Here he lets you see where he digs, in sketches full of fierce, free emotion.View image in fullscreenInnocent and honest … The Artist by Sean Scully.Photograph: Courtesy Estorick Collection of Modern Italian ArtThere is a loving watercolour of his son and a beach scene of a mother and child entitled Madonna. Among these small slices of Scully’s life, and heart, are designs for abstract compositions in which you can see the process by which his heaving passion is transformed into disciplined painting.Both Scully and Morandi seem to follow Cézanne’s advice to “treat nature by means of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone”. That pull of geometry is plain to see in Morandi’s works, such as his 1931 etching Various Objects on a Table. It also emerges in Scully’s 2025 ink sketch of a glass on a table: while the base of the glass is barely curved at all, its top rim shapes a near perfect circle, as if it is slipping before your eyes from the real world of observed appearances into the abstract realm of absolute geometries. Now that’s what Cézanne was talking about. The rim of a mug, also drawn last year, becomes an even more perfect and unhesitant circle.Jewels of the Nile: how a new exhibition finally gives Egyptian artists their dueRead moreYet when I once asked Scully about Cézanne, he made it clear he loves and reveres Van Gogh more. It’s not just his commitment to expressing raw feeling through colour, nor the echo of Vincent in his intense, uninhibited self-portrait. He also provides, above a sketched abstract square, a scribbled manifesto for his art: “I don’t think about it. I just do it, with no thought about ambition or result … it’s pure feeling.” His forceful, thickly drawn landscape sketches nearby have the authenticity of Van Gogh, or Constable, or Auerbach. You look from these ardent rough drawings to his abstract designs and see, and feel, the poetry of memory, all the suffering and desire that a nest of rectangles can hold.If you still need convincing, Scully takes the transformation the other way and adds figuration to one of his abstract works. In his 2023 print White Rose, against layered rectangles of black and greyish white, lies a flower thrown down as if at a funeral. It could be corny but isn’t, as the modernist painter confesses the sheer universality and heartbreaking directness of what he wants to say.There’s only one problem with this honest, intimate show. Scully kills the artist he loves. The freedom and restlessness of his living art makes Morandi’s work seem almost sterile. On this occasion, there’s no comparison between the finished works of a dead artist and the flowing energy of one who is still making it anew.Sean Scully: Mirroring is at the Estorick Collection, London, until 23 NovemberExplore more on these topicsSean ScullyArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The City of Lights has been the stage and stomping ground of French architecture’svieux terriblesince the early 1980s. Yet the building that first made his name – the Institut du Monde Arabe, a glittering, delicate, metallic creation inset with mechanical lenses to regulate light – is a lifetime away from the bemusement that met his last Parisian project, completed a decade ago.That was the ill-starred Philharmonie, a gargantuan trophy concert hall,described in the Guardianas resembling “a pile of broken paving stones” and “a greatest hits mashup of dictators’ icons”. Nouvel may well concur, since he boycotted the building’s inauguration, dismayed by budget cuts and design tweaks (“value engineering” as it is known in the trade), describing his project as “sabotaged” and the half-finished concert hall as “counterfeit”.Retractable rails around the perimeter prevent visitors from plummeting to their doomDefiantly weathering critical opprobrium, Nouvel is an auteur who revels in creating architecture that is always theatrical and never the same. There is nole style Nouvel.“I’m not a painter or a writer,” he once said. “I don’t work in my room. I work in different cities with different people. I’m more akin to a movie-maker who makes movies on completely different subjects.”So what are we to make of Nouvel’s latest movie: a new home for the Fondation Cartier, a private art foundation established in 1984 that’s dedicated to the accumulation, display and creation of contemporary art?

Occupying an entire city block, the building is a slab of classic, Haussmann-era Paris, a colossal, five-storey hulk of honey-coloured stone with a mansard roof and colonnade that yomps monotonously along the Rue de Rivoli.Opened in 1855, this began life as the Grand Hôtel du Louvre, designed to accommodate visitors and exhibitors to the first Parisian Exposition Universelle, a world’s fair conceived by Napoleon III as a rival to London’s Great Exhibition of 1851. The hotel was then transformed into a department store, the Grands Magasins du Louvre, fuelling the demands of France’s emerging consumer society. As a teeming city in microcosm and forerunner of the modern shopping mall, it operated for almost a century, shaping Parisian cultural and social life.In terms of kerb appeal, this must rank as Nouvel’s lowest-key building to date, distinguished solely by the gold Fondation Cartier logo discreetly strung across the main facade on the Place du Palais-Royal, like an expensive necklace. An elongated steel and glass awning, a silver counterpoint to the gold, extends down Rue Saint-Honoré, a modern version of the historic colonnade. The honey-coloured stone has been meticulously cleaned and buffed, and elegant new windows added at street level. It all has a tasteful, seamless, stealth luxe refinement, in the manner of an Apple store or five-star hotel.View image in fullscreenSimply red … Jean Nouvel’s trademark rouge space.Photograph: Martin Argyroglo/© Jean Nouvel/ADAGP Paris 2025Nouvel’s relationship with Cartier dates back to the early 1990s, when he first designed a watchmaking plant in Switzerland. He was then tasked with the more glamorous project of creating a new arts centre for the Fondation on a site in Montparnasse, down in Paris’s 14th arrondissement – social Siberia compared with the latest plum locale.Nonetheless, Nouvel responded with a crystalline confection of steel and glass, subtly subverting the “white cube” aesthetic as the default setting for contemporary art. Galleries, it seemed, were no longer blind boxes, but glazed display spaces, opening on to a garden and the wider city. Characterised by an uncharacteristic formal restraint and precision, it’s still seen as one of his most memorable buildings.For the Fondation’s latest incarnation, while being presented with an architectural fait accompli in the form of an existing historic building, Nouvel has still managed to indulge his subversive tendencies.View image in fullscreenAn exhibit in the opening exhibition.Photograph: Marc Domage“Here, it is possible to do what cannot be done elsewhere,” he says, “by shifting the act of showing.” Behind thepolitesseand sobriety of the facade, the interior has been radically reconfigured around five modular, movable platforms, offering the potential to instantly restructure space and transform how objects are displayed.Nothing like this has ever been attempted before on such an ambitious scale. It upends the idea of galleries as static boxes or an enfilade of rooms, creating tantalising possibilities for curators and artists alike, in how they respond to “the act of showing” and orchestrate changes of scale, juxtapositions and through views.Occupying the footprint of what was originally a sequence of internal courtyards, platforms vary in size between 200 and 340 sq metres. Each can be adjusted to a different height, over three storeys, through cable mechanisms positioned at the corners. Retractable guardrails around the perimeter prevent visitors from plummeting to their doom. In line with the general tenor of the project, the platforms are not ostentatiously steampunk creations, but instead are rather elegant. Most of the time, you are hardly aware of them. Their inherent drama is as a mechanism for shaping space, architecture in the service of art.View image in fullscreenVieux terrible …Nouvel.Photograph: Jean-Paul Pélissier/Reuters“The platforms are very much in line with the historical spirit of the building,” says Béatrice Grenier, who co-curated the opening exhibition. “They play on this idea that the mid-19th century marks the beginning of mechanical modernisation of the city at large: the Eiffel Tower, the invention of elevators, the integration of mechanical mobility into brick and stone architecture.”Much of the original 19th-century fabric was destroyed when a Lancaster bomber ploughed into the building in 1943, so Nouvel had a relatively free hand to gut the interior. Still standing are a row of massive concrete columns, left over from a previous remodelling in the 1970s, which now loom like archaeological relics within the voluminous space.To inaugurate its new home, the Fondation will revisit pivotal moments in its history, through landmark works, fragments of exhibitions and the key projects that have shaped and consolidated its identity. The show’s title, Exposition Générale, alludes to exhibitions of the latest fashions, textiles, appliances and accoutrements – highly anticipated cultural events in themselves – that were organised by the Grands Magasins du Louvre in the 19th and early 20th centuries.View image in fullscreenHard at work … part of the pulley system.Photograph: Martin Argyroglo/© Jean Nouvel / ADAGP, Paris, 2025.The same visual connectivity, experiential richness and concern with display that enabled the building to play such a significant role in Parisian cultural life are reprised in Nouvel’s transformation. In many ways, Andy Warhol’s famous dictum that “all department stores will become museums” has come to pass.“The Louvre,” says Grenier, “is object-focused and encyclopaedic, showing the world in terms of a material manifestation of culture. We’re saying something very different: that exhibition-making is at the centre of culture, a succession of ideas elaborated with thinkers, artists and architects, and subject to constant change.”The Louvre also turns its back on the street. From the Rue de Rivoli, passersby might catch a glimpse of the backsides of sculptures through the odd window. The Fondation, by contrast, is extroverted and inviting, harking back to its origins as agrand magasin. Strolling along the colonnade, people can enjoy its displays through what were, and still are, shop windows.From this vantage point, you might be drawn to the ecstatic, chromatic installations of Bolivian architect Freddy Mamani or the minimalist maquettes of Japanese designer Junya Ishigami. The spectrum of creation encompasses outsider art and work by established practitioners (Patti Smith rubbing shoulders with the Yanomami community of the Amazon), connecting visitors to an aesthetic and mindset that could not be more divergent from that of the Louvre.The flexibility of the platforms means that all scales, from the monumental to the minute, can be easily accommodated. Exhibition spaces are augmented by a public cafe and lecture theatre, the latter saturated in Nouvel’s signature blood red; walls, floor, ceiling and seating as an eye-poppingly incarnadine ensemble.Architects are fond of gnomic pronouncements. “The future of architecture,” declared Nouvel in 1980, “is no longer architectural.” Though sounding suitably abstruse, it simply meant that, rather than remaining a closed discipline, “architecture needed to seek its sources in the culture of today”. Now, as Nouvel enters his ninth decade having turned 80 this year, and the Fondation Cartier opens its doors, it seems curiously apt. And he’ll still always have Paris.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureParisFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is second only to Ed Sheeran’s ÷, released in 2017 to 672,000 first-week sales.Only the Beatles and Robbie Williams have had more UK No 1 albums than Swift, with 15 apiece. At a concert in London last night,Williams admittedthat he had pushed back the release of his album Britpop from last Friday – The Life of a Showgirl’s release day – to 2026 because of Swift: “I could pretend it’s not, but it is. It’s selfish. I want a 16th No 1 album.”Swift has now surpassed Elvis Presley, with 13 No 1 albums, and is tied with the Rolling Stones. No one else has notched up so many No 1 albums in such a short time: the Official Charts Company said that since 2012, the 35-year-old pop star has averaged more than one a year.Taylor Swift: The Life of a Showgirl review – dull razzle-dazzle from a star who seems frazzledRead moreThe Life of a Showgirl also scores the biggest first-week UK vinyl sales since modern chart records began in 1994, as well as the most UK album streams in a single week.Swift also claims the entire top three songs in the UK Top 40.

Her list of achievements this week is extraordinary, not least the fact that The Life of a Showgirl has just registered comfortably the biggest first week in the UK of her career. Taylor is bigger than she has ever been in the UK – and shows absolutely no sign of letting up.”In the US,Swift beat Adele’s first-week sales record, selling 3.5m units in under a week with two days of the chart window still to go; in 2015, Adele sold 3.482m copies of her third album, 25, in its initial release week.

The video calls on viewers to “remember to like and subscribe before Paddington gets cancelled”.The online show featuring Paddington’s makeover is produced by Avalon, the makers of Spitting Image – the satirical TV puppet show that angered numerous politicians when it ran throughout the 1980s.The latest programme, a poke at the successful stable of podcasts produced byGary Lineker’s company, Goalhanger, runs on YouTube and features Paddington and Prince Harry as hosts.The two comedians who created the show,Al Murrayand Matt Forde, said they were amazed when the high court lawsuit reached them.“We’re baffled by that, to be honest,” Murray said in a Radio Times interview alongside Forde. “If we were going to expect anything, it would be a hard stare from Paddington.“There obviously has been a drift towards people who want to shut other people’s jokes up, and it’s weird, it seems like an attack on comedy, really.”Forde said it was part of a wider pressure on freedom of expression, pointing to the recent suspension of theUS comedian Jimmy Kimmelafter he criticised the Trump administration’s response to the killing of the rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk.“It’s terrifying that pressure can come from all sorts of different places,” Forde said. “I think the risk is that these kinds of authoritarian instincts exist on left and right.“People need to be careful about thinking: ‘Well, I never liked Jimmy Kimmel anyway, so I’m fine with it’, because eventually they will get round to you, and they will shut you up.“Comedy is an easy first target because people don’t like being laughed at, but it’s not comedy that they have an issue with.

And no one questioned it.“It’s a low-level mistake but nevertheless, it is indicative. It was good to spot it, because what you wouldn’t want to do is just to make some kind of egregious claim about somebody and it is defamatory.”The BBC’s broadcast of the claim comes amid increasing concern over online misinformation reaching the mainstream media, with media workers often users of platforms such as X, owned by the billionaire Elon Musk. The post about Blair, which is still on the site,has been viewed almost 3m times.Blair’s company, Multiverse, offers apprenticeship programmes and tech-related training, but has said it is not involved in the proposed digital ID project and does not have the expertise to oversee it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was convicted of the murder of the 70-year-old Castellano in 1992 and died in prison 10 years later.It is not known how or when Castellano acquired the Kerouac story. According to the company that bought it from his estate,Your Own Museum, it is thought to have originally been given to a San Francisco poet in the beat generation circle. The company said: “It has remained in private hands, meticulously preserved, for over six decades. It is a direct, tangible link to the moment the beat generation exploded into the American consciousness.View image in fullscreenPage 1 of the unpublished manuscript.Photograph: Your Own Museum“As was his known practice during this fertile time, he [Kerouac] would often produce unique, typewritten pamphlets and chapbooks – sometimes referred to as ‘brochures’ by his circle – for friends, lovers and patrons. These were not commercial publications but rather personal literary artefacts, gifts from the artist himself, typed by his own hand on his signature long-sheet roll paper and often bound simply.”The UK-based Kerouac scholar Dave Moore, creator of the online Kerouac Companion, said the discovery was “very significant”. He added that Kerouac had visited Britain during April 1957.“Kerouac was in Tangier on 25 March 1957 when he wrote letters to his agent Sterling Lord and to Neal Cassady. He wrote to Philip Whalen on 10 April, from London, and again to Lord on 20 April, also from London. So that suggests that he was in London on 15 April.”Subtitled A Brief Tale, the story seems to be a retelling of an episode from On the Road, the first draft of which Kerouac famously wrote in three weeks on one long roll of teletype paper. The writer, born in Lowell, Massachusetts, died in 1969, aged 47.The final version of the novel as published begins: “I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won’t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road.”The two-page story, described by Your Own Museum as “a quintessential ‘lost’ chapter”, opens more dynamically: “We hit Denver with the gas gauge kissing empty and the Hudson coughing dust from a thousand desert miles. It was that wild, holy, and crazy time when Dean and I were inseparable, two halves of a lost and found coin, and Marylou was with us, a sad-eyed angel in a too-tight sweater. The money was gone, spent on gas and cheap wine and a wild night in a Tucson motel that ended with a fistfight and a sprint to the car. Now we are broke, the sky was the colour of a dirty nickel, and a mean mountain wind cut down Larimer Street.”Kerouac assigned fictional names to his beat friends in his roman-à-clef novels, Dean being Dean Moriarty, his name for Neal Cassady, and Marylou the name for LuAnne Henderson, who Cassady married when she was just 15. Also referenced in the story is Carlo Marx – the poet Allen Ginsberg.The manuscript was discovered by Jerry Braunfield at Your Own Museum, a New York-based company dealing in signed and rare collectible artefacts.Braunfield said: “We acquired it at the Paul Castellano estate sale in November 2024. It was during this season that his mansion in Long Island, New York was being listed for sale.View image in fullscreenPage 2 of the manuscript, including Jack Kerouac’s signature in green ink at the bottom.Photograph: Your Own Museum“Preceding the sale of the property, the beneficiaries organised a private auction of Castellano’s collection. The amount of time Castellano owned this piece is unknown, however it has never been seen on public records.”Over the past year Braunfield and his team have been verifying the provenance of the piece, with a third-party company called Proper & Verified carrying out exhaustive checks and testing.He said: “The short story was bound in the form of a pamphlet. It is two pages long, and the last page is signed by Jack Kerouac. The signature is in green ink, and it shows clear signs of a fountain pen – damp folds in the paper.“The story itself takes place within the timeline of Kerouac’s masterpiece, On the Road. The dating of this short story shows that it was written during the writing process of On the Road, and it seems to us that it was created by Kerouac for the purpose of him further understanding the setting and characters. Evidently, it was never published, and we find no signs of this work anywhere else.“Despite it never being authenticated before, the provenance was too substantial for us not to take a risk. To our delight, after lab work and thorough investigation, it was confirmed that the item was from that time. On top of this, the signature was consistent with all confirmed examples of Kerouac.”Your Own Museum is now offering the manuscript for sale at $8,500 (£6,300).Explore more on these topicsJack KerouacMafianewsShareReuse this content"

A surrounding urban horizon is obscured from view by old-growth forest and 175 species of trees; the park is beholden to its own rhythms, with natural waterfalls, grand lawns stretched across the borough’s glacial rock formations, and fewer adjacent towering buildings. Visiting feels like a quiet reprieve. For the Brooklyn-born photographer Jamel Shabazz, Prospect Park has long been, as he writes in his newly released book, Prospect Park: Photographs of a Brooklyn Oasis, 1980 to 2025, “one of my best teachers … a giver of life”.‘I want to capture love’: the intimacy of Jamel Shabazz’s photographsRead moreShabazz has lovingly documented his city since 1980 (or earlier, if you count an adolescent stint with his mother’s Kodak Instamatic), photographing Black and brown New Yorkers of all ages with tender reverence: on the train, at the boardwalk, impeccably dressed, always camera-ready; Shabazz ensures his subjects are collaborative participants in the image-making. He has chronicled his work across several chapters – New York’s Pride parade, its emerging hip-hop scene, young romance – and into, by his count, 12 books, including A Time Before Crack, The Last Sunday in June and Back in the Days. At his home in Long Island during the Covid-19 lockdown – a curse of mass death, Shabazz says, that forced him to slow down – he examined his archives “and structured my work into themes, a gift and lesson I learned from my father, a professional photographer. It was an opportunity to look at my creative process, frame by frame.”View image in fullscreenProspect Park, 1988.Photograph: Jamel ShabazzProspect Park continually reappeared, as backdrop and muse. He compiled the park negatives and in 2021, they were presented publicly at an exhibition organized by Photoville and the Prospect Park Alliance, which prompted the attention of Prestel Publishing. The previously exhibited works are featured in the book amid a much larger selection; in one of Prospect Park’s five texts (including two by Shabazz himself), the New Yorker photo editor, Noelle Flores Théard, writes: “His photographic process in the park was more organic than his purpose-minded portraits on the street.” The Prospect Park portraits contain Shabazz’s signature throughline of care alongside a palpable ease bestowed by the titular oasis, a feeling the photographer remembers affecting him early and instantly.Shabazz was seven, maybe eight, when he visited the park for the first time. School was closing for the season, and the sun was shining. “It was a beautiful summer day,” he says. “The air smelled fresh. We had pizza and took the bus to the park, and I’ll never forget the exhilarated feeling of beingfreein this new space.” An avid reader with unfettered access to his parents’ vast library of books and magazines, he pored over articles about animals in Life and National Geographic, learning, he explains, to empathize equally with humans and non-humans. (He recalls an early affinity for the work of Jane Goodall.) Prospect Park enabled him to see wildlife up-close, an experience that “transformed” him. Shabazz and his cousins loved to chase butterflies; they’d bring mayonnaise jars from their homes in Red Hook “and have competitions: who can catch the best butterfly or bee? It was a joy to step into a place surrounded by this serenity, this atmosphere of natural beauty.”View image in fullscreenProspect Park, 1995.Photograph: Jamel ShabazzThe natural beauty abounds in Prospect Park: in one image, a girl blows a dandelion, a blur of whirled petals at her side. In another, a father sits in a tree and reads a book aloud to his son, who watches from below. “When I saw that, it blew me away,” Shabazz shares. “There’s something artistic about the beauty of the tree, too. It’s an ideal backdrop.” In 1977, still in his youth, Shabazz enlisted in the military and was stationed in Germany’s Black Forest, where the petrichor and greenery made him nostalgic for home. “It reminded me of Prospect Park: being in the field, in the woods, the smell,” he says. When he returned to the city in 1980, “I came home to war. A lot of young men were at odds with each other, and lives were being taken.” He began making portraits with his Canon AE-1, partly inspired by the creativity of his parents. “My father put me on assignment,” he says. “He directed me to look deeper.”Prospect Park, for Shabazz, was no longer simply thrilling but hallowed. In between spontaneous shoots, he’d walk to Lookout Point, nearly 180ft above sea level, and write. “That was my sacred spot,” he says. “When you’ve been in the military, it takes a while to reacquaint yourself with civilian life. The park served as a transitional space to separate myself from the noise, to be alone.” Shabazz had also joined the New York corrections department, with which he’d spend the next 20 years. Six of those were at Rikers Island, where the conditions were disheartening and the circumstances surrounding the inmates’ detention troubling. “After what I experienced and saw at work, the park was therapeutic.” His co-workers from the academy were among the first people with whom he shared his growing portfolio; eventually, he began mentoring the inmate population. “The photographs started conversations about life, about atonement. If someone came upon a photograph of Prospect Park, it might take them back to a point in their lives when they’d gone there as a child.”View image in fullscreenProspect Park, 1982.Photograph: Jamel ShabazzParkgoers, he realized, had a shared objective: seeking comfort. It was easier to approach his subjects there, to ask for permission. “It’s a slower pace. The heart rate goes down. My style was brick walls and gates, but in the park, I had sunrises and sunsets.” The photographs’ light often reveals the season: the red, stained-glass sun of fall; the dappling of glowing gold, marking the dawn of summer. A couple in twin cerulean coats embrace on a snow-dotted bridge. In the spring, another couple do the same, on a tree stump carved with a face (Shabazz has a knack for finding his oeuvre’s parallels; mirror-images poses, snapped decades apart, appear throughout). A man paints an autumnal soccer gameen plein air. A woman and two girls feed a paddling of ducks. At Drummer’s Grove, a gathering place where Shabazz met the Vietnam veteran and activist Richard E Green – who contributed an essay to the book’s pages – revelers encircle each other, dancing, wailing on trumpets. If the book has a theme beyond the setting, it is time. In the park, Shabazz had more of it to share. In return, everyone pictured granted him theirs.View image in fullscreenProspect Park, 1982.Photograph: Jamel ShabazzShabazz has spoken of spotting his subjects’ beauty, how compelled he feels to hold it up to the light and create what he calls “visual medicine”. He wants to capture love, he says; in doing so, he hopes to give it back. One black-and-white photograph, made in 1982 and featured in a two-page spread in Prospect Park, depicts four smiling women on a bench. When Shabazz posted it on his Instagram, where much of his archive is showcased, a young man contacted him to thank him and share that those were his sisters, three of whom had since passed away. The connections he made back then, even briefly, keep resonating.Today, he visits Prospect Park infrequently, finding new sacred quiet at Jones Beach, his “second home,” in the fall and winter. When he does return, it’s a reunion. “I go to Drummer’s Grove, because a lot of the people I photographed back in the days are still there. I bring my portfolios and we reconnect.” He describes his camera as a compass, he continues, that “leads me to the people who I need to meet. My objective is to make sure that the history is preserved, to secure my legacy and, importantly, that of all the people who’ve stepped in front of my lens.”Prospect Park: Photographs of a Brooklyn Oasis, 1980 to 2025 is out nowExplore more on these topicsPhotographyBrooklynNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But she’s drawn into danger when she agrees to help a man whose wife, an artist skilled in the new art of “vivid dreaming” – using AI and virtual reality to allow her live audience into her stories – has disappeared. He has seen a video from someone claiming to have kidnapped her and hopes Julia can tell him who sent it. The near-future setting is convincing, and the story is rich in interesting ideas about potential developments in the use of AI and social media. Julia is a strong, complex character, and there’s a suggestion there could be a series of novels about her. Action-packed as well as thought-provoking, this is one of the best science-fiction books of the year.View image in fullscreenWhen There Are Wolves Againby EJ Swift (Arcadia, £20)Like Swift’s previous novel,The Coral Bones, this book is powered by a passionate love of nature and deep concern for the planet’s future. Beginning with the character-forming effects of major events during the childhoods of the two main characters – Covid lockdowns for Lucy, the Chornobyl disaster for Hester – the novel tracks their separate journeys in climate activism and documentary film-making as both make their own contribution towards a better world, until 2070, when they meet at last. Evocative and beautifully written, this character-driven novel also inspires as an argument for rewilding in Britain.View image in fullscreenThe White Octopus Hotelby Alexandra Bell (Del Rey, £18.99)Eve has grown up feeling responsible for the death of her little sister, and her only escape is through art and music, especially tunes composed in the 1930s by Max Everly, a mysterious figure who vanished from history. In 2015 an elderly gentleman gives Eve a small ornament – a white octopus with a black tip on one tentacle. How does he know it’s her birthday, or that she’s obsessed with octopuses? Eve’s quest for answers leads her to the legendary White Octopus Hotel in the Swiss Alps, fallen into ruin since it closed in 1935, but still hiding objects with magical powers, including a key that lets Eve travel in time. This is an absorbing magical mystery, the story of two wounded people given the chance to save one another.View image in fullscreenDarker Daysby Thomas Olde Heuvelt(Bantam, £18.99)The latest from the author ofHextakes place in a small town in Washington state, on Bird Street, where all the residents are fantastically successful, healthy and happy – except in November, when the “Darker Days” arrive. Then the adults must pay the fee and sacrifice one human life. They seek out elderly, terminally ill people who are ready to die, but one year their best-laid plans fail, and for the Lewis-da Silva family, the darker days turn especially dark and gruesome. This masterly work of horror, gripping and terrifying on more than one level, is probably Heuvelt’s best novel yet.View image in fullscreenRemainby Nicholas Sparks with M Night Shyamalan(Sphere,£22)Author Sparks and film-maker Shyamalan jointly developed the premise and characters for this romantic supernatural mystery. Tate is an emotionally repressed architect recovering from a nervous breakdown when he wakes up to find a strange woman, Wren, living in the house he’s rented for himself alone. Unsurprisingly, she’s a ghost who doesn’t know she’s dead, unable to “move on” until a mystery connected to her death is resolved. Realising that some things he had never believed in are real – and he’s in love with one – Tate determines to set Wren free by finding out how she died. There’s nothing very original about this formulaic story, but it’s smoothly done: a warm-hearted, sentimental tale of the expected.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFantasy booksHorror booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Renovated with affectionate cheek by Rob Madge, it’s a scrappy but very fun take on the tale of dowager dress-up and scheming lovebirds.Jack (Benjamin Westerby) and Charley (sweetly bird-brained Jonathan Case) want alone time with their beloveds Kitty and Amy (Yasemin Özdemir and Mae Munuo). Even if they evade the girls’ forbidding guardian, decorum demands a chaperone. Charley’s rich aunt doesn’t show, so am-dram fan Babbs is persuaded to impersonate her. Do shenanigans ensue? They certainly do.Brandon Thomas, a Liverpudlian clerk turned actor, wrote the original 1892 smash. In Madge’s version, the women are no longer bit players in posh-boy stratagems, but every bit as smart and racy as their swains (Kitty, the minx, even waxes her ankles). Crucially, Babbs transforms from silly-ass student to sharp butler: a Jeeves saving the day by climbing into a crinoline.On a textual level, Madge often doesn’t so much adapt as heckle the original, cheerfully scattering quips, filth and people getting the ick. Some of the most deeply dippy lines are in fact Thomas’s – rhapsodies about Oxford’s ancient spires, random offers of mayonnaise and the celebrated non sequitur about “Charley’s aunt from Brazil – where the nuts come from”. Others are most definitely Madge: “When that royal butler said he’d introduce me to his Prince Albert, that was not what I was expecting.”View image in fullscreenBeloveds … from left, Yasemin Özdemir, Benjamin Westerby, Mae Munuo and Jonathan Case.Photograph: Mark SeniorThe candy-striped doors and pink icing balustrade on Alex Berry’s set are as toothsome as her costumes: jaunty shorts, florals, lemon meringue frills and lots of bows. Zippily performed, Sophie Drake’s brisk production is kissing cousin to the National Theatre’s currentThe Importance of Being Earnest– Victorian courtship comedy gets a colourful glow-up, queer tweak and poppy soundtrack. The shows even share a gag about a self-playing piano.For Gill’s tender Babbs, an afternoon as auntie is a liberation. Settling into a layer cake of ruffle or daring sequinned trousers, they can let their freak flag fly: flirting or gossiping about partying with Gilbert and Sullivan (“the 80s werewild”). “I’m simply enjoying being whatever I am,” they declare.AtWatermill theatre, Newbury, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWatermill theatreComedyDragreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a script writtenwith his regular collaborator Oisín Kearney, Patrick describes the impact of that prognosis and his decision to take part in an international drug trial.Directed by Kearney with an assured touch, the simple staging against a plain black curtain is animated by a soundtrack of Patrick voicing his friends, family and childhood drama teacher, with snatches of songs and Shakespeare sparking memories. Referring to his eligibility as “a diversity hire”, having lost the use of his right leg, a tongue-in-cheek social media post suggesting stage roles he was now suited for prompted Belfast’s Lyric theatre to invite him to playRichard IIIlast year. Adapting the text with Kearney, who directed him, Patrick’s portrayal of the murderous king as disabled was far from tokenistic.Watching Patrick spinning in his hi-tech wheelchair, speaking with wryly humorous candour about being “a dying man”, it is as if there is no gap between the performance and his life; he is summoning all his available energy for these moments on stage, in his chosen form. “For this hour, I’m the one in charge,” he says.Honest about his fears of death and the frustrations of having to be lifted into bed, dressed and cared for, what makes his account so exceptional is his total lack of self-pity. He could have written a bestselling memoir about his illness, he says, but instead chose to perform it because, like a life, “theatre is there until it’s not”.AtAxis Ballymun, Dublin, until 10 October as part ofDublin Theatre festival, which runs until 12 October.

His recordings of these with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra reach their penultimate volume with the Concerto No 4 andSalvatore Sciarrino’s 15-minute Il sogno di Stradella, conducted by Omer Meir Wellber.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Beethoven Vol 4: Salvatore di Sciarrino.Photograph: Orchid ClassicsBiss’s tempos are unhurried in the concerto, and while his playing fizzes when Beethoven asks it to, this exuberance isn’t a constant undercurrent; the first movement sometimes feels a little episodic. Yet the tension in the middle movement between the belligerent orchestra and the serene piano is highly effective, and the finale, genial without being playful, has enough weight to balance it out. It’s a characteristically considered, thoughtful performance.The Stradella in Sciarrino’s title refers to thefree-living 17th-century composerwho escaped assassination by one jealous nobleman, only to be murdered by another. Sparking off the sound of footsteps, the piano initiates a waltz-like tune, with one foot in a baroque church and one in mid-20th-century Paris – all with string harmonics evoking a haze of radio static. Even Biss can’t quite explain its link with Beethoven, but as an atmospheric vignette, it stands on its own.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

The 23-year-old US songwriter couldn’t be much further from his brand of hypermasculine evangelism. Her debut album, The Hermit, recalls the rich 90s scene of offbeat North American female singer-songwriters who would go on toshare the stage at Lilith Fair: Shawn Colvin’s acoustic breeziness, Fiona Apple’s earnest blues, Indigo Girls’ strident joy. (Similar era, very different scene: Patterson’s voice has an expressive skippiness that also channels Life Without Buildings’ Sue Tompkins.) Her songs – and I say this as the greatest compliment – could easily have lived on the soundtrack tocosy mother-daughter drama Gilmore Girls. Fittingly, God wonders whether she should have a baby, and Hey Mama pays tribute to her own mother, pairing the scrappy triumph of Tom Petty’s Free Fallin’ with impressionistic vocals that feel like a singer nudging her way towards revelation.Patterson grew up in North Carolina and moved to Los Angeles as a kid, in part so the family could support her brother’s dreams of becoming an actor. She studied at the starry LA County High School for the Arts (alumni include Phoebe Bridgers and Haim) and also wanted to act – until music became her thing, her taste evolving beyond the family’s soul records and church background when she discovered Radiohead and Nick Drake. After her brother and grandmother died, she scrapped her plan to study acting, no longer able to pretend to be other people, and threw herself into music. Since then, she’s supportedCameron Winterand soon heads out on a US tour withJens Lekman. Feels like the good kind of cult success lies her way.Laura SnapesThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBeverly Glenn-Copeland (right) and Elizabeth Copeland.Photograph: Wade MuirBeverly Glenn-Copeland – Let Us DanceGlenn-Copeland celebrates his relationship with his wife, Elizabeth, in this revamped version of a Keyboard Fantasies song, a hymnal benediction about joy and movement featuring a new choral accompaniment.Oklou – Viscus ft FKA twigs“Sometimes I’m so fragile / As if someone else’s face feels more like home,” the French producer trills, smartly contrasting trance’s diaphanous high end with lyrics about the difficulty of feeling grounded.Haim – Tie You Down ft Bon IverCan Danielle Haim and Justin Vernon just start a sensual gospel duo already? “I want you here but I don’t know how,” they sing, channelling the starry-eyed yearning of their recent records.

Beside us are a small dipping pool, some mulberry trees and a whitewashed house crawling with purple bougainvillaea, from which two dogs drift in and out to inspect our work.“This is pretty therapeutic, isn’t it?”someone says above the clattering of tools, as flower-dappled light dances on a canopy that’s shielding us from the hot Andalucían sun.We’re on a four-day wild clay ceramics retreat atLas Mecias, a regenerative farm in Spain’s Alpujarras, an idyllic valley just over an hour and a half south-east of Granada in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The course is a collaboration between Las Mecias’s Dutch owners, Laura and Nina, and Spaniards Milena and Julia fromTierra de Arcillas, a local ceramics studio. They connected through Instagram and things evolved from there.The aim is to teach guests how to find, forage, process and fire ceramics from locally sourced wild clay in a more sustainable approach to pottery. They run a handful of workshops in spring and autumn when temperatures are more bearable.I found Las Mecias while looking for pottery retreats in Spain, already hooked after one wheel-throwing workshop months earlier. That class came towards the end of a debilitating bout of depression and anxiety that had left me unable to work or function properly for months. At the wheel, I felt the dark cloud lift temporarily and anxious ruminations evaporated like water on a hot stove.View image in fullscreen‘We test the quality of the clay by removing stones, adding a drop of water, making a ball, then a tiny sausage, then a ring.’Photograph: Tierra de ArcillasThis time I’d be hand-building pottery for the first time. Las Mecias is located in exactly the kind of place those tired of the city long to escape to. Set off a dusty track, a few minutes from the picturesque mountainsidepueblo(village) of Cástaras, the 2-hectare (5-acre) off-grid organic farm and retreat space is a natural haven dotted with olive and fruit trees, wildflowers and vegetable gardens.The accommodation comprises a tiny home (a dinky caravan with a sundeck), a good-sized Mongolian-style yurt, and a minimalist Mediterranean two-bedroomcasita(small house) with a kitchen, living room and terrace. All have spellbinding views over the low Sierra de la Contraviesa, which is speckled with vines andcortijos(farmhouses).Las Mecias is exactly the kind of place those tired of the city long to escape to – a natural haven dotted with olive trees and wildflowersOur group includes a model from Taiwan, a Spanish project manager, a French yoga teacher, a Polish AI expert and a clarinettist from High Wycombe. My girlfriend and I are staying off-site atEl Huerto de Lobras– a collection of bucolic apartments run by an endearingabuela(grandmother) named Ana.The first day begins with introductions followed by a lesson on clay theory and a foraging mission led by Milena and Julia. The warm, spirited couple, who met in Barcelona and now live together in Almería, run Tierras de Arcillas in the foothills of the Alpujarras Almeriense.Sick of being stuck behind a screen, Julia, a graphic designer, took a ceramics course in Barcelona where she became fascinated with the origins of clay. Lighting designer Milena was converted later when trawling the hills of Almería, charmed by the earth’s colours and textures.View image in fullscreenThe retreat sits in an idyllic valley in the AlpujarrasArmed with pick-spades, we all set off to roam the marbled hills, searching for good clay.“See those cracks? That’s a good sign,”Julia says, leading us to a jagged, light-grey shard of mountain. We test the quality by removing stones, adding a drop of water, making a ball, then a tiny sausage, then a ring. The ring is the goal as it means the clay is 70% pure. After a positive test, we hack away frantically in clouds of dust, filling buckets like middle-class miners.Back at the farm, Laura and Nina prepare dinner. Between them, the couple have worked in kitchens across the UK, Australia, Denmark and the Netherlands, so meals at Las Mecias are exceptional. For breakfast, there’s freshly made sourdough loaves, homemade quince, strawberry and plum jams and plates of watermelon, mango and loquat. Lunches feature Ottolenghi-worthy salads, while dinners span Indonesian, Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cuisine – served with their own olive oil and natural wine.Between meals, we wander the grounds, flop in deck chairs and hammocks staring out to snow-capped peaks, and work on our pieces. One of the group – me – makes an ugly olive dish, which looks like a flower that’s been stamped on. Others craft impressive vases, plates, cups, trays and bird feeders.View image in fullscreenMealtimes at Las Mecias are an added delightThe workshop is well structured and flows naturally. Each part feels like a therapeutic technique. Foraging becomes my grounding ritual. Processing clay by removing impurities echoes filtering out negative beliefs. Deep discussions replace the rawness of therapy. And nutritious meals, quality sleep and abundant nature restore the soul.Over the days, my mind quietens. It’s not a resounding silence. I’m not cured from the mental health issues that have plagued me for two decades, but I feel calmer. I’m attuned to the hum of bees and the crunch of stones underfoot. Inconveniences morph into joyful moments: getting stuck behind a farmer herding goats on a winding mountain road, having no phone signal anywhere, and being woken by the local church choir.Over the days, my mind quietens. It’s not a resounding silence, but I feel calmerThe four-day workshop culminates in a final ritual, where we fire up the handbuilt kiln and load it with our pieces. Between shifts gathering sticks and stoking the fire, we take turns dipping in the pool.After sunset, Laura makes a pizza while Nina glides around with homemade wine and jugs ofshrub– a refreshing drink made from fruit and vinegar.View image in fullscreen‘There’s no telling what’s survived: the fire decides’.Photograph: Tierra de ArcillasPerching on hay bales, swigging wine and sharing stories, we cheer as the kiln’s temperature hits its century milestones, before reaching a high of 917F (492C). Sealing the oven, Milena and Julia chant a symbolic blessing,“protectora, ponle lo que falta y quitale lo que le sobra”, roughly translated to,“protector, provide us with what we lack and remove what isn’t needed”,before we retire to bed.The Spanish camping brand that’s big on nature immersion, cool design and creature comfortsRead moreThe next morning, we gather around the kiln and remove bricks, one by one. There’s no telling what’s survived: the fire decides. Perhaps a final reminder that acceptance and letting go is part of the process. Cheers erupt and compliments are exchanged as the first pieces emerge intact.As we say our goodbyes, one member of the group leaves us with a final moment of reflection.“Honestly, I didn’t really care what mine turned out like. It didn’t matter if it cracked or exploded. I just enjoyed the process and would’ve accepted whatever happened.”The retreat was provided byLas MeciasandTierra de Arcillas, which offerthree-night, four-dayintroduction to wild clay workshops, includingaccommodation,three dinners, three breakfasts and two lunches, and over15 hoursof theory and practical instruction.

Here you can walk across the rare grassland called the machair to the white, three-mile longWest Beach, which looks out into the North Atlantic, and marvel at the immense space and colour of the sea. We stayed at aGatliff Hebridean hostel, which consists of two converted crofts where for about £20 a night for a bunk you will be staying in probably one of the most peaceful locations in the world.

The main town, Chora, is beautiful, with buildings leading up a hill to an old castle. We rented a small apartment and spent our days on quiet pebble beaches that we had almost to ourselves. It’s a genuinely peaceful place where you can properly switch off from the noise of modern life. This Dodecanese island is the focus of a scheme for emission-free transport, with generous grants to replace petrol and diesel vehicles with electric ones.RoyProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Hearing its story of being created from local forests was as fascinating as the walk through the tall woods that surround it. We watched red kites soar over the valley before stargazing under a sky free from light pollution. Such tranquility and connection with nature is hard to find in the UK these days, but the benefits are palpable – we left rested and refreshed, more so than any recent holiday.HannahMagical Irish castleView image in fullscreenAnnes Grove Miniature CastleWe stayed at theAnnes Grove Miniature Castlein Castletownroche, County Cork, near to the ruined AugustinianBridgetown Prioryand Blackwater Castle, in what felt like the middle of nowhere. It was magical. The Irish Landmark Trust has renovated it for people to stay in, complete with a wood-burning stove and comfy gothic bed.

Expertly guided by Tora tours, I endured a dreadful but thankfully short sea crossing to Mykines to see puffins, visited the beautiful villages of Saksun (population: eight) and Gjógv (a metropolis of 31 inhabitants) and explored Tinganes, location of the islands’ parliament. It was the most wonderful, wild and remote August week, shrouded in fog and empty space.AbigailOff-grid in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenThe River Coquet in Northumberland national park.Photograph: David Taylor Photography/AlamyLast October we had a wonderful week in the most remote part of Northumberland – theUpper Coquetvalley. Our stay was an off-grid, simple bunk barn called Nightfold at the top of the valley. We spent a week living like woodland creatures in autumn – eating heartily, keeping ourselves warm (thanks to the wood-burning stove) and sleeping. In the daytime, we did long walks where we didn’t see a single other person – only sheep, deer, birds and squirrels. At night there were endless stars, the Milky Way and reading by candlelight. Bliss.BenFree camping in Portugal’s mountainsView image in fullscreenThe Serra da Estrela mountains.Photograph: ARoxo/Getty ImagesThe sleepy villages of continental Portugal’s highest mountain range, the Serra da Estrela, are a world away from the coastal honeypots of Lisbon and Porto. In Vila Cova à Coelheira there is a free campsite on the banks of the Alva river, reached via an old Roman bridge that you can swim under (or jump in from if you’re feeling brave). Even better, there is a bar at the river beach that serves excellent pica-pau – pork braised in wine, with onions and pickles. During my stay there I never encountered more than one or two others camping.DavidCroatia’s Mljet island is not for the jet setView image in fullscreenA monastery on a lake on the island of Mljet in Croatia.Photograph: Vedrana2701/AlamyAway from Dubrovnik’s cruise-ship crowds, Mljet island feels like another world: pine forests dipping into turquoise bays, an ancient monastery on a tiny islet in the middle of a saltwater lake, and hardly a sound beyond cicadas and the wind. I stayed in a simple family-run cottage just outside the national park gates, where evenings meant grilled fish on the terrace and nights under skies thick with stars. Days were spent kayaking across mirror-still water and walking through pine-scented trails where I rarely met another soul. It felt like stepping into a slower rhythm of life, a corner of Europe the 21st century has politely passed by.Mark AdamsonView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m not a fan of tinned pumpkin – it’s watery and flat-tasting – so I’ve taken the extra step of roasting some butternut or Kent squash; the oven’s heat coaxes out its natural sweetness while evaporating excess moisture, resulting in a smooth, flavourful puree that gives the cheesecake real depth. The maple pecan brittle provides the final flourish: golden, nutty and with just the right amount of crunch to offset the cheesecake’s creamy softness.Pumpkin cheesecake with maple pecan brittleTo make 200g pumpkin puree, chop 350-400g peeled, deseeded pumpkin into chunks, then roast, loosely covered, at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 until soft but not browned.

In a food processor, blitz the biscuits to fine crumbs, then tip into a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and salt, and mix so the crumbs are evenly damp. Tip into the greased tin, press down firmly, bake for 10 minutes, then remove and leave to cool.Turn down the oven temperature to 175C (155C fan)/355F/gas 3¼. Meanwhile, put the cream cheese, sugar and orange zest in the bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with the paddle attachment on medium-low until smooth and creamy (about 30 seconds). Add the pumpkin puree, cornflour and spices, and beat on medium-low until combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating in well between each addition, then add the soured cream and vanilla, and beat until fully incorporated.Pour the pumpkin filling on to the cooled biscuit base and smooth the top with a small spatula. Tap the tin gently on a worktop to dispel any air bubbles, then bake the cheesecake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes, until the edges are set and the centre is slightly wobbly. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave the cheesecake to cool for an hour. Once it’s at room temperature, chill for at least six hours (and up to three days), until completely set.Meanwhile, make the pecan brittle (up to three days ahead). Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line a small oven tray with baking paper. Combine the maple syrup and sugar in a small saucepan and stir gently over a low heat for about a minute, until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the pecans and sea salt, then remove from the heat and scrape into the lined tray. Bake for about eight minutes, until golden and bubbly, then remove and leave to cool. Once the brittle is completely hard, chop into irregular pieces and store in an airtight container in the freezer.Release the cheesecake from its tin and transfer to a platter. Whisk the cream to soft peaks, then spoon into the middle of the cheesecake, leaving a 3-4cm border all around. Scatter most of the pecan brittle on top, then serve with extra pecan brittle alongside.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodAutumn food and drinkBakingVegetablesCheeseCakerecipesShareReuse this content"
