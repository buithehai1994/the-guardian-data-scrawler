Here are a few good habits that will help you stay productiveSign up here to get the whole series straight to your inboxSarah PhillipsThu 1 Jan 2026 11.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 11.02 ESTShareIt is an all-too-familiar scenario: you reheat a bowl of last night’s noodles for lunch, devour it, then return to your desk and gradually droop over the course of the afternoon, to the point at which you are battling to keep your eyes open. Or perhaps you struggle with energy on waking up; or, after a busy start and strong coffee first thing, you begin to fade mid-morning. Or, like me, after dinner in the winter months, you are completely lethargic.How common are such peaks and troughs in our energy levels? “If you’re having an active day, then you will naturally get tired because we are human, we’re not machines,” says Dr Linia Patel, a dietitian and nutritionist. “Getting tired at the end of the day, before you go to bed, is perfect. But getting tired at your desk is not great.” Chronic tiredness is something to see a doctor about, says Patel, as it could be a symptom of illness.But the afternoon slump is perhaps the most common energy dip. “It can be seen across lots of different populations and has real-world implications,” saysDr Thomas Marjot, a hepatologist at Oxford University Hospitals with an interest in circadian rhythms and metabolism. “It could just make you feel rubbish and affect work performance, or it can cause people to nod off at the wheel and have road traffic accidents.”Marjot explains that there are two processes at play that cause our energy levels to fluctuate.“One is sleep pressure, the natural tiredness that builds the longer we’ve been awake. The other is our circadian rhythm, the body’s internal clock, which gives us a daily pattern in alertness that starts to reduce in the afternoon.”For most, it is at about 3pm when there is a dip in energy, says Marjot. “Sleep pressure has been rising for several hours, and at the same time the circadian alertness signal naturally dips. When those two things coincide, we feel the classic afternoon slump. You see the same pattern even in ‘bunker’ experiments, where people live for days with no clocks, daylight or meal cues, which shows that this afternoon dip is naturally built into our biology.”So how can you get through a slump?Go for a coffee“You can artificially prop up your alertness using caffeine, which is the most readily available and socially acceptable stimulant,” says Marjot. How much caffeine and at what time you should stop so as to not affect your sleep depends on your tolerance, says Patel. “Some people are much faster metabolisers of caffeine than others. And for some, if they have caffeine, it will make them feel super anxious and their heart races.” Generally, it’s not advisable to have more than 400mg of caffeine a day. The caffeine content of drinks varies wildly but this roughly translates as two cups of coffee a day, and you should stop at around lunchtime. Energy drinks are not recommended, adds Patel, “as they are often high in sugar, stimulants and additives that may amplify raised heart rates, cause energy spikes and crashes, and disrupt sleep”.Caffeine also affects our dopamine levels, which is our “lust for life”, says Dr Katie Cooper, a psychologist and author of This Book Will Give You Energy, which will be published by Quadrille in April. “If you go back to caveman days, dopamine was the thing that kept you moving forward, going out looking for resources, living another day. Transferring the idea of that back to the modern day, it keeps you energised for work or being productive.”Plan your lunch carefullyView image in fullscreenCoffee and a banana – the perfect pairing?Photograph: Tim Gray/Getty Images“We know that slumps are exacerbated significantly by a large lunch – then you get much worse afternoon dips in your ability to concentrate and increase in your sleepiness,” says Marjot. “The parasympathetic nervous system, which is largely responsible for rest and digest processes, is massively turned on with a large meal, so it’s unsurprising that you feel a bit sleepy.”We can feel tired after lunch because “blood is going straight to your stomach to digest – that is the priority and there is less left for your brain”, says Patel. The key to addressing this, she says, is looking at what you are eating. “Having pasta at lunch is a recipe for you to feel super slump-ish in the afternoon. But if you instead include a small portion, a quarter of a plate’s worth of wholegrain carbohydrates, then that is enough to give you the energy you need, but not necessarily to give you a slump.” The rest of your plate should be a quarter protein – “if you want to be perky in the afternoon, you have to include some protein in your lunch” – and the rest vegetables or fruit. Patel concedes that this can be hard if you are grabbing a sandwich on the go, and suggests adding in a carrot and hummus pot or a hard-boiled egg to get the balance right. As a dietary supplement, B vitamins can give an added energy boost, she adds.Some of us reach for sugar in an energy emergency, but this may be counter-productive: “You run the risk of having a sugar rush and then a second slump,” says Patel. Having some protein as well as chocolate would be a better plan.There are certain foods that are naturally energy-boosting, says Patel. “A banana contains glucose, which gives you energy – it is why they are used a lot in sport.” But this could also cause a spike and crash. Instead, Patel suggests green tea for a “slow, focused, steady release of energy” through its combination of the amino acid L-theanine and a low dose of caffeine – so again, proceed with caution in the afternoon if you are sensitive to the latter.Visit the water cooler“Most of the time I find people who have a slump are also dehydrated,” says Patel: the guidance is1.5 to 1.8 litresof water a day. “If you are mildly dehydrated, you’re not going to be as efficient.” The colour of your urine is the best way to check your hydration: “the clearer the better”, says Patel.Take a walkView image in fullscreenA snowy woodland is ideal, but failing that, a rain-soaked suburban street will do.Photograph: Cavan Images/Getty ImagesWhat you do after eating is almost as important as the food itself. Going straight back to a sedentary position at your desk is the exact opposite of what works best: a brief stroll outside.“Just that movement of walking and using different muscles in your body activates starting digesting and getting glucose to the muscles,” says Patel. “Getting some fresh air is also a fantastic way to keep yourself alert.”Dr Katharina Lederle, a sleep therapist and chronobiologist (studying biological rhythms), advises her clients to get up every hour for a mini movement break to help boost alertness: “Sitting down for long periods is associated with poorer sleep, and can affect concentration negatively, whereas getting up regularly improves energy levels, attention and sleep.”But Cooper adds it is important not to push yourself if you are very fatigued. “If you’re exhausted and then you cane yourself in the gym, it might give you a bit of a dopamine hit, but it is also going to leave you wiped out. Listen to your body, and if you’re too tired, go for a walk instead.”Catch up with colleaguesInteracting with others is a guaranteed way to wake yourself up, says Lederle: a 2018study showedthat socialising during a micro-break had positive effects on performance. With the rise of working from home, this is not always easy to do, but Lederle says sending a message to a friend or even just looking at photos can have a similar effect.Smartphones can trigger dopamine, but Cooper doesn’t recommend a quick scroll to overcome ennui. Instead, we should seek out more adaptive pursuits: “In caveman days, everyone would go out and explore; it would be an adventure. Variety is the spice of life. Being able to do little explorations within your day, like taking a different route home, will be energising because it’s new and it’s exciting.”Extreme exposure to temperature, through an ice plunge or a sauna, can also liven things up by getting the blood circulating– and the fall in dopamine afterwards is slower than if you’d had a hot chocolate, says Cooper.Get outdoorsView image in fullscreenIn winter months, catch the sunset if you can.Photograph: EyeEm Mobile GmbH/Getty ImagesThe other thing to play with is light. “Light is a very powerful stimulator of the circadian system to signal alertness,” says Marjot. At this time of year, when leaving for work in the dark and getting home in the dark, it is important for workers to get out during the day “and get some daylight just to signal to the circadian system that it’s daytime and they should be awake”.Sleep well – or napYou can’t improve your daytime energy without also working on your night-time sleep. “If you wake up after a bad night’s sleep, you’re not going to have a good day,” says Cooper. Positive sleep hygiene, Marjot says, involves: “Morning daylight, avoiding caffeine in the afternoons, winding down 30-60 minutes before you go to bed, reducing your screen time in bed, and keeping your bedroom cool, dark and quiet.”View image in fullscreenNapping in the office poses unique challenges.Photograph: Zoonar GmbH/AlamyIf you are really fighting to stay awake, is a nap OK? “There are different camps on that,” says Cooper. “If you’re someone who is chronically struggling with sleep, then I think you are better off not napping and getting outside for a walk instead.” But if you sleep well, a nap is fine, says Lederle. “When we have that dip in alertness, it is a great time to have a short nap if you are a napper: 20 minutes to half an hour, no longer than that, and then your alertness will rise again.”Is there any hope for those of us who slump in the evening? “You would want to make it brighter in the afternoon to send your body alertness signals,” says Lederle. Failing that, “lean into it”, says Patel – and have an early night ready for an energised new day.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHow to have a better daySleepHealth & wellbeingDiets and dietingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The song’s credits would educate me on the sample’s origins; I had previously assumed Big Yellow Taxi was an Amy Grant original. The second time I heard a Mitchell song was when Travis covered the beautiful River as a B-side.Mitchell always seemed a bit too “adult” to me, or too folky, or too jazzy. As with Bob Dylan, another entry in the “best artists of all time” canon that had eluded me, I had dismissed her voice as an acquired taste. My childhood home was all Michael Jackson, TLC and Meat Loaf, while my teenage years leaned towards singer-songwriters who could channel my angst: I playeda lotof Alanis Morissette.View image in fullscreenJoni Mitchell performing in Berkeley, California, in 1974.Photograph: Larry Hulst/Getty ImagesI emailed this perhaps depressing backstory to author Ann Powers, whose book Traveling: On the Path of Joni Mitchell tells a similar story. “With time I came to realise that Joni’s great gift is for capturing the tangled ways in which people ruminate and, trying to make connections, communicate with each other,” she replied, before name-checking two Mitchell classics, Blue and Hejira. But my mention of Janet Jackson, she said, makes her think of Prince, whose favourite Mitchell album was 1975’s initially misunderstood experimental gem, The Hissing of Summer Lawns. “It’s her vibe-iest album and the one in which she fully employs her gift for social critique,” Ann added.She is right: the albumisvibey, and after a few listens at home it works particularly well as I take it for a walk on a crisp winter’s day. My early favourite is the avant-pop of The Jungle Line, which uses an early version of sampling to create an intoxicating swirl of distorted drums and synthesised percussion. Lyrically it’s an abstract collage of modern city life and music industry politics, the imagery delivered in a half-sung style I recognise from Laura Marling. I also hear Kim Gordon in the blank intonations of Harry’s House, a song about curdling domesticity, and the synthesiser-heavy Shadows and Light reminds me of Purple Rain-era Prince.I have to confess that the album’s midsection – the jazzy Edith and the Kingpin; the orchestral softness of Shades of Scarlett Conquering – washes over me a bit. At home, I give the more emotionally direct Blue a go. It instantly suits the evening dusk, and as River’s brutal emotional economy hits I almost cry into my Baileys. As Q-Tip said on Got ’Til It’s Gone: “Joni Mitchell never lies.”Michael Cragg‘I wince at Kendrick Lamar’s high-pitched vocals’View image in fullscreenLamar on stage in 2022.Photograph: Jason Koerner/Getty ImagesThis year, after I wrotea middling review of Drake’s trifecta of Wireless shows, I was repeatedly accused by his stans of being an agent for Kendrick Lamar, working to entrench the beef between the two rappers. Nothing could be farther from the truth: I’ve been a fan of Drake’s music since the days of downloading mixtapes off DatPiff, and I have never been able to stand Lamar’s music. There’s one simple reason: his voice. I find it unbelievably nasally and grating and it often triggers my misophonia (a lower tolerance to certain sounds).Recently, though, I’ve been thinking that I need to reassess my relationship with Lamar and work through my wincing at his higher pitch. I appreciate a wide range of Black music, so how can I flat-out refuse to listen to someone considered one of the greatest figures in hip-hop, whose conscious lyrics and painting of inner-city subcultures have earned him a Pulitzer? I was very impressed by his Super Bowl half-time performance, particularly his impeccable breath control and incredibly clever staging and social critiques.I turn to a close friend of mine, Derrien, who is a Lamar superfan and discovered him during the heyday of hip-hop blogs, back when he was still using the moniker K.Dot. Derrien likes the fact that Lamar is not for everyone. “I gravitated to him because I found his lyrics to be quite layered,” he tells me. “They were like a puzzle to figure them out, so I’d listen and have Genius open to decipher them.” There’s also a personal dimension for Derrien. “I really resonated with his story, especially Good Kid, MAAD City because the title alone resonated with the tribulations of trying to formulate a moral compass when you’re surrounded by gang shit.”So where should I start with Lamar to make good on my resolution? The deep cuts, Derrien tells me as he sends me a wide-ranging playlist. I start with Black Boy Fly, which immediately resonates with my own experiences growing up in the inner city, dreaming of making it out of your environment, particularly the idea that success could only come through making it in sport or rap: “Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40.” Then there’s ADHD from his debut album Section.80, which speaks well to experiences of overstimulation and the numbing effect of growing up amid chaos.But it’s the 12-minute long Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst that really stirs me emotionally. To my surprise, I find Lamar’s mixed pitch cinematic and searching rather than jarring, and it lends an authentic complexity to a track that is partly narrated from the perspective of a murdered friend. Derrien tells me that a notorious Lamar-hater and vloggercried while listening to it. I understand. I feel as though I’m on a spiritual road that is leading towards conversion.Jason Okundaye‘On paper, Diamanda Galás offers a lot of what I like …’View image in fullscreenDiamanda Galás in 1985.Photograph: Paul Harris/Getty ImagesMy first interaction with the truly uncategorisable music of Diamanda Galás was at London’s Royal Festival Hall in 2012, a performance that moved me to tears but left me none the wiser, to be honest, about her place in the pantheon of 20th-century avant garde artists. But at least I started the right way round: experiencing her multifaceted mezzo-soprano in the flesh is the best introduction, according to devotee Luke Turner, co-founder of music website the Quietus. “When I’ve seen her live I’ve been in tears, and time goes weird,” he says.Why had I not gone back to Galás after that gig? On paper she offers a lot of what I like: weird, imperious, glam, politically radical – and, with those incredible pipes, fusing opera with Middle Eastern modal scales and black metal babble. But I admit I don’t really understand opera, or operatic things. My brain is tuned to repetition, and Galás’s music demands that I sit down and listen closely.“She’s the sort of artist where you have to focus – it’s not background music,” Luke advises. He got the chance to interview Galás in the early 00s and prepared by spending a weekend immersed in her records. Unfortunately, “it was when I was splitting up with my then wife, in a half-empty flat – it was a real psychic rinsing. But it was good, it worked.”I try to focus on the elements that appeal to me: notes of blues, goth, punk, free jazz and experimental composition. Over her 50-year career she’s collaborated with Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones on The Sporting Life (a soft no from me, as a committed Zep-hater) and path-breaking composer Iannis Xenakis, on N’Shima, an abstract piece for mezzo-sopranos, horns, trombones and cello (a massive yes, with my Wire-reading hat on).Luke points me towards industrial Galás – particularly The Divine Punishment, from a trilogy of records about the Aids crisis released in 1986, when the disease was still heavily stigmatised and barely understood. “I think she found the goth scene incredibly homophobic,” he notes. And this is the stuff: spooky, bizarre, confrontational and compositionally out-there – a soundtrack to a real-life horror movie.Finally, he guides me to her 2008 version of the Appalachian folk song O Death, where her floor-shaking melismatic vocals seem to channel something ancient and terrible, like Rosalía summoning Cthulhu. What more could you want?Chal Ravens‘Who has the time for Neil Young’s 60 albums?’In my mind,Neil Younghas always lived in an amorphous category of musicians that includes Bob Dylan, Nick Drake and Leonard Cohen, bound together by nothing more than a loose idea of what I think they will sound like: old-fashioned, miserable and boring. But every time I say this out loud, someone will jump to one of said musicians’ defence, and this is almost always Neil Young. My encounters with his music have been pleasant enough but limited (On the Beach via an old boyfriend, Harvest Moon via Eat Pray Love) and I’ve never believed the hype. Why didn’t I look any further? Because I’m stubborn, no doubt, but also because Young has such a huge discography: more than 60 albums, including bands and side projects. Who has the time?View image in fullscreenNeil Young in 2015.Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesBut in the spirit of trying something new, I reached out to John Mulvey, editor of Mojo and committed Young fan, to see if I could finally understand what he’s all about. John identified three key areas to focus on in his vast back catalogue: “the longform frazzled electric jams”; the more commercially successful, folky corner; and the “Ditch Trilogy” of Time Fades Away, On the Beach and Tonight’s the Night. “It’s a constantly unravelling, capricious and hyper-detailed story that can be very addictive,” he told me. “But obviously you need some basic love of what he does to get drawn in in the first place.” With that in mind, I decided to start with the classics: Harvest, from 1972, and Zuma, a favourite of several of my friends, from 1975.Over the next few weeks, guided by John’s suggestions, I tried repeat listens of these, plus 10 or so other albums across different styles and time periods. I played them at work, on the bus and while running errands; on one occasion, I listened to After the Gold Rush on the way home from a club. I noticed tracks growing catchier as they became more familiar, and I even jotted down a few for future listens (Tell Me Why, Motion Pictures (For Carrie), Don’t Cry No Tears). Still, it felt like homework.As a last-ditch attempt, I tried a sideways approach through Young’s “stylistically diverse and chaotic 1980s” music, which John suggested might align more with my tastes – such as Trans, where Young plays around with a vocoder and electronics. I enjoyed the huge, soaring synths on Computer Age, and was surprised by how hypnotic Like an Inca grew over its near-10 minute run time. John was certainly right about range.I still have more than 40 Neil Young records left to check out, and while I’d not yet consider myself a fan, I now feel more equipped to explain why. Plus, I’ve bagged a few new tracks along the way.Safi Bugel‘I pretended I liked Radiohead in high school to impress older kids’View image in fullscreenRadiohead in 1993.Photograph: Bob Berg/Getty ImagesI love a lot of gravely serious music, but it would be a stretch to describe myself, in any sense, as a “serious person”. I think this is the reason, among others, that I’ve never really been able to get intoRadiohead, a band I’ve always considered too morose and self-important. The closest I’ve ever got was in high school, when I torrented a few albums in order to credibly pretend I liked them when hanging out with some older kids. As time has gone on, I’ve let go of my hangups about seeming smart and largely given up trying to understand this godhead indie band.When asked if I wanted to try a listening resolution, Radiohead seemed like the obvious choice, and the obvious expert to ask was my friend Jazz Monroe, fellow music critic and certified Radiohead freak. He asked some questions. What’s the closest thing to Radiohead I like? I didn’t know; my boyfriend saidCameron Winter, and I’m still not sure if he was trolling. Who do I like most out of REM, Pixies and Robert Wyatt? REM. What’s my favourite Bowie album? Hunky Dory or Blackstar, I tell him.The magical life of Toni Basil: how she taught Elvis, enchanted Bowie - and had a smash hit with ‘Mickey’Read moreA day later, Jazz sent me a short playlist that he assured me was “not canon”, but which might present “a more sympathetic side” of the band for me. Aware of the roiling contempt I have for corporate omnipotence and the rich and powerful, he explained: “Thom is one of those artists who is so naively, childishly pissed off at the sight of a corporate smile or the sound of an automated phone line that they devote themselves to making something beautiful to put an opposite force into the world,” which I found a very compelling raison d’être.I did enjoy a lot of the songs on the playlist, especially more percussive tracks such as Weird Fishes, Blow Out and Where I End and You Begin: there I found that Yorke’s voice was offset nicely by the alternately pummelling and hypnotic drumming. Certain elements, like the warbling synths on the Hail to the Thief tracks, felt a little hackneyed before I remembered that the reason these sounds are so ubiquitous is because Radiohead are so influential. The songs that draw liberally from jazz generally tended to be my favourites, which tracks with the fact that I actually do really enjoy the Smile, which I know makes no sense because they’re basically Radiohead.Will I be diving deeper into the catalogue? Probably not. I like these songs well enough, but I can’t help but feel as if I’ve filled the Radiohead-shaped holes in my life with other music that serves a similar purpose. But I plan to listen to a few full albums, just to be sure – in part, because I think A Moon Shaped Pool is a gorgeous album title.Shaad D’SouzaExplore more on these topicsMusicRadioheadNeil YoungJoni MitchellPop and rockExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When was the last time you were clean-shaven?DoubleRDinerI’m an ambassador for Marie Curie andshaved it off live on X over lockdown. I’ve had the moustache since I was 23. It’s not itchy. I have to trim it, else it comes down over the lip and gets thick and bushy. I’ve tried going full walrus, but it doesn’t look good.Were the physical comedy greats from the silent era such asBuster Keaton, Harold Lloyd andMax Linderan inspiration for you and your brother [Barry] getting started in slapstick?TomboYes. Slapstick is something we’ve always found funny. Laurel and Hardy were our favourites. You can’t go wrong with visual comedy. There can’t be many people that don’t laugh at somebody falling down. We were brought up in showbusiness. My dad [Gene Patton, who worked with Peter Sellers] was a comedian and very visual. Our mum was a dancer. Our two older brothers were in the business. We’d been brought up in and out of the theatre all our lives and found it natural to be on stage.Was there ever any rivalry between you and your older brothers Jimmy and Brian, AKAthe Patton Brothers?Top TrampJimmy was 16 years older than me and in the business when I was born. Brian is 14 years older; he’s 92 in December. They sang, danced and did comedy. They were always on Saturday night telly through the 50s and 60s, tap-dancing with Ronnie Corbett and Harry Secombe. We used to tap-dance, but I wasn’t brilliant. When we were Butlin’s redcoats back in 1966, I had to learn to ballroom dance as well. We dropped the dancing in the early 70s and went pure comedy. My sister, Sheila, was a dancer, and my brother, Colin, was a motor mechanic. Sadly they’ve all gone. It’s just me and Brian left.‘To me, to uzi’: why Paul Chuckle as a gangster isn’t such a dramatic career changeRead moreDid working with your brother Barry for so long bring you as much happiness as it brought your audience?RoheonI think more. Anybody that watched us live could see the fun we had on stage. It was the same with filming – just look at the ChuckleVision outtakes. We loved each other and just had fun. He’d say something that made me laugh and I’d say something that made him laugh. I miss him dearly. That’s the biggest thing I miss – working with him on stage – because we did so together for over 50 years.What’s your favourite episode?CropolitePlaying football at [former Rotherham United stadium] Millmoor was a good one. We had fun making them all. ChuckleVision was on for 23 years, so several generations grew up with us. I can’t go down the street without somebody wanting a selfie. It takes me ages to go around the supermarket. It’s a lovely feeling and I never get fed up with it.What’s the strangest place someone’s tried to do “to me, to you”?NowtonttellyWell, never in the gents toilet, I’ll tell you that! I was in the Maldives, walking down the street because my wife wanted to go shopping, and this little guy came out of the shop and went: “To me, to you.” I said: “How do you know that?” He said: “Two years in England. It was my favourite show, I watched it all the time.”We’ve had some great comedians go on to be noted actors in theatre: Max Wall, Ken Dodd, etc. Any ambitions to do Samuel Beckett or Shakespeare?LowerColon“To me, or not to me, that is the question?” I doubt very much I would be able to learn those lines, but if it was offered, I’d have a go.View image in fullscreen‘Bring it on!’ Paul Elliott (Paul Chuckle) in Fall to the Top.What was your first reaction when you were offered the role of a ruthless London gangster in Falltothe Top?ingledoody“Bring it on!” I thought: well, that suits me down to the ground.

In terms of the face masks, we were walking to the local Co-op in Doncaster over lockdown, and outside they had two full-sized cut-outs of me and Barry, saying: “2 metre U.” I thought: “Cheeky sods, using our names and catchphrase.” Then we thought: “Hang on, there’s something to add here. Let’s do “2 metre U” masks with our picture on.” They sold very well.Who is the most famous person to tell you they love your work?TooMuchSpareTimeWe were filming theNational Treasures sketch for Red Nose Day. We were just leaving, going down the stairs, and Liam Gallagher came up two steps at a time, really quickly. My wife, Sue, said: “That’s Liam Gallagher.” I said: “Was it?” I shot back up the stairs behind him, and said: “Liam. Can I have a selfie?” He said to his girlfriend: “Get the camera out. Take a picture.” So he got a picture with me and I got a selfie with him.Who do you think is funnier on Gogglebox –your grandnephew Pete or your grandniece Sophie? I say Pete.ArthurThistlewoodI think they’re just as fun as each other. Why haven’t I been on Celebrity Gogglebox? They’ve never asked!How would you and Barry have best handled the Kraytwins if they started taking libertiesin your manor in 1963: gang war, settle it like gentlemen, or from you to them?Mr_202We’d have nailed them, then backed off slowly.Which would you have preferred? Fame and a successful TV career, or Rotherham United in the Premier League?stephenw1979That’s a tough one. I’d love to see Rotherham in the Premier League, but I think fame and success because, when you’re in the business, it’s something you crave. We were working men’s clubs, nightclubs, theatres and pantomimes, hoping one day we’d get that break, which we got after 23 years slugging around. We won Opportunity Knocks in 1967 and we won New Faces in 1974. But it wasn’t until 1984 that we got noticed. We did a tour over Easter with Roger the Dog, who had his own BBC One children’s show.I remember doing a matinee in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, with an audience of 28 people in a 1,000-seat theatre. As Dad told us: “Always give 100%, whether 1,000 people have paid £20 each or 20 have paid £20 each.” We just had a laugh and made it like a little party. What we didn’t know was that at the back of the theatre, the producer and director of Roger the Dog were watching. We got a phonecall the next day asking us to go for lunch. We ended up wearing dog costumes in Roger the Dog, which we borrowed from It’s a Knockout, and asked if we could call the characters the ChuckleHounds.At the end of the series, they did a survey around the country asking people what they thought was the best part of Roger the Dog. And 97% said the ChuckleHounds! So they gave us our own series, which went on to become ChuckleVision, and it’s all gone from there. And here we are.Fall to the Top is coming to streaming platforms later this yearExplore more on these topicsCultureFilm & Music reader interviewTV comedyComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s like what phrases ‘bird theory’ and ‘monkey branching’ meanAlaina DemopoulosThu 1 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 06.03 ESTShareThis year marked a decade since the term “ghosting” hit the mainstream. At the time, the idea that someone could abruptly cease communication with a lover without explanation seemed like the peak of indignity. How naive we were. In the 10 years since, finding a partner has only become more confounding – an oftentimes fruitless exercise in humiliation that is increasingly pigeonholed by social media jargon.Fewer one night stands, more AI lovers: the data behind generation Z’s sex livesRead moreGen Z, a cohort who came of age during a loneliness epidemic, a masculinity crisis, and a coordinated attack on the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community, faces afar messier landscapethan their millennial predecessors could ever imagine. And so their dating glossary has grown longer and more deranged, with phrases like “Shrekking” and “monkey branching” testing the limits of your sanity.What follows is a comprehensive guide to the terms gen Z is using to talk about romance, sex and the pursuit of both. To paraphrase one of the year’s most enduring memes, by the end of this glossary you’ll yearn to get back toGod’s country– because wherever that is, it doesn’t have “wokefishing”.AAuthenticity– According to gen Z, dating’s gold standard is showing up as your true, unvarnished self. Good luck with that!BBird theory– A TikTok trend loosely based on atestdeveloped by couples researchers Julie and John Gottman, in which you point out something trivial – for example, “I saw a bird today” – and note whether your partner’s response is inquisitive or dismissive. If they do not want to hear more about the bird, you two are doomed.Black cat girlfriend– Gen Z’s response to the “manic pixie dream girl” archetype of the early 2000s – but instead of having baby bangs, liking The Smiths and eschewing commitment, the black cat girlfriend prioritizes herself while oozing mystery and independence. (She might still have baby bangs.)CChair theory– This means going for someone who supports you without being asked. If you walked into a room, they would pull up a chair for you to sit down.Choremance– A date where two people bond while running errands, such as walking the dog or grocery shopping. In other words, how broke twentysomethings do affordable dating in a post-“$5 beer and shot combo” world.Crashing out– Melting down when you feel overwhelmed by life. You can crash out over a crush or breakup, spilling all of your (unrequited) feelings.DDink– Dual income no kids. Once a signifier of 80s yuppie excess, it describes couples who forgo parenthood to prioritize their own happiness. Or because they cannot afford to become parents.EEmotional vibe coding– The opposite of playing it cool: practicing communication, honesty and openness.FFlagsRed flags– Behavioral quirks indicating a potential partner is bad news. Examples include calling their exes crazy, subpar tipping habits, a love of Woody Allen films, a burgeoning DJ career …Green flags– These quirks validate your decision to pursue a mate. Examples include checking in to make sure you got home safe after a date, low screen time, owning a bed frame …Beige flags– These usually describe niche, mostly benign quirks. Examples include being an enthusiastic birdwatcher, still carrying around a pen in their purse, paying rent in cash …Freak matching– When you find someone who’s just as obsessive about documentaries about the second world war or DVD collecting or collaging or whatever it may be, as you. Or, conversely, finding someone whohatesthe same things or people that you do (nothing builds intimacy faster than sharing a nemesis).GGeese– A bandyour gen Z boyfriend likes.Ghostlighting– Someone who pops back into your life after a period of ghosting.Golden retriever boyfriend– Someone who is friendly, eager to please and loyal. The rare boyfriend who is beloved by all of his partner’s friends, and a black cat girlfriend’s foil.Gooners– A mostly online subculture of men so obsessed with masturbation that they attempt marathon sessions, purposefully delaying orgasm so they can continue as long as possible. (If you are of an unshakably stable mental state and want to know more, this Harper’s magazinefeatureis recommended reading.)HHeterofatalism– A phenomenon describing many women’s increasing pessimism toward heterosexual relationships. It will come as little surprise to anyone who read the previous entry.High-value woman– An archetype touted by manosphere figures: a woman who is sexually desirable, ever-comforting and happily domestic, who seemingly has no aspirations of her own aside from pleasing her male partner. Maybe now you’re beginning to understand the whole “heterofatalism” thing better?Golden retriever boyfriends and ick lists: gen Z’s dating rules are making them ‘constantly disappointed’Read moreIIcks– Random andoften mundane turnoffsthat immediately shut down any feelings of desire.“If he wanted to, he would”– Something to remember after you watch someone else receive an incredibly romantic gesture.JJobs– These have not been this important in the dating scene since the greed-is-good era. For some women, a “man in finance” is the ultimate catch: a fleece-vest-wearing, Republican-coded guy who will provide (there’s a hit TikToksongon the topic). Meanwhile the anti-capitalist crowdoptfor partners in fields they perceive as being staffed by the more emotionally available among us: healthcare workers, teachers or therapists.KKissing– This year, scientists learned thatkissinghas existed for 16m years. But the days of locking lips may be numbered since some gen Zwantfewer sex scenes in film, as they are having less sex themselves and do not find onscreen intimacy realistic.Kittenfishing– Catfishing-lite. Or, not exactly lying about who you are, but maybe using older (better) photos of yourself on a dating app profile, or making your job sound more important than it is. Also known as putting your best foot forward.LLoud looking– The act of being very vocal about what you want on a dating app profile, such as marriage material, hookups only, ethical non-monogamy ….MMicrocheating– It’s not cheating, but it’s notnotcheating either. Maybe you’re secretly texting someone else without your partner knowing, or meeting with an ex for coffee on the sly.Misandrist– Men have long (and erroneously) defined feminism as man-hating. Well, the young women of TikTok have taken them up on the offer: they’re increasingly identifying as misandrists, or people who hate men, on the app.Monkey branching– A subgenre of microcheating, this means having someone ready in the wings to swing on over to, making a breakup easier. A rebound you tee up before things are officially over.NNo fap– Abstaining from masturbation. This could be due to religious or political reasons, or because PornHub is nowinaccessiblein 23 US states due to age verification laws.OOrange peel theory– Another viral pop-therapy “test” to see if your partner is willing to do small things for you. Ask them to bring you an orange; if they peel it before handing it to you, it means they care. Hope they washed their hands first!Orbiting– When a partner ceases communication,à la ghosting, but stays around like a phantom by keeping tabs on your digital footprint. As in, they’ll suddenly like an Instagram post after years of no contact, retraumatizing you all over again.PPhubbing– This one sounds freakier than it actually is: ignoring your companion to stare at your phone. Do this less in 2026.Polyamory– A relationship style where people consensually date multiple people at the same time. A group of poly people who are linked is called a polycule. Typical gen Z polyamorous behavior includes talking about polyamory incessantly – especially about how elevated and mature it is – while simultaneously instigating the messiest breakups on earth.Polyphobic– Describes people, often formerly polyamorous themselves, who want nothing to do with polyamory.QQuestion deficit– Asking all the questions on a first date, but not getting any asked of you.Quiet quitting– Checking out of a relationship in hopes that your partner will be the one to officially break it off.RRelationship anarchy– An non-monogamous ethos that prioritizes autonomy in relationships, with no hierarchy between partners. Strives to undo the rigidness of heteronormative love.Roommate syndrome– When moving in with a partner ruins the magic, so you end up as nothing more than cohabiters.SShrekking–Datinga person you find less attractive in hopes that said ogre will be more loyal to you. (Spoiler: they will cheat more than you ever dreamed possible.)TThroning– Dating a cool person for clout.“Touch of the ‘tism”– A phrase used (half-seriously) by men on TikTok and dating apps to describe their ideal woman: someone they believe exhibits traits associated with being on the autistsm spectrum, such as having a special interest or a charming social awkwardness.Turbo dating– Deciding if it’s serious by the third date.UU-hauling– An old-school term, adopted by gen Z, meaning the tendency to move quickly – and moveinquickly – in lesbian relationships.Uncoupling– Breaking up. It’s just breaking up.VVirginity– Not a big deal to young folks who are deciding when (and how) to have sex on their own timelines, oftentimeslaterthan older generations.WWildflowering– Taking it slow, trying new things, allowing yourself to date without rules, sort of like a wildflower. A label to describe people who don’t like labels.Wokefishing– Coming off as more liberal or progressive-aligning on dating apps, even when you really skew conservative. (See: the countless stories ofliberal women who did not know their partnervoted for Donald Trump until a few months into the relationship.)“Written by a woman”– A male partner who acts as if they were plucked from the pages of a romance novel: sending flowers, making breakfast, being gentle and strong and loyal, and otherwise doing the types of things Emily Henry might write about. A meditation on the “female gaze” that de-centers male desire.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreXX-ing people on dating apps– Another way to say swiping left,which we did more of this year due todating app fatigue.YYap trapping– When you’re stuck on a date with someone who only talks about themselves.Yearners– People who proudly flaunt their desires, however embarrassing, and wear their hearts on their sleeves, no matter who’s watching.ZZip coding– Keeping a tight radius on your dating app location preferences – for example, New Yorkers who won’t leave a borough for a lover, or suburbanites who refuse to travel into the city on a dateExplore more on these topicsDatingThe sex lives of gen ZSexRelationshipsOnline datingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the autumn, she also found time to take on Reform UK when it tried to win theCaerphilly byelection.Bond, a Ukrainian refugee who has settled in southWales, said she could not remain silent as Reform tried to win the seat in the Senedd (Welsh parliament ).“Members of our Ukrainian community spoke up,” Bond said. “We challenged the disinformation because we didn’t want our neighbours to be misled into resenting us. I didn’t want people to turn against us because of lies. So I spoke up and others did, too.Reform swaggered into Caerphilly, ready for a coronation. An unpleasant surprise lay in store | Will HaywardRead more“Reform UK tried to create panic and hate with tactics used not only in the UK, but by far-right political parties all over Europe and across the world. The messages they used in Caerphilly didn’t feel local. They felt imported – like someone copied a script from another country and dropped it through our doors.”Nigel Farage’s party was confident it could win the byelection,especially as Labour, the dominant party in Wales for a century, appears to be in freefall. An energetic campaign by the Welsh nationalists, Plaid Cymru – and people like Bond – kept out the rightwing party.“Their biggest mistake was assuming that people here have no critical thinking,” Bond said. “They thought nobody would check the facts. They assumed that refugees are not just vulnerable, but somehow stupid. That is not true. We may have escaped a war, but we are not stupid. We understand policies.”View image in fullscreenUkrainian refugee Yuliia Bond says Reform’s messages ‘didn’t feel local – like someone copied a script from another country and dropped it through our doors’.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesOne of Reform’s key claims was that the Welsh government’s nation of sanctuary scheme showed both it and Plaid supported a “mass immigration agenda” and “asylum seekers” were receiving “preferential treatment”.The claim did not hold water– more than 80% of the nation of sanctuary money has been spent on supporting Ukrainian refugees.Bond said: “When I read the leaflets, all I could see was a clear attempt to divide people, to scapegoat a small group, and increase hate in a place that had been welcoming to us.“It didn’t work in Caerphilly because the Ukrainian community and refugees from different backgrounds are not outsiders. We are part of the community. People know us.“They see us at school gates, in shops, at work, volunteering. They know what we contribute. The picture in the leaflet simply didn’t match reality. Most residents could sense that something wasn’t right. It felt like manipulation, not truth.”Caerphilly byelection could signal ‘fundamental realignment’ of Welsh politicsRead moreBond spoke to the Guardian in the “gratitude orchard” in Caerphilly, planted by members of the Ukrainian community in the town as a thank-you for the warm welcome they have received.She said the arrival of Reform had put pressure on Ukrainian people in the area. “Vulnerable people should not have to carry this burden. Yet, during the election, we had to raise our voices first. Only later did support come – from local residents, politicians from different parties, and local media.”There are full Senedd elections in May whenReform has hopes of becoming the largest party in Wales.Bond said people campaigning against Reform in Wales in May and in other elections across the UK had to challenge the party’s messages swiftly and with conviction.“As a Ukrainian, I know how dangerous disinformation can be. The war inUkrainedid not start with weapons. It started with disinformation, propaganda and lies that prepared the ground for violence.“Disinformation must be challenged early, strongly and clearly, because hate spreads faster than facts. The two months of that byelection were truly exhausting. We just had to survive it. But we survived together, and that is why the hate campaign failed in Caerphilly.”View image in fullscreenLindsay Whittle, the successful Plaid candidate: ‘People in Caerphilly have friends of different nationalities and they don’t like people threatening their friends.’Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesForLindsay Whittle,the successful Plaid candidate, the aftermath of the byelection was a whirlwind. When he popped into the pub,people wanted selfies; at a Wales rugby match, he was applauded into his seat. “There have been points when I’ve been fighting back the tears, because it’s been so emotional,” he said.Whittle said both Reform campaigners and their opponents had believed the party might sweep all before them. He said: “The thought was that they’d spend obscene amounts of money and beat us.”View image in fullscreenJudith Pritchard, a Plaid Cymru county councillor, says Plaid won because of its policies.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesSo how did they halt the juggernaut? One reason, Whittle believes, is that Plaid ran an upbeat, positive campaign. “Don’t attack anyone personally because people don’t like that. Keep the message positive. Try and unite people. I think Michelle Obama had the best phrase: ‘When they go low, we go high.’“People in Caerphilly have friends of different nationalities and they don’t like people threatening their friends. Voters recognise that without certain people coming to this country, you’re not going to have an NHS or social care. I think Reform misjudged the people of Caerphilly.”While Whittle made the front pages and news bulletins, an intense grassroots campaign was under way in the background. People likeJudith Pritchard, a Plaid councillorwho acted as “captain” for the St Cattwg ward, knocked on thousands of doors.“We think it was the most important byelection we’ve ever fought,” she said. Pritchard said Plaid won because it had good policies – and people who believe in them passionately.“Many Plaid members really believe in independence for Wales and believe it is a fight for survival of the Welsh language, Wales as a community of communities and Welsh values. It was a hard slog but in the end I think it came down to conviction versus cash.”View image in fullscreenRichard Gurner, the editor of the Caerphilly Observer, says the byelection campaign was divisive.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesRichard Gurner, the editor of theCaerphilly Observer, was taken aback at how divisive the campaign was. “We had communities turning on each other, Reform posters torn down, really sharp debates online. I grew up in this area and I know everyone’s lovely so to see that side come out was a surprise.”Gurner believes the turning point was aBBC debatewhen an audience member challenged the Reform candidate, Llŷr Powell, and told him people like her, who had someone not born in the UK in their family, did not feel welcome in the area since Reform had arrived.“That was someone from our community who had a mixed race family explicitly stating the impact all this rhetoric had,” Gurner said. “Caerphilly isn’t the most multicultural of places but we’ve always welcomed people from overseas. That was the line in the sand.”View image in fullscreenPolitics lecturer Jac Larner says assumptions about Caerphilly during the byelection were ‘quite uninformed or, at times, condescending’.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesAs alecturer in politics at Cardiff Universityand a native of the village of Senghenydd in Caerphilly, Jac Larner has a unique perspective on the byelection.He said Plaid was extremely successful in presenting the election as a straight two-horse race between them and Reform – but this will be harder at the Senedd elections in May when a new proportional system comes in.Larner said seeing Caerphilly get so much attention was often uncomfortable and emotional. “It tended to be quite uninformed or, at times, condescending. But Caerphilly isn’t some post-industrial wasteland passively absorbing whatever political winds blow from across the border – it has its own political traditions and, like Wales more broadly, it has its own dynamics and can’t simply be read through the lens of what is happening in England. It was gratifying to see my home town confound those lazy assumptions.”Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsWalesPlaid CymruLabourReform UKUkraineImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether you agree with him over this or that utterance or the broad sweep of government policy, he has, unquestionably made his contribution to Tottenham, in north London, whose people he has represented for a quarter of a century, to parliament, as a senior MP, as foreign secretary and now as an important figure with several key portfolios.So when a lieutenant of Nigel Farage, admittedly no fan of Lammy’s,suggests, without notable contradictionor condemnation from Reform, that Lammy “should go home to the Caribbean”, one is tempted to look at that askance. But then, in the year just past, when bigotry in frontline politics took off its training wheels and othering became the sport that everyone can play, the notion that someone who clearly belongs here should not belong here ceased to shock.Bad stuff happened in 2025. The big stuff you know: the violent, toxically nativist besieging of asylum seeker hotels and the condoning of it by rightwing politicians and media outlets. The deployment up and down the country by hard-right activists of the British and St George’s flag, as a symbol,not of collective adhesion (as it surely can be) but of intimidation. Thevery public claimsthat Farage, a man with pretensions to lead our country, hurt people as a racist school bully and refuses to atone or suitably acknowledge their hurt now that he is a dog-whistling adult.But I’m also thinking of less high-profile stuff. Like the friend who went for a weekend out of London into summery, leafy Middle England and, while waiting at a road junction, was assailed as a “black bitch” by a car passenger waiting at the lights, seeking to prove to an even younger passenger – perhaps his own son – that he wasn’t constrained by the strictures of woke.Like the student who, along with his father, entered a pub in the West Country – to sample the local colour, watch a bit of football – and was advised to leave because it wasn’t a good or safe place for “Pakis”. Like the health worker friend whose job entails driving into towns and villages, who continued to do so amid the summer explosion of union flags but who said that as a black man entering those places, he felt, for the first time, the need to watch his back. All were acting as if they belong, with infinite justification. All were given reason to doubt. Diehard populists and racists want that kind of Britain and they’ve had a good year. According toa new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the number of people absorbing and mirroring hard right narratives is rising. Time to take stock: divided, resentful, hostile to all but a default culture – is that the sort of country the rest of us want?Against this backdrop, and at a time when a small but growing minority says you have to be white to be British, I have been thinking about minority belonging and attachment. I was born here, schooled here, have worked and paid taxes here, have served communities: but as the son of Windrush parents, how solid is my footing here? My late parents arrived in the 1950s and thought their status was secure. Then came the 1971 Immigration Act, which ripped up the rights they had as Commonwealth citizens and necessitated that they scramble to find the money to solidify their status under the government’s new arrangements. As a child I overheard the strained discussions about where the money was going to come from. The sound of shock and uncertainty.We are settled, but never quite cosy. How can we be? Using theNationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the home secretary can pull the rug out from under a British citizen, without notification, if doing so meets their particular criteria of the public good. Earlier this year,research by the Runnymede Trustsuggested that 9 million people – mainly those with dual nationalities – are vulnerable to losing the citizenship they thought was theirs, with minority citizens 12 times more vulnerable than white. This is us: you belong until, maybe, one day, you don’t.Go home, Farage’s man said, and with that he echoed the exhortation of choice from nativist crowds outside asylum seeker hotels this summer. In the 50s and 60s, my parents’ generation of Windrush-era migrants used to hear that a lot too. But then, as now, it was a nonsense. Home to where? Where you have lived the longest? To your last port of call? To wherever will have you? We don’t know. That’s why politicians sought to shuttle folkoff to Rwandain the hope they would sort out the home/belonging conundrum themselves.Where am I from? Where’s home if not here? Well certainly there is a quiet, leafy bit of Jamaica that my parents left in the 50s and returned to almost 40 years later. But this year, having paid the fee and explored my DNA, I’ve found there is a viable case that home could be a lot of places. Via Mum, according to the Ancestry results, there are traces from Benin and Togo, with a good bit of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, a smidgen of Nigeria, a little bit of Mali and a sliver of north-east Scotland. There’s even a drop of Iceland. Go figure.From Dad, a bit of Benin and Togo, a bit more from Côte d’Ivoire, but most notably Nigeria. I am unsurprised. A Nigerian friend once glanced at a picture of my father and said, never mind Jamaica, “He’s from Nigeria: no question”. But here, again a mix: a chunk of Devon and Somerset, a little bit of Cameroon and Mali. Some Senegal, some Panama and Costa Rica. And then a trace of the Netherlands. Well, I do enjoy trips to Rotterdam.I find all this energising, and certainly it challenges the idea that we are identity parcels labelled from one destination, ready to be returned to sender.I am not a citizen of nowhere, as demonised by the populists, but through history, politics, cruelty and happenstance, a creature from almost everywhere. My guess is that many of you are the same – and that David Lammy is similar, too.That’s the truth of it, and a conversation about home and belonging that starts from there would undoubtedly be more positive. Let’s have it.Hugh Muir is executive editor, OpinionDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two women told the French broadcaster BFMTV a bartender carried a female member of staff who was holding one of the bottles.Satellite photo of locationThe flames set fire to the ceiling. Within seconds the blaze had spread, engulfing a crowded basement packed with revellers. Many were teenagers. One of the women described a crowd surge as people desperately tried to escape up a narrow flight of stairs.‘It happened in seconds’: sudden inferno brings horror to Swiss ski resortRead moreHundreds gathered in silence in the freezing cold on Thursday evening, laying flowers and lighting candles.

Other footage showed grim scenes of orange flames billowing from a ground-floor lounge and several people lying motionless on the street.The canton prosecutor for Valais, Beatrice Pilloud, said she could not comment on reports that lighted candles had caused the inferno. “An investigation is taking place. It will identify the exact circumstances of what happened,” she said, confirming that the basement steps were very narrow. She said it was too early to draw any conclusions about emergency exits.1:19'I'm very worried': residents wait as victim identification under way in Switzerland – videoFrédéric Gisler, the canton’s police commander, said his officers arrived at the scene at 1.32am, two minutes after receiving an emergency call. He described the situation as “unprecedented”. A red alert was issued, with multiple firefighting teams, 42 ambulances and 13 helicopters sent to the area.“Their first mission was to provide care to the victims … and direct them to the various hospitals. The firefighters at the same time secured the site,” he said.The injured were dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich. Parmelin – speaking in his first day in the job as Switzerland’s new head of state – said some of those who survived were “severely injured”. They had suffered serious burns, as well as damage to their lungs.

They were now being treated in critical and specialised care units. “This will be a long and intensive process, lasting several weeks, perhaps even months,” she said.Investigators now have the grisly task of identifying the victims and taking DNA samples from their families. Some of those caught up in the fire were visiting the ski resort from neighbouring countries. Italy’s foreign ministry said 16 of its nationals were missing and 12 were among the injured. France said eight of its citizens were missing and it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.2:50Video dispatch: Crans-Montana mourns nightclub victimsCrans-Montana is a bustling resort town of about 10,000 people perched high in the Valais canton of the Swiss Alps, with a view across the valley to the famed Matterhorn mountain. Unlike nearby Verbier, which attracts a wealthy anglophone crowd, Crans-Montana is popular mainly with wealthy Europeans.But Le Constellation itself was more of a cheap and cheerful bar for younger people and tourists.View image in fullscreenThe fire inside Le Constellation, Crans-Montana.Photograph: XBrozzo, the ski instructor, said the venue was set over two floors, with a bar on the main floor and narrow stairs leading to a basement nightclub below, where he speculated it would have been possible for people to have become trapped and incapacitated from smoke inhalation.He said shisha pipes were available to smoke. “What people are saying is that the charcoal on the shisha could have spilled and caused the fire,” Brozzo said.Swiss officials called the blaze aembrasement généralisé. The French firefighting term describes how a fire can trigger the release of combustible gases. These then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would term a flashover or a backdraft.map of SwitzerlandSpeaking on Thursday morning, Mathias Reynard, the president of the Valais canton, said what should have been a moment of celebration “turned into a nightmare”. He said he was devastated by the tragedy. “I can’t hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,” he told a press conference.Le Constellation opened in 2015 and could accommodate up to 300 people inside, with another 40 on a heated terrace, French media reported. The bar’s Facebook and Instagram pages appear to have been deleted and are unavailable.The owner of the Dédé clothing store, directly across the street from Le Constellation, said the venue was a popular destination for younger people – including the children of her friends, who would often drink there from as young as 14 years old.View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside Le Constellation bar on Thursday evening.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersFrançois, 17, a ski instructor who said he had often partied at the bar, said new year parties were known as being more lax in terms of checking the age of bar entrants.The town relies heavily on a largely European clientele who come to ski, eat in several Michelin-starred restaurants and shop at Moncler and Louis Vuitton stores. It has about 3,000 hotel rooms and 10,000 residents.In a region busy with tourists skiing on the slopes, the authorities have called on people to show caution in the coming days. They urged them to avoid any accidents that could require medical resources that are already overwhelmed.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The victims are believed to come from several countries. The Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, said many of them were young people with “projects, hopes and dreams”.Investigators said there was no indication of terrorism or arson. Many of the victims could not be identified immediately because of the severity of their burns.Work is under way to name the victims and inform their families but “that will take time and for the time being it is premature to give you a more precise figure”, the Valais canton police commander, Frédéric Gisler, said.“We are devastated,” he told a news conference after one of the worst tragedies in recent Swiss history.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

Local media described a “smell of burning still in the air”.A tourist from New York filmed bright orange flames leaping from the bar, and told Agence France-Presse he had seen people running and screaming in the dark.A witness speaking to the French broadcaster BFMTV described people breaking windows to escape the blaze, some badly injured, and panicked parents rushing to the scene in cars to see whether their children were trapped inside.The young man said he had seen about 20 people scrambling to get out and likened the scene to a “horror movie” as it unfolded across the street.The head of the regional government, Mathias Reynard, said: “This evening should have been a moment of celebration and coming together, but it turned into a nightmare.”Map showing location of Crans-Montana in SwitzerlandHow many people were hurt?The police have said about 40 people are believed to have died and about 115 were injured in the blaze. Many of the victims were in their teens and 20s, officials said.Witnesses described a crowd surge as people frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a small doorway. Investigators said they would work to determine whether fire safety protocols had been maintained. Le Constellation had a maximum capacity of about 300 people.The hospitals in Valais canton were full and had declared a state of emergency, with the injured being transported to various hospitals across Switzerland. Some patients may need to be sent to clinics in neighbouring countries, officials said.Helicopters and ambulances were sent to the scene to assist victims who were from several countries, officials said. The intensive care unit and operating room at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, Reynard said.Location mapSixteen Italians have been reported missing, while about a dozen more Italian nationals are being treated in hospital after the blaze, the Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said.France said on Thursday evening that eight of its citizens were missing and it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.There are 60 people being treated at a hospital in Sion. Lausanne university hospital, which was treating the most severely injured among the victims, said the 22 patients in its care were aged between 16 and 26.Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris, survived the blaze by using a table to push a plexiglass window out of its casing, allowing him to escape the “total chaos” inside the bar where he said he felt as if he was suffocating.One of his friends died and “two or three were missing”, he told the Associated Press.He said he had not seen the fire start, but did see waitresses arrive with champagne bottles containing sparklers.Unverified video showed several sparklers burning in bottles as the waitstaff entered the room.1:19'I'm very worried': residents wait as victim identification under way in Switzerland – videoWhat caused it?Investigators said it was too early to determine the cause of the fire as experts had not been able to go inside the building. However, officials said there was no sign of terrorism or arson.“At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,” said Beatrice Pilloud, the public prosecutor of the Valais canton.Officials called the blaze that raged through the crowded bar an “embrasement généralisé”, a firefighting term describing how a fire can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.The municipality of 10,000 residents had banned New Year’s Eve fireworks owing to a lack of rainfall in the past month, according to its website.Two women later told BFMTV they had been inside when they saw a barman carrying a female server on his shoulders. She was holding a lit candle in a bottle that set fire to the wooden ceiling.

Dawn was far off and the teenagers and twenty-somethings were in no hurry to leave the bar. It was, after all, New Year’s Day.Outside, darkness draped Crans-Montana, a ski resort in the Swiss Alps with a reputation for posh luxury. Le Constellation, however, had few pretensions: a cavernous venue with TV screens on the top floor to watch sport, and a basement with low lighting, loud music and a dancefloor.It attracted a young crowd, including under-18s, mainly fromSwitzerlandand continental Europe, and early on Thursday morning hundreds thronged the venue to see in 2026. Many would not live to see the sunrise.Investigators are still investigating the cause ofthe horrorthat began at 1.30am.Two witnesses said a bartender carried a female member of staff on his shoulders who was holding a champagne bottle that contained a lit sparkler, or flare, near the wooden ceiling above the bar area.

Video posted on social media, also unverified, showed people, silhouetted by fire, hastening through the venue while music continued to play. Some patrons used sweaters to try to extinguish flames, a witness said.Le Constellation bar fire in Switzerland: what we know so farRead moreThe blaze turned into what Swiss officials called anembrasement généralisé, a term for a fire that releases combustible gases that can ignite violently, triggering what English-speaking firefighters call a flashover or backdraft.Le Constellation became an inferno.“The whole ceiling was in flames and the fire spread really fast. It happened in seconds,” two survivors, identified as Emma and Albane, later told the French network BFMTV.Satellite photo of locationThe conflagration was so sudden that some thought it was an explosion. Screams and cries filled the basement as people tried to escape. Many surged towards a door leading to a narrow flight of stairs. Others smashed windows that turned black and opaque.Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris, felt as if he was suffocating. He used a table to push a plexiglass pane out of its casing, allowing him to flee the “total chaos”, he told Associated Press.From the street, people rushed to help. “I thought that my little brother was inside so I came and I tried to break the window to help people to exit,” one man told the BBC. He saw people “burning from head to foot, no clothes any more”.View image in fullscreenRescue workers and firefighters near the scene of the fire in the early hours of Thursday.Photograph: Police Cantonale Valaisanne/APSome witnesses likened the scene to a horror film. Dominic Dubois described an appalling spectacle as flames engulfed the venue. “You could see the orange, the orange, yellow, red,” he told Reuters.Police reached the scene at 1.32am, two minutes after reports of smoke.Bystanders and first responders worked together to pull people from oven-like temperatures into the cold outside, Dubois said. “One of the priorities was to get everyone warm ... the curtains of the restaurant were used.”A UBS bank branch opened to offer refuge, he said. “All the tables were pushed aside and people entered and it was warm in there, there was more light as well, so the triage was down there.”1:19'I'm very worried': residents wait as victim identification under way in Switzerland – videoAll through the night convoys of fire engines, police vehicles and about 40 ambulances raced to Crans-Montana, a picturesque area of snowy peaks and pine forests transformed into what may be one of the worst disasters in Switzerland’s recent history. About 10 helicopters joined the response.As news spread, parents and other relatives of those who had been inside the bar made their way to the scene.“There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,” Samuel Rapp, 21, a local resident, told Reuters. “They had jackets over their faces.” Rapp said he had seen videos showing revellers trampling each other to escape. “People were shouting, ‘help me, please help us’.”Dozens of the injured, many in serious condition, swiftly filled hospitals in the Valais canton. More than a dozen were taken to Zurich university hospital, 150 miles to the north. A hospital in Lausanne that treated 22 patients said ages ranged from 16 to 26. Hospitals in neighbouring countries are expected to treat some victims.About 40 people died and 115 were injured, the Valais canton police commander, Frédéric Gisler, told a news conference, adding that the community was devastated. There was no detail given about the ages or nationalities of the dead.By 1pm bright sunshine lit up incongruous scenes in the centre of Crans-Montana: fake reindeer and Christmas decorations amid emergency vehicles, posters for new year parties amid huddles of hushed bystanders.Switzerland’s president, Guy Parmelin, visited the scene, where forensic teams worked behind white screens. Families were still awaiting news of loved ones, he said. “Some don’t yet know if their children have died.”Location mapSwitzerland will fly flags at half-mast for five days, Parmelin said. “What was meant to be a moment of joy has turned the first day of the year in Crans-Montana into a day of mourning affecting the entire country and beyond.” Many of the dead were young people with “projects, hopes and dreams”, he said.Valais canton’s attorney general, Beatrice Pilloud, rejected arson or terrorism as probable causes of the fire. “At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,” she told reporters. Asked about emergency exits in the bar, she said it was too early to draw conclusions. There had been no arrests and there were no suspects, she said.View image in fullscreenPeople leave flowers outside the bar on Thursday.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersAs darkness fell across Crans-Montana on Thursday evening, blotting out its view of the Matterhorn mountain, shock and disbelief hovered over the town.Le Constellation was an institution, a bar that served mainly locals, not tourists. Unlike many other bars and clubs, it often had no cover charge and so attracted young people.Dozens of local teenagers, some in tears, gathered by the police cordon and laid flowers. The impromptu vigil drew Milica Lazic, who said she had heard no news about a friend who worked at the bar.Tourists continued to shop, ski and eat at restaurants. “I don’t think it means they don’t care, but they don’t know anyone involved,” said Ernesto Perila, 56, a cafe owner. “Life goes on, the world continues. I don’t think badly of anyone for that.”In the chill air, forensic teams, cloaked by the screens, continued their work.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not nearly enoughRowena MasonWhitehall editorThu 1 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.58 ESTShareKeir Starmer does not have enough of a plan to defeat the “existential threat” that populism poses to UK democracy and should undertake a “fundamental reset”, New Labour’s former advertising strategist Sir Chris Powell has warned.Powell, who is the brother of Jonathan Powell, Starmer’s national security adviser, warned there were just three years to stop the “new and terrifying threat” of populists, suggestingReform UKcould represent a danger to democracy and national institutions.Writing for the Guardian, he said: “Here in the UK, where is the urgently needed counter plan on a huge scale, to thwart and head off such an existential threat? It is simply not in place, nor does it appear to be even at the planning stage.“We are at a very dangerous moment. We simply cannot afford to allow Reform UK to have a free run, and become established and entrenched as a credible potential government in the minds of disenchanted voters.“The longer they go unchallenged, the more unthreatening and risk-free they will seem to voters. Just hoping that Reform UK and [Nigel] Farage implode, or that the rightwing vote will somehow fracture, is potentially suicidal for our freedom and democracy.”His intervention comes as Starmer faces deep unhappiness within his own party about Labour’s poor poll ratings andhis own personal unpopularity, while Reform has led in opinion surveys for almost a year.The prime minister will attempt a new year push on reducing the cost of living through cuts to energy bills, interest rates and ending the two-child cap, saying that voters would start to see their lives improve in 2026.With Farage and Reform dominant on social media, No 10 also has plans to overhaul its communications strategy to reach more voters in new ways, such as through influencers and viral videos on channels including TikTok.ALabourparty source said the government was “tackling the problems that populists exploit, in particular the cost of living”, adding: “The prime minister has many times called out the politics of division peddled by Reform and will continue to work with grassroots activists and others to win this fight.”Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time to turn Britain around | Larry ElliottRead moreHowever, Powell, who ran the ad agency that worked on Labour’s 1997 victory, said the social media engagement had so far been “small scale” and argued the “narrative surrounding this government has more often been about its own failings and internal conflicts than the battle it faces against a populist surge”.As part of his Winning Against Populists project with David Cowan, the founder of a data and consumer research consultancy, Powell said Starmer’s party needed to “wage and win the daily war for attention” with a goal of making sure their voice was heard when voters scrolled.He also said Starmer needed to interact better with voters on the issues they care about and highlighted how – in the US – a Democratic governor had won in a Republican state by “relentlessly speaking out in plain language on bread and butter issues: jobs, roads, schools, prices”.Recalling Tony Blair and his team meeting at his home for their first election planning meeting in 1995, Powell said what was needed for Starmer and Labour was a similarly “new strategy, new branding, new policy, new presentation, new organisation … this kind of no-holds-barred thinking is needed. A fundamental reset.”Powell said the current situation in the UK was a “textbook case of an establishment party caught in the headlights, as its populist opponent expertly fills the vacuum of voter pain and disrespect”.“Relying on containment or a rational ‘hold-your-nose’ vote is a strategy that will eventually fail. Labour needs a comprehensive action plan, now. Time is a luxury they can’t afford,” he said.Some within Downing Street are convinced that when voters come to a choice between Starmer and Farage, those who have progressive leanings will vote to keep out Reform – even if their sympathies lie with other parties on the centre or left. However, many Labour MPs are deeply worried that this is a complacent strategy that risks underestimating Farage and Reform.This year’s elections in Wales and Scotland, as well as locals in England, will be a test of how far Reform’s dominance in the opinion polls will translate into seats, with Starmer’s position potentially under threat if Labour suffers heavy losses.The Guardian reported on Wednesday that Starmer would reinforce his message with a series of new year drinks receptions for Labour MPs at Chequers in an attempt to dispel angst about local and devolved elections in 2026, at which the party is expecting heavy losses.In a barb aimed at Reform in his new year’s message, the prime minister said: “We are getting Britain back on track. By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerReform UKThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

We have a more unhealthy childhood population, and hypertension puts them at greater risk of events like kidney disease, stroke and heart attack earlier in their adult lives,” he added.Nearly a third of British adults and half in the US have hypertension. Prevalence rises steeply with age as blood vessels naturally thicken and stiffen, and most people over 65 have the condition. Beyond age and genetics, poor diet, especially one high in salt, physical inactivity, being overweight or obese, drinking too much alcohol and smoking all contribute.In young children, high blood pressure is mainly caused by other medical issues such as heart defects, kidney disease, genetic disorders or hormonal problems. But increasingly, doctors are seeing cases linked to excess weight, poor nutrition and lack of exercise.High blood pressure can steadily damage the body for years before people experience symptoms. The excess pressure can cause aneurysms, or bulges, in weak arteries, which can be fatal if they burst. The strain on the heart can lead to heart failure.Dr Emily Haseler, who studies childhood hypertension at King’s College London, said the rise in cases was on course to become a further burden on the NHS and damage UK productivity as more people of working age suffered the impacts of high blood pressure.Monitoring could be folded into the national child measurement programme, which records height and weight at the end of primary school, or run through a new NHS health check in adolescence, she said. That would allow doctors to diagnose hypertension early so it could be treated, and would show how prevalent the condition was.Alternative approaches could involve targeted blood pressure screening for children known to be at high risk, such as those with a family history, who were born prematurely, or who are overweight.“We must start monitoring this so we can understand the scale of the problem and start thinking about what to do,” said Prof Igor Rudan, a co-head of the Centre for GlobalHealthat the University of Edinburgh. “We need to know whether these kids are going to become adults who get heart attacks and strokes aged thirtysomething.”Hypertension is the leading cause of premature death in the UK. It is rarely picked up before people reach their 40s or 50s, but trends are changing. Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of theStrokeAssociation, said there had already been an “alarming surge” in strokes among people of working age.“The digital age has brought about changes in how children spend their time that we haven’t seen in the history of humanity,” Rudan said. “Traditionally, kids were playing with each other outside as much as possible, but now parents just give them a screen. That’s a complete shift in children’s lifestyles.“The combination of inactivity due to digital devices and poorer nutrition means we see plenty of obese children and they are getting hypertension at eight times the rate of other children,” he said.But children may be easier to help than older people. “In kids, you have so much more opportunity to get them back on track,” Rudan said.Research from Canada shows that childhood and adolescent hypertension increased from1.3% in the 1990s to 6% in the 2010s. Twice as many have pre-hypertension or elevated blood pressure. The effect on health is stark: a study of more than 25,000 hypertensive teenagers found that over a 14-year follow-up period, their risk of kidney disease or failure wasthree times higherthan in teenagers with healthy blood pressure.Prof Ian Wilkinson, an honorary consultant physician at the University of Cambridge and president of the British and Irish Hypertension Society, said tackling high blood pressure earlier could give people many more years of healthy life. “What we’re currently doing is waiting for people to get to 40 or 50, waiting for their blood pressure to rise, and then treating them,” he said. “We are ignoring younger people.”He favours blood pressure monitoring in secondary school and wants marketing professionals to create positive public health messages to reduce people’s salt intake and obesity.“We are measuring height and weight, and giving vaccinations against various diseases, so why aren’t we addressing hypertension?” he said. “A third of adults in the UK have hypertension, and a substantial proportion of that is probably fuelled by obesity. It’s a national health emergency.”Bouverie said it was concerning that more children and adolescents had high blood pressure as it was the cause of about half of all strokes. “Childhood is an opportunity to teach and establish healthy living patterns, such as getting regular exercise and eating a balanced diet,” she said. “This all helps to reduce the risk of stroke both now and in the future. Without these healthy habits, the body can store up problems for later in life and increase the chances of a person of any age having a stroke.”Explore more on these topicsHigh blood pressureYoung peopleChildrenHealth policyStrokeHeart attackHeart diseasenewsShareReuse this content"

The total for the year ended up being 13% higher than the figure for 2024.Keir Starmer had fought the election in 2024 promising to “smash the gangs” and last year negotiated a “one-in, one-out” returns deal with France to act as a disincentive.A Home Office spokesperson said the number of small boat crossings was “shameful and the British people deserve better”.But they added: “This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.“The home secretary has announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in decades, removing the incentives that bring illegal migrants to the UK and scaling up the return of those with no right to be here.”However, Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said Starmer’s plans had been “a complete disaster” and a “farce”. He also claimed that “many of the young men that have arrived last year will do us great harm”.The Conservatives have claimed that foreign nationals arriving by small boat are more likely to go to prison, butFull Fact found in July thatthe University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory has said there is no reliable publicly available data about crimes committed by foreign arrivals by small boat.Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that pulling out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) was the only way to reduce the number of small boat crossings.He said: “Labour have confined themselves to cosmetic tweaks, hence only 5% of arrivals have been removed. There is no deterrent and anyone who crosses the Channel knows they can invoke human rights law and remain indefinitely. Labour lack the backbone to confront that truth.”The government is counting on greater powers for law enforcement to tackle people-smuggling gangs under the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act , which became law in December. The act introduces new criminal offences and allows law enforcement agencies to use counterterror-style powers to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, also announced plans in November for “the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times”, in an effort to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.Under changes inspired by the Danish system, refugee status will become temporary with regular reviews every 30 months, and refugees will be forced to wait 20 years for permanent settlement in the UK, up from five years currently.Reacting to the Channel crossings for 2025, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Most men, women and children taking these journeys have fled oppressive regimes like the Taliban in Afghanistan and brutal civil wars in countries like Sudan.“No one risks their life on a flimsy boat in the Channel except out of desperation to be safe in a country where they have family or community connections.“It’s right the government wants to stop Channel crossings, but plans that will punish people found to be refugees are unfair and not an effective deterrent.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesHome OfficeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He said one of the drones was carrying an incendiary mixture that sparked a blaze.On Thursday evening a Ukrainian military spokesperson told the Interfax Ukraine news agency that Kyiv’s forces exclusively targeted Russian military or energy sites.The general staff spokesperson did not refer specifically to Russian accounts of a strike on a hotel, but said all strikes by the Ukrainian military were published on a general staff social media page.“The Defence Forces of Ukraine adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law and strike exclusively at enemy military targets, fuel and energy facilities of the Russian Federation, and other legitimate targets,” Interfax quoted the spokesperson as saying.A number of Russian officials condemned the attack. The chair of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, said it strengthened Russia’s resolve to quickly achieve its goals in its almost four-year invasion of Ukraine.The strike “once again demonstrates the validity of our initial demands”, Matviyenko said.The statement follows claims from Moscow that Ukraine had launched a long-range drone attack against one of Vladimir Putin’s official residences in north-western Russia on Tuesday. Kyiv said the claims were a lie.Did Ukraine target Putin’s residence or is Russian claim a ploy to sway Trump?Read moreRussia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its specialists had accessed the navigation system in one of the drones it claimed was used in the attack, and that data extracted confirmed that Putin’s residence was the target.The ministry did not share evidence of its findings, but officials said it would transfer the data to US officials “through established channels”.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the CIA had determined thatno attempted attack had taken place. Donald Trump had initially said he was “very angry” about the purported attack, but he later posted a link on social media to a New York Post editorial describing the Russian claims as “bluster”.Russia’s defence ministry also released a video of a downed drone it said was involved in the attack.The night-time clip shows a man in camouflage gear, a helmet and a Kevlar vest standing near a damaged drone lying in snow. The man, his face covered, talks about the drone. Neither the man nor the defence ministry provided any location or date, and neither the video nor its claims could be independently verified.Kyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have gathered pace in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in his new year address that apeace deal was “90% ready”but that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live”.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on Wednesday that he, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process”.“We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of [the] peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart,” he wrote on X.Ukraine’s lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, reaffirmed that European and Ukrainian officials planned to meet on Saturday, and Zelenskyy is expected to hold talks with European leaders next week.With additional reporting by the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Again.Crowds of revellers gathered in the city’s Centenary Square, hoping to catch a glimpse of a pyrotechnics display to welcome in 2026.They were left disappointed, however, after they discovered no display would be taking place and that they had fallen victim to false news spread online.Asimilar incident happened last year, when thousands of people gathered in the city centre after claims online promised a spectacular display with food vendors and performances.One online advertisement this year claimed there would be a dazzling fireworks show where attenders could “expect a lively atmosphere featuring music alongside the brilliant show as the city welcomes the new year”.West Midlands police had said on Tuesday that there were “no official firework displays or city-organised events happening in Birmingham city centre on New Year’s Eve” and blamed the spread of rumours online every year about “big celebrations in the city”.“Unfortunately, these false claims often lead to confusion and disappointment,” the force said in a statement.Despite the warnings, footage shared on social media showed a large group of people gathered in front of the ferris wheel at Centenary Square, a focal point in the city, on Wednesday evening. The video’s caption read: “When you queue for fireworks and the sky stays silent.”It is not just people in Birmingham who have fallen victim to such hoaxes.Tourists were dismayed last month when they visited Buckingham Palaceafter an AI-generated image had circulated on social media showing a picturesque scene of a Christmas market. Visitors arrived to find it was fake.West Midlands police said misinformation incidents such as the one on New Year’s Eve could create “real safety issues in the city”, and that when “large crowds gather for an event that doesn’t exist, it puts pressure on public transport, emergency services, and can lead to congestion in the city centre”.1:52New Year's Eve: from Sydney to London, how the world ushered in 2026 – videoElsewhere across the UK, millions of people gathered at events and parties to welcome in 2026. London staged its biggest pyrotechnic display to date, with about 12,000 fireworks set off in front of a crowd of 100,000 people watching on the banks of the Thames.In Scotland, tens of thousands of revellers attending the Hogmanay street party enjoyed a display that lit up Edinburgh Castle.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamNew yearWest MidlandsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, she said, body parts might have been removed as part of a funerary ritual, perhaps to be carried as tokens.Dr Jessica Thompson, a senior author of the study from Yale University, said that, while such practices may not seem relatable, people still keep locks of hair or relatives’ ashes for scattering in a meaningful place.The researchers said the rock shelter appears to have been used as a natural monument, with burials occurring from about 16,000 to 8,000 years ago. As well as complete skeletons, very small collections of bones from different individuals have been found.“[This] supports our hypothesis that some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere,” said Dr Ebeth Sawchuk, a co-author of the study from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.The team also found flakes and points from stone-knapping within the pyre, which might have been added as part of a funeral ritual.“Were people actively throwing these things into the fire or … were they in the body itself?” said Thompson. Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh.The team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation.While it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance.However, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life.View image in fullscreenSharp points of grey flint and rock from stone-knapping found in the pyre.Photograph: Justin PargeterWriting inthe journal Science Advances, the team note the oldest known pyre containing human remains was previously found in Alaska, and dates to about 11,500 years ago – however, that was for a young child.Indeed, most burned human remains dating back 8,000 years or more have not been found in a pyre, and prior to the latest find the earliest confirmed intentional cremations in Africa only appeared about 3,500 years ago, amongpastoral Neolithic people.Thompson said the discovery that different people merited different treatment in death “suggests that in life, they also would have had a lot more complexity to their social roles than I ever imagined, or that certainly is stereotypically described for tropical hunter-gatherers, especially this old”.Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the discovery.“That it is such an early date, and that they would have been transient as hunter-gatherers makes it more amazing,” he said.“They clearly had advanced belief systems and a high level of social complexity at this early date.”Explore more on these topicsAnthropologyArchaeologyAfricaMalawinewsShareReuse this content"

It has got so much going for it. This is a place that can do things and we want more people to see that.”View image in fullscreenThe newly restored Arctic Corsair trawler, known as Hull’s Cutty Sark, one of several projects that are part of a £70m transformation of the city.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWhen the Guardian visited on a rainy day in December, it was clear that everything is nearly there. Finishing touches and final decisions are being made for a series of openings taking place in 2026.The Hull Maritime project includes a new home for a restored trawler, theArctic Corsair, known as Hull’s Cutty Sark.A vessel called theSpurn Lightship, which for 50 years guided ships through the treacherous waters of the Humber estuary, will reopen to the public after a makeover.Swathes of public space are being improved, including a £21m refurbishment of Queen’s Gardens, a former dock; and the city’s much-missed Maritime Museum will reopen after a five-year closure.The ambitious project is a legacy fromHull’s UK city of culture success in 2017and has had a number of frustrating delays, but 2026 will be the year things finally start happening.View image in fullscreenThe Spurn Lightship will reopen to the public after a makeover.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe Arctic Corsair, the project’s centrepiece, is a deep-sea trawler built in 1960 that operated duringthe cod wars with Icelandand which once broke world records for landing the largest amount of cod and haddock in a year.It is an emblem of Hull’s proud trawling history – still within living memory – and has been a visitor attraction since 1999. It was badly in need of restoration and closed to the public in 2018. Today, the 57-metre-long boat positively gleams.The Arctic Corsair was restored byDunston Ship Repairs in Hull, where it is docked, and everyone involved in the project has praised the company for going above and beyond what was expected.For Dave Clark, the technical director at Dunston, it has clearly been a passion project but he will be happy when it makes its way to its permanent home. “People need to be on it, it needs to be seen,” he said. “People need to hear the stories, to see the working conditions … men working 16 hours a day.“We are all from Hull and most of the people who work for us have been involved in the fishing industry their whole life and you can see the pride that has been put into it.”View image in fullscreenHull Maritime Museum will reopen after a five-year closure.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMoving the trawler from its current berth to its dry dock home will be a huge challenge involving dredging and a possible 20-point turn.Men who used to work on the Arctic Corsair have also volunteered their memories and knowledge. They include Cliff Gledhill, a retired maritime engineer who seems to know every working part of the boat’s machinery and huge, labyrinthine engine room.“It’s 52 years since I first came on this ship,” he said. “If the ship broke down, it doesn’t matter where it was … Iceland or Norway or wherever, the chances were that one of us [engineers] would go.”He said the Arctic Corsair was important to Hull. “It was a very successful ship with quite a history. It was the pride of the fleet. This is going to be a massive attraction.”View image in fullscreenCliff Gledhill, a retired maritime engineer, on the newly restored Arctic Corsair.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianAt the city’s Maritime Museum, housed in former dock offices, the rooms are still largely empty but the roof has been fixed, display cabinets are being put in place and boxes are ready to be emptied.Robin Diaper, a curator, said the museum was a place for tourists to spend time but also somewhere local people could pop in to see Erik, the popular polar bear on long-term loan from Dundee, while they were shopping.“We wanted to make the whole project world-class,” said Diaper. “It’s of a standard you might see in New York or Paris or London. But we also want a young mother from the Orchard Park estate to be able to just walk in and for it to be hers as well.”View image in fullscreenThe Ferens Art Gallery in Hull city centre is also a draw for tourists.Photograph: Andrew Paterson/AlamyRooms in the museum that were previously off limits are being used to display far more objects, more boldly. The grade II*-listed former docks building was badly in need of restoration. When it rained, plastic sheeting had to be placed over whale skeletons hanging from the ceiling.Hull also has the Ferens Art Gallery, the Wilberforce House Museum and itsspectacular aquarium, The Deep. With everything happening in 2026 it is a world-class destination for visitors, say tourism officers.For the council leader Ross, the challenge is for people not to be surprised they might have a great time in Hull, but to know in advance that they will. “If we can do that, we’ve made it,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHullHeritageArtFishing industryNorth of EnglandYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is the third time the BBC has dropped a new season ofThe Traitorson or close to 1 January, enshrining a great new British tradition of easing into the new year with a month-long “psychological game of deception” – and, after a slow-burn start to the first season back in 2022, audiences have now learned to bay for fresh blood at Claudia Winkleman’s bell.This fourth “civilian” season comes just a month afterThe Celebrity Traitors finale, which drew a record 15m viewers, sent some of its contestants’ profiles skyrocketing (and called others into question – Nick, what happened?) and is still generating headlines from the retrospective play-by-play.By this point, The Traitors is about as close as we come to appointment viewing in the streaming age, singlehandedly convincing audiences to stump up for TV licences. Yet, after the barnstorming success of The Celebrity Traitors – and that jaw-dropping finale, which saw Alan Carr, the best-worst Traitor ever, somehow seize victory from his loyal faithfuls – even diehards fans might well be asking themselves: how can this new season top that?By changing the game, of course. Episode one makes clear almost from the jump – after a typically camp opening sequence showing Winkleman in a 4x4, shadowed by an owl – that in this season, not even her appointed traitors can expect to have total control. “Just when they think they know how to play …” Winkleman murmurs, brushing a telltale red cloak.Last year the show sought to keep contestants on their toes by having them boot three of their own from the train, before they had even reached the castle. This year everyone makes it to The Traitors HQ, with introductions made along the way. With 22 starting players, the show does a good job of suggesting who we need to pay attention to. There’s 62-year-old Fiona from Swansea – in the mould of season one’s Amanda, dialling up the dither to evade suspicion. Thirty-something Scot Stephen – who plans to draw on “having to be different people”, growing up queer on the isolated Isle of Lewis. Cool, calm and collected comms head Rachel – who once successfully breached security, pretending to be the Irish president’s daughter, and has been manifesting Winkleman’s tap on her shoulder.They skew older than last year’s crop and, mercifully, less jittery. Some, such as crime writer Harriet, 52, and Amanda, 57, a retired police detective, have already resolved to conceal their professions. Others – such as Hugo, a barrister and self-described “psychopathic teddy bear”, and 34-year-old accounts guy Sam, poised to be this season’s love-to-hate player – have brought nothing but brazen confidence. Meanwhile, in a series first, there’s a shock reunion outside the castle doors between nursery teacher Netty, 42, and personal trainer Ross, 37 (lapsed acquaintances), which promises a new dynamic to play with.Strikingly, all of them want to play as traitors, shocking even Claudia with their bloodlust. It suggests a slight change in tack with casting, prioritising those with a sheer love of the game. Last year’s contestants, selected by “the pub test”, quickly turned on each other like rats in a cage, veering between the fight-or-fawn response at the round tables in a way that was certainly not strategically productive, and occasionally unpleasant to watch. No doubt the pressure will get to this lot, too, but they at least seem prepared.The hype around The Traitors is also acknowledged in the episode, with the contestants shown to be thrilled by the famous castle and “queen Claudia”, suggesting a slightly more meta production. (Winkleman congratulates them on arrival: “You made it off the train – that doesn’t always happen.”) But, the audience has already been let in on the coming twist: on top of the traitors selected by Winkleman at the first round table, there’s now a “Secret Traitor” who knows their identities, nominates who they may kill and is the only player to have total oversight of the game. Not even those watching at home know who, among the supposed faithfuls, is beneath that scarlet cloak.It’s an audacious decision, shaking up the format at the series’ peak, but one that could stymie The Traitors’ emergent flaw, where only the most gullible faithfuls have a chance of making it to the end. Indeed, the impact on gameplay is seismic, and immediate. Winkleman wastes no time in selecting her traitors, but the triumph of her chosen three is short-lived once they learn they’ll have to murder to order. (“I do not require middle management,” grumbles one.) Their stricken expressions as they realise that their strategies have been totally upended are immensely satisfying to watch and promise great telly ahead.The first challenge, too, delivers spectacle with 100 coffins suspended across a loch. Some contain cash, and must be towed to shore – but there’s another twist, forcing the players to reveal their suspicions about each other on the fly and make split-second decisions about who to shield from banishment. When a secret blood tie between faithfuls is revealed near the episode’s end, you’re left to anticipate what gems the producers must be holding back. (The season two Ross and Diane bombshell was delayed until episode three.)Having grown the series’ following with The Celebrity Traitors, the BBC could easily have rolled out another civilian season using past templates and felt sure of a record-breaking audience. Instead, they’ve upped the ante and made the format even twistier. Episode one, with its rapid, punchy reveals, leaves us and the players with plenty of threads to pull on – and exudes the producers’ confidence in the coming payoff.The Traitors aired on BBC One in the UK and is on iPlayer now. It will be available to stream on Channel 10 in Australia from 2 January.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

OK, I wasn’t that good at the job, but I was also done with it. It was on my mind that I needed an actual job, one that you could describe to someone: “I’m an X.” At what point did you get to say: “I’m a journalist”? And was that even a real thing? A lawyer friend had told me: “I see mine as a profession and yours as more of a trade.” I ruminated on that a lot.Anyway, some time between my latest misdemeanour and my inevitable disciplinary letter, someone from the main paper, let’s call him Pete Clark because that was his name (everyone else will go by initials, but Pete’s dead now, and he would want to be named, I think), asked if I wanted to go to a party. It was no special occasion, just the launch of a bar; this happened every night in the 90s, even Mondays. He was 43, but all old people look the same when you’re 23, so I felt as if the viscount owner of the paper had noticed me from the top of his gold mountain and invited me to a ball.I asked him why he had invited me, and he said I reminded him of Elmer, the patchwork elephant: “This great, big, maladroit thing, incredibly colourfully dressed.” I didn’t feel insulted. He was obviously just someone who liked to go about carnival-style, surrounded by freaks.We arrived late and mob-handed: Pete, who always wore a silk scarf that he would toss like a dandy, but then come over incredibly East End if anyone admired it; C, who took so much chaos with him that it wasn’t an evening out until he had injured himself; M, who would have much preferred to go home, but was too shy to ever say, “No, I am shy and would prefer to go home”; B, who looked like a supermodel but for some weird reason didn’t know it; A, who always peeled off five minutes before any trouble started; R, the only one of us who was working, as his job was “bars”; two other people who over time I came to understand would always be with us, except nobody knew what they did during the day; and me.The mood shift when we walked in felt like a western; a gang of ruffians blowing into the saloon, a pause while people waited to see what kind of mayhem we had brought. But the bar itself was nothing like a western – being quintessentially 90s. All the surfaces were onyx or obsidian or whatever the hell: very shiny, very black. All the waiters were dressed in black, and all the mirrors were tinted a kind of coppery grey, so everywhere you looked, you saw your face reflected back at you, except made of pure evil. The only drinks being served were martinis.Hanging from the ceiling was a giant cage, and inside the cage was what cannot possibly have been a panther. Could it have been a vast black domestic cat? A snow leopard, sprayed black? I wish I’d spent more time bottoming this out, then the whole thing would sound less like a dream. Whatever it was, it was a living, breathing creature, sitting there, intended to convey an atmosphere of elegance and decadence, I guess.Instead, the cat just looked pissed off, and Pete decided it was not the right environment for an animal. It was too noisy and the cat was getting smoke in its eyes, and even though we were the ones smoking, he wouldn’t let it drop. He started berating the manager, who couldn’t tell whether or not he was joking. He wasn’t even a cat person – he had border terriers – but he couldn’t abide an unhappy creature in a cage. We stayed until all the martinis were finished, and I think Pete yanked the establishment’s chain for the entire time.The next day someone from the satanic bar called Pete’s boss to say they had found his credit card in the loo, and she laughed for about half an hour at the idea that anyone would think the implication of drug use would besmirch his reputation. They were lawless people who took a good time with them, and couldn’t stand cruelty to animals. I loved my work after that. Someone other than Pete – a senior editor, who was not lawless, who was magnificent and is still alive, thank God – hoicked me off listings and on to the main newspaper, where every day ended in a carnival of freaks going to a party. I finally discovered, as the long 90s ground to a close, that this was a real job.Explore more on these topicsWork & careersMy big night outPubsNewspapersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s 8.30pm andDavid Attenborough– 99 years young, in customary short-sleeved blue shirt and chinos – is on the hunt for Tottenham’s most elusive resident. He gets settled on a camping chair. Waits. Emits a tiny rhapsodic gasp as the creature in question appears. It’s a … fox.“It’s still a huge thrill to see one suddenly emerging from the bushes,” he whispers to camera of a sight so bog-standard most Londoners wouldn’t bother looking up from their phones. “A totally wild creature!” Attenborough holds out a hand. Murmurs a delighted “hello”. The fox comes within a few inches of the greatest natural historian and broadcaster this country has ever produced, then slinks off into the night. What an encounter! And if you think that’s exhilarating wait until you see his reaction to a pigeon getting on the tube.For those at the precarious stage of the holidays where a poultice for the heart is urgently required, I give you Wild London. An exquisitely cheerful, beautifully produced, unexpectedly moving special, captured over Attenborough’s centennial year, in which he seeks out the wildlife of the capital and we discover that the secret to a good life isn’t actually a parasite cleanse or a facial for your vagina – it’s appreciating what’s on your own doorstep. Which in Attenborough’s case is a megacity home to 9 million people, 2.6m cars, 607 sq miles of concrete, asphalt and steel, and more wild animals than seem possible in such unnatural circumstances. Plus, of course, one vanishingly rare David Attenborough. “Throughout my life I’ve had the good fortune to travel the world witnessing many spectacles,” he says in a black cab home to Richmond. “But this is the place to which I’ve always returned.”View image in fullscreen‘Still a huge thrill’ … David Attenborough with a fox in Wild London.Photograph: BBC/Passion Planet Ltd/Gavin ThurstonAnd so to Hammersmith station, through which Attenborough once regularly commuted, his day “always brightened” by the sight of … yes, I too was thinking a rat! But no. Pigeons. Hopping on and off trains before the doors close with the chutzpah of Indiana Jones grabbing his hat, while commuters look on obliviously and Attenborough explains how pigeons typically use the sun and magnetic fields to find their way, but in urban areas have learned to navigate using landmarks, roads, even train lines. Honestly, does British telly get any better than this?Next, peregrine falcons, whichHamza Yassin fans will knoware now nesting in pairs all over London. When Attenborough moved to the capital in the 1950s they were virtually extinct in the UK. Today? “They’re thriving in London in greater numbers than almost any other city in the world.” There’s breathtaking footage of the fastest animal on Earth soaring through the city, nesting in the Houses of Parliament, Charing Cross hospital and factories on the Thames, which work as ideal substitutes for their natural cliff habitats. “London’s concrete canyons”, Attenborough calls them. “Plenty of opportunity to make a killing in the city.” The writing, as ever in his films – which he has always insisted on refining and rewriting himself – is lyrical, mischievous, glorious.So much evokes childlike wonder: “green squadrons” of parakeets, honeybees drunk on fermenting nectar, Aesculapian snakes along Regent’s Canal, emperor dragonflies breeding in the pond outside the Natural History Museum and, most astonishingly of all, the return of wild beavers to a London wetland. A species that disappeared from the UK about 400 years ago. “If someone had told me when I’d just moved here that one day I’d be watching wild beavers in London I’d have thought they were mad,” he says. “Imagine what else can be achieved if we let nature back into our cities.”It’s not only beavers that blow his mind. “Oh, what a lovely thing,” Attenborough says, holding a four-week-old peregrine falcon chick. He marvels at a vixen hiding a chicken bone under a car’s windscreen wipers. He’s tickled by the “hedgehog highways” the owners of London’s 4m private gardens have introduced, cutting holes in fences to allow males to travel up to two miles every night in search of a mate. In Hyde Park he witnesses a face-off between some territorial coots and a frankly terrifying herring gull, whose taste for pigeon meat “has given him the glossiest plumage on the shores of the Serpentine”. Without getting into the gruesome details, I found myself jumping up and screaming three words I never thought would fall out of this Londoner’s mouth: “Come on, pigeon!”What is most moving is seeing the common urban spectacles the rest of us take for granted, or don’t see at all, elevated to the giddy heights of an Attenborough documentary. Whether he is witnessing a herd of fallow deer cross an east London street to feast on someone’s garden roses, or narrating the high-stakes drama of a mother trying to hide her fawn from an off-lead dalmatian sniffing about the bushes of his local park, it’s this endless capacity for wonder, on his own doorstep and everywhere else, that is most humbling. This one human animal has changed the way we see the natural world. Whatever will we do without him?Wild London aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsDavid AttenboroughTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Let me explain exactly why you need a button-through sleeveless knit. It looks just “fashion” enough to be intentional, but you can throw it over a regular T-shirt and trousers. The temperature control has a psychological impact: having fewer layers on your arms feels a bit fresher, less soporific, than being swaddled in a big knit. The horn-effect buttons add a dressy touch and make the shape versatile: you can wear this open as a sleeveless jacket over a shirt dress, for instance.AlbarayChunky rib waistcoatfrom£85£85 at Albaray£85 at M&SThe personality scarfCotswold KnitNotgrove neckerchief£64£64 at Gather & SeeNotgrove neckerchief£64 at Gather & SeeThe scarf has had a renaissance in fashion over the past couple of years.

They’re often called “travel trousers” because they’re cool and comfortable enough to wear on a long journey, but because they don’t crease or sag, you arrive looking smart. You don’t have to be travelling to appreciate them: they’re great for regular days when you need to get dressed at 7am and look presentable at 7pm. Vuori, home of chic Californian modern activewear, has nailed it with its Elevation trousers, which have a hook-and-eye fastening and front pleat to bring sophistication without any need to get out the iron.VuoriElevation trousers£110£110 at VuoriBeg, steal or borrow a plaid shirtAligneTaylor flannel shirt£49.49£49.49 at AligneTaylor flannel shirt£49.49 at AligneThis is not, in all honesty, a shopping suggestion so much as a suggestion to root around in your wardrobe – or your partner’s, or your dad’s – for a checked flannel shirt. These are going to be a Thing this year. This is not just a jeans-and-boots casual outdoorsy vibe: on the fashion circuit recently I’ve seen plaid shirts tied around the waist to break up an all-black tailored outfit, or tucked into pencil skirts. Charity shops are also a good source here, but if you’re in the market for a new purchase, this beauty by Aligne has a clever button and loop at the back that pulls it into a waisted shape, for days when that works better than boxy.AligneTaylor flannel shirt£49.49£49.49 at AligneThe French-Girl hairpinAnthropologieEyelet resin hair pins£20£20 at AnthropologieEyelet resin hair pins£20 at AnthropologieGen Z love a claw clip.

With Supergirl, Hoppers and a live-action Moana on the way, can Hollywood stand up to Trump?Andrew PulverThu 1 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTShareIt’s fair to say that Hollywood is in crisis, or at least in transition. Studios getting taken over, culture wars all over the place, and gen AI rearing its head. The last thing they need is an interventionist president determined to wage war on the entertainment industry, as well as no doubt extracting what value he can.Donald Trump, as we know, is very interested in the movie business: in his pre-politics days, he made dozens of appearances in films, as well as on TV. It seems very likely that he’s eyeing a place at Hollywood’s top table after he leaves office (presuming he does).Perhaps that’s what is behind his most spectacular recent intervention:demanding, and getting, a fourth Rush Hour moviefrom the new owners of Paramount Pictures, the studio that was recently taken over by David Ellison, son of Larry, one of Trump’s key allies. Coincidentally, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is one of the funders of Paramount’s subsequent bid to derail Netflix’s takeover of Warner Bros, withTrump himself suggesting he might influence US corporate regulatorsto prevent the Netflix deal from going ahead. And of course, in the background, isTrump’s threat of non-specific “tariffs”on the film industry, ostensibly aimed at keeping movie production inside the US. But, arguably, this could also be a way of keeping Hollywood’s top executives nervous and pliable.View image in fullscreenLow profile … Milly Alcock as Supergirl.Photograph: DC StudiosSo how far has it gone? Can we trace any actual Trump effect on the movies we might be watching in 2026? Is the “woke” blockbuster in retreat? Unless it’s put on a bullet-train travelator, we’re not likely to see Rush Hour 4 this year (but it’s been in the works since 2009 so you never know). Entirely typically in Trumpworld, if it does go ahead, it will be the Hollywood comeback for the controversial director Brett Ratner, who hasn’t directed a feature since a series ofcomplaints of sexual assault and harassment were made against him in 2017. (Ratner denied all allegations and settled a case with one of his accusers, Melanie Kohler, after suing her for defamation.) One film we will get from Ratner this year, though, isa documentary about Melania Trump.Next year we will also get a biopic of Michael Jackson. He wasacquitted of child molestation in his lifetimebut allegations of abuse continued to emerge after his death, particularlythrough the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland. The new filmhas been called “sugar-coated” by Jackson’s daughter, who has said it “panders to a very specific section of my dad’s fandom that still lives in the fantasy”. Wuthering Heights, the new adaptation of Emily Brontë’s novel by Emerald Fennell, has so far brazened out the kind of social media firestormover the ethnicity of its Heathcliffthat might have scuppered it in a pre-Trump universe.All of which brings us to the perhaps more serious issue of the continuing intimidation of mainstream films over the inclusion of anything deemed “woke”. Given the glacial pace at which big-studio production proceeds, it’s unlikely any of the putative blockbusters of 2026 have been foundationally influenced by fear of Trump’s wrath, but DC are no doubt relieved that this year sees the release of films about the relatively low-profile figures of Supergirl and Clayface, after the pastingSuperman took in 2025over its supposed veneration of immigrants. And afterthe grief it took over Snow Whiteand theinternal strife over content, it will be interesting to see if Disney has pulled in its horns. The 2026 crop – which includes a robot beaver cartoon called Hoppers, a fifth Toy Story movie and a live-action remake of Moana – could easily trip the studio up, as could the Marvel and Star Wars-branded films it looks after: Avengers: Doomsday and Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu respectively.View image in fullscreenHave faith … William Franklyn-Miller as Young Washington.Photograph: Angel/ Wonder ProjectWill there be any pushback? A film called Young Washington, about the early years of prez 1, might be promising, until you see it’s from Angel Studios, the “faith film” specialists who previously gave us theQAnonish thriller Sound of Freedom. The Maggie Gyllenhaal-directed remake of the Bride of Frankenstein (called simply The Bride!)says it will offer“romance, police interest and radical social change”. You might expect The Devil Wears Prada 2 to aim a few barbs in Trump’s direction, even if its presiding deity, Anna Wintour,breaks bread with the man himself.But as usual, all eyes will turn to the team behind South Park to stick it to Maga in 2026,as they have done in 2025. Whitney Springs, their new film, is about a black slave re-enactor who finds out his white girlfriend’s family once owned his ancestors. It looks like just the kind of bad-taste satire to stir the pot. We can but hope.Explore more on these topicsFilm2026 culture previewFilm industryDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Tom Hiddleston’s M16 agent Jonathan Pine returns to take down a new supervillain, he just about pulls it offJack SealeThu 1 Jan 2026 17.05 ESTShareFinesse was the selling point ofThe Night Manager when it debuted in 2016. It was a class above other spy thrillers, setting itself among moneyed elites – rotten ones, but elites nonetheless – and furnishing itself with luxury locations. In Tom Hiddleston it had a lead with a reputation that signalled that the often tacky espionage genre was looking to improve itself. Based on a book by John le Carré and airing on the BBC in the dying days of the era when that carried heavyweight global cachet, its pedigree was impeccable.A large part of the rarefied atmosphere the series created, though, was in being one and done: it swept in, won a ton of awards, then swooshed away, leaving behind a delicate waft of something impossibly exclusive. Lesser shows would have hastily cashed in with an inferior second season, but The Night Manager could not be so vulgar.A decade later, it’s back. Whether it’s the new Amazon co-production money or the frenzy among platform bosses to make spy things that might be a bit like Slow Horses, the programme has been lured into the fray again. Hiddleston and co-starOlivia Colmanare here for season two, with a third run already on its way.View image in fullscreenTom Hiddleston and Camila Morrone in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryThe elegant Jonathan Pine (Hiddleston), who began the story as an ex-soldier manning the night desk at five-star hotels before being provoked into joining MI6 when international master criminals whacked his girlfriend, is still in the secret service but no longer in the field. He suppresses the trauma he suffered in season one by working a different kind of hotel-related night shift: running an unglamorous surveillance unit that monitors the CCTV of London’s swankiest establishments, watching for behaviour that raises a terror flag.Pine’s crew are oddballs who are part of MI6 but excluded from the main building, instead operating from faceless premises down the road. They talk warily of the bigwigs at HQ, “River House”, who have given them a nickname: the “Night Owls”. Hang on! Has The Night Manager gone fully Slow Horses? Only for half an episode: when the sight of a familiar face shocks Pine so much his complexion changes from magnolia to ivory, he’s soon turning himself into a proper spy again.Hiddleston remains a divisive presence. He’s either a 21st-century take on a James Bond-style hero, single-handedly bringing down the billion-dollar business of a criminal mastermind without any ludicrous gadgets or retrograde chauvinism, and without being cringingly smarmy about it all. Or he’s a ridiculous attempt to bring modern sensitivity to an essentially boorish and silly genre, and is cringingly smarmy. It depends on your taste.‘We’re your dream throuple!’ The Night Manager is back – and it’s even steamierRead moreIt doesn’t matter too much, because what elevated the original Night Manager wasn’t Hiddleston, but who he was up against. If Hugh Laurie and Tom Hollander didn’t immediately sound like obvious casting for pitiless arms dealer Dickie Roper and his psychopathic lieutenant, Corky, the way they subverted their own chummy poshness quickly convinced us that our man Pine had walked into the very heart of darkness. These are the extremely bad men who really run the world, we were willing to believe, and we’ve sent someone to fight them armed only with strong morals and crisp linen.The new Night Manager tries to sustain that Roper bogeyman vibe, without Roper himself. The operation Pine is now infiltrating, a Colombian arms cartel, is linked to Roper, and Pine has Roper-themed flashbacks. Roper looms over all. But the big man has gone, and his replacement, Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva, who was a drug lord in Narcos: Mexico), is a much more generic antagonist. Doubtless he’ll be getting help from inside MI6 – Paul Chahidi, Hayley Squires and Indira Varma are superb as the new faces there, alongside a rehired Douglas Hodge as the upstanding if perhaps not hard-nosed enough Rex Mayhew. But, the show loses its naughty glint when Pine isn’t directly up against other members of the British upper classes. Although the drama still feels like cashmere and silk, the blade stashed in the folds isn’t so sharp.There is something fundamentally gauche, too, about the way season two methodically tries to rebuild the dynamic of the first run. Pine suffers another tragedy, adopts another fake identity and, without being sure who he can trust back at base, pitches himself into another game of bluff with another nefarious kingpin who could suss him at any moment – potentially aided by said supervillain’s disaffected moll (Camila Morrone). None of this is to say The Night Manager is suddenly average: it still floats far above most of the competition. But it no longer feels pristine.The Night Manager aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now. It airs on Prime Video on 11 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTom HiddlestonOlivia ColmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not the usual swing of the pendulum this way or that. It will be a key moment in the history of our democracy – and it could be less than three years away.Be in no doubt: populists represent a new and terrifying threat to the kind of free elections and free society we cherish, but now take for granted.As Donald Trump declared at a pre-election rallyin July 2024: “In four years you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Or, as his fellow populist Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, said: “Democracy is like a tram. You ride it until you arrive at your destination, then you step off.”Yet, here in the UK, where is the urgently needed counter-plan on a huge scale to thwart and head off such an existential threat? It is simply not in place, nor does it appear to be even at the planning stage. We are at a very dangerous moment. We simply cannot afford to allow Nigel Farage’s Reform UK to have a free run, and become established and entrenched as a credible potential government in the minds of disenchanted voters.The longer they go unchallenged, the more unthreatening and risk-free they will seem to voters. Just hoping that Reform and Farage implode, or that the rightwing vote will somehow fracture, is potentially suicidal for our freedom and democracy.The Labour party has taken some small steps to counter Reform. Keir Starmer has at last begun to talk about acloser relationship with Europe, and more broadly challenge the disastrous failure that is Brexit. Presentationally, we have recently seen the first decentStarmer videos on TikTok. But it is small-scale and the narrative surrounding this government has more often been about its own failings and internal conflicts than the battle it faces against a populist surge.If this goes on, the threat will grow. It is already doing just that on the international stage. Thenew US foreign policy strategyaims to support European populist parties. That is frightening. The 50-year-oldConservative Political Action Conference, reinvigorated by hard-right influencer Steve Bannon, brings populist parties in the US and Europe together to combine their electoral experiences and share initiatives. But what is there from the anti-populist side at European level? Nothing.In September 1995,Tony Blairand his team met at my home for their first election planning meeting. All the key players were involved. New Labour was ahead in the polls. But we did not just hope that the Tories under John Major would continue to decline. We planned scrupulously for a complete reorientation, to signal a real break from the past by Labour: new strategy, new branding, new policy, new presentation, new organisation. This kind of no-holds-barred thinking is needed. A fundamental reset.View image in fullscreenTony Blair with Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson at a pre-briefing with staff in 1996.Photograph: Peter Marlow/Magnum PhotosFor four years,my colleague David Cowanand I have been studying how populist parties operate here and in other countries, and how to counter them. There arecertain key lessons. The first is that many populists seem to work single-mindedly on the “we have only got to win once” principle. So survival means adopting an equally ruthless rebuttal mindset within democratic bounds. Prioritising conventional niceties, as Kamala Harris did whenrefusing to break with Joe Biden, will be a self-defeating luxury. Anti-populists must be prepared to fight fire with fire on messaging, call out lies and expose Farage’s simplistic solutions.Once elected, a number of populists have faced accusations of rigging democratic political systems to make it nearly impossible for them ever to lose. Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Erdoğan in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India, now Trump in the US, Robert Fico in Slovakia and Andrej Babiš in the Czech Republic all seem to adopt the same game plan.Since he came to power in 2010, Orbán has changed the voting system to benefit himself. The judiciary became accountable solely to him; they appear to freely throw opponents in jail. Last year Erdoğan jailed his presidential opponent, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who wasahead in the polls, and demanded he serve a2,000-year sentence.Some populists have been accused of meddling with national broadcasters, by appointing cronies to their board. They deny opposition parties equal rights to promote themselves, so they have no chance. This is the populist playbook. What chance then for our elections, our free speech? How will the BBC and independent media fare? An independent judiciary?The second lesson from our research is that Starmer needs to fundamentally change the way he approaches voters and his way of interacting with them. Voters are fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored. Our work shows that populists are best taken on when their opponents can somehow demonstrate that they are on the people’s side. This is how Kentucky’s Democratic governor since 2019,Andy Beshear, won out in a deeply Republican state. He has relentlessly spoken out in plain language on bread-and-butter issues: jobs, roads, schools, prices.And third:Labourneeds a top-to-bottom media and communications overhaul. The populist right in many countries operates a coordinated, emotionally driven media machine across social platforms, leaving the mainstream left’s ecosystem looking fragmented, reactive and constrained by an outdated broadcast mentality. To compete, Labour needs a two-front strategy now. Tactically, it must create a semi-autonomous digital narrative unit whose sole mission is to wage and win the daily war for attention. The goal is to ensure that when a voter scrolls, the populist narrative is no longer the only one they hear. This also requires a long-term cultural overhaul to recruit and elevate authentic communicators willing to talk on platforms like popular podcasts, as traditional media is no longer reaching disengaged voters.To achieve this, a shift will be needed from a national media “air war” to a permanent, hyper-local “ground war”. The solution is a local action network, a permanent organising infrastructure modelled on the ground-up success ofStacey Abrams in Georgia. Its mission would be to listen, act and communicate – identifying local problems, launching campaigns to fix them and publicising every small win.The current situation in the UK is a textbook case of an establishment party caught in the headlights as its populist opponent expertly reacts to voter pain and disenchantment. Relying on containment or a rational “hold-your-nose” vote is a strategy that will eventually fail. Labour needs a comprehensive action plan, now.

Do nothing about itGaby HinsliffFrom Agatha Christie doing the dishes to the cancer surgeon inspired at the theatre, an idling brain suddenly seems able to join the dotsThu 1 Jan 2026 10.51 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareIf you really want to solve a problem, try doing nothing about it. Fold some laundry. Stir a risotto. Go for a run, watch a film, try to entertain someone else’s baby: anything that involves pottering about in an undemanding yet still vaguely engaged way, which absolutely couldn’t be classed as work but isn’t totally vegetative either. It may not be the productivity hack any go-getter wants to hear, but it’s surprising how often a spell of aimless noodling around frees an otherwise overworked human brain to make the kind of lateral mental leap that helps everything fall into place. And I’m not just saying that to justify a New Year’s Day spent lying hungover on the sofa, ploughing through the last of the Christmas cheese.For the eminent cancer surgeonMichael Baum, it was a night off with his wife at the theatre that allowed him to suddenly join the dots. After watching a scene in Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia where one character explains chaos theory to another, Baum had his own personal eureka moment: what if this mathematical concept, used to describe complex systems that may seem haphazard but have a hidden underlying pattern to them, could also explain the otherwise puzzling way in which cancer grows and spreads? The result of that one stray thought as the interval curtain rose was an innovation in chemotherapy, and a gratifying rise in survival rates.Though the history of science is littered with accidental breakthroughs discovered in pursuit of something else entirely, what Baum was describing sounds more like a kind of glorious inefficiency: a victory born of knowing exactly when to stop trying. The story only came to light after Stoppard’s death, when Baum was movedto write to the Timesthat the playwright couldn’t have known how many lives he had inadvertently saved. But with all due respect to the power of drama, perhaps it wasn’t really the play that saved them so much as the permission it gave a doctor to switch off and relax.View image in fullscreen‘Agatha Christie used to work out plots for her murder mysteries while washing up.’Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesAfter all, the kind of pottering that frees a mind doesn’t have to be particularly high-powered. Archimedes supposedly had his breakthrough lolling in the bath, watching displaced water slop over the side.Agatha Christieused to work out plots for her murder mysteries while washing up, arguing that “the purely mechanical labour helps the flow of ideas, and how delightful to find your domestic task finished with no actual remembrance of having done it”. Even I have learned over the years that when I’m stuck on a piece of writing that won’t fall into shape, the quickest way of fixing it isn’t to hammer away at it grimly for hours but (sorry, boss) to shut the laptop and do something completely different for a bit. Somehow, in the process of taking the dog round the block or grumpily stacking the dishwasher, things more often than not arrange themselves. The trick is to divorce the busy conscious mind from some deeper subconscious part of the brain, which can carry on percolating things even when it doesn’t feel as if you’re thinking at all. It’s different from consciously working, but also very different from loafing: if anything the closest parallel is with dreaming, and the way it allows a mind to rerun the mental videotape of the day and make sense of everything you couldn’t process at the time. And, as with sleep, the busier you are, the more you probably need it.Recently I heard a former Downing Street aide suggest only half-jokingly that governments should adopt what universities call a reading week (or strictly speaking, what a reading week would be if students didn’t mostly treat it as a chance to go home and get their laundry done). What he meant was a break, long enough to do some actual thinking, from constantly running to catch up with whatever outrage is currently fuelling the social media news cycle. If Keir Starmer’s government is often criticised for lacking a grand vision or intellectual hinterland, in part that’s surely because nobody in this punch-drunk administration ever has time to develop one: to reflect on what has worked and what hasn’t, to make the less obvious connections, and let some original ideas bubble up.There’s no way a government as unpopular as this one would ever dare say it was taking time out to think deep thoughts, of course, for fear of the inevitable public backlash against what would be perceived as either slacking or unbearable pomposity. Yet the irony is that many of us are probably secretly craving something similar. According toa recent TUC survey, more than half of British workers say their jobs have got more intense in recent years: women are particularly likely to feel uncomfortably stretched, which may reflect the fact they’re more likely to work in public sector jobs such as health and education, where rising workloads and shrinking headcounts, coupled with government productivity targets, have systematically squeezed all the slack out of the day. For too many of us, work intensity means having no time to think straight during the day, and getting home too knackered to do anything much but slump and scroll. What is being lost is the kind of free-floating time that allows a relaxed but still intellectually curious mind to slide usefully sideways.Paradoxically, it’s technology that may also offer the best chance to claw some of it back. As AI starts to take on more and more routine tasks at work, employers will face a choice over how to use the human time saved. They can either simply seize the opportunity to make humans redundant and max out their profits in the short term, or they can gamble on a longer path to future productivity gains by giving some of that time back to their employees – not as the endless paid leisure time of Keynesian fantasy but to do the kind of original and creative thinking or training that large language models still can’t replicate. (One obvious template isGoogle’s 20%ruleto promote innovation back in the 00s, under which programmers were offered a day a week to play around with side-projects on the company’s time: the commercial rationale was that while most would come to nothing, there would be enough original ideas generated to justify the time seemingly wasted.)Too utopian? Maybe. But for now, there are worse ways to ease yourself gingerly into January than to remember that time spent doing what looks like nothing much can be time spent achieving more than you actually realised.

Midlife crisis? No thanksEmma BrockesAt 50, I find myself in a gazing-up-at-trees phase. What does it all mean? It’s not completely clear – but it’s certainly bothering my kidsThu 1 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareAccording toresearch undertakenby Stanford Medicine in 2024, adult human beings are subject to two “massive biomolecular shifts” – spikes in ageing, in other words – one at 44 and another at 60, confirming what most of us instinctively know to be true: that we get older in jagged bursts – not with gentle, steady progression. As the new year issues its annual invitation to stocktake, the thing I keep thinking is where we might place the equivalent emotional pivot points, those periods in which, after years of – God willing! – pottering along feeling roughly the same, suddenly, one day, there’s a change.I bring this up because I seem to be in the middle of one, an inflection point that manifests in the number of times on the walk back from the school drop-off I stop to look at a bird in a tree, or a snail on a wall, or any number of other overwrought visual metaphors that allow me to feel momentarily like I’m inside a poem byGerard Manley Hopkins. Hard to put one’s finger on what’s going on, but it has to do with the sense of an ending, which, if it’s sad at all, isn’t sad-sad; rather, it occupies that category of sadness I think of as the anticipation of future nostalgia.These feelings of transition are largely brought on by external factors – in my case, my kids’ last year of primary school – but are also, obviously, subject to cultural cues. I turned 50 at the end of November, which in any age prior to ours, would put me safely on the other side of a full-scale midlife crisis. But in an era in which 50-year-olds still dress precisely as they did 20 years ago – as if they’re about to commute to work via skateboard – everything has been pushed back by a decade. And so here I am, in what I have come to think of as my looking-at-trees phase, which last hit with this intensity in my early 30s and before that, adolescence.That seems about right, doesn’t it? Three big pivot points in a life when one becomes, briefly but acutely, aware of time passing, and which in my experience, tends to hit during even-numbered years (for that reason, I’ve always preferred the lower pressure of odd-number ages). There’s that line fromDon DeLillo’s Underworldin which he remarks of a couple working out on their running machines, “they were training to live forever” – and it’s the faltering of that delusion that ushers in these mind-blowing periods. In other words, I’m doing what everyone does as they age, which is to assume they are the first people in history to have experienced something people have been experiencing since the beginning of time – in this case: intimations of mortality. (See also: having a baby.)By the way, children don’t like their parents entering this mode, partly because, at least in my case, it triggers observations like, “Weird to think one day our cats will be dead and we’ll be so sad”; and partly because it forces them to confront the horrifying possibility that their parents have interior lives as real and awkward as their own. That’s the other thing about these pivot points: their unavoidability. I’ve had occasional success when it comes to big, decisive life events of finding ways to cheat the impact by feeling the feelings ahead of time, at a lower temperature, and then sailing through the actual event relatively unscathed.I managed to do this last year when I moved countries after 17 years and did most of my grieving in advance, bit by bit, so that I was blindsided only twice: once when walking away for the last time from the school my kids had been at since kindergarten – and feeling, to my utter amazement, almost panicked by the size of the grief. And the second time, spontaneously bursting into tears at the awfulness of saying the goodbyes I’d been so busy rationalising away – I’d forgotten to factor in what it would actually feel like.By contrast, these more generalised periods of change don’t work like that, and it’s my assumption there’s no hack that gets us around them. Why would we want to, in any case? There’s that thing the director and actorLena Dunhamsaid, which is that, sometimes, it’s nice to do – or in this case – feel the thing you’re supposed to be feeling at the time you’re supposed to be feeling it. I feel that way now, as time concertinas. Looking ahead, what I wonder is how this period of my life will appear looking back, just as when I look back to last year, it appears in my memory as if through deep water. It seems like decades ago now.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionNew yearHealthMedicineGirlsTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in theUSis slightly higher thanin Europe.The real threat facing Europe lies in its own economic and technological backwardness. Between 2008 and 2023, GDProse by 87%in the US, compared with just 13.5% in the EU. Over the same period, the EU’s GDP per capita fell from 76.5% of the US level to 50%. Even the poorest US state – Mississippi – has ahigher per capita incomethan that of several major European economies, includingFrance,Italyand theEU average.Today, roughly half of the world’s 50 largest technology firms are American, while only four are EuropeanThis widening economic gap cannot be explained by demographics. Instead, it reflects stronger productivity growth in the US, largely owing to technological innovation and higher total factor productivity. Today, roughly half of the world’s 50 largest technology firms are American, whileonly four are European. Over the past five decades,241 US firmshave grown from startups into companies with market capitalisations of at least $10bn (£7.4bn), compared with just 14 in Europe.These trends raise a critical question: which countries will lead the industries of the future, and where doesEuropefit in? The race for technological leadership now spans a wide range of fields, including AI and machine learning, semiconductor design and production, robotics, quantum computing, fusion energy, fintech and defence technologies. Europe enters this race at a clear disadvantage.Whether the US orChinacurrently leads the industries of the future remains open to debate, but most observers agree that it’s essentially a two-horse race, with the US still ahead in several key areas. Beyond that, innovation is concentrated in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Israel. In Europe, by contrast, innovative activities are largely confined to the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland – two of which are not even EU member states.It is hardly a surprise, then, that while the US and China dominate global technological rankings, Europe finds itself far from the top. And the outlook is anything but reassuring, given that the next wave of innovation is widely expected to be more disruptive than anything we have seen over the past half century.View image in fullscreenView of Paris. Even the poorest US state has a higher per capita income than several major European economies, including France and Italy.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThe technological gap between the US and Europe can be attributed to several factors. First, the US has a far deeper and more dynamic ecosystem for financing startups, while Europe still lacks a genuine capital markets union, limiting the scale and speed at which new firms can grow.Second, Europe is hampered by excessive and fragmented regulation. A US startup can launch a product under a single regulatory framework and immediately access a market of more than 330 million consumers. The EU has a population of roughly 450 million but remains divided among 27 national regulatory regimes. An International Monetary Fund analysisshowsthat internal market barriers in the EU act like a tariff of about 44% for goods and 110% for services – far higher than the tariff levels the US imposes on most imports.Third, cultural attitudes toward risk-taking differ sharply. Until relatively recently, a failed entrepreneur in some EU countries (such as Italy) could face criminal penalties, while in the US, a tech founder who has never failed is often seen as too risk-averse.Fourth, the US benefits from a deeply integrated academic-military-industrial complex, while Europe’s chronic underinvestment in defence has weakened its innovation capacity. Technological leaders such as the US, China, Israel and, more recently, Ukraine spend heavily on defence, with military research often producing technologies that have civilian applications.Despite this, many European political leaders continue to frame higher defence spending as a trade-off between security and social welfare. In reality, free-riding on US defence spending since the end of the second world war has limited the type of innovation that could have generated more of both through higher productivity. Paradoxically, sustaining Europe’s social model will require greater investment in defence, beginning with meeting Nato’s new spending target of 3.5% of GDP.If Europe allows its technological lag to grow over the coming decades, it risks prolonged stagnation and continued economic decline relative to the US and China. There are, however, reasons for cautious optimism. Increasingly aware that Europe faces an existential challenge, policymakers have begun to advance serious reform proposals. The most notable examples are the two major 2024 reports onEU competitivenessand thesingle marketby the former Italian prime ministersMario DraghiandEnrico Lettarespectively.With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovationEurope also retains considerable strengths, including high-quality human capital, excellent education systems and world-class research institutions. With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovation. With a better environment for entrepreneurship, Europe’s high per capita income, large internal market and elevated savings rates could help unleash a wave of investment.Crucially, even if Europe never leads in cutting-edge technologies, it could still significantly boost productivity by adopting and adapting American and Chinese innovations. Many of these technologies are general-purpose in character, benefiting both adopters and pioneers.All of this leaves Europe at an inflection point. As Ernest Hemingway famouslyobserved, bankruptcy happens “gradually and then suddenly”. So far, Europe’s technological decline has been gradual. But if it fails to confront its structural weaknesses, today’s slow erosion could give way to a sudden and irreversible loss of economic relevance.Nouriel Roubini is professor emeritus at the Stern school of business and the author of Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends that Imperil Our Future and How to Survive Them.©Project SyndicateExplore more on these topicsEuropeProject Syndicate economistsEconomicsDonald TrumpGlobal economyEuropean UnionChinacommentShareReuse this content"

I see him as an heir to the Yiddish socialism that helped build New YorkThu 1 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.10 ESTShareBillionaires raised fortunes against him. The president threatened to strip his citizenship. Mainstream synagogues slandered him as the spawn of Osama Bin Laden and Chairman Mao. But today,Zohran Mamdanibecame the first socialist mayor of New York City.For all the hysteria, when I look at Mamdani, I didn’t see some radical departure from the past. I see him as the heir to an old and venerable Jewish tradition – that of Yiddish socialism – which helped buildNew York.In some cases, the link is direct. Bruce Vladeck, a member of one of Mamdani’s transition committees, is a well-respected expert on Medicare, but for the sake of this article, his credentials matter less than his surname.Vladeck is the great-grandson of Baruch Charney Vladeck, a Marxist troublemaker from the Pale of Settlement, a tract of land in the Russian empire where Jews were permitted to live at a time of rampant antisemitic oppression. Baruch showed up in New York after the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 with a Cossack’s saber scars all over his face. He later became a socialist alderman and member of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia’s housing administration. Vladeck was not actually his birth name. It was rather anom de guerre, adopted when he joined the Jewish Labor Bund, the socialist, secular and defiantly anti-Zionist movement whose slogan, “here where we live is our country,” would make an apt tagline for Mamdani’s New York.In our city, exiled revolutionaries like Vladeck found fertile ground. At the dawn of the 20th century, New York was home to nearly 600,000 Jews, making it the largest Jewish city on Earth, a title it still holds. They packed 10 to a room, into the squalid tenements of the Lower East Side, where they toiled in garment sweatshops, and where the fires caused by their in-home piecework businesses mirror those caused by the exploding lithium-ion batteries of e-bikes today. They soon transformed into a clamorous, disputatious and utterly radical proletariat – the same sort of constituency that powered Mamdani’s campaign.View image in fullscreenShoppers congregate as vendors sell their wares on the sidewalk outside haberdasheries on the Lower East Side of Manhattan circa 1900.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesWhile New York’s Jewish communities are far too numerous, and far too fractious, to jam into one single story, there is still a narrative that gets spun. It goes like this. After the second world war, Jews made bank, assimilated into America, and fell in love with Israel. (Never mind the many communities this story leaves out – the booming, non-Zionist, utterly unassimilated Satmar community; the Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union; the dykes and freaks and commies and artists; Bernard Sanders. The list goes on.) The institutions associated with the narrative –the Anti-Defamation League, posh New York synagogues – have been Mamdani’s most virulent attackers.Jewish New York’s reckoning with Zohran Mamdani: ‘He’s become a vehicle for our tensions’Read moreThe hysteria of this elite over Mamdani’s ascent would have seemed bizarre to so many of their great-grandparents. In New York at the turn of the century, Jewish workers created a secular, socialist, but specifically Yiddish world. By the time my own great-grandfather turned up in Ellis Island in 1904, this sort of socialism was alive on every Lower East Side street – in the mutual aid societies, debate clubs, picket lines, night schools, and the lectures that Jewish workers obsessively attended. Socialist Yiddish papers sold 120,000 copies a day. The socialist Workmen’s Circle attracted tens of thousands of members in hundreds of branches across America and educated thousands of children at their secular Yiddish schools. Two garment workers unions, led by former Jewish revolutionaries, represented more than 100,000 workers between them. And in 1912, the Yiddish, socialist newspaper The Forwardconstructed a beaux-arts skyscraper on the corner of Rutgers Square on the Lower East Side. “Where is the synagogue of our Jewish workers? Where is the temple of freedom, of equality, of brotherhood?” Forward editor Abe Cahan asked. That building was his attempt at an answer.View image in fullscreenPeople protest against child labor in New York circa 1909.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCahan adorned the Forward Building’s facade with busts of Marx and Engels, but on the Lower East Side, socialism meant more than the words of these two men. It was the idiom of something broad, free and generous – the fight for a better and more beautiful world. To be a socialist meant to be a human, to affirm that there was more to life than the brutish quest for coin. Not just wages, but dignity. Not just bread, but roses too.Or, as Mamdani’s first campaign for state assembly put it – “roti and roses”.Today, just blocks away from the Forward Building is the New York office of the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani joined the group in 2017, and it continues to be his political home. The thick culture the DSA created – of picket lines and soccer leagues, educational lectures and political canvasses and dating nights – recalls that of its socialist forbearers. Over the last eight years, it has also built a formidable political machine. The DSA launched Mamdani’s bids for state assembly, then for mayor. When it came to door-knocking, they were his army.Like the Jewish socialists of old, Mamdani grew his base with militant labor organizing. In 2021, when taxi drivers camped out in front of City Hall, to protest their murderous medallion debt, Mamdani was with them. He moved his assembly office on to the sidewalk, went on a 14-day hunger strike with the drivers, then danced with them when they won their debt relief.I remember the emotion in his voice when he shoutedinto the microphone: “This is just the beginning of solidarity. We are going to fight together until there is nothing left in this world to win.” Those words that could have echoed down Broadway 100 years before.View image in fullscreenThe Jewish Daily Forward building in New York circa 1950.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesLike New York itself, Mamdani’s campaign was multicultural, multiracial, polyglottal. When Andrew Cuomo tried to bait him as un-American, he released ads in Spanish and Bangla, Hindi and Arabic. He ran a campaign devoted to class-first politics that sought to speak to everyone in their own idiom, while never once apologizing for who he was.This too mirrors the tactics of New York’s old school Jewish left. They also lived and struggled in a diverse immigrant world – where their co-worker at the garment factory might be Italian, and where their uncle, the radical lawyer, would defend aboricuacomrade from the cops. They also knew how to organize across difference.AsBen Daviswrote in the Guardianthis April: “Jews in New York voted in thehundreds of thousandsfor socialists for decades.” In the years before the first world war, Jewish districts in New York elected 10 socialist assemblymen, seven socialist city councilmen, and one socialist municipal judge. In 1914, these neighborhoods sent Jewish socialist labor lawyer Meyer London to Congress.View image in fullscreenMeyer London speaks at a rally for striking street car workers in New York on 15 July 1916.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLondon was not a favored choice – not any more than Mamdani. He had once raised money for guns to fight the tsar. He denounced lynching and supported open immigration regardless of race, and opposed the creation of a Jewish ethnostate on the backs of Palestinians. Worst of all, he was hated by the Tammany machine, which sent thugs to the polls to gin up support for their favored candidate. But unionized garment workers turned the tables, canvassing, door-knocking and poll watching with a fervor that reminds me of the canvasses we Mamdani volunteers undertook on the murderously hot days before the primary. Then, and now, the socialists won their race.Power concedes nothing willingly, and as socialists took political office, they fell ever more under siege. In 1918, London opposed attempts to create a Jewish state against the will of Palestine’s Arab majority. Furious,wealthy Zionistsrallied against him, their denunciations likely costing him his election. (Billionaires such as Bill Ackman ran a similarly vicious, but blessedly futile campaign against Mamdani). With America’s entry into the first world war, jingoistic nationalism swept the country, leading to the arrests of socialist politicians, and the Palmer Raids that savaged the Jewish left. In 1920,five New York socialist assemblymenwere expelled from office on accusations of disloyalty. Three of them were Jewish. During the Red Scare, and later, throughout the McCarthy years, the institutions of the Jewish left would be surveilled, raided and smashed. Partial as it was, this attempted erasure was effective enough that in the year 2025, Jewish institutions could bellow that Mamdani’s politics were foreign to their New York.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani calls for the full enforcement of the city’s sanctuary city laws at a campaign rally in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, on 21 June 2025.Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty ImagesAs Mamdani’s video team churned out content throughout his campaign, they sought to situate him in his city’s socialist legacy. Particularly moving were his history lessons, where he sat at a desk in the middle of the street and expounded on his political forbearers – like East Harlem congressmanVito Marcantonio, and the Yiddish-speaking, socialist birth control pioneerFania Mindell. At the same time, he spoke in the idiom of today’s New York, with its neighborhoods of more recent arrivals. He went onSubway Takesand passed out sweets for Diwali in Jackson Heights, and showed up at the queer dance partyPapi Juiceto ask for votes. He honored the past, but found new voters in new coalitions, in a city that is ever in the process of becoming.Throughout the election, Zionists tried to smear Mamdani as an antisemite. It didn’t work. Not even with these Zionists’ own children; according to one July poll by Zenith Research,two-thirds of Jews under age 40supported Mamdani. There are many reasons for this, including the craven falsity of the charge, which had grown hollow from misuse; the moral anguish of witnessing Israel’s genocide in Gaza; and the fact that Jews, just like everyone else, want affordable rent, free childcare, and buses that are fast and free.But another reason is this. Mamdani walks in an older Jewish tradition. Not that of ritzy Upper East Side synagogues, but of so many of our great-grandparents: the socialist sweatshop workers who fought for a better and more beautiful world.Molly Crabapple is an artist and the author of the forthcoming bookHere Where We Live is Our Country: The Story of the Jewish Bund, which will be published by One World Random House on 7 April 2026Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkUS politicsJudaismReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

In this era of canine exceptionalism, can humanity stage a comeback?Farhana DawoodFrom pawdicures to designer rainwear, the cult of the dog is expanding with impressive speed. Why must we tolerate it?Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.07 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.12 ESTShareI’m becoming concerned that we as a species have gone to the dogs – quite literally. Somewhere between the rise of boutique pet grooming and private members’ clubs for canines, dogs appear to have become our preferred species for social interaction.Parks, beaches, cafes – even offices and yoga studios, which in the past were areas for human exclusivity, or at least priority – are all frequently shared zones. That means you must joyfully tolerate being sniffed or enthusiastically pranced at. Your belongings, likewise, are subject to dog paws and noses. Object, and you’ll be met with looks of discord, as though you’ve confessed to disliking sunlight or laughter. Or the pet person thinksyou must be frightenedand insists “He/She won’t hurt you!”What happened next: Valerie the dachshund taught us how to survive – and thriveRead moreIf a human, especially a small child, pressed up against strangers, making prolonged eye contact while drooling, there’d likely be reprimands and reining in. But when a dog does it, it’s apparently “adorable”.We seem to have entered an era of canine exceptionalism. A new dog on a bush walk now attracts at least as much excitement as a new baby. People flock to stroke the spaniel, and entire conversations unfold between strangers about breeds and training techniques.Across cities, the cult of the dog is expanding with impressive speed. In London, there are private members’ clubs for dogs – actual clubs, with menus, treatments and membership fees that would make most humans blush. In Sydney’s more affluent suburbs, dog grooming salons, resembling human day spas and offering pawdicures, are the new retail must-have. And then of course there’s puppy schools and puppy yoga, where the dog is essential to the practice.A woman in my old apartment building regularly transported her dog in a pram, complete with blanket and an air of maternal pride. Every afternoon she’d walk the dog,in the buggy, along the harbour foreshore. At Christmas, she put it in the back of her convertible, surrounded by wrapped presents, for a photoshoot. She then drove off with her canine companion in the front seat on Christmas Day, presumably for a special lunch.Dog ownership has taken on a deeper emotional charge. For some, the pet has become a permanent stand-in, replacing partners or even friends. A dog’s love, after all, is uncomplicated. It doesn’t ghost you or critique your life choices. You can project whatever you like on to it, and it will happily wag along. It’s always ready and willing to accompany you as you head to the shops, the cafe, the park and even to work.I can’t help wondering where that leaves those of us who still prefer human company. Increasingly, we seem to be the awkward ones, the ones who don’t kneel to greet passing labradoodles or maintain a separate Instagram account for our pets. The ones who dare to prefer human conversation to pet companionship.Dog play afternoon: dachshunds overrun Hyde Park for Christmas walkRead moreDogs are loyal, affectionate, non-judgmental. They don’t argue or forget to text back. Yet there’s an awful lot of emotional heavy-lifting we’ve assigned them. In a world that feels complicated and lonely, dogs have become our emotional support systems, our confidants, our social icebreaker and, in some cases, our replacements.I’m really hoping that humanity stages a comeback. That we rediscover the quiet joy of connection not mediated by fur or fetch. I still believe the efforts required to maintain human relationships are overall rewarded. If we give up, we are fast-tracking the road to silo solos, made up of Karens and Kevins who never learned about give and take between humans.So for now, if you see me in the lift, politely avoiding the dog in the designer raincoat, be kind. That look on my face is me wondering whether it’s the world, not me, that’s gone barking mad.Farhana Dawood is a journalist and academic. As a journalist she has worked for the BBC, ABC and SBS.

It’s been a wild ride to get hereBen CollinsMy transformation was most apparent the day I realised that a digital rectal examination can be life-savingThu 1 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.06 ESTShareFor the past four years I’ve been breaking every rule of appropriate, normal behaviour. I’ve poked, probed, inserted, stabbed and cut people in their most intimate body parts. I’ve examined dissected bodies and riffled through a bucket of human hearts. I’ve been baptised in every bodily fluid known; dodged spurting blood, spilt oozing pus and been caught out by the force of amniotic fluid erupting from a caesarean section.Studying medicine at the age of 47, I realised in my first semester that this was not going to be like my previous experiences. Feelings of fear and ineptitude have been my almost constant companions as I was thrown into challenging situations.At first just asking a patient about her depression seemed paralysingly inappropriate. Who was I to stumble into the private world of a stranger, when I would normally simply smile and mind my own business as we passed in the street?At 47, I’m retraining to be a doctor 2,000km from home. The challenge is immense | Ben CollinsRead moreShe kindly tolerated my nervous questioning, becoming the first of many of my forgiving patients to say: “You’ve got to learn somehow.”Then came the patients willing to let me stick a large needle into their vein. And the incredibly generous women who allowed me to learn how to examine their newly born babies, causing tears all round while checking for hip dysplasia.With the onslaught of study and constantly asking patients if I could squeeze, tap, listen and feel their various body parts, I found myself becoming someone else. Searching for signs of disease through the intestines of the cadaver was just a normal Wednesday morning, and discussing how someone would prefer their death to play out was the topic for after lunch.The transformation was most apparent the day I realised that a digital rectal examination can be life-saving. Until that point I’d seditiously protested to my fellow students that sticking your finger up the patient’s arse was bad for us and worse for them. But then a urology professor showed me how it could be minimally traumatic for the patient and clinically illuminating. The prostate was hard, lumpy and asymmetrical, and even I could immediately tell this was cancer and treatment should be expedited.The terror continues now that I’m poised to start my first job and can no longer loudly assert that I am just a student, minimising the expectations of my colleagues and patients. I have not quite come to terms with calling myself a doctor because it sounds somewhat fraudulent.But I also occasionally admit to myself that I am pretty thrilled about being a junior doctor at 51. I am blown away at the momentary connections I get to share with people in the most extraordinary moments of life. I am in the front row at the birth of their children, I am there when they learn of a newly discovered brain tumour. What do you say to someone faced with their own death? I can’t speak for the patients but even in my fledgling state I feel I have been able to make some small positive contributions.Here’s what I learned in medical school – beyond the curriculum | Roland BullRead moreAnd occasionally the fog of ignorance and insecurity parts for just a moment to provide a glimpse of what it might be like to be an experienced doctor. As a student I was struck one day when a seasoned paediatrician glanced at a three-second video of subtle movement of a baby in its mother’s arms and immediately diagnosed a seizure disorder with a high risk of significant lifelong consequences. I was in awe of his skill.The experience was still just hanging on to my straining grey matter a year later in the emergency department, when I was the first to assess a baby brought in by her mother concerned about some unusual movements. She also had a short video of a momentary jerky movement. The chances of seeing this condition once were low so seeing it a second time and being able to suggest the diagnosis to my supervising doctor was maybe a fluke. But knowing I may have played a small role in getting this child treatment that could prevent a life of disability is a nice thought to hold on to.Looking back on the four years since I resigned from my previous career as a small-town journalist, I feel a mixture of excitement, pride and exhaustion. It’s been the most stressful and anxiety-ridden episode of my adult life but also such a satisfying achievement that I feel has set me up for what is hopefully a very rewarding 20-odd years of my next career.Ben Collins is a former ABC journalist in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where he grows tropical fruits, builds and sails traditional wooden boats, and will imminently be an old but junior doctorExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionHospitalsHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)commentShareReuse this content"

Today we examine how the White House’s war on vaccines has left the future of a key technology uncertain and up for grabsThu 1 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe late scientist and thinker Donald Brabenarguedthat 20th-century breakthroughs arose from scientists being free to pursue bold ideas without pressure for quick results or rigid peer review. The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines seemed to validate his claim: emergency conditions sped uptrials, relaxed regulatory sequencing and encouraged scientists to share findings before peer review. Out of that sprang one of the great scientific success stories of our age: mRNA vaccines. These use synthetic genetic code to train the immune system to defend itself against viruses. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, whose work enabled the mRNA Covid vaccine, went on to win theNobelprize. Their breakthrough suggests that loosening traditional constraints could accelerate major scientific advances.The extensive scientific and logistic infrastructure built during that period is now occupied with turning the technology towards other diseases: flu,HIVand evencancer. Until very recently, the US, which put more than $10bn into mRNA development, appeared primed to reap the scientific and commercial rewards. Despite the deregulatory zeal that birthed mRNA, the second Trump administration has rejected it. Instead, it has been remarkably steady in its commitment to the radical anti-science and anti-vaccine agenda of the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. He has spent the past year undermining and outrightsabotagingthe US’s own success. Over the summer, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a “coordinated wind-down” of federal funding for mRNA research, cancelling an additional $500m in funding for 22 projects.These cuts will be devastating. Developing safe novel therapies depends on long timelines, steady funding and – despite Braben’s thesis – predictable regulation. The abrupt US reversals signal that Washington is now an unreliable partner, willing to walk away after others have invested heavily. And when once-trusted federal agencies stoprecommendingmRNA vaccines ordeliberatelyslow approvals, the harm doubles: it undermines public confidence and cripples the system meant to keep people safe. That’s all toovisible infalling vaccinationrates in the US. The pharmaceutical industry is not a benevolent actor, but these firms want to deliver – and profit from – mRNA technology. An unstable US market makes that significantly more difficult.The future of vaccinationAlthough mRNA vaccines proved their efficacy against Covid, the next frontier remains an open question. Early lab and trial data shows that they excel at priming the immune system, though real-world results are harder to pin down. They can be made quickly, tweaked easily, and a factory that makes one kind of mRNA vaccine should – with some caveats – be able to make any other one too. This means that scientists can test huge numbers of candidates: there are hundreds of vaccines currently in clinical trials, including early-stage work on extremely difficult pathogens like HIV.So far, mRNA’s biggest impact has been on diseases that we already vaccinate against, but not very effectively. For example, flu shots are slow to develop and cumbersome to produce, a terrible match for a virus that mutates every year. In some winters, the standard flu jab protects against serious illness onlyabout 30% of the time. Recently developed mRNA flu vaccines likeModerna’s mRNA1010andPfizer’s modRNAsignificantly outperformed the standard flu jab in final-phase trials. This is another vote of confidence for the technology, but also sets up a potentially clarifying conflict with the Trump administration: the decision on US approval for those vaccines is expected in early 2026 and rests with the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research – which is run byVinay Prasad, a close ally of Mr Kennedy. A negative or stalled result would confirm just how far the administration is willing to go in its anti-mRNA crusade.Ironically, the most ambitious mRNA work has escaped the Trump administration’s notice. Companies are racing to develop personalised cancer vaccines – drawn by both the huge market and the fact that the White House doesn’t seem to view these treatments as “vaccines” at all. As a result, they’ve been largely left untouched. The development of mRNA was not just an academic enterprise. The technology advanced because firms built the infrastructure needed to turn laboratory findings into therapies. Paradoxically for a Republican president, it is this business that US policy now jeopardises.The world’s responsibilityIt will take more than a mercurial Donald Trump to destroy the US’s advantage in mRNA research and production. The technology emerged from an American university, most industry jobs are there, andnearly 75% of all manufacturingcomes out of the US (the remainder is almost entirely in the EU).However, both public and industry researchers are alarmed by the government’s actions, and bothsaythat they willtake their work elsewhereif it continues. It’s quite a leap from threatening to move to actually doing it. Given the circumstances, the UK and the EU should help them along.The EU has made the right noises on recruiting US scientists horrified by Mr Trump,with a proposed€500m from the European Commission and another €100m pledged by France. But it is only a fraction of what the US president has cut, and it remains to be seen if that money will materialise. If Mr Trump’s campaign against mRNA research continues, theforthcoming EU Biotech Actshould make it a priority for Europe to surpass the US as the world’s pre-eminent mRNA research and manufacturing centre. As a bloc, it is already comfortably in second place.The UK has a role to play as well. It is a major vaccine research power and has taken an interest in mRNA cancer therapies andpartnerships with industry. Its manufacturing ambitions have been largely focused on vaccine self-sufficiency but, with several facilitiesalready able to make vaccines, the knowhow is there to be built on.As long as Mr Kennedy is allowed to set policy, American mRNA research will be operating in a hostile environment. This is a critical moment for the technology, with a second generation of vaccines emerging and a plethora of promising long-term programmes that need support. The US underwrote much of the early success of these vaccines, but it was always a global project. The rest of the world must now see it through.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let’s hope not, but the case for moving to a proportional-representation-based system seems clear. The disillusion with Westminster, however, surely stems from the growing gap between House of Commons politics and extra-parliamentary politics in workplaces, communities and the streets. Hundreds of thousands have continued to march on Palestine in 2025. Some nods to this have been made – recognition of a Palestinian state. However, arms sales to Israel continue, as do official relations with Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, hardly a week goes by without the government finding new ways to restrict protest. In 2026, we will need to see a battle to defend democracy from above, but also crucially from below.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonIn Andy Beckett’s article, there is no mention ofYour Party. There may be a shortage of wise men/women, but the desires and the want that produced its conception won’t disappear. There will be fresh messiahs born in search of a Jerusalem that existing parties can’t deliver, as we sight the mass unemployment/pauperisation that Herod’s AI will bring for the “many”. Jobs in “fulfilment centres”, anyone? Quite rightly, the myths of the centre cannot hold, if the truth be told of our condition. We may even get an Easter rising by my grandchildren.Chris BratcherRichmond, North YorkshireIn the bleak midwinter, Andy Beckett paints a downbeat vision, but come the birds in spring again, it could look very different. The future rests in the hands of the parliamentary Labour party: they either change leader and reset, or let the crisis in democracy worsen by leavingKeir Starmerwhere he is. That would be a failure of historic proportions by the party.Michael ChandlerShoreham-by-Sea, West SussexOne point Andy Beckett missed in his interesting article is that, as I remember it, whenNigel Farageset up Reform UK, one of its main demands was for a system of proportional representation – about the only sensible policy Reform ever had. The party seems quiet about this now, though.Bill FreeSt AlbansLarry Elliott says that an economic upturn would not be guaranteed to form a reassessment of voters’ view of Labour,but continues to analyse the chances of economic recovery (Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time to turn Britain around, 24 December). There are more profound reasons for thedrop in Labour’s popularitysince the election, namely the lack of action on Gaza and the punitive approach taken to those protesting on climate and Palestine. This betrayal of trust is likely to be permanent and unaffected by the cost of housing or eggs.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, OxfordshireLarry Elliott neatly sets out the descent of Starmer’s government into deep unpopularity. He says this is “almost certainly” attributable to a “combination of factors”, which he goes on to list. But nowhere does he mention the scale of the blizzard of fake online stories reported by you last month (YouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos viewed 1.2bn times in 2025 13 December).

Sperm counts may be falling in places like the Chinese province ofHenan, which has substantial air andwater pollution, but there is limited evidence that sperm counts are falling in the developed world.In 2024,the Pew Research Centerasked women and men over 50 who never had children why they hadn’t. Around a third (31%) didn’t want them, but more prolific reasons included “it just never happened” (39%) and “didn’t find the right partner” (33%). Since 1980, the Italian maternity rate has fallen from 77% to 60%, accounting for 77% of the fall in the Italian fertility rate over that period (calculated using amicrodemographic frameworkandIstat fertility data). The demographic winter is primarily driven by a decline in people becoming parents, which is primarily driven by life milestones, including romantic ones, not being met in time.Peter Foreshaw BrookesDirector,The Centre for Family and EducationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is a political outcome that needs to be taken seriously. Despite the “British” rhetoric of the political class, and the profusion of union flags in highways and byways, the continuation of the United Kingdom in its current form cannot be taken for granted.Twentieth-century history shows us that when plurinational polities collapse, they do so fast. Crucial conditions for the collapse of plurinational polities are the weakening of pro-integration parties, and the attitudes of political elites in the majority nation. Weakening support for Labour and theConservativesanticipated in the May elections of 2026 could provide a hint that the centre may not hold.As yet, the attitude of political elites in England – politicians, civil servants and opinion formers – appears to remain very much in favour of the pro-British project. But as is rightly pointed out,Reform UKremains very much a product of the “historic ambiguity in the expression of English nationalism”. The Conservatives, more radical right than conservative these days, may also be tempted to switch registers from Britain to England.Brexit represented a moment when English nationalism switched from its habitual mode of supporting the integration of whichever polity England found itself in – the empire, the UK, the EU – to a disintegrative mode. That political energy was directed outward at the EU – with historic consequences. With the EU no longer available as a target, nationalism in England has become dominated by British nativism.But this version of Britishness may not be enough to reverse longer-term trends that point towards fragmentation and disintegration. Given this, it is time to invest Englishness with a progressive political project, and not leave it to a xenophobic British nativism.Ben WellingsAssociate professor of politics and international relations, Monash UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They knew that Enzo Maresca was attempting to engineer an exit from the club and now they were ready to call his bluff. Midnight was approaching and the fireworks at Stamford Bridge were about to erupt.A baffling story soon had a familiar, predictable ending. Maresca, who is not the first manager to run out of friends at Chelsea, had taken the provocations too far. There was surprise when he told staff that he did not want to conduct his post-match press conference after thedisappointing 2-2 draw with Bournemouthon Tuesday night. The official explanation was that Maresca was too unwell to talk in public, despite having just spent the evening coaching on the Stamford Bridge touchline, but the friction was palpable and it was never going to sit well with the Chelsea hierarchy when it took less than 24 hours for reports to emerge that the sickness line was a red herring and their head coach had actually decided not to meet the media because he needed time to consider his options. It was further confirmation that this was someone who wanted to be sacked. Maresca dared Chelsea to act and will have been the least surprised person in the world tofind himself unemployedless than a day into 2026.A timeline of Enzo Maresca at Chelsea: his highs and lows with the BluesRead moreThis is where it was heading from the moment Maresca started his rebellion against the Chelsea project after last month’s otherwiseunremarkable win over Everton. The 45-year-old was asking for trouble when he made those cryptic comments about experiencing his“worst 48 hours”at the club. Chelsea hated the volatility. After the2-2 draw with Newcastleon 20 December, one source said Maresca’s position would quickly become untenable if he kept acting up.It is not as if Chelsea had peak José Mourinho or Thomas Tuchel in charge. Maresca is talented but imperfect. He is in his third year of management and his behaviour has betrayed his inexperience. There were wry smiles when Maresca talked about his love for the fans and thumped the badge on his chest afterbeating Cardiff Citylast month. Sources have claimed that Maresca tried to use interest from Juventus and Manchester City this season as leverage for a new deal. The brazenness infuriated Chelsea.It has been a sharp decline since they were talked up as title contenders at the end of November. A subsequent run of one win in seven league games did not go down well given Maresca’s antics, while concerns over his tactical choices have grown because of Chelsea dropping 20 points from winning positions in all competitions this season. Other issues include fans struggling to warm to Maresca’s cautious, positional-based game. Chelsea have been exhilaratingly direct against tough opponents but they have often been ponderous against deep defences. They couldnot beat Ipswich last yearand have dropped points at home toBrighton, Bournemouth,Crystal PalaceandSunderlandthis season.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s Chelsea stint started strong, winning the Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season.Photograph: Dénes Erdős/APFor his part, Maresca felt a young squad was not good enough to challenge on four fronts. He did a fairly good job after replacing Mauricio Pochettino in the summer of 2024. He guided Chelsea back into the Champions League before ending his first season bywinning the Conference LeagueandClub World Cup. He leaves with Chelsea in fifth place in the league and still in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Yet cracks appeared when the Italian responded to losing Levi Colwill to a knee injury before the start of the new season by demanding a new centre-back. This is not a club where the manager calls the shots. Chelsea are not going to change a structure with a focus on buying young players on long contracts. They trust the recruitment team, Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Dave Fallows, Joe Shields and Sam Jewell. Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, is a leading voice in club strategy.Yet Maresca felt there was too much interference from above. It has emerged that his comments about not receiving support from “many people” before the Everton game related to tension over advice on load management from the medical department. Chelsea maintain that Maresca has never been told what tactics to use. The idea he had no say in recruitment is also laughed off. What Chelsea did want Maresca to do, though, was rotate. They were scarred by a heaving treatment room under Pochettino in the 2023-24 season. They modernised the medical team and tried to ensure that fragile players such as Reece James, Pedro Neto and Wesley Fofana have been able to cope with the rigours of a packed calendar.For Maresca the problem is that some of his best players are those who struggle to play multiple games in a short space of time. Cole Palmer has fallen into that category because of agroin issuethis season and Maresca faced external criticism after rotating duringdefeats to LeedsandAtalantalast month. Injuries to Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo have led to an overreliance on Moisés Caicedo and Enzo Fernández in midfield. João Pedro has had to play too much because of Liam Delap’s stop-start season.View image in fullscreenChelsea were unhappy with Enzo Maresca’s insistence of playing injury-prone players like Reece James during a packed schedule.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PABut rotation was the policy throughout Maresca’s 18 months in charge. Why only challenge it now? The theory is that Maresca, who was booed by supporters when he substituted a tiring Palmer against Bournemouth, could not handle the outside noise. Chelsea, though, were fine with him resting players if it kept them fresh. When they actually had a problem it was because James had played three full games in a week last month.Young, articulate, ambitious: why Liam Rosenior is in the frame to be Chelsea’s next manager | Michael ButlerRead moreYet Maresca dropped hints about not believing in his backup players. He questioned whether Andrey Santos was ready to start when Caicedo was suspended last month. He talked about Chelsea’s lack of experience after the draw with Newcastle. It was another red flag. It is true that Chelsea remain too inconsistent for a title challenge but they have a talented team and do not want their head coach to question it.Chelsea did not like Maresca being touted as a potential replacement for Pep Guardiola should he leave City at the end of the season. It has since emerged that Maresca informed his bosses that he had spoken to people associated with City about replacing Guardiola on three occasions this season. The pieces have fallen into place.Timing is everything: Chelsea visit City without Maresca on Sunday. They arelikely to turn to Liam Rosenior, manager of Strasbourg, their partner club. When it comes to the PR war, Maresca’s supporters will argue that Pochettino, Tuchel and Graham Potter all struggled to work within Chelsea’s setup since the takeover by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, the private equity firm run by Eghbali and José E. Feliciano.But Maresca toed the line until it was convenient to do otherwise. He had just led Leicester to the Championship title when Chelsea came calling. His stock is higher now and he is hoping to capitalise. Time will tell if Maresca, seen as a mini Guardiola, has played the game well enough. Wherever his career takes him next, though, Chelsea have no regret over seeing him go.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was a little after half past nine on the first evening of the year, and already the throngs were streaming out of Alexandra Palace and back down the hill, convinced beyond any fraction of a doubt that they had just seen the next few years of darts take shape.Gary Anderson and Ryan Searle show class and surge into world darts semisRead moreBarely an hour of time on the oche, barely a couple of hours in total, was all it took for Van Veen andLuke Littlerto secure their passages to the semi-finals of the world championship. Different tests, with a different weight of history on each, and yet negotiated in much the same fashion: while Littler smashed Krzysztof Ratajski 5-0, Van Veen crushed the 2024 champion, Luke Humphries, 5-1 to continue his own inexorable ascent towards the summit of darts.And so a rivalry forged in the youth ranks of the sport comes one step closer to rejoining on the biggest stage of all. Of course, Ryan Searle and Gary Anderson will have plenty to say about that when they play Littler and Van Veen respectively in Friday’s semi-finals. But whatever happens in those games, this was the night when it felt the future of darts became its present. Certainly this was the night Van Veen, already the European champion and now the world No 3 and a Premier League lock-in, catapulted himself into genuinely elite company.A more symbolic milestone is that for the first time in two decades the Dutch No 1 is neither Raymond van Barneveld or Michael van Gerwen. A keen tennis fan, Van Veen’s eyes lit up when one journalist compared it to Carlos Alcaraz eventually surpassing Rafael Nadal. “Growing up as a Dutchman, the goal was always to be No 2, because in my head, you cannot overtake Michael van Gerwen,” he said.View image in fullscreenGian van Veen and Luke Humphries are all smiles after the Dutchman knocked out the world No 2 with a 5-1 quarter-final win.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe idea of Littler and Van Veen as the Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of their sport has a certain seductive narrative quality to it. In truth, Humphries is going nowhere for a while, Josh Rock still has plenty of gears in him and Beau Greaves has the talent to go as far as she wants. But at the very least a changing of the guard seems to have occurred, the era of Van Gerwen and Gerwyn Price and Peter Wright and Michael Smith already receding.This is a sport for the young and the hungry and ideally the childless, players with boundless energy and time amid an increasingly gruelling schedule. In which context the presence of the 55-year-old Anderson in the last four strikes a pleasing note of dissonance, a throwback to a different, more innocent age of the sport.It was Anderson who finally ended Justin Hood’s remarkable challenge in the afternoon, winning 5-2 in a game wreathed in smiles and good humour. And this has always been Anderson’s unique appeal: the sense that he’d much rather be throwing in the pub with his mates. He doesn’t need the cash. He doesn’t really practise much any more. But he’s two wins away from his third world championship: proof that while rankings fluctuate, genius endures.His friend Searle is cut from the same kind of cloth: a sublime talent who has always wanted but never really needed to win. Like Anderson, he has never been the most dedicated or driven of players. Just a couple of months ago he didn’t even bother trying to qualify for the Grand Slam because, in his words, he didn’t want “another week in a hotel room”.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler reaches out to Krzysztof Ratajski after their quarter-final.Photograph: Godfrey Pitt/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut something seems to have clicked in him here: an appreciation that now is finally the time to make good on his promise. He swept aside Jonny Clayton 5-2 in the afternoon, dropping his first two sets of the tournament in the process, and if he brings his A-game against Littler, Alexandra Palace could be treated to one of its classic semi-finals.As for Littler, it was a far more serene night’s work after the rancour and recrimination of his win against Rob Cross on Tuesday. There were a few boos waiting for him as he took the stage, but the world champion quickly won them over with a brutal, nonchalant 33-minute exhibition that included a 170 to clinch the opening set.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

Instead ­Manchester City’s winning streak came to a juddering halt as Pep ­Guardiola’s side spurned a chance to move within two points of Arsenal at the top of the table.Hats – or should that bechapeaux– off to Régis Le Bris and his clever and courageousSunderlandteam for not merely frustrating City but offering Gianluigi Donnarumma scope to remind everyone precisely why he is a world-class goalkeeper.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City players to get ‘heads up’ for visit of ChelseaRead moreAs the final whistle blew, Erling Haaland had been contained, City’s run of eight straight wins in all competitions was over and it seemed easy to see why the Stadium of Light DJ has taken to playing the Dave Clark Five’s Glad All Over shortly before kick-off.It was Haaland’s first visit to the Stadium of Light and City’s ultimately disappointing No 9 did not take long to make his presence felt. Only six minutes had passed when Haaland flicked on Rayan Cherki’s corner and Bernardo Silva’s outstretched foot did the rest.Yet as City celebrations were cut short and Sunderland’s goalkeeper Robin Roefs no longer looked quite so crestfallen, it became apparent that a linesman had detected Silva was fractionally offside. When a lengthy video assistant referee check confirmed that judgment it appeared Silva must have overextended a toe. That represented quite a reprieve for a Sunderland side that were sunk3-0 at the Etihad Stadiumin early December and, creditably, they made the very most of it.Brian Brobbey has taken time to build his fitness up since arriving from Ajax last summer but the striker showed off eye-catching strength to connect with a long ball and not so much shrug Rúben Dias off but bulldozer through the defender.Brobbey had missed two excellent chances during last Sunday’s1-1 draw with Leedsbut a fine save from Donnarumma ensured that it was not to be third time lucky for a centre-forward well aware Le Bris intends reinforcing his frontline this month.If Sunderland’s manager was impressed by Brobbey’s disruptive physicality, Le Bris must also have been quietly encouraged by his entire team’s intelligence, competitiveness and indefatigable pressing. Nordi Mukiele had, unusually, struggled against Dominic Calvert-Lewin during that Leeds visit but the former Paris Saint-Germain defender delighted in frequently subduing Haaland here.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola shows frustration on the sidelines.Photograph: Craig Cowan/ProSports/ShutterstockWhen, thanks to a clever interchange with Matheus Nunes and Phil Foden, the Norwegian finally succeeded in dodging Mukiele and his fellow minders Roefs reacted smartly to save the striker’s shot with his legs. Almost immediately Guardiola’s persistent pacing of the away technical area assumed the sort of manic intensity that was surely more about internal agitation than a riposte to the bitter Wearside chill.As the temperature plummeted it served as a reminder that a day when public transport in the north-east always shuts down for the new year holiday was hardly ideal for staging an 8pm kick-off. And especially not when visiting City fans faced an icy, three-hour, late night, trans-Pennine drive home.At least it was considerably more engrossing that your typical 0-0 draw, even if City only managed two shots on target during an opening 45 minutes that concluded with Le Bris’s right-back, Trai Hume, glancing a header narrowly over the bar following Granit Xhaka’s superior delivery.The tone-raising introduction of the fit again Rodri at the outset of the second half improved City considerably, finally breaking Sunderland’s lines and permitting Foden greater licence to attack. Yet although Savinho directed one highly inviting, Cherki conjured, chance over the crossbar before subsequently prompting Roefs into another stellar save with his legs, the visitors generally found Sunderland’s defence as opaque as Guardiola’s future.The revelation that the former Chelsea manager,Enzo Maresca, has discussedthe possibility of succeeding the Catalan - should he opt to leave Manchester this summer - with figures associated to City added an air of intrigue to proceedings.More immediately, one thing remained as crystal clear as the near full moon illuminating the Wearside skies: the word surrender is not in Sunderland’s vocabulary. Sure enough, City again had Donnarumma’s excellence to thank for a brilliant save from Eliezer Mayenda after Enzo Le Fée’s sublime pass outwitted Guardiola’s rearguard.The latter’s discomfort was compounded by the success Xhaka and friends were enjoying in disrupting his team’s customary midfield fluency. Not for the first time, Le Bris’s tactical blueprint was frustrating high-calibre opponents. At times it was hard to imagine Sunderland were missing a quartet of key first-teamers otherwise engaged at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.Not that City gave up. Jérémy Doku and Josko Gvardiol missed decent chances as they forced their hosts ever deeper, with only a series of increasingly desperate blocks and interceptions preserving one of surely the most precious points Sunderland will collect this season. Small wonder Glad All Over boomed out of the sound system at the final whistle.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Tottenham head coach was applauded back by theBrentfordfans because he will always be a hero to them. His work over a near seven-year period as their manager has seen to that.But what of the followers in his new gig, which began when he said farewell to the Gtech last summer? It is safe to say the jury remains out after this driest of January performances had the supporters in the away enclosure adapting a barb they have historically reserved for Arsenal. “Boring, boring Tottenham,” they chorused in the 85th minute.Stubborn Sunderland deny Manchester City to give Arsenal four-point cushion at topRead moreFrank’s problem over the first half of thePremier Leagueseason has been the dearth of creativity in too many games and it was the case once again. Spurs offered next to nothing as an attacking force; it was as if they did not believe they could make chances let alone score and the frustration of their fans boiled over upon the full- time whistle – shortly after a weak Richarlison cross to no one had led to howls and the flinging of arms into the sky.Now there were boos and it was all horribly edgy when Frank and the players gathered together and thought about going over. No quick fixes, he has stressed. It feels as though could be plenty more angst in the coming weeks.Brentford shaded it. They were the more forceful, proactive team, certainly in the second half; the point felt like a bad one for them even though it did not dent their fine home record under Keith Andrews. In the final analysis, they stayed above Spurs in the table.Frank, who continues to grope for the answers, was asked whether the fans understood the situation or needed to be more understanding. “That question is very difficult for me to answer, going off a few boos after the game,” he said. “As I say, I’m not really reading anything on social media or articles or all that. I watch the team. I’m very aware that we are not where I want us to be. Very aware.”Frank will always cherish what he achieved at Brentford – the promotion from the Championship; the manner in which he established the club in mid-table Premier League respectability; how his team repeatedly out-performed their budgets. He could be glimpsed on one of the big-screen montages prior to kick-off before he made his sortie on to the turf.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank embraces Mohammed Kudus after the final whistle.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersFrank’s mission was complicated by his being without eight players for various reasons – nine, if you included Brennan Johnson, who was left out of the squad as he closed in ona £35m move to Crystal Palace. The Spurs support would sing their song for him.Kevin Schade had the ball in the net for Brentford after a sixth-minute corner only to be flagged for offside and Andrews’ team pressed with intent at the outset. They tried to ask questions of Spurs with their movement in midfield.The Spurs fans wondered where the X factor might come from. Frank had felt his selection problems bite most strongly in the central midfield positions, Lucas Bergvall the latest absentee with what the club believe is a minor injury. The head coach does not seem to like João Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur as a pairing in front of the back four but he had no option but to use them. Archie Gray, the only other available central midfielder, was asked to play as the No 10.Gray had hesitated in the early running when well-placed, eventually seeing his shot blocked and Spurs’ only real flicker before the interval came on the half-hour when Richarlison returned a deep Palhinha cross for Gray in the middle. His header hit Nathan Collins and Richarlison volleyed the rebound past the far post.Tom Cairney earns Fulham a point at Crystal Palace with late levellerRead moreBrentford did not create much themselves in the first half but they pushed after the restart. Keane Lewis-Potter swiped at a low cross – the connection was not there – while Vitaly Janelt worked Guglielmo Vicario with a header from Jordan Henderson’s cross. In between times, Cristian Romero got away with a misjudged last-man tackle on Igor Thiago. The Spurs captain missed the ball and then seemed to handle while on the ground. He also missed Thiago and yet he surely served to get in his way. Andrews said it ought to have been a red card.When the Spurs support chanted again for Johnson in the 70th minute, it was easy to get the wistful vibes. Where was the runner in this team to get in behind, to stretch the opposition? It was a tough watch; too many unconvincing touches from their players and unforced errors, not enough cohesion. Frank talked up the clean sheet and defensive solidity. It is not enough.Gray shouted in vain for a penalty on 57 minutes after a risky lunge from Schade but Spurs never looked like scoring and their fans knew it. Richarlison had a late shot and it was the definition of tame. The consolation for Spurs was that it was not worse. It might have been had Thiago not lifted high after good work by Michael Kayode in the 69th minute.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

You’d hear it from the old pros who sensed a poor wicket or a downpour, because it meant they would get more time off. Well, England and Australia have certainly adhered to that saying.There’s another one you hear a lot in cricket these days: there’s a ball with your name on it. It frees batters up, takes the pressure off, and allows them to run down the wicket, to play scoops and ramps, in the belief that they have to be proactive because there’s a good ball round the corner. Modern batters don’t want to trust their defence and, if the world’s best players have that mindset – you hear it a lot from this England setup – you’re going to get a lot of unnecessary dismissals, leading to accelerated matches. That’s what we sawin the fourth Test, exacerbated by an unsatisfactory pitch.Sydney has a history of hosting Ashes comebacks – and launching dynasties | Geoff LemonRead moreIn Perth at the start of the series England blew a match-winning position to lose the game inside two days, and in Melbourne it was Australia’s turn. Brendon McCullum likes to talk about running towards the danger, and at the MCG his team flew towards it. As the game ended I was really not sure what I had just witnessed – how much had they improved on their previous performances, and how much had Australia allowed complacency to creep in with the series won?Either way, I was reminded of a few Ashes series that I had been involved in, in which England ended up in the kind of position they found themselves after three games of this one, with the urn lost but pride still to play for. I can tell you we were all scrapping for our lives and I was pleased to see a side full of determination and competitive spirit and delighted that they were rewarded with a victory.But there were some disappointments along the way. In particular I was frustrated to see Jacob Bethell thrown in at No 3. Obviously my opinions have been shaped by my own experiences and in my career I was elevated up the order when I was very young – but there was a method to it. I had opened in school cricket and at second XI level, but there was no way they were going to throw me into the first team at the top of the order so they put me in initially at No 6, and gave me a chance to adjust to the standard I was dealing with.They did everything they could to help me succeed and find my feet, and I feel England have done the opposite with Bethell. He’s very highly rated, plays quick bowlers well and has a good temperament, but he is also young and inexperienced. As he walked out 15 balls into England’s first innings, it felt like a really tough ask. People will counter that Test cricketistough, and you have to grab your opportunities whenever they come along. But if the selectors have faith in a young player they should be doing everything they can to help them succeed, and though Bethell may well thrive at No 3 it will be in spite of not because of them.In that second innings, as England chased down a small total, we saw the best of Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett as an opening partnership, enjoying the clarity that comes with having a target to chase and being told to set the tone. Bethell came in (at No 4 due to Brydon Carse’s surprise elevation) and looked assured, with a good range of shots, and seems calm at the crease – a contrast with some of his predecessors at No 3 – which on a wicket like that is not easy.But the greatest bonus fromthat game was Josh Tongue. He looks to be the big success story of the talent ID system under Rob Key. He just does the basics brilliantly well: a simple run-up then delivering the ball from a high release point just past the perpendicular, which makes it really hard for a right-hander to line him up.View image in fullscreenJosh Tongue (centre) took seven wickets in Melbourne and could prove one of the big successes of the tour.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PABrydon Carse deserves credit for coming back after the punishment he’s taken in this series, when he’s bowled all over the place and gone round the park, and for rediscovering what a good length is, the length where the batter is thinking about coming forward but the ball is full enough to threaten the top of the stumps. Especially with Gus Atkinson getting injured, those were big positives for England.It looks like Matt Potts will come in for the last game, a player with a reputation as a very hard worker, very fit, conscientious about his cricket. But his lack of match practice makes an already difficult ask even harder. Let’s hope he can learn from watching Pat Cummins in Adelaide, returning after a lengthy period of not bowling in matches and hitting his straps very quickly.If I were David Saker, England’s bowling coach, I would be wanting to know what Australia did to help Cummins bounce back with no match practice – though obviously their captain is a proven world-class performer with a massive resource of experience to draw on. Hopefully Potts can be relied upon to run in and bowl that fuller, top-of-the-stumps length.After winning in Melbourne, Ben Stokes referred to the brilliant job the management, coaches and support staff had done to help the team shake off the narrative around their trip to Noosa and concentrate on cricket. Well, we can admire that to a degree, but it’s tinged with the knowledge that this was a situation of their own making. There’s no one else to blame here.The players were told, in the middle of the biggest series of their lives, to let their hair down and enjoy a lads’ trip by the sea, and the negative headlines that followed were in effect written by England’s coaches and management. The whole thing was very hard to comprehend. So great, England won at the MCG despite a lot of bad press, but it was a mess entirely of their own making.And so we move to Sydney, and a chance to end this often bewildering and disappointing tour on a high. The destiny of the urn has been decided, but when it comes to the future of this England setup and those responsible for it, it’s all to play for.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketEngland cricket teamAustralia sportAustralia cricket teamcommentShareReuse this content"

Leeds succeeded in stifling and frustrating Liverpool as the first goalless draw of Arne Slot’s reign underlined the limitations that linger behind thePremier Leaguechampions’ recent recovery.A drab scoreless draw, the first in 84Liverpoolgames under Slot, owed much to the defensive excellence of Jaka Bijol and Pascal Struijk as Daniel Farke’s depleted visitors extended their unbeaten run to six matches and moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. But Liverpool’s contribution to a meagre spectacle was significant too.Liverpool v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead moreShort on ideas against Leeds’s low block, lacking urgency plus a clear attacking structure in the closing stages, Slot’s side toiled for much of the contest. There was a smattering of boos as the final whistle sounded on a ponderous performance and Slot’s post-match demeanour was not in keeping with an eighth match without defeat. “We had a lot of ball possession but that doesn’t mean a lot if you can’t create a lot of chances,” admitted the Liverpool head coach.Farke sprang a surprise by leaving Dominic Calvert-Lewin out of his starting lineup. The in-form forward had scored seven goals in six games but, given his injury record, the Leeds manager took no chances with a player who has become integral to this season’s ambitions. That sensible approach was undermined by the limited contribution of Calvert-Lewin’s replacement, Lukas Nmecha, for the 70 minutes he was on the pitch before the pair swapped places again. Calvert-Lewin scored shortly after his late introduction but, having beaten Alisson from close range, the striker’s celebrations were derailed by a correct offside call.Liverpool struggled when Farke switched to 4-3-3 during the recent 3-3 draw at Elland Road. Containment was the priority at Anfield with a 3-5-2 formation and, a few Hugo Ekitiké scares aside, Leeds delivered. Liverpool dominated possession with Jeremie Frimpong prominent on the right. There was more zip and precision to Liverpool’s play than of late – initially at least – but clearcut chances were limited throughout.View image in fullscreenLeeds’s Lukas Nmecha tussles with Virgil van Dijk.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PALeeds were almost caught out by Ibrahima Konaté’s long ball. Ekitike sprinted clear of Bijol, who held the forward as he advanced into the area. Ekitiké stayed on his feet and squared to Florian Wirtz, who was denied by an important interception by James Justin. The striker’s appeals for a spot-kick were dismissed. The penalty was not given, Slot said, “because he stayed on his feet. If he had fallen down it would probably have been a penalty but I can see why he didn’t because so many times this season we were fouled in the box and did not get a penalty.”Ekitiké’s mood was not helped by failing to hit the target with his best opportunity. After Frimpong retrieved an Andy Robertson cross and pinged a ball back into the Leeds’s six-yard box, the striker miscued a header that struck Lucas Perri while facing an open goal. Frimpong’s cross arrived at pace and Ekitiké was probably surprised that it reached him, but a player of his quality would expect to score.Leeds’s clearest chance arrived courtesy of an Alisson mistake. The Liverpool keeper sprayed a clearance straight to Ethan Ampadu, an effective disruptor, who sent a first time shot back down the centre of goal. The Brazilian recovered in time to spare his own blushes. A consolation for Alisson, and they were thin on the ground overall, was the 100th clean sheet of his Liverpool league career. He became only the fifth goalkeeper in the club’s rich history to reach that milestone after Ray Clemence, Bruce Grobbelaar, Pepe Reina and Elisha Scott.The contest descended into a scrappy affair, low on quality and incident. Dominik Szoboszlai tested Perri from distance. The keeper parried his effort and Ampadu handled while attempting to clear the rebound, gifting Liverpool a free-kick 19 yards out. Wirtz’s lame effort, clipped straight into the Leeds wall, encapsulated proceedings. Ampadu was booked for the handball and will miss Sunday’s game against Manchester United through suspension.Slot made a triple substitution in the 66th minute to inject more urgency into the Liverpool display. Moments later Virgil van Dijk almost marked the eighth anniversary of officially signing for Liverpool by heading his team in front from a Szoboszlai corner. A textbook header bounced just wide of Perri’s top corner. Leeds were dangerous in the closing stages and, after Calvert-Lewin’s disallowed effort, Anton Stach shot wastefully over. A New Year’s Day to forget.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Wales forward will add some much-needed firepower to Palace’s faltering attack, with the FA Cup winners also pursuing another striker to provide some back-up for Mateta, having registered their interest in 19-year-old Sidiki Cherif from Angers.Mateta – so often the player who sets the tone for Palace – has been labouring in recent weeks but took his goal brilliantly. However, they could not kill off a spiritedFulhamside who were nine points behind their London rivals when they were beaten at Craven Cottage in early December and now found themselves trailing only on goal difference.Both sides were unchanged after experiencing a contrasting few weeks, with Fulham having recorded three straightPremier Leaguewins since their last meeting to ease themselves away from any relegation peril. Silva insisted this week that their recent success would not affect their “clear plan” for the January window, with another striker a major priority given Rodrigo Muniz is not due back from injury until next month.They enjoyed some threatening moments during an opening period that was strangely lacking in intensity but couldn’t make the most of a couple of decent chances. The in-form Harry Wilson forced Henderson into action for the first time but Raúl Jiménez could only scuff the rebound wide.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta (right) gives Crystal Palace the lead at Selhurst Park.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAPalace had to wait until the 32nd minute for their first sight of goal when Marc Guéhi was denied from close range by Bernd Leno. They were given a helping hand when Jorge Cuenca went down with a head injury after a challenge from Justin Devenny when there had appeared to be minimal contact. He was ordered off for treatment by referee Tony Harrington and could only watch from the sidelines as Nathaniel Clyne was able to pick out Mateta at the far post, with Silva looking less than amused at what he felt was an overzealous application of the rules.“It was a strange decision,” said the Fulham manager. “We should not have been playing with 10 men in that moment because our player was in a condition to keep going.” His mood would have soured further if Clyne and Will Hughes had taken their chances to extend Palace’s lead before the break. A hamstring injury to Kenny Tete forced Fulham into an early change in the second half before Hughes was also forced off to add to Glasner’s injury concerns.Mateta should have been more alert to convert a clever pass from the outstanding Yeremy Pino that would have given Palace breathing space. Jiménez almost made them pay when his header from Antonee Robinson’s cross struck a post. Leno was fortunate to escape when he pushed the ball onto the bar after an initial mistake and Guéhi somehow blocked teammate Maxence Lacroix’s effort on the line.It proved to be a crucial moment as Fulham eventually found their equaliser after a combination between Robinson, Wilson and Cairney’s brilliant finish with his left foot that was celebrated with a double fist pump from Silva. Timothy Castagne should have settled it only to be denied by a diving Henderson before Andersen was left with his head in his hands when his shot with virtually the last kick of the match sailed into the stands.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I thought we certainly did enough to win the game but without doing everything that we probably wanted to do to be honest.”At Pride Park, Boro were punished for failing to take their chances as Bobby Clark fired the Rams to victory. The visitors dominated the game but lacked a ruthless edge inside the box and Clark took advantage with a second-half winner. The midfielder showed the composure with his finish that Boro craved to earn Derby a first home win since 4 November and condemn the visitors to a third defeat in four matches.“For the moment, football is very, very cruel to us and we have to sort it out and turn it around,” said Boro’s head coach Kim Hellberg. “I am very happy with how we performed, the first 60 minutes we were very good and created a lot of opportunities and we should have killed that game off. But we didn’t and then you know that in this league you cannot keep a very good team from not creating anything at home.”Joe Rankin-Costello opened his goal account forCharltonas they drew 1-1 with leadersCoventryat The Valley.

It was 3-0 five minutes after the break, thanks to Scott Twine’s first-time, left-footed shot from 10 yards from a Neto Borges cross. More calamitous defending saw Sinclair Armstrong slot home the fourth from close range nine minutes later and an unstoppable Armstrong drive, rifled home in stoppage time, completed the rout.Tom Ince’s first league hat-trick in a decade gaveWatfordan emphatic 3-0 victory over a dismalBirminghamside at Vicarage Road and continued his side’s surge towards the Championship automatic promotion places.

She has three Frauen Bundesliga goals this season and sparked Bayern’s comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League. After making her senior debut for Germany in November 2024, she will be looking to establish herself as a regular for their upcoming 2027 World Cup qualifiers.Giulia Galli, Roma and Italy (17):Galli is widely regarded as one of the best young Italian talents to emerge for a long time and became Roma’s youngest player to make her Serie A debut in May 2024, aged 16 and one month. Establishing herself in the senior squad this season, she scored her first club goal in September and has featured in the Champions League. After starring in Italy’s sensational run to the semi-finals of last summer’s Under-17 Euros, the talented forward played a significant role at the subsequent Under-17 World Cup, picking up the bronze boot. She will surely feature at this autumn’s Under-20 World Cup.Fridah Mukoma, Kansas City Current and Zambia (19):Mukoma is yet to feature for Kansas City Current since joining in March but she is one of the latest exciting Zambian talents. She signed for the National Women’s Soccer League club for an undisclosed fee from Zesco Ndola Girls before heading to Beijing Jingtan on loan. The striker made an immediate impact after making her debut at international level, winning the golden boot as Zambia won the 2024 Cosafa Women’s Championship (southern Africa’s regional tournament) and will be one to watch at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations.Daniela Galic, Vittsjö and Australia (19):Galic is an attacking midfielder who has shown plenty of potential. Currently playing in Sweden at Vittsjö, she made her mark on the second half of the 2025 Damallsvenskan season, immediately becoming a regular starter and registering four goals and three assists in 13 appearances. She has yet to make an appearance for Joe Montemurro’s Matildas but, with a successful Young Matildas career under her belt, she will have one eye on trying to force her way into the squad for a home Asian Cup this March.View image in fullscreenPaula Comendador has stepped up to Real Madrid’s senior team as a teenager after demonstrating a proven ability to score in age-group football.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockPaula Comendador, Real Madrid and Spain (18):Comendador has consistently been one of the most prolific goalscorers in youth football. Her exploits with Spain at both under-17 and under-19 level – including a silver medal, golden boot and silver ball at the 2024 Under-17 Women’s World Cup – are an indication of the depth of her talent. She moved up to the Real Madrid senior team in July and has predominantly featured from the bench this season. She should add to her experience with an Under-20 World Cup later this year and a senior debut forLa Rojawill surely not be too far away.Montserrat Saldívar, Club América and Mexico (19):There is a strong argument to say that Saldívar has already broken out in Mexico. Since making her debut for Club América at 14, she has racked up more than 100 appearances for the Liga MX Femenil side. The winger has played an integral role in Mexico’s recent progress at youth level, ever-present in their run to the round of 16 at the 2024 Under-20 World Cup and scoring eight goals as they secured the silver medal at last summer’s Concacaf Under-20 Championship. Her senior debut came in October 2024 and with the opportunity to play in another Under-20 World Cup and first Concacaf Women’s Championship, where qualification for the 2027 World Cup is up for grabs, the next 12 months could prove even more significant.Wassa Sangaré, London City Lionesses and France (19):Sangaré’s bright start to life in the Women’s Super League has certainly been noticed after the young French international joined London City Lionesses on loan from OL Lyonnes. The talented central defender has adjusted well to the demands of the top English league, establishing her place with nine consecutive league starts. Her success at youth level for France – winning the 2023 Under-17 Euros and reaching the semi-finals of the under-19 tournament the subsequent year – led to her making her senior debut in the Nations League third-place playoff victory over Sweden in early December.Kaylee Hunter, AFC Toronto and Canada (17):The launch of Canada’s Northern Super League in 2025 allowed the spotlight to be shone on some of Canada’s emerging talents. One of the leading lights is Hunter, who was at the heart of AFC Toronto’s success in winning the inaugural NSL Supporters’ Shield, for topping the regular-season table, and reaching the final. A talented forward, she finished second-top scorer with 14 goals and was named rookie of the year. Her performances caught the eye of Canada’s head coach, Casey Stoney, and she received her first call-up in October but is yet to make her debut.View image in fullscreenLucia Kendall’s excellent end to 2025 included scoring a first senior England goal.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockLucia Kendall, Aston Villa and England (21):It has been a whirlwind three months for Kendall, who has found herself propelled into the spotlight at the highest level. After making the move from Southampton to Aston Villa and the WSL, her impressive performances at the heart of midfield caught the eye of Sarina Wiegman. A debut followed in the Lionesses’ victory over Australia back in October where she put in a player-of-the-match performance. In the following camp, she scored her first England goal against Ghana at St Mary’s Stadium, the home of her childhood club, where she had played for a decade. Kendall will surely play an integral role in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers as she looks to cement her role within the setup.Trinity Armstrong, San Diego Wave and USA (18):Armstrong’s debut season in the NWSL could not have gone much better. The centre-back established herself as a mainstay in Jonas Eidevall’s San Diego Wave side as they made a run for the playoffs. Mature beyond her years, she made 23 regular-season appearances and scored one goal. She has represented the USA from under-15 level and was ever-present in their third-place finish at the 2024 Under-17 World Cup. Her performances will have no doubt put her on Emma Hayes’s radar as she continues to bring young players into the senior fold.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

Thomas Byrnes, chief executive of MarketImpact, a consultancy for the humanitarian sector, has been tracking aid cuts throughout the past year and said the $2bn was significantly less than the $3.38bn in funds given by the US to the UN in 2025, all of which was provided under the previous Biden administration.“This is a carefully staged political announcement that obscures more than it reveals,” said Byrnes.He said the contribution was better than nothing but that it would have a limited impact in the context of other US decisions, includingcutting $5bn in foreign assistance already approved by Congressas “woke, weaponised and wasteful spending” and a proposal toend support for peacekeepingmissions – for which italready owes the United Nations $1.5bn.Death by aid cuts: how a decision in the US led to the loss of a mother in YemenRead moreByrnes suggested that channelling the money through Ocha may be less about partnership and more an attempt to centralise control and have one UN body on which to make demands about how aid should be distributed.Patz shared that concern and said he was worried about whether the money would even materialise if the UN failed to meet the expectations set out by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,to “cut bloat, remove duplication”.“I would be cautious,” he said. “This is $2bn promised, but not $2bn given.”Explore more on these topicsAidAid cutsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUnited NationsUSAIDUS politicsHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

Its latest accounts, as has been the case in recent years, exempts the names of a number of entities receiving grants.The accounts state: “The trust considers that further reporting will expose the recipients to serious prejudice and impair the furtherance of their charitable activities.”Recipients who were named and who received £60,000 or more include Happy Day Ministries, Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association, Waterlife Recovery Trust, Cliftonville Community Centre, Inside Job/Beating Time, Living Room, Mustard Tree and Not Beyond Redemption.Two recipients of grants – totalling £1,150,000 – were exempted from disclosure in the accounts filed to Companies House. A total of 98 grants were issued in 2024, compared with 69 in the previous year.The trust was committed to £7.4m of grants at the end of 2024, which included some carrying over from the previous year. The trust gave £5.27m in grants in 2022.The Sackler Trust continues to be chaired by Dame Theresa Sackler, a former trustee of the V&Awho saton the Purdue board from 1993-2018. She is the widow ofMortimer Sackler, one of the three brothers who ran Purdue Pharma.Dame Theresa’s children – Michael, Marissa and Sophia – are trustees of the family charity, which has assets totalling £50m.A US judgesaid in Novemberhe would approve Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.The deal, overseen by the US bankruptcy judge Sean Lane, would require some of the multibillionaire members of the semi-reclusive Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7bn (£5bn) and give up ownership of the Connecticut-based company.Members of the Sackler family who own the privately held Purdue, which now-deceased members of the family grew into a specialist in pain treatment in the early 1990s, became philanthropists using the huge profits generated by sales of OxyContin.The Sackler family’s reputationtook a divewhen investigative journalism and activism exposed the company’s expansionist drive toincrease prescriptionsof the opioid despite growing addiction and deaths across the US. While the Sacklers have donated millions over the years to charitable interests, some have accused them of using the giving of money as a means of “reputation laundering”.The Sackler Trust has been approached for comment.At the time of its move to pause the trust’s giving, Dame Theresa said in a statement issued on behalf of the trustees: “I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.”Explore more on these topicsCharitiesVoluntary sectorOpioids crisisDrugsPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

She was surprised and thrilled at the great care many had clearly taken.Taylor said: “Some have included old cut-out pictures which people used to collect and send in letters. Some have drawn pictures or made collages. Many expressed their sadness at the ending of the postal service and the removal of the postboxes.”View image in fullscreenMany responses detailed people’s memories associated with the now-closed postal service.Photograph: The GuardianOne writer included a map marking the last three postboxes in her town. “She talks about being a child on holiday – the process of finding the right postcard to send, thinking about what to write and finding the post office to buy a stamp and send the card,” said Taylor.The writer told Taylor: “Receiving mail was even more exciting, especially post from abroad with different stamps and postmarks. I feel it’s a shame that the generations to come will never be able to send or receive a handwritten card or letter”.Another writer described the excitement of receiving letters from her mother’s sister in Norway. Taylor said: “Before she could read, she recognised her aunt’s handwriting when a letter arrived.“The family gathered round the kitchen table (she uses the now well-known Danish word ‘hygge’) with the smell of the coffee while her mother read the letter to the family. The mother’s voice was warm and her Norwegian accent clear. Now, the writer reflects how much her mother must have missed her sister and her homeland.”The same writer recalls emptying her childhood home where the family had lived for 60 years, and finding carefully saved letters from her mother to her father. She has not read them because she feels they should remain private.View image in fullscreenTaylor hopes to display the artwork she made from the letters in the UK and Denmark.Photograph: The GuardianA 67-year-old woman described receiving thousands of letters throughout her life. Taylor said: “She talks about looking out longingly for the postman as a teenager. She had pen pals across the world and has stayed in touch with some of them throughout her life. She writes to a prisoner in America with a life sentence.”Another writer talked about the Danish writer and philosopher Villy Sørensen, who created a short story called The Missing Letters in which people had stopped writing letters.Taylor said: “Now, it’s become a reality. The last handwritten letter the writer received was several years ago from an old school friend. The post office and all the postboxes near her have all now gone.”Taylor’s previous work has included sets of tiny envelopes made with second world war love letters and large installations of paper poppies.The Danish letters and their envelopes are to be used in a new artwork called Med Venlig Hilsen (With Kind Regards), which Taylor hopes to display in the UK andDenmark.Explore more on these topicsArtPostal serviceDenmarkEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He stops at a gnarled trunk, its bark split and peeling from months of unrelenting heat.He points out that the branches should be sagging under the weight of ripening fruit, but instead they stretch upward, nearly bare, with only a few shrivelled olives clinging to the withered stems.Zoubi has tended these trees for almost two decades, learning their rhythms through seasons of abundance and scarcity. But nothing prepared him for this harvest.“I’ve never experienced anything like this before,” he tells the Guardian as he surveys the damage. “We’ve lost more than half of our crop before the harvest even started.”View image in fullscreenAncient olive trees in Irbid endure another season of low rainfall and rising temperatures.Photograph: Mohammad ErsanHis story has become familiar across Jordan’s olive-growing heartland. The country is facing its weakest olive oil season in four decades, with production down as much as 70% compared with last year. In a typical year, the olive-picking season begins in late September, and mills start processing by mid-October. This year, the harvest did not begin until early November.According to the National Agricultural Research Center, the crisis threatens a sector thatsupports 80,000 familiesand generates more than $1.4bn (£1bn) for Jordan’s economy annually. With an estimated 12 million productive olive trees concentrated in the northern regions of Irbid, Ajloun, Jerash and Mafraq, olive cultivation has been the backbone of rural life for generations. Jordan has long achieved near-total self-sufficiency in olive oil production, covering 98% of domestic needs and generating export revenue. That independence now hangs in the balance.View image in fullscreenA farmer presses olives in Irbid during one of Jordan’s weakest olive harvests in decades.Photograph: Mohammad ErsanIn the hardest-hit northern regions, output has collapsed to just 10% of the average200,000 tonnesthat typically yield 30,000 tonnes of oil. Prices have soared accordingly, with 20-litre containers of olive oilnow fetching $190, up from $140 previously, while 16kg tins have reached 140 Jordanian dinars ($197) – a 40% increase over the normal range.“This year,temperatures were 10-15C above average, delaying the winter harvest and affecting nearly every agricultural sector,” says Mahmoud al-Auran, the director of the Jordanian Farmers Union.‘We cannot do it the way our fathers did’: farmers across Europe struggle to adapt to the climate crisisRead moreClimate records from the Jordanian meteorological departmentdocumentthe severity of 2025’s conditions, including a 13-day extreme heatwave from 12-24 August, the longest on record for the kingdom.The 2024-25 rainfall season delivered a further blow, with precipitation levels ranging from just15% of seasonal averages in Aqabato 79% in parts of the southern Jordan valley. Northern and central regions received roughly 54% of normal precipitation, catastrophic for rain-fed olive groves that depend on seasonal water rather than irrigation systems.“Olive trees here depend on rain to grow, not chemical fertilisers,” Auran explains. “Heat and drought give the trees less water, resulting in smaller fruits and oils of less quality.” The prolonged heat severely affected both fruit formation and oil composition, leaving farmers unable to compensate despite supplemental watering and fertilisers.View image in fullscreenOne of the olive presses in Irbid runs below capacity amid a steep fall in production.Photograph: Mo’men MalkawiIn response to the shortage, the government now allows West Bank visitors to bring five tins of olive oil into the kingdom, while the minister of agriculture has pledged to open imports if prices continue rising.“Olive oil is woven into the fabric of Jordanian life,” says Amal al-Ghawanmeh, the head of al-Sendyan Land Association for Environmental Development. “When production decreases, every household suffers, because families must import oil at more expensive rates, disrupting customary traditions and meals.”Fayad al-Zyoud, the chair of the Jordanian Association of Olive Producers and Exporters, says small olive groves that typically generate $5,000 in annual income now face severe losses. Women, who form the backbone of the harvest workforce, will see drastically reduced employment.“Climatic extremes have created unprecedented declines in traditional cropping systems,” Ghawanmeh says. “Rainfall has been scant and irregular, and when storms did come, little replenishment occurred in our mineral-rich soils.”Jordanian farmers are calling for drought-resistant olive varieties, improved irrigation infrastructure, and climate-smart agricultural practices.“I fear the day will come when I or my grandchildren will be forced to abandon olive farming, the work our family has lived and breathed for generations,” says Zoubi. “Without real support, these trees may not survive … and neither will our way of life.”This article is published in collaboration withEgab.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisJordanMiddle East and north AfricaFood securityFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She also keeps chickens and has planted quince and peach trees and grapevines, which are watered by a stream winding down the hills towards the Indigenous community of Copiapó.But now the huge British-Australian mining multinational Rio Tintohas signed a dealto extract lithium, the “white gold” of the energy transition, from a salt flatfarther up the mountains, and she fears the project could affect the water sources of several communities in the area.“We could be left with no water,” says Rivera. “How will we plant crops or feed our animals? It will make it very hard to survive here.”View image in fullscreenThe salt flat is the ‘source of all life’, says Lesley Muñoz RiveraRio Tinto has signed ajoint venture agreementwith the state-owned copper mining company Codelco to exploit Salar de Maricunga, Chile’s second-largest salt flat, 3,760 metres (12,340ft) above sea level in the Atacama region.Lithium is a critical element for manufacturing smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles and battery storage for wind and solar farms, but its extraction is highly water-intensive.The project will pose a direct threat to the Colla Indigenous people living here, says Lesley Muñoz Rivera, secretary of the Copiapó Indigenous community.“The Maricunga salt flat is the source of all life here. Hydrological studies suggest that it is the source of our water. It’s a sacred place for us.”All commercial lithium production in Chile currently uses anevaporation method: water is pumped from natural salt lagoons into pools, where it is exposed to sunlight for 18 months, leaving behind lithium salts. Between85% and 95% of the water is lostin the process.Rio Tinto acknowledges “the sensitive environments” where it will operate and emphasises its commitment to “responsible water use” and “minimal impact on local communities and ecosystems”.The company also says it is still determining whichdirect lithium extraction(DLE) method to adopt for its early-stage projects developed in partnership with Codelco and Chile’s state-owned mining company, Enami, referring to a technique that extracts lithium from brine more quickly and then pumps the brine back into the lagoon.View image in fullscreenBrine ponds at a lithium mine in Chile’s Atacama desert. As the green transition accelerates, demand is growing for ‘white gold’ found across South America.Photograph: M Bernetti/AFP/GettyBut Cristina Dorador, a microbiologist at the University of Antofagasta who has studied Chile’s salt flats for decades, says reintroducing treated water into the Maricunga could destroy a unique and fragile ecosystem that ishome to 53 animal species.We are completely opposed to lithium extraction but … we were only asked about peripheral detailsLesley Muñoz Rivera, Indigenous leaderThis includes Andean flamingos, horned larks, rheas and guanacos, as well as 11 native plant species andprehistoric micro-organismsfound only in the Atacama salt flats.“Maricunga is a hotspot of unique flora and fauna,” Dorador says. “The reinjected brine could have traces of chemical compounds such as surfactants and detergents that could affect the whole ecosystem of the salt flat.”The southern part of the Maricunga salt flat is within a protected national park, Nevado Tres Cruces. Although lithium will be extracted from the northern part of the salt flat, Dorador says it is unrealistic to regard them as separate bodies of water. “Everything in the local ecosystem is connected,” she says.View image in fullscreenAndean flamingos at Chile’s Chaxa lagoon. Experts say the unique flora and fauna of Maricunga could be put at risk if the fragile ecosystem is damaged by lithium extraction.Photograph: ReutersRio Tinto said: “DLE supports water conservation, reduces waste and requires less land. The aim is to minimise fresh water consumption through recycling, and the use of processing and reinjection technologies that maximise the recovery of lithium with the lowest environmental footprint.”The company uses DLE at two lithium mines in north-west Argentina: its starter plant at theRincón salt flatand the Fénix project on theHombre Muerto salt flat, which it acquired through atakeover of Arcadium Lithiumthis year. Rio Tinto’s partner, Codelco, confirms it has not yet decided on the method of lithium extraction at Maricunga.The Indigenous communities in this region are still recovering from the repression they faced underAugusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, which lasted from 1973 until 1990. Rivera’s 91-year-old mother, like most of the older generation of Colla Indigenous people, was born in the Atacama mountains.During the 1970s, the military regime sold tracts of territory to landowners and banned residents from collecting firewood, which they needed to survive, forcing many Colla people to migrate to the nearest city, Copiapó. But they often returned to their mountain communities to visit older relatives or participate in ceremonies.View image in fullscreen‘We could be left with no water,’ says Miriam Rivera Bordones (second from right), making crafts with other women from the Indigenous community of Copiapó.Photograph: Grace LivingstoneSince democracy was restored in 1990, Colla people have been reclaiming their ancestral lands and rebuilding their villages. Rivera lived in this desert community until she was six, then moved to the city. She returned 15 years ago. The Copiapó community has a museum that showcases its struggle for survival and justice, and Rivera is building a guesthouse there.Muñoz says: “The idea is to have Indigenous-run sustainable tourism, which will safeguard the environment and sustain our communities.”However, she believes this could all be threatened by commercial-scale lithium mining. As well as the Maricunga contract,Rio Tinto has been selectedas the preferred partner to extract lithium from another salt flat in the Atacama region,Altoandinos, with Enami.View image in fullscreen‘Sacred territories,’ says Cindy Quevedo, of her environment.Photograph: Grace LivingstoneSix local communities, including Copiapó, were invited to participate in a consultation over the Maricunga project, but Muñoz says this was just window-dressing. “We are completely opposed to lithium extraction, but there was no opportunity to say that,” she says. “The project’s going ahead whether we like it or not. We were only asked about peripheral details.”Across the wider Copiapó region, 24 other Colla communities also allege they have not been consulted. Cindy Quevedo, president of the Finca Chañar Indigenous community, is angry that she has had no say about a project on her ancestral lands.“Our biggest worry is the impact on water because Atacama is the most arid place on Earth,” she says. “And these are sacred territories for us; places where our great-grandparents prayed, made offerings and performed ceremonies. It hurts me so much that this land is being destroyed.”Only 10% of the local Indigenous population have been consulted about this lithium project, says Isabel Godoy, from the National Council of the Colla People. The council has launched a legal challenge to expand the consultation process.“We want our views to be heard. We won’t benefit from this; we don’t use expensive electric vehicles, it’s not going to improve our quality of life, and we’ll just be left with the rubbish,” she says, adding: “When you take the water from a territory, you destroy it.”View image in fullscreenA lithium-processing plant near Antofagasta, Chile. ‘We won’t benefit from this,’ says one Indigenous woman. ‘We’ll just be left with the rubbish.’Photograph: M Zegers/NYT/Redux/eyevineCodelco says the six communities within the project’s area of influence are being consulted. It added: “We value dialogue with all original peoples. Respect for ancestral territories and Indigenous rights are an essential principle of this project.”Chile has theworld’s largest lithium reservesand isthe leading producer of copper, two vital elements for renewable energy generation. Rio Tinto said: “We, along with our partners Codelco and Enami, are acutely aware of the sensitive environments where these projects are proposed to be built, especially in terms of water use, the impacts on the salt flat and the local communities.“We are committed to building strong, respectful and enduring partnerships with local communities,” the mining company said.View image in fullscreenThe Maricunga salt flat’s unique flora could face an existential threat under José Antonio Kast, who wants the private sector to take over lithium exploitation.Photograph: Rudi Sebastian/AlamyOn 11 March 2026,Chile’s new ultra-conservative president, José Antonio Kast, will be inaugurated. He advocates afaster commercialisation of lithium extraction, led by the private sector, and has announced a decree to expedite the issuance of permits, which ecologists say will weaken environmental protection and regulatory institutions.Kast has alsocriticisedChile’snational lithium strategy, in which the state plays a central role in overseeing the extraction of the critical mineral.‘The Dubai of South America’: how the promise of riches from lithium mining turned to dust in BoliviaRead moreLucio Cuenca, director of theObservatory of Latin American Environmental Conflicts, says: “The state’s role in the protection of ecosystems and the communities that inhabit them will be diminished.

And then you think, actually, we should do things in a more moral way. I think it’s going to become a more moral period.“Humans are very weird in the way they think the past was always some better place. In fact, today is pretty good and tomorrow is going to be even better.“People are basically good. Fundamentally, the instincts of humans are those of tribal primates. We like to look after each other. We like to be gentle. We really adore laughing. And we only tend to be at our roughest when resources get less.”Eden opened in 2001,with an aim to explore humans’ place in nature. The growing climate emergency was talked about but was not at the top of the agenda.Smit said: “The main inspiration was that most people didn’t realise that without plants there’s no life on earth. Effectively, theEden Projectis a monument to the importance of plants.”View image in fullscreenThe Eden Project’s biomes.Photograph: Gordon Scammell/Loop Images/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesHe said the “holy grail” at Eden was to create a “narrative arc” that made humans see the natural world as something to which they really belonged. “So if they damage the natural world, they damage themselves.”Smit said the situation was perilous. “Our winters are getting wetter our summers are getting more arid. We know just a small amount of climate tipping may create things we can’t control. Our consumer culture is incredibly damaging to our ability to forward plan.“We’re not conserving our water; we’re allowing people to poison our water. The privatisation of water was a complete mistake. It was to do with the dogma of ownership rather than the best use of things for the civic good.”But he said there was hope, including from the world of plants such as advances in theunderstanding of mycelium: the thread-like network that forms the bulk of a fungus, which can be grown into building materials and clean up contaminated environments.View image in fullscreenSmit with the seed sculpture at Eden Project.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianAbout 25 million people have visited Eden, not only to walk around its rainforest biome but to attend everything from gigs –next year’s lineupincludes the Pixies and Becky Hill – to community events.“I’ve always believed that gathering groups of people together is good,” Smit said. “It’s a spiritual experience with a small ‘s’. It’s special, hopeful.”Smit said that as an island nation one of the things vital for Britain was reliable energy.He said: “I find it utterly crazy there’s no British vision to become completely energy-independent. If you’ve got energy independence, there is nothing you cannot grow. And if there’s nothing you cannot grow, it means you’ve got two of the major planks – food and energy – under the control of your island nation. No matter what poverty you got into borrowing, you can feed yourself and rebuild and regenerate.”Country diary: Here’s the charm of the goldfinch – we want them to be near us | Mark CockerRead moreSmit was criticised in 2022 for suggesting that Cornish people are not articulate and are over fond oflooking back to imaginary “good old days”. Another of his schemes, to build an education centre for horticulture, agronomy and cookery on a hillside above the Cornish town of Lostwithielattracted fierce protestsand was rejected by councillors.But Eden has brought many millions into the Cornish economy. The organisation put the figure at £2.2bn in 2019 and will give an updated total in the new year, which it says is much bigger.There are plans to build new Edens on the seafront atMorecambe in Lancashireand inDundee, Scotland. An “Oriental Eden” isopen inQingdao, eastern China.Smit admitted that when Eden first opened its doors he resented the public coming in. “It had been our baby at the time. Now, I feel happy. I think it’s beautiful.“The real magic of the natural world is the plants have adapted and created the same leaf structures they would in the rainforest, which shows there’s a pattern, there’s a system going on. Nature knows a thing or two but the absolute joy of the Eden Project is that young people who come here feel it gives them permission to dream.”Explore more on these topicsEden ProjectPlantsConservationCornwallEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The area has more than 800 people – about 250 of them children – who are in the poorest 10th of the population of England, according to official documents.The Rev Matthew Lockwood, the leader ofBeacon church, said residents were “bewildered, angry and distraught” and risked being made homeless in a “mass dispersion of statistically some of the most vulnerable people in the country”.Chris Webb, the Labour MP for Blackpool South, is understood to have raised concerns about the scheme after an angry and emotional public meeting last month.The demolitions in the Rydal Avenue area of central Blackpool highlight Britain’s chronic shortage of affordable housing and the urgent need to improve lives in areas of entrenched poverty.View image in fullscreenPaul Kimberlin says he will ‘fight the bulldozers all the way’ to try to stop the demolition of his Blackpool home.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBlackpool council insists the project is a vital part of the “systematic and wholesale” regeneration of the town. Lynn Williams, the local authority’s leader, said: “I can’t comprehend how any community leader can say regenerating one of the most deprived areas of the country is a bad thing.”Residents have raised concerns that the demolitions will worsen the seaside town’s housing crisis by significantly reducing the number of affordable properties.Blackpool has one of the lowest levels of social housing in England – about 10% of all properties, compared with 17% nationwide. Nearly 12,000 households were on the social housing waiting list this year, according toofficial figures.The council was awarded £90m by Michael Gove, the former levelling up secretary, in March last year as part of the Homes England agenda.It plans to demolish up to 400 “poor quality” houses and replace them with 230 “high quality, energy efficient” properties, including upmarket townhouses.It said a large number of the homes to be flattened did not meet basic living standards and were unsafe, empty or overcrowded. Inspections of 679 homes found that two-thirds had a category one hazard – meaning a risk to life or serious injury – and 74% did not meet the decent homes standard.However, a masterplan for the area produced in partnership with Blackpool council in 2019 described many of the homes as “good quality” and an “excellent example of early 20th century terraced housing that has been proven suitable for a successful and sustainable residential community”.A councilimpact assessmentidentifies more than 800 people in the regeneration zone, including 50 toddlers and about 200 children aged under 15. A quarter of the residents are disabled and about 80 are over 65.Lockwood said about 300 families would be evicted under the scheme and the anxiety and “powerlessness” was exacerbating their mental distress.View image in fullscreenA quarter of the people living in the regeneration zone are disabled.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn October, a coroner ruled that the council’s forced purchase of a 34-year-old resident’s house under a separate regeneration plan had contributed to his suicide.An inquest heard that Alistair Taylor, a barber and father of four, felt “bullied, cajoled and intimidated” by the council before it seized his home to make way for a £54m education campus last year.The coroner, Alan Wilson, ruled that the compulsory purchase order played a “more than minimal role” in his death and described the council’s approach as having a “lack of focus and thought but not ill feeling”.A council spokesperson said it could not say how many of the 230 new homes would be social or affordable housing. However, they said two similar schemes had been wholly social housing and had lowered poverty levels.Williams said officials had held “dozens” of sessions for residents and had engaged with the community for nearly a year. She added: “It’s absolutely not lost on us that we are talking about people’s homes and we’re very conscious that for tenants and local residents this kind of change can be unsettling.”One of the residents due to be evicted, Paul Kimberlin, said he would fight the bulldozers “all the way”.View image in fullscreenOfficial figures show that 800 people living in the redevelopment area in Blackpool belong to the poorest 10% of the population of England.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianKimberlin, 64, bought his three-bedroom property with his partner in 2018 because they had always wanted to live by the sea.His partner died from cancer in July and the house they shared meant “everything” to him, he said, adding: “I’m suffering with depression from losing my husband and anxiety and stress from what’s going on – the council are causing me so much heartache.“This is a perfectly warm property. There’s nothing wrong with it and there’s nowhere to move to – there’s a shortage of housing in the whole country so why are they knocking 400 down to build 230?”Kimberlin said he turned down the council’s offer of the market value of his house, £96,000, plus £15,000 in compensation: “That wouldn’t buy a hovel down South Shore [in Blackpool]. It wouldn’t buy a cardboard box and if it did it would be damp.“I’m not moving so they’re going to have to drag me out of here in handcuffs”.His neighbours, Brian and Rose Timmins, said they had reluctantly agreed to leave their beloved Victorian terrace after the council offered to move them into supported accommodation.Brian, 78, said the house had been in his family since it was built a century ago: “I don’t want to move but we haven’t got much choice. There’s no damp, no cold – structurally there’s nothing wrong with these properties. The only way we planned to leave was feet first through the front door. I’ll be sad to see it go.”Another resident, who did not want to be named, said the prospect of being evicted by her landlord was “traumatic” because no properties were available for the £650 a month rent she pays for her and her four children, aged eight to 15.“We’ve been told by the council to look at private rented but all the available properties are £1,300 a month – there’s no way I can afford that. I’d like to see the area nice but if we want to come back we would have to apply and they would be far too expensive.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Some rural communities could become cut off, the Met Office said on Thursday.Ch Supt Scott McCarren, Police Scotland’s head of road policing, urged motorists to consider whether their journeys over the next few days were essential.He said: “If you need to travel, please drive to the conditions, be prepared for delays and allow extra time for your journey.“Please don’t drive through road closures. The decision to close roads is not taken lightly and is done for public safety.”The northern part of Scotland, including large parts of the Highlands and the region around Aberdeen, is expected to have the heaviest snowfall into the weekend.Met Office amber weather warnings are in place for those areas, meaning severe disruption is likely, while yellow warnings for snow and ice cover large parts of the Highlands,Northern Ireland, Wales and England.The worst of the disruption is, however, expected to have cleared by early next week, when most schools are due to reopen and people return to work.Health leaders have warned that the cold snap will place further “extraordinary pressure” on the NHS after an extremely busy winter.The UK’s Health Security Agency has issued amber cold health alerts for every region of England, which are in place until 10am next Tuesday.Dr Paul Coleman, a health protection consultant at the UKHSA, said: “The weather is forecast to be very cold across England over the coming few days.“Low temperatures like these can have serious impacts on the health of some people, particularly older people and those with serious health conditions. Exposure to cold can lead to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.“It is therefore really important, as the colder weather sets in, to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

The family dog, Hutch, also died.Shearmansmashed his way out of the stone cottage in the Cotswoldsand tried to break into his children’s bedroom from the outside to rescue them but was beaten back by the flames.He said: “I have stared at my keypad for what seems like an eternity waiting for the words to appear. I have no way to thank any of you for the unbelievable out-of-this-world generosity that you have shown to me in the darkest of hours.“My life, the lives of my loved ones, my friends and the whole community changed on Boxing Day. Most importantly, and tragically, three of the greatest humans to ever grace our presence were taken from not just me, but all of us.“I cannot begin to describe the anguish and trauma of the events of Boxing Day 2025. My family had its very core, its very essence, ripped from it in the most violent way.“While nothing can ever undo what has happened, nor can it ever make sense of the suffering, I am genuinely humbled beyond comprehension at what this [GoFundMe] page has and is doing.“My family and friends have rallied around and provided me with more than the bare essentials. I have a roof (and many offers) over my head, clothes on my back, food – most importantly company and compassion. I will heal.“I have already started the ball rolling on a plan that came to me just as I was falling past the precipice of the abyss. I WILL make sure my unbelievably talented, empathetic, compassionate and beautiful wife’s legacy of craft, design and making lives on.”Nu Shearman ran a bespoke handbag manufacturer, making fashion accessories from leather and canvas.Shearman continued: “As will I ensure that my bright spark Eve’s legacy of enjoyment from books and writing be carried on. Along with my incredible son’s sheer compassion and desire to help people.“I thank each and every one of you for your donations. I shall forever be in your debt and you will now forever be in my thoughts and prayers, hopefully I can repay in some way.“Please all take every opportunity to hug your loved ones, tell them you love them. Because, as Paulo Coelho said, one day you will wake up and there won’t be any more time to do the things you want. Do it now.”He concluded: “My heartfelt thanks to the emergency services whom tried everything to save my wonderful family. I hope they are all being looked after by their colleagues and friends. Boxing Day was horrific for all involved. Now go light up the darkest corners and the black sky. In memory of Nu. Eve. Ohner.

However, not a single one of the main childhood vaccines in England hit the target in 2024-25. There were also sharp differences in uptake across the country.In an effort to tackle the crisis, health visitors will begin offering a range of life-saving jabs to children in their own homes as part of a £2m pilot scheme starting in January.Health visitors are nurses or midwives that specialise in working with families with children under five to identify health needs as early as possible. Under the scheme, they will target families who are not signed up with a GP or who struggle with travel costs, childcare, language barriers or other issues stopping them seeing a doctor.Children will be identified by the NHS using GP records, health visitor notes and local databases, sources said. Health visitors will be trained to administer vaccines safely and have tricky conversations with parents, including those with doubts about vaccine safety.Twelve pilot areas will launch in January across five regions of England – London, the Midlands, the north-east and Yorkshire, the north-west and the south-west – aimed at boosting uptake and protecting children against diseases. If successful, the scheme will roll out everywhere in 2027.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “Every parent deserves the chance to protect their child from preventable diseases, but some families have a lot going on and that can mean they miss out.“Health visitors are already trusted faces in communities across the country. By allowing them to offer vaccinations, we’re using the relationships and expertise that already exist to reach families who need support most.“Fixing the NHS means tackling health inequalities head-on. By meeting families where they are, we’re not just boosting vaccination rates – we’re building a health service that works for everyone.”The child vaccine drive comes as the NHS remains under “extraordinary pressure” amid high rates of flu and other winter bugs.Health leaders are braced for a surgein cases in the next few days as temperatures plummet.Half a million more people in England have had the flu jab compared with the previous year. But health officials said on Wednesday it was not too late for unvaccinated people to protect themselves for the rest of winter.The move to send health visitors with vaccines direct to children’s homes comes amid serious concern about uptake in England.Only 91.9% of five-year-olds received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, the lowest level since 2010-11, according to UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data reviewed by the Guardian.Just 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, down year-on-year from 83.9% and the lowest level since 2009-10. Uptake of the first MMR dose at 24 months stood at 88.9% in 2024-25 – again the lowest figure since 2009-10.In Julya child died in Liverpool after contractingmeasles, the first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have received the necessary two shots to protect against measles.The UK is the worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the WHO: as of 2024 only89% of children had received their first MMR jab. Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine coverage having stalled or reversed, according tothe largest study of its kind.Coverage for the Hib/MenC vaccine, which protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningitis C, stood at 88.9% for five-year-olds in England, the lowest level since 2011-12.Meanwhile, uptake of the four-in-one preschool booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – was just 81.4% among five-year-olds in 2024-25.It means about one in five are unprotected when starting primary school, and represents the worst uptake since current records began in 2009-10.From Friday, a vaccine for chickenpox will be rolled out on the NHS across England.The jab, which costs about £150 at private clinics and pharmacies, will form part of a new combined immunisation on the childhood vaccination programme.Ministers hope it will not only protect some youngsters from severe complications from the virus, but also prevent parents taking time off work to look after their children if they become infected.The chickenpox vaccine – also known as the varicella jab – will form part of a new combined MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccine.It will be offered at GP practices from Friday, and is expected to offer protection to about 500,000 children every year. The MMRV will eventually replace the MMR, which is offered to babies at 12 months and 18 months.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Israeli government says entry of these items must be severely restricted because they could be exploited by Hamas or other armed groups for military ends.However, for at least a month, Israeli authorities have allowed businesses to transport multiple dual-use items intoGaza, including generators and metal pallets, which are more durable in winter rains and mud than wooden alternatives.These are now on sale in the open market in Gaza, according to military, diplomatic and humanitarian sources. They must pass through the same three tightly controlled Israeli checkpoints that currently bar shipments of these goods for aid organisations.“It seems highly improbable that the Israelis don’t know about them,” said one diplomatic source. “It’s very shocking that these things are able to enter through commercial channels.”The disparity limits the work of humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians at a time ofdesperate need, while providing lucrative opportunities to commercial traders who can secure import permits from Israeli authorities.The American commander of a new US base in southern Israel has been briefed on such dual-use restrictions. Lt Gen Patrick Frank has discussed the controls with diplomats and humanitarians at the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), which was established in October to monitor the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire and plan for Gaza’s future. His views on the matter are not known.Israel has a long track record of exploiting access to Gaza to further its political goals, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that has been monitoring controls for 20 years.“On the surface the private sector [shipments of items on the dual-use list] can appear to be very confusing and an inconsistency,” she said. “But I see it as very consistent with their policy of trying to strengthen the hand of certain actors and weaken the hand of others.”Entry controls on items such as generators did not reflect “the inherent risk or danger of the item itself”, she said. “It’s a question of: whose hands is it in? Where is it? How is it being used?”View image in fullscreenShelter is a critical need in Gaza as winter sets in  but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents ‘dual use’.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockIsraeli restrictions have long made trade into Gazaparticularly lucrativefor those Palestinians and Israelis who can secure permits. Items on the dual-use list now sell for huge premiums inside Gaza.“The only way to get a generator right now is on the private sector,” said Sam Rose, acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “There’s a mark up on that.”“My understanding is that it is the business interests on all sides – Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian – with some of the security companies that enjoy Israeli protection also taking a cut alongside other criminal elements, all in all supporting the growth of an illegal economy,” Rose added. “What’s not clear to me is whether Hamas is getting a cut. I would assume so but have not seen any confirmation of this.”Ahmed Alkhatib, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that when it came to commercial deliveries into Gaza, “You’re not just paying fees and taxes to Hamas in Gaza, you’re paying fees and taxes to merchants on the Israeli side. We all know that Gaza was and will always be a massive market for the Israeli economy.”Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, denied “preventing or delaying” aid shipments into Gaza or applying looser restrictions for commercial traders.“The policy governing the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip is approved by the political echelon in Israel and implemented by Cogat in a uniform manner vis-a-vis the UN, international organisations, donor countries, and the private sector,” a spokesperson said in a statement.For dual-use items, Israel “offers international organisations alternatives that allow and facilitate a humanitarian response”, the statement said, without providing any details. Spokesperson Shimi Zuaretz also said medical aid organisations had been given permits to bring generators into Gaza “over the last month”.The Israeli military referred questions about aid shipments into Gaza to Cogat. The US military declined to comment.The shipment controls are the latest instance of Israel weaponising aid for political and military goals in Gaza. Over the summer Israelcaused a faminein parts of the territory by blocking food shipments for weeks, then allowing only a trickle of aid to enter, killing hundreds of people.Israel this week told37 NGOs active in Gaza they would have to cease all operations within 60 days, unless they hand over detailed information on their Palestinian staff.Diplomats and humanitarian officials have said that stopping the work of the NGOs listed would have catastrophic consequences and put Palestinian lives at risk.“The EU has been clear: the NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form,” the EU humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, posted on social media. “IHL [international humanitarian law] leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need.”“The reality is that the commercial sector can bring in what it wants [now],” said Rose. “Items not approved for humanitarian organisations, such as generators, are available commercially. So we have a two-tier system, which is undermining the UN-led system, which Israel is required to support as per international law.”US forces deployed to the CMCC arrived in October prepared to launch a major logistics effort to get aid supplies into Gaza.They were surprised and confused to find the biggest challenge was political, and began clashing with Israeli counterparts over some of the restrictions almost immediately, said multiple sources briefed on meetings at the base.An early confrontation was over tent poles. Shelter is a critical need as winter sets in because Israeli attacks have destroyed nine out of 10 Palestinian homes, but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents “dual use”.US officers at the CMCC rapidly drew up a list of at least a dozen key humanitarian items they wanted removed from the dual-use list, with tent poles near the top. Weeks later Israel has not lifted restrictions on any of them.“It is clearly not security interests that are driving decision-making here,” said one western source. “The dual-use list is just another way to control what enters Gaza.”Restrictions on the type and quantity of goods allowed into Gaza long preceded the current war. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but maintained effective control of the borders and used that to impose a blockade.“It has always been a form of control over the wellbeing of the population,” said the Gisha director, Hary. “Whether that’s the bare minimum of humanitarian standards we are looking at now, or in previous years in terms of economic life, construction, industry, development in technology and agriculture and innovation.”The dual-use list, which requires a security assessment and permits to import items to Gaza, has been a particular concern since it was introduced.It is sweeping in its scope, secret until an item is rejected and has been imposed arbitrarily. Older versions obtained by Gisha through legal action include categories such as “communications equipment” – so broad it could cover most modern electronics.Items barred on dual-use grounds over the last two years include solar panels, smoke detectors, crutches, wheelchairs and walkers.Aid groups have collaborated to compile an unofficial list of rejected items in an effort to limit the amount of time and money spent applying to import things that are unlikely to get approval. But it is time consuming.International pressure on Israel over the dual-use list has also flagged over the last two years, and even with the creation of the CMCC.Diplomats are concerned about spiralling violence in the West Bank and uncertainty about long-term plans for Gaza’s reconstruction, as aid groups are negotiating possible de-registration by Israel.The dual-use list is not the only bureaucratic obstacle limiting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Some items are banned because Israel has decided they don’t address urgent humanitarian needs.This category includes paper and pencils to restart schools after two years without education for 600,000 children, and frozen beef and mutton to feed a malnourished population. Aid organisations have been limited to chicken while commercial traders have been able to bring in all kinds of meat.The limited number of crossings into Gaza and their hours of operation, as well as delays approving routes for convoys inside the territory – which is vital to ensuring they do not come under Israeli attack – all serve to slow the entry of vital supplies.Overall flows of aid into Gaza are well below levels agreed under the ceasefire, data provided by the Israeli military and analysed by theAssociated Pressshowed.Food shipments have increased enough to stave off famine, but hunger is still widespread, UN-backed food security expertssaid last week. About 1.6 million people were expected to face “crisis” levels of hunger in the next four months and if the ceasefire broke down, the territory could slip back into famine.Winter weather and lack of shelter are exacerbating the impact of long-term malnutrition, particularly on young children. At least three have been killed by hypothermia this month, the UN said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count onthe issue in their efforts todrive votes in the 2026 midterms, after makingabortion rightsthe centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followedthe fall ofRoe v Wade.In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found.PRRI’s findings mirror a September pollfrom the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.During the 2024 election, abortion was seen as the Democrats’ strongest issue, after the 2022 overturning of Roe sparked a wave of deeply unpopular state-level abortion bans.Kamala Harris put abortion rightsat the heart of her presidential campaign, while Democratic Senate candidates and Super Pacspoured an astounding $175minto abortion-related TV ads – far more than any other issue. Donald Trump, who enabled Roe’s collapseby appointing three conservative justices to the US supreme court, repeatedly tried to downplay the fight over abortion rights, viewing it as a political liability and a sure-fire boost for Democrats.Five key moments in the assault on the rights of women and girls in 2025Read moreBut the powerof the issue turned out to beoverstated in 2024. Trump handily won the popular vote and Republicans ended up with control ofboth houses of Congress. Still, the president has largely avoided further action on the issue at the federal level, focusing insteadon initiatives likecracking down on immigration,instituting steep tariffsandbulldozing the federal workforce.Thetumult has furtheryanked Americans’ attention away from abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRI’sCEO.“It’s just hard to catch your breath, because every day there’s a new, outrageous thing happening with the administration,” Deckman said. Abortion, she added, has been replaced as a top issue by affordability and the economy. “That seems to be first and foremost for everyone. But it’s also, forDemocrats, the state of democracy writ large. We consistently find that Democrats are more concerned about the health of democracy.”August polling from the group Emilys List, which champions Democratic women who support abortion rights, found that voters are now prioritizing the economy over abortion. But it also found that 49% of female voters consider threats to abortion rights to be a “dealbreaker”. Abortionremains a galvanizing issueinstate supreme court elections, which now often have the final word on the legality of state-level abortion restrictions.Advocates are currentlyworking to secure enough signatures to get abortion rights measures on the stateballots in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Virginia. Idaho, Oregon and Virginia’s proposed measures would protect abortion access, while Nebraska and Montana’s measures would eliminate it. Two states, Nevada and Missouri, have already confirmed that they will have abortion-related measures on the ballot. (Nevada passed an abortion rights measure in 2024, but it must past a second time before the constitution can be amended.)In the past, Democrats have hoped that these kinds of measures, which voters tend to support, will elevate their candidates.But in 2024, voters backed abortion rights while rejecting Democratic candidates. Trump won four states that voted in support of ballot measures that added abortion rights to their state constitutions.Some of those measures have also proven to be less gamechanging than advocates originally hoped. In 2024, Missourivoters decided to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights, making the state – which at the time banned virtually all abortions – the first state in the country to repeal a post-Roe ban. However, a protracted legal battle over the exact implications of the measure haverepeatedly blocked Missouri abortion clinicsfrom offering the procedure. Now, in 2026, voters will be asked whether they want to repeal the measure they passed just two years ago.“It just feels like such a messaging failure, to not understand and not be able to communicate that these people are going to continue to decimate abortion access,” said Alisha Dingus, executive director of the DCAbortionFund, which helps people get the procedure. “I would like to see more politicians who are more comfortable talking about abortion more regularly.”The flagging attention to abortion is having a trickle-down effect on fundraising efforts by abortion rights advocates.Donations to the DC Abortion Fund dropped precipitously in 2025, as post-Roe rage donations evaporated and economic struggles led reliable donors to stop giving.Data indicates that US abortions have increasedover the past few years, thanks in large part toonline access to abortion pills. But Dingus fears that funding will dry up for women who need to travel to clinics for abortions. Right now, the DC Abortion Fund gives out about $3,800 to dozens of people per week to support costs associated with abortions – but Dingus isn’t sure how much longer the money will last.“What I see is going off the cliff in 2026, because we can only stretch those additional dollars for so long,” Dingus said.Explore more on these topicsAbortionUS politicsDemocratsRepublicansUS supreme courtRoe v WadenewsShareReuse this content"

This goes beyond politics, it’s about the future of our country,” it said.“As business leaders and proud Australians committed to upholding our values of tolerance and mutual respect, we recognise the need for clear answers as to how the Bondi massacre could occur.”The signatories want an end to “the unprecedented harassment, intimidation and violence” directed at the Australian Jewish community since 7 October 2023, when Hamas invaded southern Israel and killed more than 1,000 people and took another 251 hostage.The incursion sparked a massive response from Israel which began bombing Gaza,killing many thousandsof Palestinians.Meanwhile, Australia’s most senior Catholics have also joined the call for a broader inquiry into antisemitism in a separate letter published on Friday.The Catholic archbishop of Perth, Timothy Costelloe, said while the Richardson review was an important step to prevent a repeat of the Bondi attack, there was a need to confront and eradicate the deeper roots of antisemitism in Australia.“It is only by shining a light into the dark corners of our society … that we can hope to unmask the antisemitism which might otherwise go unseen, unacknowledged and unaddressed,” the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference president said.“For that reason, alongside the Richardson review, some form of wider, national inquiry with sufficient authority and resourcing which can probe into the deeper issues which lie at the heart of antisemitism is needed.”The NSW government will hold a state-based royal commission, which will have the cooperation of federal agencies, the federal government has said.Albanese remained unswayed on Thursday after the human rights commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, said a national probe was “essential”.The prime minister was pressed for names after declaring he had been advised by “actual experts” to hold a departmental review.He cited Richardson as one of the experts, along with the heads of security authorities.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His client would “present a detailed account of his version of events before the court”, he added.Høiby, whose mother is the crown princess, Mette-Marit, and whose stepfather is the crown prince, Haakon, Norway’s future king, could face 10 years in prison if he is found guilty of the most serious charges.May Britt Buhaug, the secretary general of the women’s public health organisation Sanitetskvinnene, said her staff had recorded a rise in the number of women reporting experiences of domesticviolence and sexual assault, which they expected to increase further when the trial started.“Staff at our women’s health centres have seen an increase in women who make contact to ask for help and advice after experiences of violence and sexual assault. Media coverage of cases such as Høiby’s lower the threshold to ask for help. That women ask for help more easily is a positive effect. Openness breaks taboos,” said Buhaug.According to statistics from the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS), one in 10 women in Norway have experienced serious violence from an intimate partner.Buhaug said: “Although tragic, it seems that this case can contribute to break the silence around intimate partner violence and rape.”Meanwhile, an explosive new book, which Høiby unsuccessfully tried to prevent from being published, claims he has personally sold drugs on the streets of Oslo. Høiby has denied the allegations.The negative headlines appear to have energised republicans. The king is Harald V, who has been the monarch since 1991 and is now 88. Because of the law of primogeniture used until 1990, it is his second child, Haakon, who is heir to the throne and not his elder child, Märtha Louise.Craig Aaen-Stockdale, the leader of the group Norge som republikk (Norway as a republic), said its membership had more than tripled in the last two years – largely, he said because of the accusations against Høiby.“In an otherwise democratic, egalitarian and liberal country the Norwegian royal family occupies a bit of a blind spot and has traditionally seen high levels of support. However, many Norwegians are now reconsidering their position on the royal family, who were previously viewed as a relatively harmless bunch,” he said.“The ongoing omniscandal has really tarnished the reputation of the younger royals, including the future heir. In a few years we may be in a situation where the head of state has a chronically ill wife [Mette-Marit recently said she would have to have a lung transplant] and a son in prison. That is not fair on anybody.”But Torgeir Pedersen Krokfjord, a co-author of the book White Lines, Black Sheep, which published the drug allegations, said the royal family remained popular among most Norwegians and had emerged relatively unscathed.“One can only imagine how it must have been for them to deal with all this through the years, while battling health issues at the same time,” he said.The royal palace and Høiby’s lawyer have been contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Users were shunned associal pariahs or “glassholes”.Despite these setbacks tech firms are persisting with smart glasses. Apple is expected to release a cheaper version of Vision Pro later this year, but the emphasis now is on AI-enabled devices.Reports in the tech press said Apple hadpaused its planned next iteration of virtual realityin favour of wearable AI devices. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is also expected to cut back on its plans for a “metaverse”, which includes its virtual reality Quest headsets. These are less advanced than Apple’s product but at £419 each are considerably cheaper and have cornered 80% of the market.Meta confirmed last month that it was “shifting some of our investments from metaverse towards AI glasses and other wearables”.Apple has refused to comment on the reports that it is scaling back virtual reality headsets.If confirmed, the cuts to Vision Pro would represent a rare commercial flop for an Apple product.When it launched Vision Pro in 2023, Apple hoped the devices, which allow users to interact with apps using eye movements, would have the same success as Macs and iPhones.At the product launch Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “Your surroundings become an infinite canvas … Vision Pro blends digital content into the space around us. It will introduce us to spatial computing.”But consumers balked at the price tag and reviewers complained that the devices were heavy, uncomfortable andlittle more than a gimmick. There was also alarm whenusers were filmed wearing the headsetswhile driving.Even enthusiasts admit the headsets only have niche appeal and that the experience of wearing them can beisolating from other people.The limited number of apps available compared with phones and tablets is also thought to have limited interest in Vision Pro.Morgan Stanley’s tech analyst Erik Woodring summed up its problems. “We can say the cost, form factor and the lack of VisionOS native apps are the reasons why the Vision Pro never sold broadly,” he told the FT.Apple says there are 3,000 apps available for Vision Pro headsets. That is a relatively small number compared with the proliferation after the launch of the iPhone in 2007.Explore more on these topicsAppleVirtual realityComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The National Crime Agency estimates that £100bn is being laundered through or within the UK every single year, with the help of enabling entities such as law firms.The City’s poor reputation for money laundering came into focus in 2018, following an assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Paris-based global crime watchdog. Its report highlighted significant weaknesses in the UK’s anti-money laundering supervisions and called on the government to “strengthen” oversight, particularly across the accounting and legal sectors.The UK’s national risk assessment on money laundering and terrorist financing has alsoclassed the UK legal sector as “high risk”for every one of its assessments since 2017.Now, with a fresh FATF review looming in August 2027, government reforms are being pushed into a high gear. “The timing of this shift is no coincidence,” Priya Giuliani, a financial crime investigator and partner at the consultancy HKA, said.While there is currently no deadline for the changing of the guard, Giuliani said the “urgency is there for the UK to present a credible, consistent, and effective supervisory system to FATF by August 2027”.The FCA’s pending role as money-laundering supervisor for the professional services sector – which also includes accounting firms and trusts – follows a two-year government review that found inconsistent oversight, duplication across more than 20 regulators, and gaps in information shared with police. For the legal sector alone, the FCA will be taking over the responsibilities of nine supervisors, most notably the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).Giuliani says that while the SRA has historically taken a more “collaborative, guidance-led approach”, the FCA will have “sharper swords” to punish wrongdoing. The SRA has limited powers, and a £25,000 cap on fines, although larger fines can be imposed if the SRA refers firms to tribunal.In the year to April, the SRA issued 86 fines worth £1.5m under its anti-money laundering powers, with penalties ranging from £1,520 to £300,000. Its largest fine was on par with the FCA’s smallest – the latter issued six anti-money laundering fines last year, ranging from £289,000 to £39.3m and totalling £82m.The FCA’s takeover could also lead to law firms facing large hurdles to start operating in the UK, HKA said. Figures it has gathered show the FCA rejected 44% of the 275 applications it received in the 2023-24 financial year, while the SRA accepted all 218 firms that applied.“The FCA brings sharper scrutiny, broader powers, and a data-driven lens,”Giuliani said. “Legal firms must be ready.”Steve Smart, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: “Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA and we have experience in anti-money laundering supervision which we will bring to bear. We intend to take a data-led and proportionate approach – with a focus on partnering with firms to identify and disrupt crime.”Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorFinancial Conduct AuthorityCrimeNCA (National Crime Agency)RegulatorsBanks and building societiesServices sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The US oil price also fell 20% last year, to $57.42 on Wednesday from about $74 a year ago.Oil price chartThe market is awash with more crude than global industrial activity can absorb, in part due to weaker than expected economic growth in major economies and the impact of the US president Donald Trump’s trade war against China, which has dulled demand from the world’s biggest energy importer.Oil producers are expected to continue pumping excess barrels in the year ahead, which could lead prices to lows of $55 a barrel by the spring, according to analysts at BNP Paribas.Commoditiesstrategists at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs also expect Brent prices to slip into the $50s a barrel in 2026.Oil analysts at the Australian investment bank Macquarie wrote in a recent note to clients that the downward price momentum was already outstripping their weak expectations for the market, which it has previously characterised as “cartoonishly oversupplied”.Falling prices could help hard-pressed families by leading to lower fuel prices at retail forecourts, and helping to cool inflation, which has led to higher costs across the economy.Fuel retailers are under pressure from motoring and consumer groups tocut their pump pricesafter oil prices fell below $60 (£45) a barrel for the first time in almost five years last month but the price of petrol and diesel remained stubbornly high.Households in Great Britain will also face higher gas and electricity bills from this month after the energy regulator, Ofgem, announceda surprise increse to the government’s cap on energy billsfollowing predictions that the cap would fall. Instead, the cap will go up by 0.2% from January to March, equivalent to increasing the typical annual dual-fuel energy bill by £3 to £1,758.Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesCommoditiesEnergy industryPetrol pricesOpecnewsShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the best examplesByAlexis PetridisThu 1 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 13.44 ESTShare20. Maxine Nightingale – Right Back Where We Started From (1975)It’s hard to imagine anyone’s heart not being lifted a little by Right Back Where We Started From: the euphoric rush of new love rendered into three minutes of cod-northern soul (performed, unexpectedly, by various ex members of ELO, the Animals and 60s soft-poppers Honeybus). Avoid the 80s cover by Sinitta at all costs.19. CMAT – Nashville (2022)A song about fresh starts for anyone who’s made a new year resolution with no intention of sticking to it.CMATannounces her departure for Tennessee, organises a farewell party (“We’ll cry to K-pop and tequila shots”) and gives her friends presents to remember her by. One problem: she’s made the whole story of her emigration up.18. The Carpenters – We’ve Only Just Begun (1970)We’ve Only Just Begun had unpromising beginnings – a jingle on a US TV advert for a bank, opportunistically picked up on by a hit-hungry Richard Carpenter. Enter his sister, Karen, whose incredible vocal – alternately joyous and tender – transformed a song intended to flog mortgages into an authentically moving hymn to new love.View image in fullscreenRichard and Karen Carpenter on the BBC’s In Concert series.Photograph: Tony Russell/Redferns17. Astrud Gilberto – Beginnings (1969)Originally a hit for Chicago, Astrud Gilberto’s cover of Beginnings turns a fabulous song into a masterpiece: lush, funky, epic. “It’s only the beginning of what I want to feel for ever,” she coos from its tumbling drums to its exhilarating brass to her breathy, wide-eyed vocal, the whole thing sounds the way that falling in love feels.16. Joe Smooth – Promised Land (1987)Written for a primarily Black, gay audience in the teeth of the Aids epidemic, a lot of early house tracks were effectively songs of resistance and optimism. Promised Land might be the greatest of them all: the cosseting warmth of its sound underscoring its assurance that everything can and will change.15. Florence + the Machine – Dog Days Are Over (2008)A song that acknowledges new beginnings and fresh starts can be intimidating, involving dragging yourself out of your comfort zone. “You can’t carry it with you if you want to survive,” admonishes Florence Welch in what sounds like a note to self: the stridency of her tone and the thunderous power of the music seems to be pushing her on.View image in fullscreenJarvis Cocker of Pulp performing at Glastonbury, June 1995.Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns14. Pulp – Something Changed (1995)“When we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing / That in a matter of hours we’d change the way we were going”: the soundtrack for the kind of new beginning that’s not planned or resolved, the sweet, soft-hued Something Changed marvels at the wonder of life-altering coincidence.13. The The – This Is the Day (1983)The The’sSoulMining was an album recorded under the influence of the then-largely unknown drug MDMA, which possibly accounts for This Is the Day’s cocktail of fragile introspection (the verses) and fuzzy, hopeful elation (the chorus): life’s a mess, it compellingly argues, but from this point on it’s going to get better.12. Otis Clay – The Only Way Is Up (1980)Yazz’s chart-topping 1988 cover is better known, but for sheer grin-inducing punch-the-air jubilation, Mississippi vocalist Otis Clay’s original can’t be beaten. The strings are pure disco exhilaration, but the vocals are steeped in gospel: he sings like a man who’s genuinely known tough times, and can barely contain his delight that they’re over.View image in fullscreenGloria Gaynor in 1979.Photograph: Richard E Aaron/Redferns11. Gloria Gaynor – I Will Survive (1978)It’s been overplayed to within an inch of its life, but I Will Survive became ubiquitous as a queer anthem and the divorcee’s karaoke belter of choice for a reason. Its lyrics perfectly fix the emotional effort involved in picking oneself up and starting again; Gloria Gaynor sings the hell out of it.10. McAlmont and Butler – Yes (1995)A new start is made with a triumphant up-yours – lent an extra gossipy frisson by Bernard Butler’s acrimonious split from Suede – set to what may be the most glorious, dizzyingly uplifting melody of the Britpop era, delivered with the perfect blend of pathos and panache by David McAlmont. Magic.McAlmont and Butler – Yes9. Diana Ross – I’m Coming Out (1980)Disco-eraDiana Rosswas big on anthems of rebirth – see also 1979’s fantastic I Ain’t Been Licked – but I’m Coming Out is the classic: written by the Chic Organisation with her gay following in mind, the bounce in Nile Rodgers’ guitar and Bernard Edwards’ amazing bassline could make a devoted pessimist feel positive about the future.8. Bronski Beat – Smalltown Boy (1984)Like a queer analogue to the Beatles’ She’s Leaving Home, a song about new beginnings that concentrates on the reasons why one might be driven to make a fresh start. Its mood is sombre and haunted, but there’s a promise of something better beginning in its urgent dancefloor beat and instrumental middle eight.View image in fullscreenFrom left … Larry Steinbachek, Jimmy Somerville and Steve Bronski of Bronski Beat.Photograph: David Corio/Getty Images7. Peter Gabriel – Solsbury Hill (1977)In which the recently ex-frontman of Genesis reflects on his decision to quit – “my friends would think I was a nut” – and comes to the conclusion that he was absolutely right: he will, he vows “show another me”. He’s left wreathed in smiles, with a racing heart, a mood that seeps into song’s subtly, but nevertheless effortlessly uplifting music.6. David Bowie – A New Career in a New Town (1977)An instrumental that nevertheless perfectly fits its title: a tentative intro explodes into music that sounds fresh and optimistic, topped off with breezy harmonica heavily influenced by Mr Bloe’s 1970 hit Groovin’ With Mr Bloe.David Bowiereferenced it on I Can’t Give Everything Away, the leave-taking closing track on his final album, Blackstar.5. Public Image Limited – Public Image (1978)A new beginning in the most literal sense. PiL sonically heralded the arrival of post-punk, furiously excoriated the bandJohn Lydonhad left behind and loudly announced things would be different from now on: “I’m not the same as when I began … it’s my entrance, my own creation.” It’s still indecently exciting.4. Nina Simone – Feeling Good (1965)Forget Feeling Good’s grisly 21st century fate – doomed to be gormlessly belted out by sundry X Factor contestants, Michael Bublé and, dear God, the Pussycat Dolls – head to Nina Simone’s definitive reading, and gawp at its gradual, increasingly elated build from emotive a cappella intro to show-stopping, this-is-my-moment finale.3. The Beatles – Here Comes the Sun (1969)Somewhere in the hereafter, one rather imagines George Harrison allowing himself a wry chuckle at the fact that Here Comes the Sun has been streamed 1bn more times than any other Beatles track. You can see why: filled with a lovely sense of gentle cyclical renewal, it’s the musical equivalent of a reassuring hug in the face of uncertainty.2. Curtis Mayfield – Move on Up (1970)It says something about its sheer quality that a song so familiar hasn’t lost its power: from the first insistent burst of brass through Curtis Mayfield’s constantly urging lyrics – “Take nothing less than the supreme best / Do not obey rumours people say” – to its dizzying chorus, it makes striving to change sound like a blast.View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks and John McVie of Fleetwood Mac in 1977.Photograph: Richard McCaffrey/Getty Images1. Fleetwood Mac – Don’t Stop (1977)There’s a hint of well-that’s-easy-for-you-to-say about Don’t Stop: it was written by Christine McVie for her husband, John, after their marriage had broken down and she’d embarked on an affair with Fleetwood Mac’s lighting director, urging him to think of her departure as a new start. But nonetheless, it’s preposterously effective: the cantering rhythm urges you forward, the melody is buoyant, Lindsey Buckingham’s vocals and guitar alike are emphatic and persuasive, the lyrics carry no hint of the bitterness that marks Rumours’ many other songs about starting afresh, and Christine McVie’s carefree piano lines are an airy delight.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockDance musicIndieSoulDiscoCMATfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take your pick from “alien offshoot mushroom, going the gym to get slim”; “my dream house is a negative space of rock”; or, indeed, “when I was a child I wanted to be a horse, eating onions, carrots, celery”. But it’s an ostensibly more straightforward line, fromCruise Ship Designer, that seems destined to attract the most attention. “I make sure there are hidden messages in my work,” says vocalist Florence Shaw as the track draws to a conclusion, the muscular guitar riff that’s driven it along devolving into a janky, trebly scrabble.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Secret Love.Photograph: Patrick JamesonInitially, the lyric appears to characterise whatDry Cleaningdo, and Shaw in particular. From the moment they first appeared with the 2018 EP Sweet Princess, the south London quartet have attracted adjectives such as “surreal”, “enigmatic” and “inscrutable”. Most of the British bands who emerged around the same time bearing a roughly equivalent blend of post-punk guitars and spoken-word vocals sounded angry or sarcastic or straightforwardly comedic. Dry Cleaning, on the other hand, seemed mysterious. Shaw’s lyrics were collages of overheard remarks, recycled YouTube comments, lines from adverts and non sequiturs, delivered in a voice that was too icy to sound whimsical. It’s variously been characterised as “anhedonic” and “achromatic”, but might more straightforwardly be described as sounding politely bored. She occasionally shifts from speaking into singing in an untutored voice that brings to mind Stuart Moxham of Young Marble Giants’ line about their understated vocalist Alison Statton sounding “as if she was at the bus stop or something”. It was all intriguingly confusing: here were songs that could indeed contain hidden messages, that seemed like puzzles to be unpicked.But the line in Cruise Ship Designer is more complicated than a straightforward description of her artistic process. It’s delivered not by Shaw, but via her, as the song’s ghastly protagonist mouths hollow, self-regarding platitudes about his chosen profession: “Designing cruisers is, for me, a privilege and a lesson … it’s a powerful boat for a powerful mind.” In context, it seems to be mocking the idea of larding your work with hidden messages as hopelessly pretentious: and if that’s what you thinkI’mdoing, runs the subtext, you’re dead wrong.Dry Cleaning: Cruise Ship Designer – videoAnd for all the peculiar imagery (“salt, sugar, vivid dishcloths, lava skylight, mouth of hell”), the songs on Secret Love suggest that Shaw’s real skill as a songwriter may lie in something more prosaic and straightforwardly affecting than setting conundrums for listeners to unravel. When she’s not skewering the pretensions of cruise ship designers – or, rather, using the figure of a cruise ship designer to interrogate the ways people feel driven to justify their more suspect decisions – she’s very good at drawing haunting vignettes of apparently mundane lives that, on closer inspection, are spiralling out of control: the narrator of My Soul/Half Pint, who presents her refusal to clean her house as a bold feminist protest, but is far more troubled than she first appears; the influencer of Evil Evil Idiot, spouting wellness advice that’s not just useless but potentially harmful; the edgelord depicted in Blood, whose cynicism and misanthropy curdles into gory violence.The lead character inLet Me Grow and You’ll See the Fruitopens the song hymning the pleasures of a solitary day off – “no one coming along with a video call or a survey or a dick pic” – but ends it blurting out their loneliness and alienation: “The world is laughing at me, I am such a disaster.” These are songs that never just feel like someone being clever, although clearly the lyricist behind them is. Nor do they feel weird for weirdness’s sake: they have a genuine gut-level emotional impact.Dry Cleaning: ‘We bond over food a lot. It’s a big part of the band’Read moreYou could point to the sharpness and empathy of Shaw’s lyrics as one reason why Dry Cleaning stand out amid the vogue forsprechgesangindie. There is also the band’s ability to tie her lyrical flights to concise, pointed, punchy songs, and to their musical expansiveness. If vinegary distorted guitar is still their main thrust on Secret Love, the sound of the album – produced by fellow left-field traveller Cate Le Bon – ventures noticeably beyond that territory, into machine-driven 80s funk on openerHit My Head All Day; ominous sounding, slow-burn atmospherics on Evil Evil Idiot; I Need You’s synthesised drones. There’s even a hint of warped folk about the guitar figure that drives Secret Love (Concealed in a Drawing of a Boy). It all works, to powerful effect. The sense of a band who have outgrown their original remit, outstripped their initial WTF? novelty value, and are shifting confidently into new spaces, is difficult to miss.Secret Love is released on 9 JanuaryThis week Alexis listened toSharp Pins – PopafangoutThe Christmas/New Year lull gives you a chance to catch up on stuff you missed, and Sharp Pins’ lo-fi recreation of c 1965 pop is a delight: it’s obviously not doing anything new, but it does what it does beautifully.Explore more on these topicsDry CleaningAlexis Petridis's album of the weekIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

She plays Anne (or Agnes) Hathaway, wife of William Shakespeare, grieving the terrible loss of their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, in 1596, which the story imagines to be a spur to the creation of Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Paul Mescal plays Shakespeare and Emily Watson his mother, Mary.9 January.The Voice of Hind RajabA docufictional account of the last hours in the life of five-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, killed in 2024 by the IDF in Gaza in her uncle’s car, along with six family members and two paramedics, after sole survivor Rajab herself had stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestinian Red Crescent, desperately begging for help. The film uses the real audio recording of Rajab’s voice and fictionally reconstructs the drama in the call-centre office; real people played by actors, responding to the actual voice.16 JanuaryH Is for HawkCan training a goshawk cure grief? Will keeping it indoors – hooded so that it remains calm – and then taking it out hunting allow you to reconnect radically with nature in a way that prissy townies will never understand? Philippa Lowthorpe’s intriguing film, based on Helen Macdonald’s bestselling nature memoir from 2014, stars Claire Foy – who is doing this for real. Foy learned to handle a goshawk and her scenes have a tremendous authenticity.23 JanuaryNo Other ChoiceView image in fullscreenIn crisis … Lee Byung-hun in No Other Choice.Photograph: Courtesy: Venice Film festivalKorean directorPark Chan-wookbrings us a fascinating, complex movie based on Donald Westlake’s satirical horror-thriller The Ax from 1997. It is a story about a salaryman faced with the humiliation of unemployment who decides that he has no other choice but to commit mass murder. It starts out like an Ealing comedy-type caper then somehow morphs into something else: a portrait of family dysfunction, fragile masculinity and the breadwinner crisis, the state of the nation itself.23 JanuarySaipanIrish footballer Roy Keane is already something of a legend: this film may well cement that status. It is about the “Saipan incident”, which ignited a culture civil war on the subject of rebellion and disobedience. The ferociously opinionated Keane, while training on the Pacific island of Saipan in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup, was fiercely critical of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy’s methods, and the gaffer sensationally sent Keane home after a tirade from his star player that reportedly included the phrase: “You’re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse!” Should sportspeople swallow their objections for the patriotic good of the team or boldly speak up? Éanna Hardwicke plays Keane and Steve Coogan plays McCarthy.23 JanuaryIs This Thing On?The formidably versatileBradley Cooperreturns to comedy – or anyway the subject of comedy – with this new movie that he directs and in which he takes a supporting role. The title is, of course, what despairing standup comics say about their microphone when they are not getting any laughs; it could also be a metaphor for non-communication in a relationship. Will Arnett (from BoJack Horseman and Arrested Development) plays Alex, a guy going through a divorce who accidentally discovers that he has a talent for standup comedy; the experience lends a bittersweet new dimension to his single status. The film is inspired by the British comic John Bishop, who blundered into comedy in the middle of his own marital breakup.30 JanuaryWuthering HeightsView image in fullscreenHere comes the bride … Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyEmerald Fennell, the Oscar-winning creator of Saltburn and Promising Young Woman, now takes on her biggest project yet: an adaptation of Emily Brontë’s classic novel, with Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as the smouldering, saturnine alpha hero himself, Heathcliff. A mild culture war has already begun with Fennell casting a white actor as Heathcliff, a character Brontë described as “dark-skinned”, while Andrea Arnold cast mixed race actor James Howson for her version in 2011. (It wasn’t an issue for William Wyler in 1939 who cast Laurence Olivier.)13 FebruaryThe Secret AgentKleber Mendonça Filho’s film is set in the Brazilian dictatorship of the 1970s, in which an academic is on the run from the authorities after discovering high-level corruption. The film’s visual brilliance, sensual big-city intrigue, shaggy-dog comedy, gruesome lowlife walk-ons and epically languorous mystery create something special. It’s like Antonioni’s The Passenger with hints of Elmore Leonard, Quentin Tarantino and Meirelles and Lund’s City of God.20 FebruaryIf I Had Legs I’d Kick YouRose Byrne has been winning prizes and raves on the festival circuit with this drama from writer-director Mary Bronstein about a therapist whose life appears to be collapsing with far more catastrophic finality than those of her patients. She has a disabled daughter and a useless absentee husband played by Christian Slater – and emotional and behavioural issues of her own which surface when she tries to get therapy from a colleague.20 FebruaryThe Testament of Ann LeeView image in fullscreenPersecuted … Ann Lee, played by Amanda Seyfried, in The Testament of Ann Lee.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA vehement, fervent drama from Mona Fastvold, co-written with her partner, the Oscar-winning Brady Corbet. Amanda Seyfried plays the historical figure of Ann Lee, who endured religious persecution in 18th-century England as leader of the fundamentalist Shaker movement. It looks sometimes like a Lars von Trier nightmare, or Robert Eggers’ horror film The Witch, and sometimes like a weird but spectacular Broadway musical melodrama, in which the shaking and shivering of the dancing faithful – ecstatically submitting to divine joy – is shaped into a choreography not unlike the musical Stomp.20 FebruaryThe Bride!Titles with exclamation marks are generally making a tacit claim for comedy or melodrama or craziness over and above what you might expect, so it’s difficult at this stage to judge the tonal register for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s remake of The Bride of Frankenstein. In 1935, it featured Boris Karloff as the monster and Elsa Lanchester as his spouse; now it’s Christian Bale as the creature and Jessie Buckley as his soulmate. Let’s hope Gyllenhaal will avoid the classy solemnity that Guillermo del Toro favoured for his own recent Frankenstein.6 MarchA Private LifeThis is a genially preposterous psychological mystery caper from film-maker Rebecca Zlotowski, channelling De Palma or Hitchcock. It’s the tale of an American psychoanalyst in Paris, watchably played by Jodie Foster speaking elegant French, who suspects that a patient who reportedly killed herself was murdered. Things get weirder when a hypnotherapist regresses her into a past-life dream state in which she and this patient were lovers during the Nazi occupation.6 MarchSound of FallingView image in fullscreenGuilt, shame and yearning … Sound of Falling.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA mysterious and uncanny prose-poem of guilt, shame and yearning in Germany in the 20th century – and the 21st. It is a drama of intergenerational trauma, taking place in the same location in four different time frames, on a farm in north-eastern Germany. Gradually connections between the characters reveal themselves, and the film also hints at more characters and more uncanny and foretold events yet to come.6 MarchLa GraziaPaolo Sorrentino has rediscovered his voice, his wan humour and his flair for the surreal and sensational setpiece. This wintry, elegant study of grief and regret, starring veteran Italian actor Toni Servillo, wears its dreamy melancholy and ennui like a well-tailored if fussily old-fashioned suit.20 MarchProject Hail MaryPhil Lord and Christopher Miller, known for wacky comedies like The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, now take on a high-concept sci-fi mystery based on a novel by Andy Weir (whose The Martian was filmed by Ridley Scott).Ryan Goslingplays Ryland, a high-school teacher who some time in the future wakes up on a spaceship called the Hail Mary, cruising through the galaxy, with no memory of how he came to be there and with all his crewmates dead. Now Ryland must piece together what he was supposed to be doing and how to save planet Earth.20 MarchTwo Prosecutors(dir. Sergei Loznitsa)An icy chill of fear and justified paranoia radiates from this starkly austere and gripping movie from Sergei Loznitsa, set in Stalin’s Russia in the late 30s. With its slow, extended scenes from single camera positions, it mimics the zombie existence of the Soviet state: there is something of Dostoevsky’s The House of the Dead and Kafka’s The Castle.27 MarchThe DramaZendaya and Robert Pattinson star in what promises to be a fraught romantic dramedy from Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli, who had a huge hit with Dream Scenario, featuring Nicolas Cage as a boring professor who keeps showing up in people’s dreams. Now this glitzy couple are preparing to get married, but there’s a gobsmacking revelation just before the big day. This is going to test Pattinson’s comedy chops.3 AprilMichaelA musical biopic of Michael Jackson directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson (son of Jermaine), who is making his acting debut. Like the stage show MJ the Musical, this is expected to stop tactfully short of the King of Pop’s later controversy, taking us from his early years in the Jackson 5 up to his breakthrough to global megastardom.24 AprilThe Devil Wears Prada 2Just about the most anticipated sequel of the decade, this is the follow-up to the sensational fashionista comedy withMeryl Streepbreathing fire as fashion-mag editor Miranda Priestly, transparently and cheekily based on Vogue editor Anna Wintour. (It may explain why Streep has never attended Wintour’s New York Met Ball.) It was the film that also made superstars of Anne Hathaway as Miranda’s terrified new intern Andie, Emily Blunt as her haughty senior assistant Emily Charlton and Stanley Tucci as the witty and wise designer Nigel. They all return for more fashion crimes and misdemeanours.1 MayThe OdysseyNo director thinks bigger or films bigger thanChristopher Nolan, and it is perhaps not surprising that he should want to take on Homer’s The Odyssey. (What next? the Book of Genesis?) This is his version of the epic poem that has been the template for storytelling in the west for thousands of years. Matt Damon leads an all-star cast as Odysseus, the Greek king of Ithaca condemned to roam the world after the fall of Troy, yearning to be reunited with his wife Penelope.17 JulyThe Social ReckoningNo one in the movies did more to warn us about the dysfunctional origins and effects of social media than Aaron Sorkin by writing The Social Network; it was directed by David Fincher withJesse Eisenbergas Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. This is not exactly the sequel many were demanding, but more a conceptual follow-up based on a true story – directed as well as written by Sorkin. Jeremy Strong plays the older, more torpidly calm Zuckerberg and Mikey Madison is Frances Haugen, former head of Facebook’s civic integrity team who blew the whistle on the site’s practices.9 OctoberFocker In-LawHere is the latest in the imperishable Meet the Parents series, with its sublime belief in the overwhelming comedy power of the “Focker” surname, but it has to be said the name “Martha Focker” on its own grants this franchise entry to the Hall of Fame. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner are reprising their roles as the oldsters who disapprove of a certain prospective son-in-law and Ben Stiller, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson reprise their roles, though are in danger of themselves becoming the senior generation. Beanie Feldstein and Ariana Grande are part of the new intake.25 NovemberDune: Part ThreeDenis Villeneuve’s mighty Dune franchise, based on the Frank Herbert sci-fi classic, began way back in 2021; it was precisely the kind of big-screen showstopper that the cinema industry needed for its post-Covid fightback. Part Two arrived last year, and now here is the final swirling sandstorm episode; Timothée Chalamet is back as Paul Atreides with Zendaya as Chani – and Rebecca Ferguson is, of course, Paul’s demanding mother, Lady Jessica. We shall see if Anya Taylor-Joy (as Paul’s sister, Alia) and Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan have roles that last more than a few moments on screen.18 DecemberBitter ChristmasPedro Almodóvar’s new film is a comedy, returning him to his home turf, with Spanish star Bárbara Lennie. She is Elsa, an ad exec who suffers from a panic attack after the death of her mother during a long weekend in December. She takes off on holiday to Lanzarote, while her partner stays behind in Madrid and this story – in classic Almodóvar style – runs alongside a parallel strand to that of a director and screenwriter.Release date tbcDiggerHollywood has been pondering the question of when and whether Tom Cruise was going to pivot away from action spectaculars like the humongous Mission: Impossible franchise and back towards the challenging indie fare with which he had once associated himself, in films such as Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia and Michael Mann’s Collateral. Well, this could be the moment. Cruise plays the lead in the new film fromAlejandro González Iñárritu, which describes itself as “a comedy of catastrophic proportions”.Date tbcI Love BoostersView image in fullscreenFuturist adventure … from left, Naomi Ackie, Taylour Paige and Keke Palmer in I Love Boosters.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDemi Moore had a career-redefining smash with the sci-fi horror The Substance, and now she’s back in another futurist adventure, from satirist Boots Riley. At some stage in the world still to come, a group of young people make a living stealing high-end garments from couture stores; but they might have taken on too much when they take aim at Moore’s formidable fashion CEO.Date tbcInkMalcolm McDowell, James Cromwell and Ben Mendelsohn have all taken on the demon-king role of Rupert Murdoch in the past; now it’s the turn of Guy Pearce in this new film from directorDanny Boyle, based on the award-winning stage play by James Graham. It’s about the traumatised rebirth of the Sun newspaper in the late 1960s, with Jack O’Connell as the paper’s launch editor Larry Lamb. A truly British national institution was born from a new exploitation of sex and crime.Date tbcNarnia: The Magician’s NephewFifteen years ago, the Narnia films had looked like a slam-dunk franchise – but nothing happened after the third episode, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in 2010. Now things look like being back on track, with stars Emma Mackey and Carey Mulligan, and directorGreta Gerwig. They now take on The Magician’s Nephew (the prequel which was in fact the sixth of CS Lewis’s published seven-novel series, and the first in narrative order), about the creation of Narnia by Aslan a millennium before the events of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Date tbcPeaky Blinders: The Immortal ManAfter six series on BBC TV, Tommy Shelby is back in a feature-length movie adventure from screenwriter Steven Knight. Shelby is the gang boss, played byCillian Murphy, who ruled Birmingham’s crime world between the wars and whose choice of headgear popularised and yet also stigmatised flat caps for an entire generation of British television viewers. Will this be a shark-jumping moment for Tommy, or his finest hour?Date tbcThe President’s CakeView image in fullscreenBaneen Ahmad Nayyef in The President’s Cake.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThis Iraqi-set film from feature first-timer Hasan Hadi has been a heartwarming festival hit, having been nurtured by producers Chris Columbus, Marielle Heller and Hollywood veteran Eric Roth. Lamia, played by nonprofessional Baneen Ahmad Nayyef, is a little girl who lives with her grandmother in Saddam’s Iraq in the 90s and is tasked with getting the rare ingredients for a special cake to celebrate the president’s birthday. To buy these, she will have to sell her late father’s watch. In classic neorealist style, she has all sorts of hair-raising encounters along the way.Date tbcUntitled Jesse Eisenberg Musical ComedyJesse Eisenberg has graduated from fast-talking acting roles like Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Luthor to director status, and his comedy A Real Pain was last year’s indie smash. Now he’s written and directed a (still untitled) musical comedy – composer still unknown – featuring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti. A shy woman finds herself cast in a local theatre’s production of a musical and gets swept up in smalltown showbusiness.Date tbcWhitney SpringsTrey Parker, known for anarchic, iconoclastic comedies such as TV’s South Park and The Book of Mormon, now ventures solo further into what can only be described as the arena of the problematic, co-produced with Kendrick Lamar. A young black man, working in an educational “re-enactment” event in a slavery museum, makes an unfortunate discovery about his white girlfriend’s ancestors and their relationship with his own forebears.Date tbcThis article was amended on 1 January 2026 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to “Japan’s Saipan island”.

Even a vegan restaurant owner gets in on the actLucy ManganThu 1 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareThey come round sooner every time, do they not? I think we’re now the recipients of a new Harlan Coben adaptation every three weeks or so. Who knows what rate will be attained next year? We watch and wait, though possibly in neither case for long.We are now about a dozen, rating-banking offerings into the bestselling thriller writer’s multi-book deals with Netflix and Amazon. They are generally solid, workmanlike fare that doubtless help fund many passion projects and pay many mortgages along the way. They are comfort TV not just for viewers, but, I suspect, everyone involved.Run Away (written by frequent Coben collaborator Danny Brocklehurst, plus Tom Farrelly and Amanda Duke, and based on the 2019 book of the same name, and one of Coben’s less bombastic and more harrowing thrillers) is a return to form. Not least because it stars James Nesbitt as Simon, the tormented father of Paige, who is now in the throes of drug addiction and missing from home. It’s not a groundbreaking role for Nesbitt but it does remind you that few do the tormented Everyman better than he does. And, just as deeply pleasingly, it has the always-magnificent Tracy-Ann Oberman going toe to toe with him as his terrifying lawyer Jessica, plus Ruth Jones as private investigator Elena Ravenscroft, an iron fist in a velvet glove – faintly but beautifully unsettling in every scene.The plot moves in increasingly convoluted but well-oiled grooves towards its resolution over the course of eight episodes. Despite the misgivings of his wife, Ingrid (an underused Minnie Driver, soon to be comatose in an ICU bed while hospital dialogue so hackneyed it would disgrace Casualty plays out above her), who worries that the official advice is that they must let their daughter Paige reach rock bottom before she can be helped, Simon is still secretly searching for his missing daughter.He receives a tipoff that she is busking in a local park, but just as he approaches her he is confronted by her boyfriend/dealer Aaron (an impressively-immediately loathsome figure, played by Thomas Flynn) and she – see title – runs away. Aaron and Simon get into a fight as Simon tries to give chase and an edited clip that appears to show the latter savagely beating an innocent homeless man soon goes viral. Which, when Aaron is discovered stabbed to death soon thereafter, puts Simon in the frame for his murder. Things become even more complicated when he and Ingrid sneak into the crime scene, meet the kindly Cornelius (Lucian Msamati), who used to keep an eye on Paige and offer her occasional refuge when Aaron hit her, and become embroiled in a basement shootout when he takes them to meet Aaron’s supplier who might know more about their daughter’s fate.Meanwhile – because there is always a meanwhile, and usually two – Elena is being hired by a very rich man called Sebastian Thorpe to search for his missing adoptive son Henry, whose disappearance the police are refusing to take seriously. “Adoptive” is a Chekhov’s gun of a word in these circumstances, but Elena alas doesn’t know that she is in a quarterly mystery series on Netflix and so does not pick up on this immediately. Perhaps she is distracted by the surveillance she is doing for as-yet-unexplained reasons on the owner of a vegan restaurant.Second meanwhile: a murderous young duo are out, well, murdering people. Apparently unconnected, but clearly on the instructions of a third party who needs them out of the way. “Make it different,” the girl (a mesmeric Maeve Courtier-Lilley) reminds the boy as he leaves the car to execute their latest prey.Each episode ends with a twist and at least a few new avenues of intrigue for viewers to trot down towards the next instalment. The end of the first, for example, shows us Paige’s brother at university with the guitar we saw her using to busk stashed in his room, and Elena discovering that the last post on Henry’s Instagram before he allegedly went off on a two-week holiday was from Paige. Dum-dum-dah! Tune in next week, as they used to say before digital streaming unshackled us from time and space. And we will, for Coben. We do.

Does fate smile upon those who see the glass as half full? The science writer Sumit Paul-Choudhury believes so.The Bright Side: Why Optimists Have the Power to Change the Worldis his hymn to positivity, though fear not: it’s not a self-help book and there is more to it than platitudes about manifesting and living your best life.The author realised he was a natural optimist following the premature death of his wife from cancer. In the aftermath, he made an active decision “not to spend any more time in limbo than I already had” and “cultivated the idea that the future would be bright”. Optimism is, he says, “central to the human psyche”. It fosters social progress and encourages individuals to be resilient and withstand stress, to be more successful at work and create stronger bonds with friends and family. Among the models for optimism offered here are Ernest Shackleton who, along with his crew, survived being stranded in the Antarctic, and Helen Keller, who lost her hearing and sight after a childhood illness and later, in her 1903 essay Optimism, wrote about discovering hope and joy.Paul-Choudhury is our upbeat, but never Pollyanna-ish, narrator. His reading, like his writing, is thoughtful and pragmatic. Could optimism – the kind that leads people to assume they won’t get cancer, or lose their livelihood – be the result of naivety or delusion? Perhaps, but that isn’t an argument for relentless realism. To consciously see brightness and opportunity rather than misery and calamity, Paul-Choudhury asserts, is to ultimately invest in one’s future and bring about change.Available from Canongate, 8hr 45minAll My Precious Madness by Mark Bowles review – a deliciously sweary, prize-winning monologueRead moreFurther listeningAuditionKatie Kitamura,Penguin Audio,4hr46minTraci Kato-Kiriyama reads this enigmatic Booker-shortlisted novel about a nameless actor preparing for a new role who meets a younger man at a restaurant.

The legendary singer finally has her say, in this uneven memoirDina NayeriThu 1 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.07 ESTShareIf you ask any Iranian to name the most important female pop star in our country’s history, they’ll say Googoosh. Nobody else comes close. Over six decades of revolution, suppression and exile, Googoosh has gone from singer to cultural icon, a symbol of a country’s grief for its murdered, imprisoned, and muzzled artists, and a living link between pre-revolutionary Iran and the diaspora.Googoosh was just three years old when she started singing in small halls and cabaret venues where her father worked. By her teens she was a film actor and a fashion icon. In the 60s and 70s, when my mother was a teenager, Googoosh was everywhere: on television, in films, magazines, on the radio. She kept recreating herself – her style, her moves, her hair. (My mother and many of her university classmates copied Googosh’s famous wispy haircut.) For a while, this bold, creative young woman shaped how westerners saw Iran, and how a generation of Iranian women understood modernity, femininity and public life.Then the1979 revolutionarrived, and cultural crackdowns pushed secular art and music underground. In 1980, Googoosh was arrested and (along with other singers and actors) banned from performing, recording or appearing publicly. She withdrew into private life, but her songs continued to circulate underground, and my generation played her music just as much as our parents had: to dance, to grieve, to fall in love. I listen to Nafas on repeat after every heartbreak, or when I just need a big, dramatic cry. Even after she went quiet, Googoosh was the emblem of a lost Iran, its joyful culture, rich artistic history, and its bold, powerful women.Her memoir uses her 1980 arrest as a framing device. After a series of interrogations, she is thrown into a cell with her old friend, the singer and film actor Marjan, and the narrative shifts between prison and the past. In prison, Googoosh’s treatment by the clerics is terrifying, but crammed together in filthy, unpredictable conditions, the women make do, telling each other their stories to distract themselves.Googoosh describes a pitiless childhood: the pain of her mother’s departure, days spent serving her father’s abusive new wife, Mouness, and protecting her brothers from their stepmother’s wrath. In those days, the stage was her only reliable refuge and her sole power (as breadwinner) against Mouness. But Googoosh soon left home and, at 17, she married, the first of many unions that crumbled under the pressures of celebrity, public scrutiny and repressive expectations.In public, though, she was free: she wore what she wanted, moved how she wanted, spoke about love in ways most women couldn’t. Her short haircut, her miniskirts, her bold eyeliner and her vulnerability on stage were enthralling to other women. After the crackdowns on secular music, Iranian women equated the silencing of their most beloved performer with their own, and her disappearance from public life turned her into a kind of lost saint. They remembered her privately through old cassette tapes: the pretty face of their unspent youth, their desires and their yearning to be heard.View image in fullscreenGoogoosh in Toronto, July 29, 2000 - her first concert in 21 years.Photograph: Peter Jones/REUTERSClearly, then, a memoir from Googoosh is exciting for her fans and an important part of our cultural archive. And it’s a genuine pleasure to read her stories, with their infuriating power imbalances and dramatic turns. But Googoosh deserved a more seasoned memoirist as her co-writer. Her (lived) story is a complicated one, full of cultural texture and interpersonal nuance, and it carries historical weight. It merits a sophisticated telling with a powerfully crafted narrative and attention to the particulars of Googoosh’s voice. With its Iranian inflection stripped or mangled, the writing tips constantly into cliche, one-note characters and melodrama. (At a concert: “It felt like there was a giant octopus with tentacles spreading all over the massive space, causing a wave to form, a wave of energy that grew exponentially as it rushed toward the stage before hitting me and the musicians.”) How much more subtle and luminous this memoir might have been if given to a skilled literary hand. Still, it’s Googoosh and she deserves our attention. She has lived a brave and remarkable life that everyone should know about.She was finally allowed to leave Iran in 2000. In exile, she rebuilt her life from the ground up, releasing new music and touring worldwide. Googoosh’s first performance (in Toronto) after two silent decades was historic: audiences wept, remembering all that had been lost. Soon her concerts became intergenerational gatherings again: older Iranians reconnecting with pre-revolutionary memories and theirthird-culture kids(and grandkids) discovering a piece of their identity through her music. For Iranian women of my mother’s generation, though, the ones who suffered most at the hands of brutish men, watching their idol reclaim her spotlight was a kind of revival – as if they, too, were getting another shot at everything they’d missed.Dina Nayeri is the author of The Ungrateful Refugee and Who Gets Believed?

Her practice was so finely wrought that it existed only in the experience between a work’s idea and its absorption. Ceal handled this equation deftly and with perfect poise, but it was a perilous and naked process with little or no place to hide, or none.Resolving the relationship between an idea’s inception and its manifestation became increasingly fraught for her and many works never made it to fruition. Therein lay her courage. This is why I wanted to add something to last month’s obituary of her byJonathan Watkins.Ceal was exceptional and brave. Her work laid her bare to the vicissitudes of existence because that’s what it was made from. Her practice was so embedded in her life that living with a brain tumour for 23 years took a toll on it, despite her continued defiance and disregard for the time limits allotted to her by her prognosis. Her brain/work nexus was so unusual that her brain surgeon took an exceptional diagnostic interest in her art. But this same brilliance meant that she could not bear to be seen to lose control and therefore preferred to isolate herself than reveal any cracks. She continued to incubate ideas but often failed to realise them and over time this began to frustrate and disappoint her.View image in fullscreenFloyer bites her nails during Nail Biting Performance at Documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 2012.Photograph: Uwe Zucchi/EPA/ShutterstockBut in her last month, in the palliative care unit in a hospital dedicated to Saint Francis near Zoo station in Berlin, she was freed from this burden and, in the face of death, became briefly once more the artist she had been. Despite the terrible attrition in her body, she was purely and unequivocally Ceal, strangely vital and resolute. Many people visited her, which encouraged the dormant performative aspect of her practice.On the wall was a wooden crucifix. She kept pointing at it and it was clear that it represented death, though she was still alive and present. She told us, as she tried to grab a glass of water, that she no longer knew if she were very old or very young. Then we watched her as she formed an idea: could we get her some colouring-in books? Adding later that she would only need black crayons. I bought her the books and the crayons, but they remained untouched; the idea was the point.Ceal Floyer obituaryRead moreShe became increasingly inaudible over her longer than anticipated hospital stay. On what would become her last full day, she raised herself up from sleep when we arrived, reached for, and clung on to, the triangular bar above her bed, holding on to it for what felt like an unbearably long time. It was clear it meant life in the way the crucifix on the wall meant death. Occasionally, Ceal shook the bar, as if willing it beyond its inert capabilities. Eventually, she let her hand drop and signalled to us to get her a nurse and, more clearly and audibly than had been possible for a long while, she answered to the doctor’s offer of morphine, “Yes please.”And in the while they took to go and get it, as I stood beside her bed, she lifted her hand and gave the middle finger to the cross on the wall. The gesture was unambiguous, audacious and courageous: I was her audience and her viewer, and she was giving death the middle finger with me as her witness. Aware and pleased by my reaction (I was both shocked and impressed), and with the slightest of feline smiles on her face, she allowed the nurse to give her the morphine and did not, to my knowledge, really resurface.Explore more on these topicsPerformance artArtTacita DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like many British institutions (Marmite, PMQs, fruit cake) the serial, which launched in 1951, occupies a curious place in the national psyche; the first notes of that determinedly jolly maypole dance will either send you lurching for the power button, or shouting for silence. There is, I’m afraid, no middle ground.Stranger still, you can switch Ambridge off any time you like, but you can never leave. Indeed, online discussion forums are littered with people sneering that they stopped tuning in when the storylines became too sensational, silly or depressing … yet somehow they’re still there, moaning about the show.One thing devotees rarely grumble about, however, is how comfortingly boring it can be. My Archers fan group still talks fondly of the week back in 2023 where Jim lost his spectacles, because in truth, the sheer, soothing mundanity is what we all tune in for. Real life can be hurtling to hell (represented here by the city of Birmingham) in a pony and trap pursued by Lynda Snell and her speed camera, but for 14 minutes a day you can vanish into a world where the biggest problem is likely to be an escaped cow.View image in fullscreenBreakfast at Brookfield … from left Phil Archer (Norman Painting), Dan (Harry Oakes), Doris (Gwen Berryman), and Christine (Pamela Mant). Standing is farm labourer Len Thomas (Arnold Peters) photographed for Picture Post in June 1953.Photograph: Bert Hardy/Getty ImagesThat said, for all the complaints about it “turning into AmbridgEnders” in recent years, this small village has always seen more than its fair share of untimely deaths, dastardly crimes and a jaw-dropping level of infidelity.1.Though the first pilots went out in May 1950, the Archers as we know it started in January 1951 as Cockney incomer Peggy was preparing to give birth to Anthony William Daniel, AKA Tony.2.Outsiders have always been treated with suspicion in Ambridge. In its first year, unrepentant townie Bill Slater was fatally injured in a brawl outside the Bull.3.In 1953, Irishman Mike Daly, who claimed to be holed up in Blossom Hill Cottage writing thrillers, confessed he was a secret agent who had escaped from Dachau. Sadly he was called away from the excitement of village life by the mysterious Baroness Czorva.4.Ambridge changed for good in 1954 when Squire Lawson-Hope broke up the estate his family had occupied since time immemorial, leaving the village free to become the socialist utopia it remains to this day.5.The first big marmalade dropper occurred in 1955 when Phil Archer’s wife, the beautiful Grace (Rex and Toby’s aunt) died in his arms after trying to rescue her sister-in-law’s horse from a fire.6.In 1957 gamekeeper and Proper Countryman Tom Forrest accidentally shot and killed poacher and Proper Bad’Un Bob Larkin. The Hollerton silver band welcomed him back to Ambridge after his acquittal with a spirited rendition of For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow. Tom later married the usually silent Pru, who was played by Judi Dench in a cameo for the 10,000th episode.View image in fullscreenPru breaks her silence … guest star Judi Dench, right, for the 10,000th episode of The Archers in May 1989, with Terry Wogan and Esther Rantzen, who also contributed to the show.Photograph: Radio 47.In what was surely the biggest news of 1966, 22-year-old unmarried teacher Jennifer Archer asked the vicar to tell her parents she was expecting caddish cowhand Paddy’s baby.8.Nelson Gabriel, once voted the Greatest Rogue in the series’ history, vanished in an alleged plane crash in 1967. Implicated in the Great Borchester Mail Van Robbery, he was eventually returned by Interpol.9.Adam Macy’s overprotective parenting style might be partly explained by the fact that in 1970, at the age of three, he was kidnapped from the Bull by a couple of Brummie bunglers hoping to blackmail his wealthy paternal grandfather. Three days later, he was rescued from the big bad city thanks to a tip-off from Sid Perks.10.In 1970, Lilian’s first husband, the dashing Canadian air force pilot Lester “Nick” Nicholson, carelessly sleepwalked downstairs to his death. Though understandably upset, she got married again the following year, to Ralph Bellamy.View image in fullscreenThe cast celebrate 21 years on air in November 1971.

The former Labour minister Lord Blunkett describes this tender moment from 1977 as his most memorable episode.13.Clarrie, inspired by the 1981 engagement of Lady Di, informed Eddie that she’d pay off the debt he’d incurred recording a country and western demo tape with Jolene if he married her. She still had to buy her own engagement ring, mind.View image in fullscreen‘Me ol’ pal, me ol’ beauty’ … Robert Mawdesley and Pauline Seville, who played Walter Gabriel and Mrs Perkins, photographed for Picture Post in 1953.Photograph: Bert Hardy/Getty Images14.Princess Margaret isn’t the only celebrity to visit Ambridge (John Peel, Pet Shop Boys and Britt Ekland have all featured), but she is the only one Ambridge has visited – her appearance at an NSPCC fashion show in 1984 was recorded at Kensington Palace.15.Fresh from her adventures at Greenham Common, Guardian-subscriber Pat Archer almost left Express-reader Tony for her women’s studies lecturer in 1984 … until Tony wooed her back with a bold plan to go organic. (On the farm, not in the bedroom.)16.In 1986, 89-year-old Dan Archer, one of the founding farmers, died of a heart attack while trying to turn a sheep.View image in fullscreenCutting through … Emerald O’Hanrahan as Emma Grundy.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC17.Before the days of Ed and Emma, residents had to do their own tree surgery. In 1987 Clarrie’s father Jethro found himself at the wrong end of a branch cut by David Archer and died at the scene.18.BSE came to Ambridge with a vengeance in 1989, when Brian Aldridge was butted by one of Joe Grundy’s infected cows and wound up in hospital with a blood clot on the brain.View image in fullscreenBrian and Jenny’s daugher Kate Madekane, played by Perdita Avery.Photograph: BBC19.Debbie’s father, the dark and handsome Roger Travers-Macy, reappeared in Ambridge, and Jennifer’s arms, in 1991. Frankly, it served Brian right.20.Peggy’s wartime flame, GI Conn Kortchmar, turned up in Ambridge in 1992 in response to a letter forged by her teenage granddaughter Kate, declared his love and begged her to run away to Boston with him.21.Also in 1992, charming Scot Cameron Fraser abandoned a pregnant Elizabeth in a pub car park on the way to the airport. A week later she discovered he was wanted by the fraud squad, and decided to have an abortion, much to Jill’s distress.View image in fullscreenElizabeth Marlowe as Lilian, Judy Bennett as Shula and Angela Piper as Jenny recording an episode on 30 November 1971.Photograph: Victor Blackman/Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images22.One-man rural crimewave Clive Horrobin held up the village shop with a shotgun in 1993. His sister Susan later went to prison for harbouring him.23.In 1994, just when Shula’s marriage to village cricket captain Mark Hebden seemed to be back on track, solicitor Hebden crashed while swerving to avoid Caroline Bone, who had been thrown from her horse. He died instantly, not knowing that Shula was finally pregnant with their much-longed-for child, Daniel.24.Usha Gupta was the victim of a vicious series of racist attacks in the mid-90s, culminating in an ammonia-throwing incident outside the Bull which left her fearing for her sight. Roy Tucker, who belonged to the far-right gang responsible, eventually, in 1995, shopped them to the police.25.In 1996, four years after the Church of England sanctioned the ordination of women, the Reverend Janet Fisher arrived at St Stephen’s. Peggy promptly transferred her worship to All Saints, Borchester.View image in fullscreenBringing home the bacon … Tom Graham as pigman Tom Archer. William Troughton took over the role in 2014.Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC26.Tragedy struck Bridge Farm in 1998 when John, Pat and Tony’s eldest, fatally overturned his father’s vintage tractor. His sausage business lives on with his brother Tom (one assumes).27.Baby Phoebe, now a mum herself, came into the world at Glastonbury 1998 guided by an “amazing woman, Morwenna” who helped Kate to birth her “with nothing but breathing”. One hopes Kate still made it to Bob Dylan on the Pyramid Stage.28.The same year, the future Reverend Shula found herself embroiled in a steamy love triangle with vet Alistair Lloyd and her friend Usha’s partner Dr Richard Locke. Shula changed her mind about running off to Manchester with the latter when dullard brother David observed he couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.29.Kirsty Miller was arrested for destroying a GM crop in Northamptonshire in 1999. As boyfriend Tom was already on bail for the same crime, they weren’t allowed to meet publicly for almost a year, by which time Tom was seeing someone else. No red flags there.View image in fullscreenNorman Painting, who played Phil Archer, and Bob Arnold, who played Tom Forrest, during a recording of The Archers in 1957.Photograph: R Viner/Getty Images30.In 2000, married man Sid Perks fell for the Lily of Layton Cross, in the gym at Borchester Leisure Centre – and listeners were shocked to start the new millennium listening to Jolene soaping his back in a steamy shower scene. A quarter of century later, many remain traumatised.31.Ruth Archer, then 31, found a malignant lump in her breast in the same year, leading to a mastectomy and a gruelling course of chemotherapy. On the plus side, it put a stop to arguments over the Brookfield inheritance.32.Businessman (never a positive adjective in Ambridge) Matt Crawford – described in these pages at the time as making Brian “seem like a Guardian reader” – evicted the Grundys from Grange Farm in 2000. Left without a herd, or a home, they were rehoused in an overcrowded Borchester council flat, where Joe felt forced totake a hammer to his beloved ferrets.View image in fullscreenFelicity Finch as Ruth Archer, Patricia Green as Jill, Louiza Patikas as Helen, Hywel Payne on sound effects and Tim Bentinck as David in the lambing shed.

He ended up in intensive care with brain damage.34.Two weeks before Christmas 2002, Jennifer Aldridge discovered what listeners had known for months: that her husband Brian was the father of newly divorced Siobhan Hathaway’s baby Ruairi – his first (and to our knowledge only) son.35.Conceived on top of a hayrick in the warm summer of 2001, Ben Archer shot into the world on the Brookfield kitchen floor in March 2002. Fortunately, David already had a bit of experience in the calving shed.View image in fullscreenPauline Seville as Mrs Perkins and Gwen Berryman as  Doris Archer in a reconstruction of the Brookfield Farm kitchen for Picture Post magazine in 1953.Photograph: Bert Hardy/Picture Post/Hulton Archive/Getty Images36.The Archers’ first same-sex kiss happened in a Home Farm polytunnel in March 2004 whenAdam invited new chef Ian Craig in to admire his organic strawberries. (As his aunt Lilian observed, “It’s more original than etchings.”) They entered the village’s first civil partnership two years later.37.Depressed gamekeeper Greg Turner died by suicide in May 2004 after girlfriend Helen walked out. The subsequent grief and guilt led to the eating disorder that nearly claimed her life.38.Kathy Perks was raped by former Lower Loxley chef Owen King after a Christmas panto rehearsal in 2004.

A sober Tom took the blame; when Helen finally admitted the truth to her parents, they tried to stop her going to the police, something Tony seems to have forgotten during recent events.43.In 2008, Peggy’s second husband, Jack, finally went into care after a long battle with Alzheimer’s. Actor Arnold Peters was diagnosed with the disease not long after his character.44.The village shop might no longer have been financially viable for Peggy, but the 2009-10community buy-outinspired many real-life copycats around the country.45.In February 2010 Helen announced to her stunned family that she had decided to have a baby on her own. “It’ll ruin your life,” said the ever-supportive Tony.View image in fullscreenFeeling herd?

Scruff returned, however, on Christmas Eve.52.Conman Matt Crawford did a runner in 2015, leaving Lilian briefly bereft. He popped up again two years later to whisk her back to Costa Rica with him, but she had already shacked up with Justin Elliott. Instead, Crawford got run over by Nic Grundy.53.The biggest drama of the year, however, was the theft of Fallon’s homemade bunting after May Day celebrations.

The band’s contract runs until 2029.Ador is also suing an unnamed member of Danielle’s family and the band’s former producer Min Hee-jin for damages and as part of a contract break penalty, alleging they both bore “significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for NewJeans’ departure and delayed return”.‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that the total amount sought from the three individuals amounts to nearly 43.1bn won (US$30m, £22m, A$45m).NewJeans made headlines in November 2024 when they announced their decision to leave Ador, prompting the company to request an injunction barring them from any commercial activities. That request was granted in March.Danielle’s contract has been terminated, the label said on Monday, as it was “determined that it would be difficult for her to continue as … an artist under Ador”.The label claimed that NewJeans’ members had been “exposed to persistently distorted and biased information” which had led to “significant misunderstandings”.The Guardian has reached out to Danielle for comment.According to Ador, three of the group’s four remaining members have decided to stay with the label, while member Minji is still in talks with the company.NewJeans, which made its debut in 2022, is among Hybe’s most successful acts. After the lawsuit against Danielle was announced, fans took to social media with the slogan: “NewJeans is five or nothing”.The dramatic contractual dispute erupted last year following allegations that Hybe had forced out Min, the band’s producer, from her role as Ador’s CEO.NewJeans members later issued an ultimatum demanding Min’s reinstatement, which Hybe rejected. The members then went public with their grievances, alleging the company had deliberately undermined their careers.Vietnamese-Australian band member Hanni Pham claimed that the band had endured mistreatment, including “deliberate miscommunications and manipulation” while working with the label. In October she delivered emotional testimony before South Korea’s parliament over the allegations, saying: “I know it’s not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace.”Danielle has also claimed that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management, an allegation Ador or Hybe have not responded to.In October, the Seoul Central district court rejected NewJeans’s claims that the allegations had caused an “irreparable breakdown of trust” with Ador.Weeks later, South Korea’s employment ministry also dismissed a workplace bullying complaint made by Pham against Ador, stating that the members were not legally employees of Ador, but “exceptional entities”.The spat sparked panic in the K-pop industry, as it fuelled discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.In a joint statement to Time magazineafter the injunction against them was granted, the band said: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”In November, Ador announced that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the agency, sparking fears among fans that NewJeans would split up. But Hanni, Danielle and Minji released a separate statement hours later clarifying that they would also return – but now it is clear, not for long.Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaPop and rockAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

You decide whose argument scrubs up bestGet a disagreement settled or become a YBTJ jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 1 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 06.37 ESTShareThe prosecution: AudreyNoah doesn’t wash himself thoroughly enough – he just rubs a bit of gel around his bodyMy boyfriend, Noah, doesn’t wash properly, but he thinks he does. I am Nigerian and grew up being told I must scrub my body thoroughly when I wash, otherwise I’m not clean. My sisters and I were encouraged to use exfoliating net sponges and propersoap to clean ourselves. Shower gel was banned in my house.Noah, meanwhile, has a much more lax approach to hygiene. He doesn’t use soap, and will just pat a bit of shower gel around his body. We’ve been in a relationship for three years, but I first started noticing it nine months ago after we moved in together.It all kicked off recently, though, when Noah came to my cousin Femi’s house for lunch. Noah, who is Scottish, asked Femi why there was a bucket in his bathroom. Femi explained that many Nigerians grow up having a bucket bath, where water is poured over you from a bucket while you bathe. It’s a very satisfying and thorough way of washing. Noah was amazed. I then made a few jokes about how badly he washes himself and I think he got embarrassed. But it seemed like an opportune time to bring it up.There is no scrubbing, no real getting into the cracks and orifices: it’s just rubbing a bit of gel aroundNoah isn’t unclean – he just doesn’t wash adequately. There is no scrubbing, no real getting into the cracks and orifices: it’s just rubbing a bit of gel around and hoping for the best. He also doesn’t bend down to wash his feet. He says, “The water will find its way there.” I find it strange.This lack of exfoliation is also not good for his skin. I bought him a net sponge to use in the shower, and he hasn’t used it. A couple of times I’ve watched him shower and expressed horror at his technique; other times I just leave him to it, because it’s weird to get annoyed with how your partner washes.Noah always smells nice, but I just think he needs to be a little bit more thorough. He laughs at how long I take in the bathroom, but Black hair needs a lot of love, and I generally like showering. We have different needs, but I’d like to see him take on board some of my tried-and-tested tips.The defence: NoahI smell nice and I’m not unclean, so why does showering have to be like a full military operation?Audrey did grow up with a very different approach to washing, and it’s true that I’ve learned more about exfoliation in my last three years with her than I had in the first 30 of my life. But while I’m grateful for her tips, I don’t want to be forced to change my ways if there’s no real problem.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreAs Audrey said, I smell nice, so it’s not like I’m unclean. “Different” doesn’t automatically mean “wrong”. Just because I don’t shower like I’m conducting a full military operation doesn’t mean I’m wandering around unwashed.I shower daily and use shower gel, but for some reason Audrey thinks this isn’t good enough. Her standards are simply different: she spends up to an hour in the shower, sometimes longer if she has to do her full hair ritual. I support her, but I’m a shaved‑head, quick-shower kind of guy. I don’t need to be re-enacting a purification ritual every time I get back from the gym.This isn’t about hygiene, it’s about technique. And technique is personal, cultural and varies wildlyThe bucket bath thing was really interesting and I was genuinely fascinated by the whole process, but Audrey did use the opportunity to make an example of how badly I wash in front of her family. I just laughed it off then, but now I realise she actually has a bit of an issue with the way I wash. Audrey can critique me all she wants, but maybe it’s better done in private.Besides, I do wash my feet. I just don’t necessarily fold myself in half to scrub in between my toes. And yes, I let water run down my legs, because that’s how most people do it. The idea that “water will find its way” is not an excuse; it is simple physics. When you shower, the water and the shower gel runs all the way down your body. I don’t need to scrub my feet as well.This isn’t about hygiene, it’s about technique. And technique is personal, cultural and varies wildly. I don’t mind learning hers. I just don’t want to be made to feel like I’m choosing chaos every time I step into the shower.The jury of Guardian readersShould Noahabandon his trickle‑down theory of washing?Scrubbing isn’t necessary, and often we are far too clean, which may add to eczema, asthma or autoimmune issues in children. However, we must properly clean our feet. They are one of the smelliest parts of our body. They need to be soaped properly and filed often to avoid callouses or athlete’s foot. Some people’s trainers, flip-flops and Crocs in the gym look and smell revolting.Ana, 51As long as Noah is clean and doesn’t smell, he is fine. Maybe give your feet a wash now and again though, mate. If Audrey is upset, she should stop watching, grab a loofah and help out.Alistair, 42If Noah showers every day, and smells and looks clean, I’d say he’s clean. It isn’t as if he’s coming home from a shift down the pit and getting straight into bed. How would Audrey like it if he told her to hurry up in the shower or joked about hair rituals in front of his family?Adam, 55While personal hygiene is important, it’s a very personal matter. Audrey is somewhat extreme – and invasive – in her demands. On a side note, her public airing of Noah’s personal habits is a trust deal-breaker.David, 73Cultural issues aside, exfoliating every day is not necessary and isn’t really good as it damages the skin barrier. As long as Noah keeps his genitals clean, doesn’t smell and has no skin conditions, his personal hygiene seems perfectly adequate.Friederike, 60Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us if Noah’s argument washes with you?The poll closes on Wednesday 7 January at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifPeter should be less obsessed with trying to save water.61%of you said yes –Peter is guilty39%of you said no –Peter is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What are some of the simplest switches to make and most nutritious dishes to try with minimum fuss? Vegans share their tips on how to eat a balanced plant-based diet.Eat the worldSophie Sugrue, who last autumn became the first plant-based finalist on MasterChef, says: “It has pushed me to experiment so much more with different flavours from all over the world, because there’s so much naturally plant-based food.” Her favourite cuisines are “Japanese, because although they use fish sauce, it can be subbed out, and they use a lot of tofu; Vietnamese food is incredible, because a lot of people follow a plant-based diet. If you go to a Vietnamese grocery store, you can find loads of substitutes.”Ensure your diet is balancedView image in fullscreen‘I tend to have a little jar of mixed seeds that go on practically everything,’ says Ian Theasby.Photograph: fcafotodigital/Getty Images“Make sure that you’re hitting all of your food groups,” says the dietitianReena Sharma, who suggests using theEatwell Guide. Check that “you still have protein, you still have healthy fats, you still have omega-3”. Although you can also get plant-based omega-3 from things such as walnuts and flaxseeds, the rate at which it is converted to what our body needs is low, so Sharma recommends taking a supplement.Ian Theasby, one half of the vegan meal companyBosh!, moved to a plant-based diet a decade ago; co-founder Henry Firth followed suit a few weeks later. “Mix up your plate so you’ve got a good variety of vegetables,” he says. “Colour is a great way to see if you’ve got variety on there, and then add little bits on. I tend to have a jar of mixed seeds that go on practically everything. It is about making sure that you’re getting a good variety every single day.”Find your go-to protein sourcesView image in fullscreenTempeh is high in protein and easy to digest.Photograph: alvarez/Getty ImagesTheasby gets most of his protein from tofu, lentils and beans: “Ten years ago, I would have looked at those and gone, ‘That is so boring and bland; why would I want to eat any of that?’ But actually, 50% of the protein that I get now is from those three ingredients and they are so wildly versatile.”Don’t be put off if your uptake in beans initially has a gaseous affect, says Rachel Ama, the author ofOne Pot: Three Waysand founder ofAma’s sauceswho went vegan nine years ago. “People always say: ‘The more beans you eat, the more you fart.’ But your body is adjusting, your gut is realigning. So if you do get gassy, it passes; it’s not a for ever thing. Your gut is enjoying it and it’s going to be able to handle it.”‘It’s actually a superfood!’ Why tempeh is suddenly on every menu – and coming to a supermarket near youRead more“One of the big revelations for me was tempeh,” says Richard Makin, the food writer behindSchool Night Veganand the author of Anything You Can Cook, I Can Cook Vegan. “Tempeh is a complete protein source, so it has all the major amino acids. It is much higher in protein than tofu. It tends to be closer to 25g of protein per 100g. Also, because it’s fermented, it is much easier to digest. I try to get tempeh in as many things as possible.”“Stick a block of tofu or tempeh into your pasta sauce and blend, to add additional fibre, calcium and protein,” says Sharma.Embrace tofu“At first I really missed scrambled eggs, because it is just such a cheat code for quick nutrition and tasty meals,” says Theasby. “So we came up with the ‘two tofu technique’.” This involves blending silken and firm tofu witha few other ingredientsincluding black salt (kala namak). “It gives you exactly the same mouthfeel, texture and satisfaction.”“Tofu can get a bad rep,” says Ama, “but if you just cook it nicely …” How so? “Get firm tofu for starters, and either pull it apart or chop it into little pieces. Then toss it in a tablespoon of cornflour, get a nonstick pan, a bit of oil, and cook it. This crisps up the outside layer and makes the inside a bit softer, so you have two texture comparisons. Smother it in a sauce, and then you get the flavour, a bit of crunch and a soft centre, and it’s just a lot more enjoyable and fancy.”“If you freeze tofu you can get an amazing texture,” says Sharma. “You thaw it, squeeze out all the water, and it becomes quite porous, so you can cook it in a broth and it will soak up the flavours. Then you can fry it, or cover it in batter. Or you can get blocks of silken tofu and just pour over chilli oil: it tastes so good and requires no cooking.”Fuel well for fitnessView image in fullscreenPeanut butter and jam bagels are an energising breakfast.Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images/iStockphoto“People say that you can’t get enough protein or energy on a plant-based diet – that is nonsense,” says Theasby. “I run ultra marathons.” How does he fuel himself for that? “For races, which are 31 miles and up, I prep by loading myself up with carbohydrates at least three days before. So that would be a big plate of pasta, sweet potato, or rice. And then on race day, my standard breakfast would be bagels with a good amount of raspberry jam and peanut butter, for fats, proteins and sugars and carbs. During the actual race, it’s just nailing loads of gels.” Afterwards, and during training, he has plant-based protein powders and shakes.Use plant milk and oilWhen baking, says Makin, “I tend to use plant milk as an alternative to eggs. I swap 50ml for a large egg, because it pretty much does exactly the same thing. I tend to use unflavoured, unsweetened soya milk because soy is the plant milk highest in lecithin, which is a naturally occurring emulsifier in soya beans – and also in egg yolks – and it mimics the way an egg binds quite closely.”With regards to butter, says Makin, “Unless you really do need a plant-based butter for buttercream, it is easily replaceable with either vegetable oil or extra virgin olive oil. What I learned from Philip Khoury, an incredible vegan baker and chocolatier, is that if you’re replacing the butter in a recipe with oil, whether it’s vegetable, sunflower or olive, you only need 80% of the butter’s weight because a lot of butter is water. So if you’re trying to convert a recipe, keep that in mind.”Snack well‘Don’t ever assume there’s anything to eat!’ 29 tips for perfect vegan holidays, from where to go to how to orderRead moreMake sure you are organised when you are out and about, in case plant-based options are limited. Sharma says she “always carries nuts”.“I’ve become one of those vegans who will eat raw tofu or tempeh as a snack to hit a macro target for my protein,” admits Makin. “It doesn’t bother me any more, whereas I think five years ago that would have been unthinkable.”Leave the cheeseAma says cheese is the thing she missed the most: “There are some really nice nut cheeses that are super cheesy and umami. But as far as melty vegan cheese, I’m not the biggest fan.”“I still don’t think that we have nailed vegan cheese,” agrees Makin. “There are some products where the flavour is there, but the texture isn’t. I tend to just do without.”Focus on versatile vegBefore going vegan: “Me and aubergine did not know each other, and now we are best friends,” says Ama. “Because it has that unique texture, you can use it to thicken stews or a bolognese, or you can smother it in a teriyaki and have a silky pull-apart texture. It can be used in many different ways and makes a main feast or a side.”“I wasn’t a big fan of mushrooms when I was a kid, because they used to remind me of slugs,” says Sugrue. “Now I’ve opened up to the world of mushrooms: there are so many different types, and you can do so much with them.”Veganise your favourite mealsView image in fullscreenSwap meat for beans and extra vegetables in a stew.Photograph: Carlo A/Getty Images“I like to think that we all have eight recipes that we rotate, and maybe sometimes we’ll switch up the ingredients a bit,” says Makin. “My advice is always to just try to veganise those things, then you tend not to feel quite so dislocated in your diet when you’ve made that switch.”Use the same formula as you would when cooking your favourites, says Ama. “I like to use coconut milk, cumin, turmeric and onions. Instead of adding the usual chicken or whatever meat you’d have, just put beans in it and more vegetables, so it’s not a completely unfamiliar recipe.”When lacking in week-night inspiration, try …“I have atofu tikka masala recipeon my blog,” says Makin. “It calls for vegan cream, which is probably the only processed ingredient in there. But what I found recently is that you can actually just blend silken tofu with a stick blender and it replaces the cream completely. It is delicious and really high in fibre and protein, so it gives an extra nutritional boost. I’ve got acauliflower cheeserecipe as well, which I am obsessed with. It teaches you how to make a really creamy white sauce that doesn’t require any vegan cheese. And then obviously you can use that as a bechamel, in a moussaka or lasagne.”Ama recommends “a big bean dish with black beans, kidney beans, brown beans and beluga lentils. Cook them with cinnamon, paprika, cumin, ground coriander and tomato paste. Add some onions, peppers, tomatoes, veg stock, salt, pepper, then just leave that to simmer on low and let the flavours infuse. It will last you a few days and you can serve it with different things like a jacket potato, pasta, or rice and avocado.” She also rates sweet potato brownies: “They are full of superfoods, like the sweet potatoes, cacao, almond butter and dates,” and even small children go wild for them.Theasby says he lives by the mantra “chop, toss, roast”: “Take a block of tofu. Cut it up into 2cm chunks. Take a vegetable of your choice, be that tomato, aubergine or carrot. Chop that into roughly the same size as the tofu, then toss it in the seasonings of your choice. I always add a little bit of nutritional yeast, because it gives a really beautiful, umami flavour, but also is really good for B12. Toss it with a bit of olive oil. Roast it for about 30 minutes, put it on a plate with some kimchi, hummus and salad. What you’ve got is a plate of excellent food, but also loads of fibre, protein and plants. It is very easy and there is minimal washing up.”Sharma swears by a dish her mother used to cook for her. “It’s an Indian dish called kitchari, and it’s just lentils with rice. You stick it in a slow cooker, or a saucepan on a low heat, and add some spices like turmeric or garam masala, cumin and salt, and you just boil it until it’s like a risotto. You can have it for breakfast as congee, or for lunch or an easy dinner, and you can add extras to it, like pickles, to make it a bit more exciting.”View image in fullscreenKitchari (rice and lentils) with a few extra ingredients.Photograph: Nikolay_Donetsk/Getty Images/iStockphotoSugrue likes to make a pot pie with whatever is left in the fridge: “mushrooms, leeks, onion, garlic, and then I use soy cream to make the sauce. You can add in plant-based chicken alternatives or chickpeas.” Homemade pastry? “No – we haven’t got time for that midweek. It is store bought.” Surprisingly, some of the ready to roll varieties are dairy-free anyway: “There are some good things that you wouldn’t ever think are vegan, that are.”Don’t worry if you have occasional lapses“Don’t beat yourself up if you find it too difficult and occasionally fall off the wagon,” says Theasby. “Most people will find the immediate restriction very difficult, because it is new to them. So give yourself the opportunity to have that cheeky bacon sandwich every now and again, or a plate of scrambled eggs. It is about introducing a lot more plant-based food into your diet, which is great for your health and the planet.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe expertsVeganismFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I remember, I’ll pop it in the fridge and save it to add to a stew or batter, but today’s rolls are my new favourite way of using it up.Beer bread with cheddar and chivesYou’ll need just 150ml beer to make these fluffy, super-flavourful buns. They’re a serious treat, and wonderful straight from the oven or dipped into a hearty stew. To build good gluten strength, especially when working with wholemeal flours, always add any extra flavourings such as cheese and herbs after the dough has had its initial proving time. (Incidentally, you could also use up any cheese rinds you have lying around in this recipe – the buns will absorb their wonderful intense flavours and distribute them throughout the crumb.Makes6 rolls500g bread flour– I used 400g bread flour mixed with 100g wholemeal spelt1½ tsp dried fast-action yeast(about 5g)½ tbsp sea salt(about 7–8g)300ml liquid– a combination of beer or ale and milk or water: I used 150ml leftover beer and 150ml milk60g melted butter, plus extra to finish2 tbsp honey, or sugar120g grated hard cheese– cheddar, gruyère or similar10g chives, or parsley, finely choppedLine a deep, roughly 20cm x 24cm oven tray with (ideally unbleached) baking paper. Put the flour in a large bowl and stir in the yeast and salt. Pour in the liquid, 40g of the melted butter and honey, then, using one hand, bring the mix together into a rough, slightly sticky dough.Turn out the dough on to a clean surface and knead for about eight minutes, until smooth and elastic. Return it to the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave somewhere warm for about an hour, until almost doubled in size.Turn out the dough again, stretch it out into a rectangle, then scatter with 80g of the grated cheese and most of the finely chopped chives, reserving a little for later. Fold over the dough to enclose the cheese and herbs, then knead into the dough and leave to rest for 15 minutes.Divide the dough into six even pieces and shape each one into a roll; fold any rough edges to the bottom while stretching the dough. Arrange the rolls next to each other on the lined tray, then scatter over half the remaining cheese. Cover again and leave to rise for another 45 minutes, again until doubled in size.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake the rolls for about 25 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Remove, brush with more melted butter, then sprinkle over the last of the cheese and herbs, and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteBreadBeerBakingCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is so serious about it, in fact, that her planning for next year starts now: she hits the January sales for everything that’ll keep for the next Christmas holiday – stocking fillers, festive candy, decorations, jumpers and socks – and it’s all stored neatly in a cupboard in anticipation of another gloriously executed December.We may not be quite as organised and foresightful as Bridget, but we are looking ahead to the coming year with the usual mix of excitement and angst, and starting to mentally put things in the calendar: maybe you have a spring holiday, or an autumn baby? Maybe there’s a visitor from abroad you’re looking forward to, or tickets for a once-in-a-lifetime gig? Even if there is nothing planned yet, summer is something we are always excited about, and the coming year starts to slot into place, as plans become experiences and, before we know it, memories. Time rushes forward, and suddenly it’s gone.View image in fullscreenBeige but brilliant … barley soup, a winter staple.Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The GuardianWhile traditionally this is a time of year to start a diet or “clean up” your eating habits, what’s really needed is to lean into old favourites: the dishes we grew up on and that were there for us in the past. There’s something quietly radical about indulging that nostalgia in January. About choosing familiarity over novelty, pleasure over punishment, comfort over guilt. Not because the past was better, but as a counterpoint to all that future planning, as well as a way to slow the flow of time if only a bit. In our house, that means bean and barley soup, a simple beige preparation that was a staple at Sarit’s house when she was growing up. Sure, it’s not a dish that we would ever make for guests, but whenever someone tries it, they get it immediately – nostalgia is a flavour that is universally recognised, and it is infinitely interesting to travel into someone’s past andtaste their memories.Maybe what presses your buttons is something from the school canteen, or a perfect iteration of aweeknight staple, or a homemade version of a beloved takeaway or ready-meal treat. After all, it might be that all that’s needed right now is to take a beat to look (or taste) back before another year rushes ahead.Our week in foodView image in fullscreenWhen life gives you oranges, make marmalade.Photograph: Dan Matthews/The GuardianPreservation orders|Every January, we take stock of our jam collection – most of the summer jams have already been used up or given as gifts, but there are plenty of things that we want to turn into jam – quinces are still around for a few more batches, lemons, clementines and blood oranges are perfect right now.

Inflationhas come downfrom its latest peak, mortgage rates have started falling and changes announced in the budget should takesome money off energy bills from April.But the price of housing, groceries and energy remain far higher than pre-pandemic, and there are some changes coming that will make aspects of life more expensive.Here are some dates that could affect your finances in the coming months.JanuaryDuring this month, mortgage customers on variable-rate deals should start benefiting fromDecember’s Bank of England rate cut.1stThe energy price cap goes up. The per unit price limit – set by the regulator, Ofgem, and recalculated every three months – willincrease by 0.2%, equivalent to taking the typical annual dual-fuel energy bill up by £3 to £1,758.This is the cap for direct debit customers. The prepayment cap is lower, while those who pay in arrears have a higher one. Your actual bill will depend on how much gas and electricity you use and the tariff you are on – some are now cheaper than the price cap.Investing in cryptoassets including bitcoin, stablecoins or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will involve more paperwork from this date.HM Revenue and Customs wants to make sure you are paying all relevant taxes, soyou will need to provide details, including your national insurance number, to any provider you use to buy, sell or transfer crypto. You should already have been declaring any taxable gains you have made.21stThe official inflation figures for December come out, havingfallen the previous month to 3.2%. The government has promised to tackle the rising cost of living, and so all eyes will be on the Office for National Statistics each month as it reports on prices.31stThe last day for filling in a self-assessment return for the 2024-25 tax year. Last January,more than 1 million people missed the deadlinefor filing. HMRC says 31,442 taxpayers left it to almost the last minute, submitting theirs between 11pm and 11.59pm on the day.This date is also the deadline for energy companies to ensure they have a tariff available with low standing charges to help customers who do not use a lot of energy.Ofgem had initially proposed tariffswith no daily standing charge, but this was watered down. It has warned consumers that these tariffs may have higher unit charges than others, so savings could be offset.February1stAlcohol duty will go up by 3.66%, in line with the RPI measure of inflation. According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, the change will add 10p to a bottle of white wine at 11% ABV, 39p to a bottle of 40% ABV whisky and 6p to a four-pack of 4.6% lager.5thThe Bank of England’s first interest rate decision of the year. The base rate ended 2025 at 3.75% after a cut at the last meeting. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said future decisions would be a “closer call”, so do not bet on another cut.March1stRegulated rail fares will not go up in England. In recent years, this has been the date for inflation-linked increases to come into effect, but in November the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,announced prices would be frozen.The government said otherwise a full-time commuter to London from Canterbury could have seen their annual season ticket rise by more than £400, to £8,929. About half of fares are unregulated and can go up at any time. Fares in London will go up by 5.8%.19thThe second interest rate decision of the year. Someforecasters are anticipating two cuts in 2026, with the first in March.This is also when thelimit on contactless card spending is scrapped. From now on, card providers can set their own but should allow customers to choose a lower one if they want.31stThe government’s household support fund is due to end. The fund was available to councils in England to help vulnerable people with the cost of essentials. It was put in place in October 2021 as the cost of living crisis began to bite and has been extended several times.April1stAbout 2.7 million workers will get pay increases. The national living wage, paid to those aged 21 and over, is going up by 4.1% to £12.71 an hour, which will add £900 a year to a full-time worker’s earnings.The national minimum wage for 18- to 20-year-olds is increasing by 8.5% to £10.85, while younger people and those on apprenticeships get a 6% pay rise to £8 an hour.NHS prescription charges will not increase. Paid in England, they will remain at £9.90 for each item. They are entirely free in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Several household bills will go up. The annual cost of a TV licence is pegged to September’s CPI inflation rate, which in 2025 was 3.8%. This will take it to just over £181 for a colour TV.Labour urged to rethink scrapping minimum wage youth rates amid ‘Neets’ riseRead moreWater bills are set to rise too. Details have not been announced, but one provider hasindicated it could increase bills by 11%. And council tax bills are likely to go up. Councils can raise them by up to 4.99% without a referendum.Energy bills should fall. The leading forecaster Cornwall Insight has forecast that changes in the budgetshould help cut the price cap by the equivalent of £138 a yearfor the typical dual-fuel bill. However, how much April’s cap moves will depend on other factors, including wholesale prices.Vehicle excise duty rates will go up in line with RPI.6thThe beginning of the 2026-27 tax year. Income tax thresholds have been frozen again, so some people getting pay rises will be pushed into a higher tax bracket.It is the last year in which under-65s will be able to put £20,000 into cash Isas. Banks may offer good rates to encourage people to take advantage of the full allowance.Some of the changes to inheritance tax announced in 2024’s autumn budget come into effect, cutting the reliefs available on agricultural land and business property and on shares listed on Aim.The tax on dividends goes up from 8.75% to 10.75% for basic rate taxpayers and 33.75% to 35.75% for higher rate taxpayers. You can earn up to £500 tax-free before those rates kick in.Thetwo-child benefit cap ends. The change will allow families to claim universal credit and child tax credits for more than two children.Increases in the state pension and a range of other benefits come into effect. Someone on a full new state pension will receive £241.30 a week.New rules onhow shops display pricescome into effect. The changes, which were delayed from the autumn, are designed to make it easier for shoppers to compare prices by making unit prices clearer and forcing retailers to give more information about loyalty pricing.30thThe Bank of England announces its third interest rate decision of the year.Explore more on these topicsMoneyHousehold billsUK cost of living crisisConsumer affairsInterest ratesBitcoinRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And social media mentions of its characters are outranking those of real-life superstarsElle HuntThu 1 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareWhenKPop Demon Hunterslanded on Netflix in late June, no one predicted it would become a globe-sweeping, chart-topping phenomenon. The near-instant success of the animated kids’ film caught the industry by surprise, and six months later, fans are still hungry for merchandise, music, spin-offs and more stories. Here’s what you may have missed.It’s an animated ‘musical urban fantasy film’The story follows aK-popgirl group called Huntr/x (pronounced “Huntrix”), who are also demon hunters, responsible for protecting humanity from supernatural threats with their combat skills and empowering pop. Their rivals are the Saja Boys, who are secretly demons. When the groups are pitted against one another, the stakes are peace on Earth, and in particular the Honmoon: the magical barrier that protects humans from the underworld. Conflict, and personal growth, ensues.View image in fullscreenUp, up and away … Rumi of Huntr/xPhotograph: NetflixIt’s Netflix’s biggest title. EverIn September itreached 300m views, overtaking the 2021 action movie Red Notice as the platform’s most-watched film ever. In October, the film wascredited with liftingNetflix’s revenue by 17%. It has not just been commercially successful: Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoespresently rates it closeto 100% “fresh”, from critics and audiences.It features real K-pop hitmakers …Seasoned K-pop producers, writers and musicians worked on the film, among them singer Kevin Woo (former member of boyband U-KISS), producer Teddy Park (who has worked with Blackpink) and Lindgren and Stephen Kirk (both former collaborators of K-pop royaltyBTS). The film’s executive music producer Ian Eisendrathsaidhis aim was for the soundtrack to reflect K-pop as “the most theatrical genre of pop”.… and harnesses the power of fansOne of the film’s charms lies in itsfond and fastidiously true-to-liferepresentation of modern pop fandoms. Huntr/x and Saja Boys’ fans engage with their idols on social media, coordinate to drive streams and stoke rivalries. Life is now mirroring art: Huntr/x and Saja Boys have spawned real-world fan armies. In July, marketing company Pulsarfound thatsocial media mentions of the fictitious groups were outranking those of superstars such as Lady Gaga, Ed Sheeran and Billie Eilish.View image in fullscreenHunting demons … Rumi, Mira and Zoey.Photograph: NetflixIt’s also one of the biggest soundtracks of the yearKPop Demon Hunters became the first ever soundtrack to have four songs simultaneously in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 (andthree in the UK Top 5). It is Spotify’ssecond most-streamed album of 2025and it hasnow spent more thanfour months at the top of the global Billboard charts. It has also received five nominations for next year’s Grammy awards, including Song of the Year for girl-power anthem Golden.Two of the singing voices of Huntr/x,EjaeandRei Amei, have been signed for global representation, and in November, Wooperformed his firstUS solo concert.It’s even been a box office hitA special singalong version of the film was released in cinemas eight weeks after the film hit Netflix, and proved remarkably popular.More than 1,300 screeningsin the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand sold out, and the film topped the US box office for the penultimate weekend of August.It has sent social mediainto a frenzyPictures of the Huntr/x trio have been made into memes, their on-screen choreography has been widely copied on TikTok, and content creators are extending the story with fan fiction.

The film’s demon-hunters are inspired bymudang, shamans who have been warding off demons with song and dance for hundreds of years. “Our hunters do the same thing through concerts,” Kang said.Meanwhile, Huntr/x’s diet includes Korean delicacies such as kimbap (sushi roll), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) and milk tea, as well as their own Huntr/x-branded ramyeon noodles. Meanwhile the Saja Boys win over fans by preparing Korean hotdogs at a street-food stall.You haven’t heard the last fromHuntr/xA sequelis reportedly slated but not until 2029, partly to give the industry time to catch up with the film’s surprise success. Dolls, toys and merchandisehave only recently goneinto production, and won’t land in stores until well into next year. (Mattelis furiously at workon a full set of Huntr/x dolls, expected to retail for $150.)That’s not to say we won’t be hearing more from Huntr/x soon. Golden isa strong favouritefor best original song at next year’s Oscars, where KPop Demon Hunters is alsoa prime contenderfor best animated film.All told, we can expect Huntr/x’s golden run to continue into 2026.

Instead, she said, body parts might have been removed as part of a funerary ritual, perhaps to be carried as tokens.Dr Jessica Thompson, a senior author of the study from Yale University, said that, while such practices may not seem relatable, people still keep locks of hair or relatives’ ashes for scattering in a meaningful place.The researchers said the rock shelter appears to have been used as a natural monument, with burials occurring from about 16,000 to 8,000 years ago. As well as complete skeletons, very small collections of bones from different individuals have been found.“[This] supports our hypothesis that some of the missing bones from the cremated woman may have been deliberately removed and taken as tokens for curation or reburial elsewhere,” said Dr Ebeth Sawchuk, a co-author of the study from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.The team also found flakes and points from stone-knapping within the pyre, which might have been added as part of a funeral ritual.“Were people actively throwing these things into the fire or … were they in the body itself?” said Thompson. Cerezo-Román said one possibility is that people were knapping stones to cut the woman’s flesh.The team also found the pyre was about the size of a queen-sized mattress, and would have taken considerable knowledge, skill and coordination to build and maintain, while the two clusters of bones indicate the body was moved during cremation.While it is unclear why the woman was given such special treatment, the team found at least one fire was subsequently made directly above the location of the pyre – possibly as an act of remembrance.However, the site also has evidence of multiple campfires, with Thompson noting it is likely the shelter would also have been used for daily life.View image in fullscreenSharp points of grey flint and rock from stone-knapping found in the pyre.Photograph: Justin PargeterWriting inthe journal Science Advances, the team note the oldest known pyre containing human remains was previously found in Alaska, and dates to about 11,500 years ago – however, that was for a young child.Indeed, most burned human remains dating back 8,000 years or more have not been found in a pyre, and prior to the latest find the earliest confirmed intentional cremations in Africa only appeared about 3,500 years ago, amongpastoral Neolithic people.Thompson said the discovery that different people merited different treatment in death “suggests that in life, they also would have had a lot more complexity to their social roles than I ever imagined, or that certainly is stereotypically described for tropical hunter-gatherers, especially this old”.Joel Irish, a professor of anthropology and archaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the discovery.“That it is such an early date, and that they would have been transient as hunter-gatherers makes it more amazing,” he said.“They clearly had advanced belief systems and a high level of social complexity at this early date.”Explore more on these topicsAnthropologyArchaeologyAfricaMalawinewsShareReuse this content"

Thomas Byrnes, chief executive of MarketImpact, a consultancy for the humanitarian sector, has been tracking aid cuts throughout the past year and said the $2bn was significantly less than the $3.38bn in funds given by the US to the UN in 2025, all of which was provided under the previous Biden administration.“This is a carefully staged political announcement that obscures more than it reveals,” said Byrnes.He said the contribution was better than nothing but that it would have a limited impact in the context of other US decisions, includingcutting $5bn in foreign assistance already approved by Congressas “woke, weaponised and wasteful spending” and a proposal toend support for peacekeepingmissions – for which italready owes the United Nations $1.5bn.Death by aid cuts: how a decision in the US led to the loss of a mother in YemenRead moreByrnes suggested that channelling the money through Ocha may be less about partnership and more an attempt to centralise control and have one UN body on which to make demands about how aid should be distributed.Patz shared that concern and said he was worried about whether the money would even materialise if the UN failed to meet the expectations set out by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,to “cut bloat, remove duplication”.“I would be cautious,” he said. “This is $2bn promised, but not $2bn given.”Explore more on these topicsAidAid cutsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUnited NationsUSAIDUS politicsHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

The band’s contract runs until 2029.Ador is also suing an unnamed member of Danielle’s family and the band’s former producer Min Hee-jin for damages and as part of a contract break penalty, alleging they both bore “significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for NewJeans’ departure and delayed return”.‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that the total amount sought from the three individuals amounts to nearly 43.1bn won (US$30m, £22m, A$45m).NewJeans made headlines in November 2024 when they announced their decision to leave Ador, prompting the company to request an injunction barring them from any commercial activities. That request was granted in March.Danielle’s contract has been terminated, the label said on Monday, as it was “determined that it would be difficult for her to continue as … an artist under Ador”.The label claimed that NewJeans’ members had been “exposed to persistently distorted and biased information” which had led to “significant misunderstandings”.The Guardian has reached out to Danielle for comment.According to Ador, three of the group’s four remaining members have decided to stay with the label, while member Minji is still in talks with the company.NewJeans, which made its debut in 2022, is among Hybe’s most successful acts. After the lawsuit against Danielle was announced, fans took to social media with the slogan: “NewJeans is five or nothing”.The dramatic contractual dispute erupted last year following allegations that Hybe had forced out Min, the band’s producer, from her role as Ador’s CEO.NewJeans members later issued an ultimatum demanding Min’s reinstatement, which Hybe rejected. The members then went public with their grievances, alleging the company had deliberately undermined their careers.Vietnamese-Australian band member Hanni Pham claimed that the band had endured mistreatment, including “deliberate miscommunications and manipulation” while working with the label. In October she delivered emotional testimony before South Korea’s parliament over the allegations, saying: “I know it’s not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace.”Danielle has also claimed that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management, an allegation Ador or Hybe have not responded to.In October, the Seoul Central district court rejected NewJeans’s claims that the allegations had caused an “irreparable breakdown of trust” with Ador.Weeks later, South Korea’s employment ministry also dismissed a workplace bullying complaint made by Pham against Ador, stating that the members were not legally employees of Ador, but “exceptional entities”.The spat sparked panic in the K-pop industry, as it fuelled discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.In a joint statement to Time magazineafter the injunction against them was granted, the band said: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”In November, Ador announced that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the agency, sparking fears among fans that NewJeans would split up. But Hanni, Danielle and Minji released a separate statement hours later clarifying that they would also return – but now it is clear, not for long.Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaPop and rockAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

I obviously had a lot of help. To my parents, who are over there, thank you for your sacrifices that never made the highlights reel.”Khawaja moved to Sydney from Pakistan as a child, and scored his first Ashes century there with 171 against England in 2018.The veteran called out the racial stereotyping he had received in the media in the past and in the lead up to the Ashes regarding his preparation and back issues in the first Test.“[Comments] like, ‘he’s not committed to the team,’” Khawaja said. “‘He was only worried about himself. He played this golf comp the day before. He’s selfish. He doesn’t train hard enough. He didn’t train the day before the game. He’s lazy.’“These are the same stereotypes, the racial stereotypes I’ve grown up with my whole life … That was the thing that disappointed me the most, because I thought we were past that. But there’s still a little bit out there, which I still have to fight every single day, which is the frustrating thing for me.”View image in fullscreenAustralian cricketer Usman Khawaja announces his retirement during a press conference.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPBowing out at the SCG against England will be a fitting location, given it was there Khawaja made his Test debut in the 2010-11 Ashes series, and is close to his home.“Funnily enough, I live just up the road from the SCG,” he said.“And I’ll never forget when I was younger, I saw Michael Slater drive in his red Ferrari. I couldn’t believe my luck. I just saw a Test cricketer. And as a boy, whose parents were barely scraping through in trying to provide for their kids in a little two-bedroom apartment, I thought, ‘One day, I’m going to be a Test cricketer and one day I can drive whatever I want.’”Australia ‘more robust’ and can handle pressure better than England, believes BaylissRead moreIt was also at the SCG that he revived his career as a 35-year-old, scoring twin centuries against England when Travis Head missed a Test in 2022 due to Covid.That prompted one of the great late-career revivals, hitting seven centuries in his first two years back in the side.“This game humbles you,” Khawaja said.“It tests your patience, your resilience and your character. And if you’re lucky, it teaches you gratitude.“Even on days that it doesn’t go your way, I hope I’ve inspired many children along the way, particularly those who feel that they are different, those who feel they don’t belong, or those others tell they will never make it. I felt all these things growing up, and trying to be an Australian cricketer, but seeing is believing.View image in fullscreenKhawaja bats during day two of the fourth Test.Photograph: Morgan Hancock/Cricket Australia/Getty Images“I’m a proud Muslim, coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now. And you can do the same.“As I walk off for the last time, I do so with gratitude and peace. Or as we say, ‘salam’. Grateful for the journey, the people, the lessons. Thank you for letting me live my dream and for sharing it with me.”Khawaja’s position had come under extra scrutiny this summer after being unable to play in the first Test in Perth due to back spasms, then missing the Brisbane Test with the injury.He was initially left out in Adelaide before Steve Smith’s vertigo allowed him to return. Scoring 82 in the first innings ensured he would stay in the side for the fourth Test in Melbourne.Khawaja becomes just the second player to walk away while still in the Australian Test team in the past decade, after David Warner’s exit two summers ago.Usman Khawaja’s Test career:Tests: 87Runs: 6,206Average: 43.39Centuries: 16Half-centuries: 28Explore more on these topicsUsman KhawajaAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

We stand ready to provide consular assistance.”‘It happened in seconds’: sudden inferno brings horror to Swiss ski resortRead moreConsular assistance can include communicating with or visiting local hospitals, local authorities, provision of lists of medical providers and assistance communicating with family members.Swiss police said the fire started at about 1.30am, local time (0030 GMT), in a bar popular with tourists called Le Constellation, which is located in the centre of the Valais resort.Video of the incident shows orange flames billowing from inside the ground-floor bar and lounge. Screams and loud music can be heard, and several people were seen collapsed outside the building.Some people who died in the blaze have not been able to be identified yet due to the severity of their burns.Australians concerned about family members who may have been caught up in the fire were advised to call Dfat’s 24/7 consular emergency support line on 1300 555 135.Swiss police said arson was not responsible for the blaze, which is thought to be the result of an accident.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSwitzerlandChris BowennewsShareReuse this content"

This goes beyond politics, it’s about the future of our country,” it said.“As business leaders and proud Australians committed to upholding our values of tolerance and mutual respect, we recognise the need for clear answers as to how the Bondi massacre could occur.”The signatories want an end to “the unprecedented harassment, intimidation and violence” directed at the Australian Jewish community since 7 October 2023, when Hamas invaded southern Israel and killed more than 1,000 people and took another 251 hostage.The incursion sparked a massive response from Israel which began bombing Gaza,killing many thousandsof Palestinians.Meanwhile, Australia’s most senior Catholics have also joined the call for a broader inquiry into antisemitism in a separate letter published on Friday.The Catholic archbishop of Perth, Timothy Costelloe, said while the Richardson review was an important step to prevent a repeat of the Bondi attack, there was a need to confront and eradicate the deeper roots of antisemitism in Australia.“It is only by shining a light into the dark corners of our society … that we can hope to unmask the antisemitism which might otherwise go unseen, unacknowledged and unaddressed,” the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference president said.“For that reason, alongside the Richardson review, some form of wider, national inquiry with sufficient authority and resourcing which can probe into the deeper issues which lie at the heart of antisemitism is needed.”The NSW government will hold a state-based royal commission, which will have the cooperation of federal agencies, the federal government has said.Albanese remained unswayed on Thursday after the human rights commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, said a national probe was “essential”.The prime minister was pressed for names after declaring he had been advised by “actual experts” to hold a departmental review.He cited Richardson as one of the experts, along with the heads of security authorities.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said one of the drones was carrying an incendiary mixture that sparked a blaze.On Thursday evening a Ukrainian military spokesperson told the Interfax Ukraine news agency that Kyiv’s forces exclusively targeted Russian military or energy sites.The general staff spokesperson did not refer specifically to Russian accounts of a strike on a hotel, but said all strikes by the Ukrainian military were published on a general staff social media page.“The Defence Forces of Ukraine adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law and strike exclusively at enemy military targets, fuel and energy facilities of the Russian Federation, and other legitimate targets,” Interfax quoted the spokesperson as saying.A number of Russian officials condemned the attack. The chair of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, said it strengthened Russia’s resolve to quickly achieve its goals in its almost four-year invasion of Ukraine.The strike “once again demonstrates the validity of our initial demands”, Matviyenko said.The statement follows claims from Moscow that Ukraine had launched a long-range drone attack against one of Vladimir Putin’s official residences in north-western Russia on Tuesday. Kyiv said the claims were a lie.Did Ukraine target Putin’s residence or is Russian claim a ploy to sway Trump?Read moreRussia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that its specialists had accessed the navigation system in one of the drones it claimed was used in the attack, and that data extracted confirmed that Putin’s residence was the target.The ministry did not share evidence of its findings, but officials said it would transfer the data to US officials “through established channels”.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the CIA had determined thatno attempted attack had taken place. Donald Trump had initially said he was “very angry” about the purported attack, but he later posted a link on social media to a New York Post editorial describing the Russian claims as “bluster”.Russia’s defence ministry also released a video of a downed drone it said was involved in the attack.The night-time clip shows a man in camouflage gear, a helmet and a Kevlar vest standing near a damaged drone lying in snow. The man, his face covered, talks about the drone. Neither the man nor the defence ministry provided any location or date, and neither the video nor its claims could be independently verified.Kyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin’s residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have gathered pace in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in his new year address that apeace deal was “90% ready”but that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live”.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said on Wednesday that he, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process”.“We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of [the] peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart,” he wrote on X.Ukraine’s lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, reaffirmed that European and Ukrainian officials planned to meet on Saturday, and Zelenskyy is expected to hold talks with European leaders next week.With additional reporting by the Associated PressExplore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinnewsShareReuse this content"

Two women told the French broadcaster BFMTV a bartender carried a female member of staff who was holding one of the bottles.Satellite photo of locationThe flames set fire to the ceiling. Within seconds the blaze had spread, engulfing a crowded basement packed with revellers. Many were teenagers. One of the women described a crowd surge as people desperately tried to escape up a narrow flight of stairs.‘It happened in seconds’: sudden inferno brings horror to Swiss ski resortRead moreHundreds gathered in silence in the freezing cold on Thursday evening, laying flowers and lighting candles. Many at the night-time vigil knew people who remain unaccounted for, or were badly injured.Ulysse Brozzo, 16, an instructor at a local ski school, said earlier in the day that several of his friends were in the club at the time.He said he had spoken to some who were safe, but had yet to hear from others he knew were inside when the fire broke out. A friend of a friend was in a coma at Sion hospital. “It’s a total tragedy,” he said. “There were hundreds of people inside.”View image in fullscreenA new year mass at the Catholic church of Montana Station to remember the victims of the fire at the Le Constellation on 1 January.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APVideo posted by survivors showed the blaze taking hold immediately above the bar. Other footage showed grim scenes of orange flames billowing from a ground-floor lounge and several people lying motionless on the street.The canton prosecutor for Valais, Beatrice Pilloud, said she could not comment on reports that lighted candles had caused the inferno. “An investigation is taking place. It will identify the exact circumstances of what happened,” she said, confirming that the basement steps were very narrow. She said it was too early to draw any conclusions about emergency exits.1:19'I'm very worried': residents wait as victim identification under way in Switzerland – videoFrédéric Gisler, the canton’s police commander, said his officers arrived at the scene at 1.32am, two minutes after receiving an emergency call. He described the situation as “unprecedented”. A red alert was issued, with multiple firefighting teams, 42 ambulances and 13 helicopters sent to the area.“Their first mission was to provide care to the victims … and direct them to the various hospitals. The firefighters at the same time secured the site,” he said.The injured were dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich. Parmelin – speaking in his first day in the job as Switzerland’s new head of state – said some of those who survived were “severely injured”. They had suffered serious burns, as well as damage to their lungs. Lausanne university hospital said it was treating 22 patients aged between 16 and 26.View image in fullscreenA hearse car in front of Le Constellation on Thursday.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/APThe hospital’s general manager, Claire Charmet, saideight of them were resuscitated on arrival. They were now being treated in critical and specialised care units. “This will be a long and intensive process, lasting several weeks, perhaps even months,” she said.Investigators now have the grisly task of identifying the victims and taking DNA samples from their families. Some of those caught up in the fire were visiting the ski resort from neighbouring countries. Italy’s foreign ministry said 16 of its nationals were missing and 12 were among the injured. France said eight of its citizens were missing and it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.2:50Video dispatch: Crans-Montana mourns nightclub victimsCrans-Montana is a bustling resort town of about 10,000 people perched high in the Valais canton of the Swiss Alps, with a view across the valley to the famed Matterhorn mountain. Unlike nearby Verbier, which attracts a wealthy anglophone crowd, Crans-Montana is popular mainly with wealthy Europeans.But Le Constellation itself was more of a cheap and cheerful bar for younger people and tourists.View image in fullscreenThe fire inside Le Constellation, Crans-Montana.Photograph: XBrozzo, the ski instructor, said the venue was set over two floors, with a bar on the main floor and narrow stairs leading to a basement nightclub below, where he speculated it would have been possible for people to have become trapped and incapacitated from smoke inhalation.He said shisha pipes were available to smoke. “What people are saying is that the charcoal on the shisha could have spilled and caused the fire,” Brozzo said.Swiss officials called the blaze aembrasement généralisé. The French firefighting term describes how a fire can trigger the release of combustible gases. These then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would term a flashover or a backdraft.map of SwitzerlandSpeaking on Thursday morning, Mathias Reynard, the president of the Valais canton, said what should have been a moment of celebration “turned into a nightmare”. He said he was devastated by the tragedy. “I can’t hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,” he told a press conference.Le Constellation opened in 2015 and could accommodate up to 300 people inside, with another 40 on a heated terrace, French media reported. The bar’s Facebook and Instagram pages appear to have been deleted and are unavailable.The owner of the Dédé clothing store, directly across the street from Le Constellation, said the venue was a popular destination for younger people – including the children of her friends, who would often drink there from as young as 14 years old.View image in fullscreenPeople gather outside Le Constellation bar on Thursday evening.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersFrançois, 17, a ski instructor who said he had often partied at the bar, said new year parties were known as being more lax in terms of checking the age of bar entrants.The town relies heavily on a largely European clientele who come to ski, eat in several Michelin-starred restaurants and shop at Moncler and Louis Vuitton stores. It has about 3,000 hotel rooms and 10,000 residents.In a region busy with tourists skiing on the slopes, the authorities have called on people to show caution in the coming days. They urged them to avoid any accidents that could require medical resources that are already overwhelmed.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Dawn was far off and the teenagers and twenty-somethings were in no hurry to leave the bar. It was, after all, New Year’s Day.Outside, darkness draped Crans-Montana, a ski resort in the Swiss Alps with a reputation for posh luxury. Le Constellation, however, had few pretensions: a cavernous venue with TV screens on the top floor to watch sport, and a basement with low lighting, loud music and a dancefloor.It attracted a young crowd, including under-18s, mainly fromSwitzerlandand continental Europe, and early on Thursday morning hundreds thronged the venue to see in 2026. Many would not live to see the sunrise.Investigators are still investigating the cause ofthe horrorthat began at 1.30am.Two witnesses said a bartender carried a female member of staff on his shoulders who was holding a champagne bottle that contained a lit sparkler, or flare, near the wooden ceiling above the bar area.

Others speculated that charcoal for shisha pipes may have spilled.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

Video posted on social media, also unverified, showed people, silhouetted by fire, hastening through the venue while music continued to play. Some patrons used sweaters to try to extinguish flames, a witness said.Le Constellation bar fire in Switzerland: what we know so farRead moreThe blaze turned into what Swiss officials called anembrasement généralisé, a term for a fire that releases combustible gases that can ignite violently, triggering what English-speaking firefighters call a flashover or backdraft.Le Constellation became an inferno.“The whole ceiling was in flames and the fire spread really fast. It happened in seconds,” two survivors, identified as Emma and Albane, later told the French network BFMTV.Satellite photo of locationThe conflagration was so sudden that some thought it was an explosion. Screams and cries filled the basement as people tried to escape. Many surged towards a door leading to a narrow flight of stairs. Others smashed windows that turned black and opaque.Axel Clavier, a 16-year-old from Paris, felt as if he was suffocating. He used a table to push a plexiglass pane out of its casing, allowing him to flee the “total chaos”, he told Associated Press.From the street, people rushed to help. “I thought that my little brother was inside so I came and I tried to break the window to help people to exit,” one man told the BBC. He saw people “burning from head to foot, no clothes any more”.View image in fullscreenRescue workers and firefighters near the scene of the fire in the early hours of Thursday.Photograph: Police Cantonale Valaisanne/APSome witnesses likened the scene to a horror film. Dominic Dubois described an appalling spectacle as flames engulfed the venue. “You could see the orange, the orange, yellow, red,” he told Reuters.Police reached the scene at 1.32am, two minutes after reports of smoke.Bystanders and first responders worked together to pull people from oven-like temperatures into the cold outside, Dubois said. “One of the priorities was to get everyone warm ... the curtains of the restaurant were used.”A UBS bank branch opened to offer refuge, he said. “All the tables were pushed aside and people entered and it was warm in there, there was more light as well, so the triage was down there.”1:19'I'm very worried': residents wait as victim identification under way in Switzerland – videoAll through the night convoys of fire engines, police vehicles and about 40 ambulances raced to Crans-Montana, a picturesque area of snowy peaks and pine forests transformed into what may be one of the worst disasters in Switzerland’s recent history. About 10 helicopters joined the response.As news spread, parents and other relatives of those who had been inside the bar made their way to the scene.“There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,” Samuel Rapp, 21, a local resident, told Reuters. “They had jackets over their faces.” Rapp said he had seen videos showing revellers trampling each other to escape. “People were shouting, ‘help me, please help us’.”Dozens of the injured, many in serious condition, swiftly filled hospitals in the Valais canton. More than a dozen were taken to Zurich university hospital, 150 miles to the north. A hospital in Lausanne that treated 22 patients said ages ranged from 16 to 26. Hospitals in neighbouring countries are expected to treat some victims.About 40 people died and 115 were injured, the Valais canton police commander, Frédéric Gisler, told a news conference, adding that the community was devastated. There was no detail given about the ages or nationalities of the dead.By 1pm bright sunshine lit up incongruous scenes in the centre of Crans-Montana: fake reindeer and Christmas decorations amid emergency vehicles, posters for new year parties amid huddles of hushed bystanders.Switzerland’s president, Guy Parmelin, visited the scene, where forensic teams worked behind white screens. Families were still awaiting news of loved ones, he said. “Some don’t yet know if their children have died.”Location mapSwitzerland will fly flags at half-mast for five days, Parmelin said. “What was meant to be a moment of joy has turned the first day of the year in Crans-Montana into a day of mourning affecting the entire country and beyond.” Many of the dead were young people with “projects, hopes and dreams”, he said.Valais canton’s attorney general, Beatrice Pilloud, rejected arson or terrorism as probable causes of the fire. “At no moment is there a question of any kind of attack,” she told reporters. Asked about emergency exits in the bar, she said it was too early to draw conclusions. There had been no arrests and there were no suspects, she said.View image in fullscreenPeople leave flowers outside the bar on Thursday.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersAs darkness fell across Crans-Montana on Thursday evening, blotting out its view of the Matterhorn mountain, shock and disbelief hovered over the town.Le Constellation was an institution, a bar that served mainly locals, not tourists. Unlike many other bars and clubs, it often had no cover charge and so attracted young people.Dozens of local teenagers, some in tears, gathered by the police cordon and laid flowers. The impromptu vigil drew Milica Lazic, who said she had heard no news about a friend who worked at the bar.Tourists continued to shop, ski and eat at restaurants. “I don’t think it means they don’t care, but they don’t know anyone involved,” said Ernesto Perila, 56, a cafe owner. “Life goes on, the world continues. I don’t think badly of anyone for that.”In the chill air, forensic teams, cloaked by the screens, continued their work.Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We ask all the people of the world to be our voice. The Islamic Republic is the enemy of us all.”Video footage shared on social media appears to show the use of gunfire by security forces against protesters as crowds run through smoke-filled streets and apparently injured people being carried away.On Thursday evening the Tasnim news agency reported that Iranian authorities in Tehran had arrested 30 people on suspicion of public order offences.“After a coordinated operation by the security and intelligence services, 30 people accused of disturbing public order in the Malard district of western Tehran were identified and arrested last night,” the report said.‘There’s no going back’: Iran’s women on why they won’t stop flouting dress code lawsRead moreThe protests, initially sparked by the collapse of the national currency, began on Sunday in the capital, Tehran, but havesince spread to cities across the country,with demonstrators chanting for economic justice and demanding an end to the regime.Roya Boroumand, managing director of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, said the protests were being driven by the drop in the value of currency and its impact on the cost of living.“Iranians are living below poverty lines in increasing numbers and have no hope [of] any notable improvement of their living conditions,” she said.“They are angry at the state’s mismanagement and corruption, and policies that are causing misery inside the country.“The state deems any protest that is anti-government illegal and the law does not really open space to legal protest. That is why we see a pattern of popular outbursts and deadly crackdown.”The protests come after a year of a record number of executions in Iran, with more than1,500 people put to death in 2025– the highest number since 1989. Human rights groups say the Iranian authorities have used the death penalty to instil fear among the population and crush dissent.“Executions are being carried out following grossly unfair trials held behind closed doors, amid widespread patterns of torture and forced confessions,” said Amnesty director Hussein Baoumi.Explore more on these topicsIranRights and freedomMiddle East and north AfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli government says entry of these items must be severely restricted because they could be exploited by Hamas or other armed groups for military ends.However, for at least a month, Israeli authorities have allowed businesses to transport multiple dual-use items intoGaza, including generators and metal pallets, which are more durable in winter rains and mud than wooden alternatives.These are now on sale in the open market in Gaza, according to military, diplomatic and humanitarian sources. They must pass through the same three tightly controlled Israeli checkpoints that currently bar shipments of these goods for aid organisations.“It seems highly improbable that the Israelis don’t know about them,” said one diplomatic source. “It’s very shocking that these things are able to enter through commercial channels.”The disparity limits the work of humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians at a time ofdesperate need, while providing lucrative opportunities to commercial traders who can secure import permits from Israeli authorities.The American commander of a new US base in southern Israel has been briefed on such dual-use restrictions. Lt Gen Patrick Frank has discussed the controls with diplomats and humanitarians at the Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC), which was established in October to monitor the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire and plan for Gaza’s future. His views on the matter are not known.Israel has a long track record of exploiting access to Gaza to further its political goals, said Tania Hary, executive director of Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that has been monitoring controls for 20 years.“On the surface the private sector [shipments of items on the dual-use list] can appear to be very confusing and an inconsistency,” she said. “But I see it as very consistent with their policy of trying to strengthen the hand of certain actors and weaken the hand of others.”Entry controls on items such as generators did not reflect “the inherent risk or danger of the item itself”, she said. “It’s a question of: whose hands is it in? Where is it? How is it being used?”View image in fullscreenShelter is a critical need in Gaza as winter sets in  but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents ‘dual use’.Photograph: APAImages/ShutterstockIsraeli restrictions have long made trade into Gazaparticularly lucrativefor those Palestinians and Israelis who can secure permits. Items on the dual-use list now sell for huge premiums inside Gaza.“The only way to get a generator right now is on the private sector,” said Sam Rose, acting director for Gaza for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. “There’s a mark up on that.”“My understanding is that it is the business interests on all sides – Israeli, Egyptian, Palestinian – with some of the security companies that enjoy Israeli protection also taking a cut alongside other criminal elements, all in all supporting the growth of an illegal economy,” Rose added. “What’s not clear to me is whether Hamas is getting a cut. I would assume so but have not seen any confirmation of this.”Ahmed Alkhatib, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that when it came to commercial deliveries into Gaza, “You’re not just paying fees and taxes to Hamas in Gaza, you’re paying fees and taxes to merchants on the Israeli side. We all know that Gaza was and will always be a massive market for the Israeli economy.”Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry unit that controls access to Gaza, denied “preventing or delaying” aid shipments into Gaza or applying looser restrictions for commercial traders.“The policy governing the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip is approved by the political echelon in Israel and implemented by Cogat in a uniform manner vis-a-vis the UN, international organisations, donor countries, and the private sector,” a spokesperson said in a statement.For dual-use items, Israel “offers international organisations alternatives that allow and facilitate a humanitarian response”, the statement said, without providing any details. Spokesperson Shimi Zuaretz also said medical aid organisations had been given permits to bring generators into Gaza “over the last month”.The Israeli military referred questions about aid shipments into Gaza to Cogat. The US military declined to comment.The shipment controls are the latest instance of Israel weaponising aid for political and military goals in Gaza. Over the summer Israelcaused a faminein parts of the territory by blocking food shipments for weeks, then allowing only a trickle of aid to enter, killing hundreds of people.Israel this week told37 NGOs active in Gaza they would have to cease all operations within 60 days, unless they hand over detailed information on their Palestinian staff.Diplomats and humanitarian officials have said that stopping the work of the NGOs listed would have catastrophic consequences and put Palestinian lives at risk.“The EU has been clear: the NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form,” the EU humanitarian chief, Hadja Lahbib, posted on social media. “IHL [international humanitarian law] leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need.”“The reality is that the commercial sector can bring in what it wants [now],” said Rose. “Items not approved for humanitarian organisations, such as generators, are available commercially. So we have a two-tier system, which is undermining the UN-led system, which Israel is required to support as per international law.”US forces deployed to the CMCC arrived in October prepared to launch a major logistics effort to get aid supplies into Gaza.They were surprised and confused to find the biggest challenge was political, and began clashing with Israeli counterparts over some of the restrictions almost immediately, said multiple sources briefed on meetings at the base.An early confrontation was over tent poles. Shelter is a critical need as winter sets in because Israeli attacks have destroyed nine out of 10 Palestinian homes, but Israel deems metal tent poles needed for sturdy winter-proof tents “dual use”.US officers at the CMCC rapidly drew up a list of at least a dozen key humanitarian items they wanted removed from the dual-use list, with tent poles near the top. Weeks later Israel has not lifted restrictions on any of them.“It is clearly not security interests that are driving decision-making here,” said one western source. “The dual-use list is just another way to control what enters Gaza.”Restrictions on the type and quantity of goods allowed into Gaza long preceded the current war. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from the territory in 2005 but maintained effective control of the borders and used that to impose a blockade.“It has always been a form of control over the wellbeing of the population,” said the Gisha director, Hary. “Whether that’s the bare minimum of humanitarian standards we are looking at now, or in previous years in terms of economic life, construction, industry, development in technology and agriculture and innovation.”The dual-use list, which requires a security assessment and permits to import items to Gaza, has been a particular concern since it was introduced.It is sweeping in its scope, secret until an item is rejected and has been imposed arbitrarily. Older versions obtained by Gisha through legal action include categories such as “communications equipment” – so broad it could cover most modern electronics.Items barred on dual-use grounds over the last two years include solar panels, smoke detectors, crutches, wheelchairs and walkers.Aid groups have collaborated to compile an unofficial list of rejected items in an effort to limit the amount of time and money spent applying to import things that are unlikely to get approval. But it is time consuming.International pressure on Israel over the dual-use list has also flagged over the last two years, and even with the creation of the CMCC.Diplomats are concerned about spiralling violence in the West Bank and uncertainty about long-term plans for Gaza’s reconstruction, as aid groups are negotiating possible de-registration by Israel.The dual-use list is not the only bureaucratic obstacle limiting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Some items are banned because Israel has decided they don’t address urgent humanitarian needs.This category includes paper and pencils to restart schools after two years without education for 600,000 children, and frozen beef and mutton to feed a malnourished population. Aid organisations have been limited to chicken while commercial traders have been able to bring in all kinds of meat.The limited number of crossings into Gaza and their hours of operation, as well as delays approving routes for convoys inside the territory – which is vital to ensuring they do not come under Israeli attack – all serve to slow the entry of vital supplies.Overall flows of aid into Gaza are well below levels agreed under the ceasefire, data provided by the Israeli military and analysed by theAssociated Pressshowed.Food shipments have increased enough to stave off famine, but hunger is still widespread, UN-backed food security expertssaid last week. About 1.6 million people were expected to face “crisis” levels of hunger in the next four months and if the ceasefire broke down, the territory could slip back into famine.Winter weather and lack of shelter are exacerbating the impact of long-term malnutrition, particularly on young children. At least three have been killed by hypothermia this month, the UN said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Again.Crowds of revellers gathered in the city’s Centenary Square, hoping to catch a glimpse of a pyrotechnics display to welcome in 2026.They were left disappointed, however, after they discovered no display would be taking place and that they had fallen victim to false news spread online.Asimilar incident happened last year, when thousands of people gathered in the city centre after claims online promised a spectacular display with food vendors and performances.One online advertisement this year claimed there would be a dazzling fireworks show where attenders could “expect a lively atmosphere featuring music alongside the brilliant show as the city welcomes the new year”.West Midlands police had said on Tuesday that there were “no official firework displays or city-organised events happening in Birmingham city centre on New Year’s Eve” and blamed the spread of rumours online every year about “big celebrations in the city”.“Unfortunately, these false claims often lead to confusion and disappointment,” the force said in a statement.Despite the warnings, footage shared on social media showed a large group of people gathered in front of the ferris wheel at Centenary Square, a focal point in the city, on Wednesday evening. The video’s caption read: “When you queue for fireworks and the sky stays silent.”It is not just people in Birmingham who have fallen victim to such hoaxes.Tourists were dismayed last month when they visited Buckingham Palaceafter an AI-generated image had circulated on social media showing a picturesque scene of a Christmas market. Visitors arrived to find it was fake.West Midlands police said misinformation incidents such as the one on New Year’s Eve could create “real safety issues in the city”, and that when “large crowds gather for an event that doesn’t exist, it puts pressure on public transport, emergency services, and can lead to congestion in the city centre”.1:52New Year's Eve: from Sydney to London, how the world ushered in 2026 – videoElsewhere across the UK, millions of people gathered at events and parties to welcome in 2026. London staged its biggest pyrotechnic display to date, with about 12,000 fireworks set off in front of a crowd of 100,000 people watching on the banks of the Thames.In Scotland, tens of thousands of revellers attending the Hogmanay street party enjoyed a display that lit up Edinburgh Castle.Explore more on these topicsBirminghamNew yearWest MidlandsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The total for the year ended up being 13% higher than the figure for 2024.Keir Starmer had fought the election in 2024 promising to “smash the gangs” and last year negotiated a “one-in, one-out” returns deal with France to act as a disincentive.A Home Office spokesperson said the number of small boat crossings was “shameful and the British people deserve better”.But they added: “This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.“The home secretary has announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in decades, removing the incentives that bring illegal migrants to the UK and scaling up the return of those with no right to be here.”However, Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said Starmer’s plans had been “a complete disaster” and a “farce”. He also claimed that “many of the young men that have arrived last year will do us great harm”.The Conservatives have claimed that foreign nationals arriving by small boat are more likely to go to prison, butFull Fact found in July thatthe University of Oxford’s Migration Observatory has said there is no reliable publicly available data about crimes committed by foreign arrivals by small boat.Chris Philp, the Conservative shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that pulling out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) was the only way to reduce the number of small boat crossings.He said: “Labour have confined themselves to cosmetic tweaks, hence only 5% of arrivals have been removed. There is no deterrent and anyone who crosses the Channel knows they can invoke human rights law and remain indefinitely. Labour lack the backbone to confront that truth.”The government is counting on greater powers for law enforcement to tackle people-smuggling gangs under the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act , which became law in December. The act introduces new criminal offences and allows law enforcement agencies to use counterterror-style powers to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, also announced plans in November for “the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times”, in an effort to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.Under changes inspired by the Danish system, refugee status will become temporary with regular reviews every 30 months, and refugees will be forced to wait 20 years for permanent settlement in the UK, up from five years currently.Reacting to the Channel crossings for 2025, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Most men, women and children taking these journeys have fled oppressive regimes like the Taliban in Afghanistan and brutal civil wars in countries like Sudan.“No one risks their life on a flimsy boat in the Channel except out of desperation to be safe in a country where they have family or community connections.“It’s right the government wants to stop Channel crossings, but plans that will punish people found to be refugees are unfair and not an effective deterrent.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumRefugeesHome OfficeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Not nearly enoughRowena MasonWhitehall editorThu 1 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.58 ESTShareKeir Starmer does not have enough of a plan to defeat the “existential threat” that populism poses to UK democracy and should undertake a “fundamental reset”, New Labour’s former advertising strategist Sir Chris Powell has warned.Powell, who is the brother of Jonathan Powell, Starmer’s national security adviser, warned there were just three years to stop the “new and terrifying threat” of populists, suggestingReform UKcould represent a danger to democracy and national institutions.Writing for the Guardian, he said: “Here in the UK, where is the urgently needed counter plan on a huge scale, to thwart and head off such an existential threat? It is simply not in place, nor does it appear to be even at the planning stage.“We are at a very dangerous moment. We simply cannot afford to allow Reform UK to have a free run, and become established and entrenched as a credible potential government in the minds of disenchanted voters.“The longer they go unchallenged, the more unthreatening and risk-free they will seem to voters. Just hoping that Reform UK and [Nigel] Farage implode, or that the rightwing vote will somehow fracture, is potentially suicidal for our freedom and democracy.”His intervention comes as Starmer faces deep unhappiness within his own party about Labour’s poor poll ratings andhis own personal unpopularity, while Reform has led in opinion surveys for almost a year.The prime minister will attempt a new year push on reducing the cost of living through cuts to energy bills, interest rates and ending the two-child cap, saying that voters would start to see their lives improve in 2026.With Farage and Reform dominant on social media, No 10 also has plans to overhaul its communications strategy to reach more voters in new ways, such as through influencers and viral videos on channels including TikTok.ALabourparty source said the government was “tackling the problems that populists exploit, in particular the cost of living”, adding: “The prime minister has many times called out the politics of division peddled by Reform and will continue to work with grassroots activists and others to win this fight.”Labour is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks it has plenty of time to turn Britain around | Larry ElliottRead moreHowever, Powell, who ran the ad agency that worked on Labour’s 1997 victory, said the social media engagement had so far been “small scale” and argued the “narrative surrounding this government has more often been about its own failings and internal conflicts than the battle it faces against a populist surge”.As part of his Winning Against Populists project with David Cowan, the founder of a data and consumer research consultancy, Powell said Starmer’s party needed to “wage and win the daily war for attention” with a goal of making sure their voice was heard when voters scrolled.He also said Starmer needed to interact better with voters on the issues they care about and highlighted how – in the US – a Democratic governor had won in a Republican state by “relentlessly speaking out in plain language on bread and butter issues: jobs, roads, schools, prices”.Recalling Tony Blair and his team meeting at his home for their first election planning meeting in 1995, Powell said what was needed for Starmer and Labour was a similarly “new strategy, new branding, new policy, new presentation, new organisation … this kind of no-holds-barred thinking is needed. A fundamental reset.”Powell said the current situation in the UK was a “textbook case of an establishment party caught in the headlights, as its populist opponent expertly fills the vacuum of voter pain and disrespect”.“Relying on containment or a rational ‘hold-your-nose’ vote is a strategy that will eventually fail. Labour needs a comprehensive action plan, now. Time is a luxury they can’t afford,” he said.Some within Downing Street are convinced that when voters come to a choice between Starmer and Farage, those who have progressive leanings will vote to keep out Reform – even if their sympathies lie with other parties on the centre or left. However, many Labour MPs are deeply worried that this is a complacent strategy that risks underestimating Farage and Reform.This year’s elections in Wales and Scotland, as well as locals in England, will be a test of how far Reform’s dominance in the opinion polls will translate into seats, with Starmer’s position potentially under threat if Labour suffers heavy losses.The Guardian reported on Wednesday that Starmer would reinforce his message with a series of new year drinks receptions for Labour MPs at Chequers in an attempt to dispel angst about local and devolved elections in 2026, at which the party is expecting heavy losses.In a barb aimed at Reform in his new year’s message, the prime minister said: “We are getting Britain back on track. By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerReform UKThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Its latest accounts, as has been the case in recent years, exempts the names of a number of entities receiving grants.The accounts state: “The trust considers that further reporting will expose the recipients to serious prejudice and impair the furtherance of their charitable activities.”Recipients who were named and who received £60,000 or more include Happy Day Ministries, Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association, Waterlife Recovery Trust, Cliftonville Community Centre, Inside Job/Beating Time, Living Room, Mustard Tree and Not Beyond Redemption.Two recipients of grants – totalling £1,150,000 – were exempted from disclosure in the accounts filed to Companies House. A total of 98 grants were issued in 2024, compared with 69 in the previous year.The trust was committed to £7.4m of grants at the end of 2024, which included some carrying over from the previous year. The trust gave £5.27m in grants in 2022.The Sackler Trust continues to be chaired by Dame Theresa Sackler, a former trustee of the V&Awho saton the Purdue board from 1993-2018. She is the widow ofMortimer Sackler, one of the three brothers who ran Purdue Pharma.Dame Theresa’s children – Michael, Marissa and Sophia – are trustees of the family charity, which has assets totalling £50m.A US judgesaid in Novemberhe would approve Purdue Pharma’s latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.The deal, overseen by the US bankruptcy judge Sean Lane, would require some of the multibillionaire members of the semi-reclusive Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7bn (£5bn) and give up ownership of the Connecticut-based company.Members of the Sackler family who own the privately held Purdue, which now-deceased members of the family grew into a specialist in pain treatment in the early 1990s, became philanthropists using the huge profits generated by sales of OxyContin.The Sackler family’s reputationtook a divewhen investigative journalism and activism exposed the company’s expansionist drive toincrease prescriptionsof the opioid despite growing addiction and deaths across the US. While the Sacklers have donated millions over the years to charitable interests, some have accused them of using the giving of money as a means of “reputation laundering”.The Sackler Trust has been approached for comment.At the time of its move to pause the trust’s giving, Dame Theresa said in a statement issued on behalf of the trustees: “I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.”Explore more on these topicsCharitiesVoluntary sectorOpioids crisisDrugsPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The name change itself is being challenged in the courts.In an email to the New York Times,Morton said that for the past five years he’d been “grabbing domains tied to politicians and authoritarian figures and turning them into blunt, often uncomfortable reflections of what they actually represent”.“I’ve been doing this kind of work for years now, building sites that mirror and expose political power by using its own language against it,” he added.Visitors to trumpkennedycenter.org find an announcement for a show by the “Epstein dancers” and not a schedule for the center’s line-up of classical music, jazz, theater and ballet.“Beginning January 2026, TrumpKennedyCenter.org enters a new era of devotion, unity and inherited authority,” a message on the website says. “We exist to preserve what must endure, to honor what must not be questioned, and to gather those who understand that greatness is not chosen, it is recognized.”The real website,kennedy-center.org, is identified as the “Trump Kennedy Center”, but the web address itself is not altered.Morton is not alone in looking to make fun. A group of British satirists has acquiredtrump-kennedycenter.orgat about the same time, and it is advertising its own brand of deranged comedy misinformation.“Saucy Jeff – a Rock’n’Roll Musical,” the website advertises, calling it a “new adaptation of the St Hubbins/Smalls-penned rock opera Saucy Jack, [which] brings this musical about friendship and sex crimes right up to date in the new location of Little Saint James, featuring Jeffrey Epstein as the protagonist.”Comedy, more than outrage, has often proved to be a better counter to political lunacy.South Parkmade its comedy bones parodying the excesses of woke culture.But during the second Trump term it has switched firmly to parodying Trump, who in recent episodes has been expecting a baby with a cartoon Satan who thinks the new White House ballroom is going to be a creche.South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker explained last year that the Trump administration was inescapable. “It’s not that we got all political,”Parker told the New York Times.“It’s that politics became pop culture.”Morton told the outlet that his view of the Trump Kennedy center name change was that it was an art in itself, perhaps in the same way that Lenin’s tomb in Red Square is better than any piece of installation art could hope to be.“It’s almost performance art in itself,” Morton told the outlet. “The irony of someone who has openly mocked artists, dismissed culture and shown nothing but contempt for the arts now positioning himself as their steward is kind of breathtaking.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSouth ParkWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Does that make sense?”Like his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump is facing scrutiny over his health.Trump’sresponse to questionsabout his health have made headlines in recent months after he was seen with what appeared to make-up on on his hand and was seen to be drowsy in a cabinet meeting in December and at a meeting to promote lower costs of GLP-1 weight-loss medication.Elsewhere in the interview with the Journal, Trump said he begins his day early at an office in the White House residence before coming downstairs around 10am to work in the Oval Office, which he does until 7pm or 8pm. He said he asked his staff to modify his schedule so that he can have fewer, more important meetings that he can give more attention to.Trump said he acted on the advice of his staff to slow his pace, including spending roughly two weeks at Mar-a-Lago, AKA the “winter White House”, over Christmas and New Year. They have also counseled him to try to keep his eyes open during public events.Trump’s health and vitality is a sensitive issue, in part because the advancing frailty of Biden became a significant issue and led to questions about a cover-up by White House senior aides. They deny that they saw obvious signs of decline.Trump’s Journal interview betrays frustration with his staff for not promoting his health more vigorously,the outletsaid. “Let’s talk about health again for the 25th time,” he said. “My health is perfect.”But Trump said he regretted undergoing a cardiovascular and abdominal advanced imaging scan during a routine health check-up in October because it drew attention. The White House initially said the screening was a CT scan, not an MRI.“In retrospect, it’s too bad I took it, because it gave them a little ammunition,” Trump said. “I would have been a lot better off if they didn’t, because the fact that I took it said, ‘Oh gee, is something wrong?’ Well, nothing’s wrong.”Trump’s doctor, US navy captain Sean Barbabella, told the Journal that his patient was in “exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as commander-in-chief”. The White House provided an AI-summary analysis of Trump’s electrocardiogram that gave him a cardiac age of 65.But Trump acknowledged that he tried compression socks to combat swelling in his legs but soon took them off. “I didn’t like them,” he said, adding that he had begun to walk around more and that the situation had improved.He said he was not interested in taking exercise other than a round of golf. “I just don’t like it. It’s boring,”Trump said. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.” Trump said he had plenty of energy, which he credited to genes he inherited from his parents.“Genetics are very important,” he said. “And I have very good genetics.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

But recent polling indicates that Democrats may not be able to count onthe issue in their efforts todrive votes in the 2026 midterms, after makingabortion rightsthe centerpiece of their pitch to voters in the elections that followedthe fall ofRoe v Wade.In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI). But in October of this year, just 36% of Democrats said the same. By contrast, abortion remained about as important to Republicans in both 2024 and 2025, PRRI found.PRRI’s findings mirror a September pollfrom the 19th and SurveyMonkey, which found that the voters who cared most about abortion are people who want to see it banned.During the 2024 election, abortion was seen as the Democrats’ strongest issue, after the 2022 overturning of Roe sparked a wave of deeply unpopular state-level abortion bans.Kamala Harris put abortion rightsat the heart of her presidential campaign, while Democratic Senate candidates and Super Pacspoured an astounding $175minto abortion-related TV ads – far more than any other issue. Donald Trump, who enabled Roe’s collapseby appointing three conservative justices to the US supreme court, repeatedly tried to downplay the fight over abortion rights, viewing it as a political liability and a sure-fire boost for Democrats.Five key moments in the assault on the rights of women and girls in 2025Read moreBut the powerof the issue turned out to beoverstated in 2024. Trump handily won the popular vote and Republicans ended up with control ofboth houses of Congress. Still, the president has largely avoided further action on the issue at the federal level, focusing insteadon initiatives likecracking down on immigration,instituting steep tariffsandbulldozing the federal workforce.Thetumult has furtheryanked Americans’ attention away from abortion, said Melissa Deckman, PRRI’sCEO.“It’s just hard to catch your breath, because every day there’s a new, outrageous thing happening with the administration,” Deckman said. Abortion, she added, has been replaced as a top issue by affordability and the economy. “That seems to be first and foremost for everyone. But it’s also, forDemocrats, the state of democracy writ large. We consistently find that Democrats are more concerned about the health of democracy.”August polling from the group Emilys List, which champions Democratic women who support abortion rights, found that voters are now prioritizing the economy over abortion. But it also found that 49% of female voters consider threats to abortion rights to be a “dealbreaker”. Abortionremains a galvanizing issueinstate supreme court elections, which now often have the final word on the legality of state-level abortion restrictions.Advocates are currentlyworking to secure enough signatures to get abortion rights measures on the stateballots in Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Virginia. Idaho, Oregon and Virginia’s proposed measures would protect abortion access, while Nebraska and Montana’s measures would eliminate it. Two states, Nevada and Missouri, have already confirmed that they will have abortion-related measures on the ballot. (Nevada passed an abortion rights measure in 2024, but it must past a second time before the constitution can be amended.)In the past, Democrats have hoped that these kinds of measures, which voters tend to support, will elevate their candidates.But in 2024, voters backed abortion rights while rejecting Democratic candidates. Trump won four states that voted in support of ballot measures that added abortion rights to their state constitutions.Some of those measures have also proven to be less gamechanging than advocates originally hoped. In 2024, Missourivoters decided to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights, making the state – which at the time banned virtually all abortions – the first state in the country to repeal a post-Roe ban. However, a protracted legal battle over the exact implications of the measure haverepeatedly blocked Missouri abortion clinicsfrom offering the procedure. Now, in 2026, voters will be asked whether they want to repeal the measure they passed just two years ago.“It just feels like such a messaging failure, to not understand and not be able to communicate that these people are going to continue to decimate abortion access,” said Alisha Dingus, executive director of the DCAbortionFund, which helps people get the procedure. “I would like to see more politicians who are more comfortable talking about abortion more regularly.”The flagging attention to abortion is having a trickle-down effect on fundraising efforts by abortion rights advocates.Donations to the DC Abortion Fund dropped precipitously in 2025, as post-Roe rage donations evaporated and economic struggles led reliable donors to stop giving.Data indicates that US abortions have increasedover the past few years, thanks in large part toonline access to abortion pills. But Dingus fears that funding will dry up for women who need to travel to clinics for abortions. Right now, the DC Abortion Fund gives out about $3,800 to dozens of people per week to support costs associated with abortions – but Dingus isn’t sure how much longer the money will last.“What I see is going off the cliff in 2026, because we can only stretch those additional dollars for so long,” Dingus said.Explore more on these topicsAbortionUS politicsDemocratsRepublicansUS supreme courtRoe v WadenewsShareReuse this content"

The winner will return to Miami Gardens for the national championship game on 19 January.Miami stun defending champion Ohio State 24-14 in CFP quarter-finalRead moreTexas Tech (12-2) entered the game ranked second nationally in scoring (42.5 points per game) and fifth in total offense, but never found its footing. The Red Raiders turned the ball over four times, failed on three fourth-down attempts and produced four three-and-outs.Quarterback Behren Morton finished 18 of 32 for 137 yards and was stripped by Uiagalelei early in the third quarter in Tech territory. Uiagalelei returned the fumble into the red zone, and Davison scored on the next play to give Oregon a 13-0 lead.Morton then threw a red-zone interception early in the fourth quarter, before Oregon’s defense stopped Texas Tech on fourth down at its own 30 midway through the final period. Davison’s one-yard touchdown plunge with 16 seconds remaining completed the scoring.The result continued a striking trend in the expanded playoff. Thursday’s game was the sixth quarter-final under the 12-team format introduced last season, and the sixth time a team coming off a first-round bye lost to an opponent that played the opening weekend.In 2024, Boise State, Arizona State, Georgia and Oregon were all eliminated in the quarterfinals after byes, while Miami added to the list on Wednesday by defeating Ohio State at the Cotton Bowl. Across those six games, bye teams have led for less than five minutes of regulation combined.Texas Tech hoped to buck that pattern. Instead, Oregon recorded their first shutout of an AP top-10 opponent since 2012. It was the Ducks’ 113th game against a top-10 team – and the first time they allowed no points.After expressing dissatisfaction with their defense following a 51-34 first-round win over James Madison, Oregon delivered a performance that left little room for complaint.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Please note thebold(or should that bebold?) in bold predictions: these are mostly to be taken with a pinch of salt.The Luka Dončić-JJ Redick relationship goes southLuka Dončić and JJ Redick’s relationship will crack and become a national storyline. The Lakers’ coach will eventually show public frustration with Luka’s lack of consistent defensive intensity and his inability to fully build chemistry with teammates, including LeBron James. Dončić initially met Redick’s demand to arrive in “championship shape”, but the dynamic feels brittle. A 41-year-old first-time head coach pushing the league’s most ball-dominant star is a combustible mix, and the tension is unlikely to stay private forever. It has the makings of a modern Allen Iverson–Larry Brown saga: mutual respect, visible friction and, eventually, a very loud moment. Only instead of “practice?”, we will be hearing “defense”.Nicholas LevineThe Auston Matthews era will end in TorontoSometime in 2026, Auston Matthews could leave the Toronto Maple Leafs. The spring, prior to the trade deadline, feels early, but one gets the sense that the relationship between Matthews and the Leafs is nearing its end. Yes, true, he just recently re-signed. And yes, that re-signing came with the captain’s ‘C’. Nevertheless, Matthews (who is likely still playing through a mystery long-term injury) has looked less and less comfortable on and off the ice. Leading into Christmas, Matthews went four straight games without registering a point for the first time since 2018. As for the fans, they’reunimpressedwith Matthews this season – and the feeling might be mutual. Toronto sports media are notoriously swivel-eyed about the Leafs, interpreting and re-interpreting each sway of the team as foretelling a different future, so it’s easy to get hooked into false narratives. But increasingly, it looks like Matthews might be thinking about a future outside Toronto. The Leafs could be thinking the same thing.Colin HorganAudi Crooks will become a household nameThe 21-year-old Crooks is dominating women’s college basketball in a way that is becoming impossible to ignore. The Iowa State junior leads Division I in scoring at nearly 28 points a game, is the only player this season with multiple 40-point performances and recently tied a school record with 41 points in a Big 12 win over Kansas – for an undefeated Cyclones team currently ranked in the top 10. Since announcing herself nationally with 40 points against Maryland in last year’s NCAA tournament, Crooks has piled up historic nights against Indiana, Iowa and Valparaiso, pouring in 43 points in just 20 minutes. She is on pace to join Joel Embiid as just the second player across Division I, the NBA or the WNBA to average at least one point per minute over a full season.But Crooks’ rise is not just statistical. She is a throwback star with modern reach: a dominant low-post force whose joy, humility and commitment to community – including a foundation delivering food packagesto families affected by the SNAP shutdownin her home county – have made her a fan favorite far beyond Ames. As women’s basketball continues its surge into the mainstream, Crooks has the game and the presence to cross over with it. By the time she carries the Cyclones into the NCAA Tournament this March, “Audi-matic” will need no introduction. By year’s end, she’ll be doing what Marty Mauser couldn’t: staring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box.Bryan Armen GrahamMultiple major colleges will drop sports entirelyThe typical Division I college sports programloses money or only manages to break evendue to institutional support and student fees. Now consider everything that has changed in the last few years. Donors are being asked to foot the bill for Name/Image/Likeness (NIL) deals. College can make direct payments to athletes, and thanks to the transfer portal, any athlete who feels underpaid can pack up and go elsewhere. Conference realignment now forces many colleges to pay for all of their teams to travel from coast to coast several times a year. Colleges now have to ramp up staffing on everything from logistical planners to academic support specialists with the thankless job of figuring out whether someone attending his fourth school in four years can actually graduate. At some point, a college is going to hit the breaking point in the arms race and either drop sports entirely or move down to Division III, where schools don’t offer athletic scholarships and travel is much more manageable. Once one college makes that move, the floodgates will open.Beau DureThe end of sports’ infinite growth curveFor more than half a century, sports has endured as the most recession-proof of entertainment spectacles. But 2026 is when the sun begins to set on the era of everlasting growth. It used to be that televised sports was nothing but upside, especially in the US. The networks got unscripted dramas with reliable story arcs. The leagues and their partners got rich. Fans could watch big games and their local teams for free or for the nominal price of cable subscription and feel as if they were getting more than their money’s worth. The bigger audiences grew, the more everyone stood to benefit.But now that Netflix, Apple and other digital platforms are crashing into the rights holding game, prepare for sports to run the same attention deficits that movies and TV shows have been slogging through since Silicon Valley stormed Hollywood. The more sports migrate to streaming –MLB.TV for local market games, Prime Video for the NFL and NBA, Apple TV for F1 – and force fans to shell out hundreds of dollars a month to keep up with action that was once virtually given away, the more the audience shrinks from subscription fees and general inconvenience and the frustration of having to search out entertainment that was once a remote click away. Eventually, new fans stop regenerating, interest flags, advertising dries up and the sports leagues that once counted on ever increasing budgets and resources suddenly find themselves having to figure out how to continue eking out a business in an attention economy where all digital content has the same negligible value.Andrew LawrenceMLB will play through 2027 despite lockout threatsIt is still a little way off, but circle 1 December on the calendar. That is the date Major LeagueBaseballowners could lock out players and begin the great work stoppage of 2027. The most contentious divide between the sides is, as ever in collective bargaining negotiations, player salaries. Some owners – particularly those not named the Mets or Dodgers – want a salary cap, arguing they cannot compete with the sport’s biggest spenders. Even Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner has recently complained about rising payrolls, despite his stadium being largely funded by the public. Players, for their part, will refuse a cap of any kind.Most observers point toward a work stoppage. I do not. Baseball will play in 2027, and the sides will settle well before the deadline. Off the back of an epic 2025 World Series and a World Baseball Classic likely to draw huge global audiences, both parties will understand that going dark would only choke off the spout shooting cash into the game. With momentum on their side, they will find a way to strike a deal and keep the sport moving forward.David LengelView image in fullscreenAuston Matthews’ time in Toronto may be running short.Photograph: Claus Andersen/Getty ImagesThe beginning of the end will come for sports stadium giveawaysThe close of 2025 brought the continuation of a long-running trend, as the Kansas City Chiefs ($6.2bn in value according to Forbes) and owners the Hunt family (net worth of around $25bn) successfully worked the state of Kansas to the tune of nearly $2bn in public money for a new, $3bn domed stadium, which the state will finance via the sale of municipal bonds. Kansas will own the development, whose revenue they mostly can’t use to pay back the bonds, and the rent from which will be deposited into a fund only the Chiefs can use. Countless economists and studies have shown that these sorts of deals do not bring any real, tangible benefit to the locality at hand. And the funding mechanism enabling them to happen weren’t even meant to be used this way; they were meant to fund things like bridges, roads and parks but have been used since the ‘80s for private sports stadiums thanks to a loophole that has yet to be closed despite multiple proposed federal bills banning the practice.There appears to be no momentum towards any of this stopping; not after the Kansas City deal, or ones of similar scale in Nashville or Buffalo, or any number of smaller deals in which the public is made to pay for the benefit of a private business. But 2026 will be different. The coming leftward reaction to the far-right and billionaire-friendly ways of the current administration will make voters especially attuned to the ways they are getting fleeced. This is a dynamic that Zohran Mamdani combined with sports masterfully in his campaign against Fifa’s World Cup ticket pricing, creating a conversation that went national and won him even more momentum in a victorious campaign. It’s one of the few aspects of his strategy that could reasonably be adapted for campaigns outside of the unique American metropolis that is NYC, and somebody, somewhere, is going to gain some votes and start a serious movement against these giveaways using similar tactics.Alexander AbnosMiriam Adelson will sell the Dallas MavericksAs Dallas Mavericks fans protested outside the American Airlines Center after the stunning Luka Dončić trade, their threnody moved beyond sport into something almost sacrosanct: basketball’s peculiar ability to turn a player from across the world into family. That was Dončić in Dallas. Nico Harrison orchestrated the trade and became public enemy No 1 across North Texas, and though he was fired in early November, the franchise remains haunted. You can remove an executive; you cannot unwind a rupture. Harrison was the face of the decision, but responsibility ultimately lies with owner Miriam Adelson, the dual-citizen billionaire casino magnate (andTrump mega-donor) for whom franchises are assets in a portfolio rather than civic trusts. Rarely seen at games and showing scant concern for fan grievance, Adelson now presides over a team stripped of its generational star and much of its goodwill. What if the past year and a half was not the billion-dollar bargain she expected? What if she sold? A sale would not bring Dončić back, but it could free Dallas from a hollowed-out era of remote ownership and offer something rare in modern sport: not competitive redemption, but moral closure.Lee EscobedoThe 2026 WNBA season will happen – but only after the league nearly self-destructsThe WNBA and the WNBPA have been negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement since the 2020 deal expired in October, and as of now there is no agreement in place that guarantees a 2026 season – or allows expansion teams in Toronto and Portland to move forward with business as usual. While fears of a lost season are real, no one involved actually wants that outcome.The 2026 WNBA season will happen, but only after a confrontation that brings the league to the brink. With players newly unified after a strike authorization vote and alternative structures already in place, the leverage has shifted. Unrivaled – the fast-growing women’s professional league founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart – has shown there is both demand and infrastructure beyond the traditional model. The mere possibility of players organizing outside the WNBA, even temporarily, would be a negotiating weapon the league could not ignore.There is no evidence of a ready-made replacement league waiting in the wings, and organizing one overnight would be enormously difficult. But the point is not whether a parallel season actually launches. It is that, for the first time, players plausibly believe they would have options. That belief – and the pressure it creates – will force a deal. The season will arrive, bruised but intact, after a fight that permanently reshapes who truly holds power in women’s basketball.Stephanie KaloiAn official tennis governing body “hires” an AI-generated content creatorEven when the tennis is brilliant and fans are flocking, the sport has a maddening habit of marketing itself in ever more busted ways. Never has a tennis documentary shown so little tennis as Netflix’s Break Point. The US Open saw record attendance and decided what it really needed wasa YouTube dating serieswhose only connection to tennis was that it took place on tournament grounds. In February, the ATP Tour announced a “groundbreaking” partnership with Overtime, effectively a social-media conglomerate for sports fans. November brought theTennis Creator Network, “a selection of dynamic TikTok creators from around the world” granted “unprecedented behind-the-scenes access” at the season finale in Turin.God forbid a skilled storyteller – with knowledge of the sport and actual writing chops – be given access for a longform profile that might reveal something new about the players or the game. Instead, tennis has chosen short-form mush in hopes of turning an ongoing boom into a … bigger boom. There’s only one step left in this righteous pursuit of mediocrity: remove humans from the creative process entirely. I won’t be surprised when the ATP or another governing body unveils an AI commentator, an interactive chatbot, or quietly outsources match recaps to ChatGPT. As longtime broadcaster andrecent Saudi tourism boosterRobbie Koenig might say: water covers 70% of the earth – and the other 30% is covered by the tears of unemployed tennis writers.Owen LewisExplore more on these topicsUS sportsCollege basketballMLBBaseballCollege sportsDallas MavericksToronto Maple LeafsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It typically serves as a mea culpa.We’re sorry our preseason predictions about your team were wrong.In theory, it’s a straight line: the coach who oversaw the biggest turnaround is handed the award. In practice, it’s a yearly argument about expectations and whether we’re rewarding actual coaching or just the greatest surprise.But this year’s race is a little different. The pool of candidates is unusually deep. It’s been theseasonof turnarounds. The league has been messy, with recent division winners falling away and recent also-rans all rising together. In an ordinary year, Sean Payton guiding the Broncos to the top of the AFC would make him the stone-cold favorite. But in a chaotic, fun year, he’s up against five other exceptional candidates.Here’s how the ballot should shake out.5) Ben Johnson, Chicago Bears, 11-5Coach of the Year voters love quarterbacks. They always have. Sean McVay in 2017. Kevin Stefanski in 2020. Brian Daboll in 2022. If you fix a quarterback, you’re halfway home.Ben Johnson hasn’t just fixed Caleb Williams; he’s unlocked him. In the right ecosystem, Williams has been given a chance to showcase his otherworldly talent. Since Week 9, the Bears rank fourth in offensive EPA per play. That’s not a hot streak – it’s sustained excellence. Under Johnson, Williams has become more decisive, less reckless, and has willingly turned himself over to the scheme rather than freelancing. It is an offense built solely in Johnson’s image: a bully-ball run game, a heavy dose of play-action and a creative passing attack that springs wide-open receiverseverywhere.Williams has taken advantage. And when openings haven’t been there, he’s been able to spin magic out of nothing.Johnson arrived in Chicago with a clear offensive vision. Almost every bet – rebuilding the offensive line, featuring the tight ends, turning Williams into a rhythm thrower – has paid off. That’s rare for a first-year head coach. And it’s rarer still for a coach who walked into the building with the kind of expectations Johnson did. For two straight cycles, he was the hottest name on the coaching market. But when it comes to hiring a head coach, there are no sure things. Somehow, Johnson has lived up to expectations – and even exceeded them. He’s proven not just to be a scheme dork but the kind of culture builder that can breathe new life into an organization.In a normal year, Johnson would be the runaway favorite. But this isn’t a normal season!Where Johnson’s candidacy comes (slightly) unstuck is on defense. The Bears currently sit 25th in defensive success rate. They are living on turnovers, and turnovers are famously unreliable. Coaches can emphasise ball disruption, but no one can guarantee it. Johnson is on the ballot because the offense is real. He’s not higher because variance is doing too much of the defensive work. With a couple of bounces of the ball, the Bears would be two wins worse off. It’s been an exceptional turnaround, and the foundation is in place for long-term success. But Johnson comes up short here.4) Liam Coen, Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4Coen is in a similar spot to Johnson. He’s another first-time head coach who has engineered a rapid turnaround. Over the stretch run of the year, he has Trevor Lawrence playing thebest all-around ball of his career. And he’s also overseen the remaking of a defense that now ranks fifth in the league in EPA per play.Even more impressively, Coen has nailed the off-field stuff, which wasn’t a given after hisgoofy opening press conferenceand some of his offseason decisions.Coen walked into Jacksonville with an uncommonly raw staff. Unlike Johnson, who surrounded himself with the perfect coaching cocktail of youth and experience, Coen bet on newbies. From the head coach himself to coordinators to position coaches, the Jags are filled with first-timers. That kind of setup is exciting in theory, but often collapses in practice – Nathaniel Hackett’s Broncos are the cautionary tale – because everybody is learning a new job on the fly. But Coen has pulled everyone and everything together.After an initial hot start, there was a chance that the season would go off the rails. A midseason collapse against Houston had the Jags wobbling again. That’s usually when coaches overcorrect. Coen didn’t. Instead, he simplified things. Jacksonville stopped chasing explosive answers and started hunting sustainable ones. Coen recentered the offense around Jakobi Meyers and the running game, and asked Lawrence to use his legs more.The results are obvious. The Jags have won seven games in a row and will be the AFC’s No 3 seed in the playoffs. Coen receives the tiniest knock in the standings because he inherited a talented roster, but he has proven he can maximize that talent.View image in fullscreenLiam Coen has led the Jacksonville Jaguars to the third seed in the AFC playoffs.Photograph: Andy Lyons/Getty Images3) Mike Macdonald, Seattle Seahawks, 13-3Every Coach of the Year case has a hinge moment. For Mike Macdonald, it was his quarterback decision.Moving on from Geno Smith, signing Sam Darnold and pairing him with offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak could have ended the season in October. Instead, it defined it. Through the middle point of the year, Darnold was anMVP front-runner. He has fallen away since that time, slipping to 23rd in EPA per dropback over the second half of the season, putting him just one spot ahead of JJ McCarthy and behind Baker Mayfield.Still, the Seahawks continue to churn out wins. Macdonald nailed his three most important offseason decisions: quarterback, coordinator and identity. He also serves as the defensive play-caller for the second-ranked defense in the league. Without that defensive firepower, the Seahawks’ season would have come unstuck as Darnold hit his slump.Seattle’s preseason win total was seven and a half. They are now the No 1 seed in the NFC, sitting on 13 wins, with the best point differential in the conference. If they beat the Niners on Sunday, they will lock up the one seed. In a brutal division, Macdonald hasn’t just exceeded expectations, he’s obliterated them.2) Mike Vrabel, New England Patriots, 13-3There are turnarounds, and then there is whatever Vrabel has done in New England. Last season’s Patriots weren’t just bad. They were directionless, devoid of talent and ideas. It looked like they were staring down a multi-year rebuild, hoping they could putanythingaround Drake Maye to find out what they had in the young quarterback. Instead, they’re the AFC East champs, have by far the conference’s best point differential and Maye is an MVP favorite.Sure, you can point to the Patriots’ historically weak strength of schedule to knock Vrabel. But that ignores the fact that the Patriots were hardly contenders to begin with. The schedule may be soft, but every team saw the Patriots as a weak spot on their schedule when the season started.A roster that looked bereft of talent is now punching above its weight, relying on old hands, rookies and Maye to scrabble together 13 wins.Vrabel’s fingerprints are all over the transformation. He had the final say on personnel last offseason, and almost every decision has been a hit. He brought back Josh McDaniels as offensive coordinator, not as a nostalgia play but to bring some professionalism back to the operation. When defensive coordinator Terrell Williams stepped away from the team to receive treatment for a cancer diagnosis, Vrabel handed the reins to the unknown Zak Kuhr to call plays while taking on more of the day-to-day responsibilities himself. On defense, the Patriots have been inefficient, but they’re fifth in points per game. Offensively, they’ve been a furnace blast. After drilling the Jets last week, they’re up to first in the league in EPA per play. Soft schedule or not, they’ve taken advantage.Vrabel’s job this season was to make the Patriots respectable again. He’s done more than that. Even with a torrent of injuries, the Patriots are serious contenders with an MVP at quarterback.1) Kyle Shanahan, San Francisco 49ers, 12-4What is the job of a head coach? It’s to put his players in a position to succeed and to find solutions when problems arise. Every other candidate on this list has done that, but no one has done it to the same degree as Shanahan.No coach has dealt with more challenges than Shanahan. The Niners lost Nick Bosa and Fred Warner early in the season. They’ve played a chunk of the year without Brock Purdy and George Kittle. They haven’t had Brandon Ayiuk all year. Every week, another difference-maker has been out of the lineup with an injury. And yet they are 12-4, with a chance at securing the No 1 seed in the NFC in the last week of the season. Oh, and this after an offseason cap purge that stripped away core parts of the team’s recent core.This is where expectation bias usually kills a candidate. Shanahan issupposedto be good. The 49ers aresupposedto win. Barring a historic season, those coaches rarely get the gong. But this season should break the pattern. Putting together the sixth-ranked offense in the league when the only certainty has been Christian McCaffrey is a remarkable feat.This is the most adaptive version of Shanahan we’ve seen. The offense has shapeshifted weekly. The defense has survived on tenacity and vibes rather than stars. It hasn’t always been pretty, but it’s been effective.Coach of the Year should reward the coach who solves the most difficult problems. This season, no one has solved more of them than Kyle Shanahan. Being even competitive in some games, given the injury challenges, has been a minor miracle. And now the Niners are healthyenoughto be a problem in the postseason.Explore more on these topicsNFLSan Francisco 49ersUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead ­Manchester City’s winning streak came to a juddering halt as Pep ­Guardiola’s side spurned a chance to move within two points of Arsenal at the top of the table.Hats – or should that bechapeaux– off to Régis Le Bris and his clever and courageousSunderlandteam for not merely frustrating City but offering Gianluigi Donnarumma scope to remind everyone precisely why he is a world-class goalkeeper.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City players to get ‘heads up’ for visit of ChelseaRead moreAs the final whistle blew, Erling Haaland had been contained, City’s run of eight straight wins in all competitions was over and it seemed easy to see why the Stadium of Light DJ has taken to playing the Dave Clark Five’s Glad All Over shortly before kick-off.It was Haaland’s first visit to the Stadium of Light and City’s ultimately disappointing No 9 did not take long to make his presence felt. Only six minutes had passed when Haaland flicked on Rayan Cherki’s corner and Bernardo Silva’s outstretched foot did the rest.Yet as City celebrations were cut short and Sunderland’s goalkeeper Robin Roefs no longer looked quite so crestfallen, it became apparent that a linesman had detected Silva was fractionally offside. When a lengthy video assistant referee check confirmed that judgment it appeared Silva must have overextended a toe. That represented quite a reprieve for a Sunderland side that were sunk3-0 at the Etihad Stadiumin early December and, creditably, they made the very most of it.Brian Brobbey has taken time to build his fitness up since arriving from Ajax last summer but the striker showed off eye-catching strength to connect with a long ball and not so much shrug Rúben Dias off but bulldozer through the defender.Brobbey had missed two excellent chances during last Sunday’s1-1 draw with Leedsbut a fine save from Donnarumma ensured that it was not to be third time lucky for a centre-forward well aware Le Bris intends reinforcing his frontline this month.If Sunderland’s manager was impressed by Brobbey’s disruptive physicality, Le Bris must also have been quietly encouraged by his entire team’s intelligence, competitiveness and indefatigable pressing. Nordi Mukiele had, unusually, struggled against Dominic Calvert-Lewin during that Leeds visit but the former Paris Saint-Germain defender delighted in frequently subduing Haaland here.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola shows frustration on the sidelines.Photograph: Craig Cowan/ProSports/ShutterstockWhen, thanks to a clever interchange with Matheus Nunes and Phil Foden, the Norwegian finally succeeded in dodging Mukiele and his fellow minders Roefs reacted smartly to save the striker’s shot with his legs. Almost immediately Guardiola’s persistent pacing of the away technical area assumed the sort of manic intensity that was surely more about internal agitation than a riposte to the bitter Wearside chill.As the temperature plummeted it served as a reminder that a day when public transport in the north-east always shuts down for the new year holiday was hardly ideal for staging an 8pm kick-off. And especially not when visiting City fans faced an icy, three-hour, late night, trans-Pennine drive home.At least it was considerably more engrossing that your typical 0-0 draw, even if City only managed two shots on target during an opening 45 minutes that concluded with Le Bris’s right-back, Trai Hume, glancing a header narrowly over the bar following Granit Xhaka’s superior delivery.The tone-raising introduction of the fit again Rodri at the outset of the second half improved City considerably, finally breaking Sunderland’s lines and permitting Foden greater licence to attack. Yet although Savinho directed one highly inviting, Cherki conjured, chance over the crossbar before subsequently prompting Roefs into another stellar save with his legs, the visitors generally found Sunderland’s defence as opaque as Guardiola’s future.The revelation that the former Chelsea manager,Enzo Maresca, has discussedthe possibility of succeeding the Catalan - should he opt to leave Manchester this summer - with figures associated to City added an air of intrigue to proceedings.More immediately, one thing remained as crystal clear as the near full moon illuminating the Wearside skies: the word surrender is not in Sunderland’s vocabulary. Sure enough, City again had Donnarumma’s excellence to thank for a brilliant save from Eliezer Mayenda after Enzo Le Fée’s sublime pass outwitted Guardiola’s rearguard.The latter’s discomfort was compounded by the success Xhaka and friends were enjoying in disrupting his team’s customary midfield fluency. Not for the first time, Le Bris’s tactical blueprint was frustrating high-calibre opponents. At times it was hard to imagine Sunderland were missing a quartet of key first-teamers otherwise engaged at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.Not that City gave up. Jérémy Doku and Josko Gvardiol missed decent chances as they forced their hosts ever deeper, with only a series of increasingly desperate blocks and interceptions preserving one of surely the most precious points Sunderland will collect this season. Small wonder Glad All Over boomed out of the sound system at the final whistle.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueSunderlandManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They knew that Enzo Maresca was attempting to engineer an exit from the club and now they were ready to call his bluff. Midnight was approaching and the fireworks at Stamford Bridge were about to erupt.A baffling story soon had a familiar, predictable ending. Maresca, who is not the first manager to run out of friends at Chelsea, had taken the provocations too far. There was surprise when he told staff that he did not want to conduct his post-match press conference after thedisappointing 2-2 draw with Bournemouthon Tuesday night. The official explanation was that Maresca was too unwell to talk in public, despite having just spent the evening coaching on the Stamford Bridge touchline, but the friction was palpable and it was never going to sit well with the Chelsea hierarchy when it took less than 24 hours for reports to emerge that the sickness line was a red herring and their head coach had actually decided not to meet the media because he needed time to consider his options. It was further confirmation that this was someone who wanted to be sacked. Maresca dared Chelsea to act and will have been the least surprised person in the world tofind himself unemployedless than a day into 2026.A timeline of Enzo Maresca at Chelsea: his highs and lows with the BluesRead moreThis is where it was heading from the moment Maresca started his rebellion against the Chelsea project after last month’s otherwiseunremarkable win over Everton. The 45-year-old was asking for trouble when he made those cryptic comments about experiencing his“worst 48 hours”at the club. Chelsea hated the volatility. After the2-2 draw with Newcastleon 20 December, one source said Maresca’s position would quickly become untenable if he kept acting up.It is not as if Chelsea had peak José Mourinho or Thomas Tuchel in charge. Maresca is talented but imperfect. He is in his third year of management and his behaviour has betrayed his inexperience. There were wry smiles when Maresca talked about his love for the fans and thumped the badge on his chest afterbeating Cardiff Citylast month. Sources have claimed that Maresca tried to use interest from Juventus and Manchester City this season as leverage for a new deal. The brazenness infuriated Chelsea.It has been a sharp decline since they were talked up as title contenders at the end of November. A subsequent run of one win in seven league games did not go down well given Maresca’s antics, while concerns over his tactical choices have grown because of Chelsea dropping 20 points from winning positions in all competitions this season. Other issues include fans struggling to warm to Maresca’s cautious, positional-based game. Chelsea have been exhilaratingly direct against tough opponents but they have often been ponderous against deep defences. They couldnot beat Ipswich last yearand have dropped points at home toBrighton, Bournemouth,Crystal PalaceandSunderlandthis season.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca’s Chelsea stint started strong, winning the Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season.Photograph: Dénes Erdős/APFor his part, Maresca felt a young squad was not good enough to challenge on four fronts. He did a fairly good job after replacing Mauricio Pochettino in the summer of 2024. He guided Chelsea back into the Champions League before ending his first season bywinning the Conference LeagueandClub World Cup. He leaves with Chelsea in fifth place in the league and still in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Yet cracks appeared when the Italian responded to losing Levi Colwill to a knee injury before the start of the new season by demanding a new centre-back. This is not a club where the manager calls the shots. Chelsea are not going to change a structure with a focus on buying young players on long contracts. They trust the recruitment team, Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Dave Fallows, Joe Shields and Sam Jewell. Behdad Eghbali, the co-controlling owner, is a leading voice in club strategy.Yet Maresca felt there was too much interference from above. It has emerged that his comments about not receiving support from “many people” before the Everton game related to tension over advice on load management from the medical department. Chelsea maintain that Maresca has never been told what tactics to use. The idea he had no say in recruitment is also laughed off. What Chelsea did want Maresca to do, though, was rotate. They were scarred by a heaving treatment room under Pochettino in the 2023-24 season. They modernised the medical team and tried to ensure that fragile players such as Reece James, Pedro Neto and Wesley Fofana have been able to cope with the rigours of a packed calendar.For Maresca the problem is that some of his best players are those who struggle to play multiple games in a short space of time. Cole Palmer has fallen into that category because of agroin issuethis season and Maresca faced external criticism after rotating duringdefeats to LeedsandAtalantalast month. Injuries to Roméo Lavia and Dário Essugo have led to an overreliance on Moisés Caicedo and Enzo Fernández in midfield. João Pedro has had to play too much because of Liam Delap’s stop-start season.View image in fullscreenChelsea were unhappy with Enzo Maresca’s insistence of playing injury-prone players like Reece James during a packed schedule.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PABut rotation was the policy throughout Maresca’s 18 months in charge. Why only challenge it now? The theory is that Maresca, who was booed by supporters when he substituted a tiring Palmer against Bournemouth, could not handle the outside noise. Chelsea, though, were fine with him resting players if it kept them fresh. When they actually had a problem it was because James had played three full games in a week last month.Young, articulate, ambitious: why Liam Rosenior is in the frame to be Chelsea’s next manager | Michael ButlerRead moreYet Maresca dropped hints about not believing in his backup players. He questioned whether Andrey Santos was ready to start when Caicedo was suspended last month. He talked about Chelsea’s lack of experience after the draw with Newcastle. It was another red flag. It is true that Chelsea remain too inconsistent for a title challenge but they have a talented team and do not want their head coach to question it.Chelsea did not like Maresca being touted as a potential replacement for Pep Guardiola should he leave City at the end of the season. It has since emerged that Maresca informed his bosses that he had spoken to people associated with City about replacing Guardiola on three occasions this season. The pieces have fallen into place.Timing is everything: Chelsea visit City without Maresca on Sunday. They arelikely to turn to Liam Rosenior, manager of Strasbourg, their partner club. When it comes to the PR war, Maresca’s supporters will argue that Pochettino, Tuchel and Graham Potter all struggled to work within Chelsea’s setup since the takeover by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, the private equity firm run by Eghbali and José E. Feliciano.But Maresca toed the line until it was convenient to do otherwise. He had just led Leicester to the Championship title when Chelsea came calling. His stock is higher now and he is hoping to capitalise. Time will tell if Maresca, seen as a mini Guardiola, has played the game well enough. Wherever his career takes him next, though, Chelsea have no regret over seeing him go.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Tottenham head coach was applauded back by theBrentfordfans because he will always be a hero to them. His work over a near seven-year period as their manager has seen to that.But what of the followers in his new gig, which began when he said farewell to the Gtech last summer? It is safe to say the jury remains out after this driest of January performances had the supporters in the away enclosure adapting a barb they have historically reserved for Arsenal. “Boring, boring Tottenham,” they chorused in the 85th minute.Stubborn Sunderland deny Manchester City to give Arsenal four-point cushion at topRead moreFrank’s problem over the first half of thePremier Leagueseason has been the dearth of creativity in too many games and it was the case once again. Spurs offered next to nothing as an attacking force; it was as if they did not believe they could make chances let alone score and the frustration of their fans boiled over upon the full- time whistle – shortly after a weak Richarlison cross to no one had led to howls and the flinging of arms into the sky.Now there were boos and it was all horribly edgy when Frank and the players gathered together and thought about going over. No quick fixes, he has stressed. It feels as though could be plenty more angst in the coming weeks.Brentford shaded it. They were the more forceful, proactive team, certainly in the second half; the point felt like a bad one for them even though it did not dent their fine home record under Keith Andrews. In the final analysis, they stayed above Spurs in the table.Frank, who continues to grope for the answers, was asked whether the fans understood the situation or needed to be more understanding. “That question is very difficult for me to answer, going off a few boos after the game,” he said. “As I say, I’m not really reading anything on social media or articles or all that. I watch the team. I’m very aware that we are not where I want us to be. Very aware.”Frank will always cherish what he achieved at Brentford – the promotion from the Championship; the manner in which he established the club in mid-table Premier League respectability; how his team repeatedly out-performed their budgets. He could be glimpsed on one of the big-screen montages prior to kick-off before he made his sortie on to the turf.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank embraces Mohammed Kudus after the final whistle.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersFrank’s mission was complicated by his being without eight players for various reasons – nine, if you included Brennan Johnson, who was left out of the squad as he closed in ona £35m move to Crystal Palace. The Spurs support would sing their song for him.Kevin Schade had the ball in the net for Brentford after a sixth-minute corner only to be flagged for offside and Andrews’ team pressed with intent at the outset. They tried to ask questions of Spurs with their movement in midfield.The Spurs fans wondered where the X factor might come from. Frank had felt his selection problems bite most strongly in the central midfield positions, Lucas Bergvall the latest absentee with what the club believe is a minor injury. The head coach does not seem to like João Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur as a pairing in front of the back four but he had no option but to use them. Archie Gray, the only other available central midfielder, was asked to play as the No 10.Gray had hesitated in the early running when well-placed, eventually seeing his shot blocked and Spurs’ only real flicker before the interval came on the half-hour when Richarlison returned a deep Palhinha cross for Gray in the middle. His header hit Nathan Collins and Richarlison volleyed the rebound past the far post.Tom Cairney earns Fulham a point at Crystal Palace with late levellerRead moreBrentford did not create much themselves in the first half but they pushed after the restart. Keane Lewis-Potter swiped at a low cross – the connection was not there – while Vitaly Janelt worked Guglielmo Vicario with a header from Jordan Henderson’s cross. In between times, Cristian Romero got away with a misjudged last-man tackle on Igor Thiago. The Spurs captain missed the ball and then seemed to handle while on the ground. He also missed Thiago and yet he surely served to get in his way. Andrews said it ought to have been a red card.When the Spurs support chanted again for Johnson in the 70th minute, it was easy to get the wistful vibes. Where was the runner in this team to get in behind, to stretch the opposition? It was a tough watch; too many unconvincing touches from their players and unforced errors, not enough cohesion. Frank talked up the clean sheet and defensive solidity. It is not enough.Gray shouted in vain for a penalty on 57 minutes after a risky lunge from Schade but Spurs never looked like scoring and their fans knew it. Richarlison had a late shot and it was the definition of tame. The consolation for Spurs was that it was not worse.

Leeds succeeded in stifling and frustrating Liverpool as the first goalless draw of Arne Slot’s reign underlined the limitations that linger behind thePremier Leaguechampions’ recent recovery.A drab scoreless draw, the first in 84Liverpoolgames under Slot, owed much to the defensive excellence of Jaka Bijol and Pascal Struijk as Daniel Farke’s depleted visitors extended their unbeaten run to six matches and moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. But Liverpool’s contribution to a meagre spectacle was significant too.Liverpool v Leeds United: Premier League – liveRead moreShort on ideas against Leeds’s low block, lacking urgency plus a clear attacking structure in the closing stages, Slot’s side toiled for much of the contest. There was a smattering of boos as the final whistle sounded on a ponderous performance and Slot’s post-match demeanour was not in keeping with an eighth match without defeat. “We had a lot of ball possession but that doesn’t mean a lot if you can’t create a lot of chances,” admitted the Liverpool head coach.Farke sprang a surprise by leaving Dominic Calvert-Lewin out of his starting lineup. The in-form forward had scored seven goals in six games but, given his injury record, the Leeds manager took no chances with a player who has become integral to this season’s ambitions. That sensible approach was undermined by the limited contribution of Calvert-Lewin’s replacement, Lukas Nmecha, for the 70 minutes he was on the pitch before the pair swapped places again. Calvert-Lewin scored shortly after his late introduction but, having beaten Alisson from close range, the striker’s celebrations were derailed by a correct offside call.Liverpool struggled when Farke switched to 4-3-3 during the recent 3-3 draw at Elland Road. Containment was the priority at Anfield with a 3-5-2 formation and, a few Hugo Ekitiké scares aside, Leeds delivered. Liverpool dominated possession with Jeremie Frimpong prominent on the right. There was more zip and precision to Liverpool’s play than of late – initially at least – but clearcut chances were limited throughout.View image in fullscreenLeeds’s Lukas Nmecha tussles with Virgil van Dijk.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PALeeds were almost caught out by Ibrahima Konaté’s long ball. Ekitike sprinted clear of Bijol, who held the forward as he advanced into the area. Ekitiké stayed on his feet and squared to Florian Wirtz, who was denied by an important interception by James Justin. The striker’s appeals for a spot-kick were dismissed. The penalty was not given, Slot said, “because he stayed on his feet. If he had fallen down it would probably have been a penalty but I can see why he didn’t because so many times this season we were fouled in the box and did not get a penalty.”Ekitiké’s mood was not helped by failing to hit the target with his best opportunity. After Frimpong retrieved an Andy Robertson cross and pinged a ball back into the Leeds’s six-yard box, the striker miscued a header that struck Lucas Perri while facing an open goal. Frimpong’s cross arrived at pace and Ekitiké was probably surprised that it reached him, but a player of his quality would expect to score.Leeds’s clearest chance arrived courtesy of an Alisson mistake. The Liverpool keeper sprayed a clearance straight to Ethan Ampadu, an effective disruptor, who sent a first time shot back down the centre of goal. The Brazilian recovered in time to spare his own blushes. A consolation for Alisson, and they were thin on the ground overall, was the 100th clean sheet of his Liverpool league career. He became only the fifth goalkeeper in the club’s rich history to reach that milestone after Ray Clemence, Bruce Grobbelaar, Pepe Reina and Elisha Scott.The contest descended into a scrappy affair, low on quality and incident. Dominik Szoboszlai tested Perri from distance. The keeper parried his effort and Ampadu handled while attempting to clear the rebound, gifting Liverpool a free-kick 19 yards out. Wirtz’s lame effort, clipped straight into the Leeds wall, encapsulated proceedings. Ampadu was booked for the handball and will miss Sunday’s game against Manchester United through suspension.Slot made a triple substitution in the 66th minute to inject more urgency into the Liverpool display. Moments later Virgil van Dijk almost marked the eighth anniversary of officially signing for Liverpool by heading his team in front from a Szoboszlai corner. A textbook header bounced just wide of Perri’s top corner. Leeds were dangerous in the closing stages and, after Calvert-Lewin’s disallowed effort, Anton Stach shot wastefully over. A New Year’s Day to forget.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Oliver Glasner was still bitterly disappointed that his team could not end a sequence of six games without a victory in all competitions after running out of steam again in their 31st match of the season. “We are a little bit in survival mode,” said the Palace manager, whose team now face three games in the space of seven days.Obdurate Leeds keep toiling Liverpool at arm’s length to earn pointRead moreAt least Palace supporters can console themselves with the impending arrival of Brennan Johnson for a club record fee of £35m from Tottenham having completed the first part of his medical while these two teams were slugging it out in south London. The Wales forward will add some much-needed firepower to Palace’s faltering attack, with the FA Cup winners also pursuing another striker to provide some back-up for Mateta, having registered their interest in 19-year-old Sidiki Cherif from Angers.Mateta – so often the player who sets the tone for Palace – has been labouring in recent weeks but took his goal brilliantly. However, they could not kill off a spiritedFulhamside who were nine points behind their London rivals when they were beaten at Craven Cottage in early December and now found themselves trailing only on goal difference.Both sides were unchanged after experiencing a contrasting few weeks, with Fulham having recorded three straightPremier Leaguewins since their last meeting to ease themselves away from any relegation peril. Silva insisted this week that their recent success would not affect their “clear plan” for the January window, with another striker a major priority given Rodrigo Muniz is not due back from injury until next month.They enjoyed some threatening moments during an opening period that was strangely lacking in intensity but couldn’t make the most of a couple of decent chances. The in-form Harry Wilson forced Henderson into action for the first time but Raúl Jiménez could only scuff the rebound wide.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta (right) gives Crystal Palace the lead at Selhurst Park.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAPalace had to wait until the 32nd minute for their first sight of goal when Marc Guéhi was denied from close range by Bernd Leno. They were given a helping hand when Jorge Cuenca went down with a head injury after a challenge from Justin Devenny when there had appeared to be minimal contact. He was ordered off for treatment by referee Tony Harrington and could only watch from the sidelines as Nathaniel Clyne was able to pick out Mateta at the far post, with Silva looking less than amused at what he felt was an overzealous application of the rules.“It was a strange decision,” said the Fulham manager. “We should not have been playing with 10 men in that moment because our player was in a condition to keep going.” His mood would have soured further if Clyne and Will Hughes had taken their chances to extend Palace’s lead before the break. A hamstring injury to Kenny Tete forced Fulham into an early change in the second half before Hughes was also forced off to add to Glasner’s injury concerns.Mateta should have been more alert to convert a clever pass from the outstanding Yeremy Pino that would have given Palace breathing space. Jiménez almost made them pay when his header from Antonee Robinson’s cross struck a post. Leno was fortunate to escape when he pushed the ball onto the bar after an initial mistake and Guéhi somehow blocked teammate Maxence Lacroix’s effort on the line.It proved to be a crucial moment as Fulham eventually found their equaliser after a combination between Robinson, Wilson and Cairney’s brilliant finish with his left foot that was celebrated with a double fist pump from Silva. Timothy Castagne should have settled it only to be denied by a diving Henderson before Andersen was left with his head in his hands when his shot with virtually the last kick of the match sailed into the stands.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I thought we certainly did enough to win the game but without doing everything that we probably wanted to do to be honest.”At Pride Park, Boro were punished for failing to take their chances as Bobby Clark fired the Rams to victory. The visitors dominated the game but lacked a ruthless edge inside the box and Clark took advantage with a second-half winner. The midfielder showed the composure with his finish that Boro craved to earn Derby a first home win since 4 November and condemn the visitors to a third defeat in four matches.“For the moment, football is very, very cruel to us and we have to sort it out and turn it around,” said Boro’s head coach Kim Hellberg. “I am very happy with how we performed, the first 60 minutes we were very good and created a lot of opportunities and we should have killed that game off.

She has three Frauen Bundesliga goals this season and sparked Bayern’s comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League. After making her senior debut for Germany in November 2024, she will be looking to establish herself as a regular for their upcoming 2027 World Cup qualifiers.Giulia Galli, Roma and Italy (17):Galli is widely regarded as one of the best young Italian talents to emerge for a long time and became Roma’s youngest player to make her Serie A debut in May 2024, aged 16 and one month. Establishing herself in the senior squad this season, she scored her first club goal in September and has featured in the Champions League. After starring in Italy’s sensational run to the semi-finals of last summer’s Under-17 Euros, the talented forward played a significant role at the subsequent Under-17 World Cup, picking up the bronze boot. She will surely feature at this autumn’s Under-20 World Cup.Fridah Mukoma, Kansas City Current and Zambia (19):Mukoma is yet to feature for Kansas City Current since joining in March but she is one of the latest exciting Zambian talents. She signed for the National Women’s Soccer League club for an undisclosed fee from Zesco Ndola Girls before heading to Beijing Jingtan on loan. The striker made an immediate impact after making her debut at international level, winning the golden boot as Zambia won the 2024 Cosafa Women’s Championship (southern Africa’s regional tournament) and will be one to watch at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations.Daniela Galic, Vittsjö and Australia (19):Galic is an attacking midfielder who has shown plenty of potential. Currently playing in Sweden at Vittsjö, she made her mark on the second half of the 2025 Damallsvenskan season, immediately becoming a regular starter and registering four goals and three assists in 13 appearances. She has yet to make an appearance for Joe Montemurro’s Matildas but, with a successful Young Matildas career under her belt, she will have one eye on trying to force her way into the squad for a home Asian Cup this March.View image in fullscreenPaula Comendador has stepped up to Real Madrid’s senior team as a teenager after demonstrating a proven ability to score in age-group football.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockPaula Comendador, Real Madrid and Spain (18):Comendador has consistently been one of the most prolific goalscorers in youth football. Her exploits with Spain at both under-17 and under-19 level – including a silver medal, golden boot and silver ball at the 2024 Under-17 Women’s World Cup – are an indication of the depth of her talent. She moved up to the Real Madrid senior team in July and has predominantly featured from the bench this season. She should add to her experience with an Under-20 World Cup later this year and a senior debut forLa Rojawill surely not be too far away.Montserrat Saldívar, Club América and Mexico (19):There is a strong argument to say that Saldívar has already broken out in Mexico. Since making her debut for Club América at 14, she has racked up more than 100 appearances for the Liga MX Femenil side. The winger has played an integral role in Mexico’s recent progress at youth level, ever-present in their run to the round of 16 at the 2024 Under-20 World Cup and scoring eight goals as they secured the silver medal at last summer’s Concacaf Under-20 Championship. Her senior debut came in October 2024 and with the opportunity to play in another Under-20 World Cup and first Concacaf Women’s Championship, where qualification for the 2027 World Cup is up for grabs, the next 12 months could prove even more significant.Wassa Sangaré, London City Lionesses and France (19):Sangaré’s bright start to life in the Women’s Super League has certainly been noticed after the young French international joined London City Lionesses on loan from OL Lyonnes. The talented central defender has adjusted well to the demands of the top English league, establishing her place with nine consecutive league starts. Her success at youth level for France – winning the 2023 Under-17 Euros and reaching the semi-finals of the under-19 tournament the subsequent year – led to her making her senior debut in the Nations League third-place playoff victory over Sweden in early December.Kaylee Hunter, AFC Toronto and Canada (17):The launch of Canada’s Northern Super League in 2025 allowed the spotlight to be shone on some of Canada’s emerging talents. One of the leading lights is Hunter, who was at the heart of AFC Toronto’s success in winning the inaugural NSL Supporters’ Shield, for topping the regular-season table, and reaching the final. A talented forward, she finished second-top scorer with 14 goals and was named rookie of the year. Her performances caught the eye of Canada’s head coach, Casey Stoney, and she received her first call-up in October but is yet to make her debut.View image in fullscreenLucia Kendall’s excellent end to 2025 included scoring a first senior England goal.Photograph: James Marsh/ShutterstockLucia Kendall, Aston Villa and England (21):It has been a whirlwind three months for Kendall, who has found herself propelled into the spotlight at the highest level. After making the move from Southampton to Aston Villa and the WSL, her impressive performances at the heart of midfield caught the eye of Sarina Wiegman. A debut followed in the Lionesses’ victory over Australia back in October where she put in a player-of-the-match performance. In the following camp, she scored her first England goal against Ghana at St Mary’s Stadium, the home of her childhood club, where she had played for a decade. Kendall will surely play an integral role in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers as she looks to cement her role within the setup.Trinity Armstrong, San Diego Wave and USA (18):Armstrong’s debut season in the NWSL could not have gone much better. The centre-back established herself as a mainstay in Jonas Eidevall’s San Diego Wave side as they made a run for the playoffs. Mature beyond her years, she made 23 regular-season appearances and scored one goal. She has represented the USA from under-15 level and was ever-present in their third-place finish at the 2024 Under-17 World Cup. Her performances will have no doubt put her on Emma Hayes’s radar as she continues to bring young players into the senior fold.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailmoving.goalposts@theguardian.com.This is an extract from our free email about women’s football, Moving the Goalposts.

After the golden 1960s, the decay of the 1970s and ensuing disasters of the 1980s came the cap-sleeved, rebounding self-confidence of the 1990s. The 21st century so far has taken in globalisation and wanton commercialism. After that rabid, often reckless push for continued growth, society and the game alight on the uncertainties that encapsulated 2025.To catch the 20 Premier League clubs in live action this season, and this writer completed the full set on Tuesday witnessing Arsenal’ssecond-half demolition of Aston Villa, has been a study in that uncertainty. From the grumbling of fans, to the ever-fragile egos of managers, to players slugging through the gristle of 90 minutes of hard-pressing slog, a leading question comes to mind: is anyone actually still enjoying this?From breakups to contract minefields: it’s make or break time for academy playersRead morePerhaps Sunderland and lately Leeds, inbucking the trendof promoted clubs sinking back down, can say they are. “Well-run” paragon clubs such as Brighton and Bournemouth have hit glass ceilings. From the disappointments of Liverpool’s rebuild to ailing projects at Manchester United and Chelsea down to the death spiral played out at Molineux, just about nobody is happy nowadays. Even within Crystal Palace’s 2025 annus mirabilis came a regrettable schism in the support base. Iffalling out over chantsof “stop the boats” isn’t a reflection of modern times, then what is?Being paid for a frequent fix of a lifelong addiction is a true privilege, though there are complications. Aesthetics cast to the margins in the drive for efficiency leads to misgivings. Following developments in the wider world, using the same tools found in business and tech, off-the-cuff improvisational football has been consumed by the playbook. Some artistry remains, from the timeless grace of Adam Wharton to the explosive speed and dribbling of Jérémy Doku, but creativity has undoubtedly been a victim of analytics.Rumours that at least two clubs make team selections using artificial intelligence seem all too credible when watching preordained, overly rehearsed football. That injury-time goals are at an all-time high at least suggests physical fatigue is one aspect the wonks have not got control of. For now, at least.View image in fullscreenLong throw-ins have been a theme of this season, with Brentford’s Michael Kayode among the best practitioners.Photograph: Natalie Mincher/SPP/ShutterstockThe inexorable rise of set pieces is the most obvious indicator of analytics’ influence. It was 15 years ago that Sir Alex Ferguson mischievously said the corners of Charlie Adam, then of Blackpool, were “worth £10m in themselves”. What might Adam’s valuation be now? There are suspicions Antoine Semenyo,probably headed for Manchester City, was coveted by many clubs because of his long throws rather than the artistry that has decorated Bournemouth. Pep Guardiola’s City still exhibit the flair with which the Catalan revolutionised the game. In Rayan Cherki, he is indulging what now passes for a maverick, but Guardiola has always kept with the times. Erling Haaland, these days a mature member of City’s leadership group, has been smoothed into the player who best fits 2025’s Premier League paradigm: physical prowess matched with man-machine productivity.Set pieces were long the confine of managers on limited resources playing the margins. Now that everyone pursues that edge, to be inefficient in the discipline is ruinous. Aaron Briggs,departing Liverpool this week, has carried the can for Arne Slot’s set-piece failings, a warning to Nicolas Jover and Austin MacPhee that their profession is a numbers game. You are only as good as your last zonal/man-marking hybrid strategy. Gotta win the second balls, fellas.In the stadiums, javelin-like long launches from players such as Semenyo and Brentford’s Michael Kayode, the latter current best-in-class, almost certainly carrying a valuation to match, have become high spots for fans fed on crumbs. Arsenal’s opener against Villa via a Gabriel Magalhães header from a Bukayo Saka corner was a comfort blanket. From there, after their first half of angst, fans and team reunified as the dominant side of early season reasserted themselves.In the Premier League’s stands, the transformation of crowds from supporters to customers continues. Customer complaints are rife, itself a reflection of cash not stretching as far as it used to in wider society. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was built as a monument to a customer experience designed to keep the tills ringing, one to which visitors to the 2026 World Cup will be exposed, but its comfortable seats often house seething wells of discontent easily matching the insurrection accompanying Wolves down the plughole.Meanwhile, information, reliable or otherwise, at the touch of a keypad gives rise to a cultural flattening. The consensus among fans continues to reject vehemently video assistant refereeing, while actual referees’ pariah status is a given, whatever their performances, names taken viciously in vain, professionalism and probity questioned after almost any decision, especially now throw-ins. Meanwhile, terrace anthems quickly lose exclusivity; Liverpool fans’ inventive use of Dean Martin’s Sway for Federico Chiesa was repurposed across the country within days.Compared with the past, bar those ever-audible groans, the majority of fans dutifully play their role as backdrop to a product sold to the world. Any shared consciousness is yet to coalesce in a general strike against ticket prices, clubs exploiting loyalty while making eyes at passing trade happy to lavish on merch. Can it be ruled out? If modern football still holds a mirror to the world beyond its touchlines, then an age of protest may soon follow.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

I obviously had a lot of help. To my parents, who are over there, thank you for your sacrifices that never made the highlights reel.”Khawaja moved to Sydney from Pakistan as a child, and scored his first Ashes century there with 171 against England in 2018.The veteran called out the racial stereotyping he had received in the media in the past and in the lead up to the Ashes regarding his preparation and back issues in the first Test.“[Comments] like, ‘he’s not committed to the team,’” Khawaja said. “‘He was only worried about himself. He played this golf comp the day before. He’s selfish. He doesn’t train hard enough. He didn’t train the day before the game. He’s lazy.’“These are the same stereotypes, the racial stereotypes I’ve grown up with my whole life … That was the thing that disappointed me the most, because I thought we were past that. But there’s still a little bit out there, which I still have to fight every single day, which is the frustrating thing for me.”View image in fullscreenAustralian cricketer Usman Khawaja announces his retirement during a press conference.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPBowing out at the SCG against England will be a fitting location, given it was there Khawaja made his Test debut in the 2010-11 Ashes series, and is close to his home.“Funnily enough, I live just up the road from the SCG,” he said.“And I’ll never forget when I was younger, I saw Michael Slater drive in his red Ferrari. I couldn’t believe my luck. I just saw a Test cricketer. And as a boy, whose parents were barely scraping through in trying to provide for their kids in a little two-bedroom apartment, I thought, ‘One day, I’m going to be a Test cricketer and one day I can drive whatever I want.’”Australia ‘more robust’ and can handle pressure better than England, believes BaylissRead moreIt was also at the SCG that he revived his career as a 35-year-old, scoring twin centuries against England when Travis Head missed a Test in 2022 due to Covid.That prompted one of the great late-career revivals, hitting seven centuries in his first two years back in the side.“This game humbles you,” Khawaja said.“It tests your patience, your resilience and your character. And if you’re lucky, it teaches you gratitude.“Even on days that it doesn’t go your way, I hope I’ve inspired many children along the way, particularly those who feel that they are different, those who feel they don’t belong, or those others tell they will never make it. I felt all these things growing up, and trying to be an Australian cricketer, but seeing is believing.View image in fullscreenKhawaja bats during day two of the fourth Test.Photograph: Morgan Hancock/Cricket Australia/Getty Images“I’m a proud Muslim, coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now. And you can do the same.“As I walk off for the last time, I do so with gratitude and peace. Or as we say, ‘salam’. Grateful for the journey, the people, the lessons. Thank you for letting me live my dream and for sharing it with me.”Khawaja’s position had come under extra scrutiny this summer after being unable to play in the first Test in Perth due to back spasms, then missing the Brisbane Test with the injury.He was initially left out in Adelaide before Steve Smith’s vertigo allowed him to return. Scoring 82 in the first innings ensured he would stay in the side for the fourth Test in Melbourne.Khawaja becomes just the second player to walk away while still in the Australian Test team in the past decade, after David Warner’s exit two summers ago.Usman Khawaja’s Test career:Tests: 87Runs: 6,206Average: 43.39Centuries: 16Half-centuries: 28Explore more on these topicsUsman KhawajaAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

This time, though, he steps away from the oche, and as the noise builds and swells around him, as the applause hardens into a tribal rhythm, he smiles. And in that moment, with millions of pairs of eyes on him, with glory within his grasp, he just knows. Knows that after all the years of hope and toil, of dreams and dismay, his moment is here at last.That’s the thing about the future: you spend lifetimes waiting for it, peering into the glass, reading the tea leaves, and when it arrives it happens all at once. It was a little after half past nine on the first evening of the year, and already the throngs were streaming out of Alexandra Palace and back down the hill, convinced beyond any fraction of a doubt that they had just seen the next few years of darts take shape.Gary Anderson and Ryan Searle show class and surge into world darts semisRead moreBarely an hour of time on the oche, barely a couple of hours in total, was all it took for Van Veen andLuke Littlerto secure their passages to the semi-finals of the world championship. Different tests, with a different weight of history on each, and yet negotiated in much the same fashion: while Littler smashed Krzysztof Ratajski 5-0, Van Veen crushed the 2024 champion, Luke Humphries, 5-1 to continue his own inexorable ascent towards the summit of darts.And so a rivalry forged in the youth ranks of the sport comes one step closer to rejoining on the biggest stage of all. Of course, Ryan Searle and Gary Anderson will have plenty to say about that when they play Littler and Van Veen respectively in Friday’s semi-finals. But whatever happens in those games, this was the night when it felt the future of darts became its present. Certainly this was the night Van Veen, already the European champion and now the world No 3 and a Premier League lock-in, catapulted himself into genuinely elite company.A more symbolic milestone is that for the first time in two decades the Dutch No 1 is neither Raymond van Barneveld or Michael van Gerwen. A keen tennis fan, Van Veen’s eyes lit up when one journalist compared it to Carlos Alcaraz eventually surpassing Rafael Nadal. “Growing up as a Dutchman, the goal was always to be No 2, because in my head, you cannot overtake Michael van Gerwen,” he said.View image in fullscreenGian van Veen and Luke Humphries are all smiles after the Dutchman knocked out the world No 2 with a 5-1 quarter-final win.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe idea of Littler and Van Veen as the Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of their sport has a certain seductive narrative quality to it. In truth, Humphries is going nowhere for a while, Josh Rock still has plenty of gears in him and Beau Greaves has the talent to go as far as she wants. But at the very least a changing of the guard seems to have occurred, the era of Van Gerwen and Gerwyn Price and Peter Wright and Michael Smith already receding.This is a sport for the young and the hungry and ideally the childless, players with boundless energy and time amid an increasingly gruelling schedule. In which context the presence of the 55-year-old Anderson in the last four strikes a pleasing note of dissonance, a throwback to a different, more innocent age of the sport.It was Anderson who finally ended Justin Hood’s remarkable challenge in the afternoon, winning 5-2 in a game wreathed in smiles and good humour. And this has always been Anderson’s unique appeal: the sense that he’d much rather be throwing in the pub with his mates. He doesn’t need the cash. He doesn’t really practise much any more. But he’s two wins away from his third world championship: proof that while rankings fluctuate, genius endures.His friend Searle is cut from the same kind of cloth: a sublime talent who has always wanted but never really needed to win. Like Anderson, he has never been the most dedicated or driven of players. Just a couple of months ago he didn’t even bother trying to qualify for the Grand Slam because, in his words, he didn’t want “another week in a hotel room”.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler reaches out to Krzysztof Ratajski after their quarter-final.Photograph: Godfrey Pitt/Action Plus/ShutterstockBut something seems to have clicked in him here: an appreciation that now is finally the time to make good on his promise. He swept aside Jonny Clayton 5-2 in the afternoon, dropping his first two sets of the tournament in the process, and if he brings his A-game against Littler, Alexandra Palace could be treated to one of its classic semi-finals.As for Littler, it was a far more serene night’s work after the rancour and recrimination of his win against Rob Cross on Tuesday. There were a few boos waiting for him as he took the stage, but the world champion quickly won them over with a brutal, nonchalant 33-minute exhibition that included a 170 to clinch the opening set.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

That was a pretty cool moment,” said Scott, who has TD returns on both of his interceptions this season. “Just having fun. ... That’s what this team relies on, man, just going out there playing free and just having fun.”The Hurricanes (12-2, CFP No 10 seed) have won two playoff games to get into football’s final four after needing an at-large berth to make the 12-team field, after not even playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. One more win and they will get to play for a national championship in their home stadium.Next for Miami in coach Mario Cristobal’s fourth season is a CFP semi-final at the Fiesta Bowl on 8 January against No 3 seed Georgia or No 6 seed Ole Miss, the SEC teams in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night.There hasn’t been a national title for “The U” since 2001, which was their fifth; Cristobal was a standout offensive tackle for the Hurricanes in their 1989 and 1991 championship seasons. The Hurricanes were denied a repeat championship in 2002 with a double-overtime loss in the Fiesta Bowl to Ohio State, the only other time the teams met in a bowl – and the last Miami played in that game.“It is 100% not about me. I’m part of their team, I’m a part of that family,” Cristobal said. “It is my obligation as a former Miami Hurricane player and all the things that Miami did for my brother and I to do my best to try to provide these guys with even better opportunities so they can fulfill all the great things they are destined for.”Before receiver Michael Irvin and coach Jimmy Johnson were Super Bowl champions with the Dallas Cowboys, they were part of the Hurricanes’ 1987 national championship. Irvin excitedly ran down the sideline while Scott was scoring for a 14-0 lead, and Johnson was nearby when acknowledged by Cristobal during the on-field trophy presentation.Now it’s third-ranked Ohio State (12-2, CFP No 2 seed), which went into the game as nine-and-a-half-point favorites, that can’t win back-to-back national titles for the first time in program history.The Buckeyes hadn’t played since a 13-10 loss to now-No 1 Indiana in a Big Ten championship game matchup of undefeated teams on 6 December. They still got a first-round bye, then lost just like all four teams that went directly to the quarter-final round in the inaugural 12-team playoff last season.“We worked really hard during the last three weeks leading up to this game to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win the first half, be ready to go,” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said. “I think the guys bought into it. But at the end of the day, we didn’t get it done.”Scott’s interception return came only 1:42 after Beck’s quick pass to Mark Fletcher Jr. out of the backfield for a nine-yard score.Beck, who was part of Georgia’s national titles in 2021 and 2022 when Stetson Bennett was the starter, completed 19 of 26 passes for 138 yards.When asked what stood out to him about these Hurricanes, Beck said, “Just the way that this team has responded to adversity. We knew coming into today that it wasn’t going to be easy.”The TD throw to Fletcher, who also ran 19 times for 90 yards and was the game’s offensive MVP, was the seventh of 13 consecutive completions for Beck. That set a record in the Cotton Bowl, which was played for the 90th time.Sayin, a freshman backup behind Will Howard for Ohio State’s championship run last season, was 22 of 35 for 287 yards with two interceptions and a TD to Jeremiah Smith. Sayin was sacked five times.AP All-America receiver Smith, the Miami native, caught seven of those passes for 157 yards, including a 14-yard TD on a fourth down in the fourth quarter.Carter Davis added a 49-yard field goal in the third quarter and ChaMar Brown ran for a five-yard TD in the game’s final minute for the Hurricanes, whose 24 points were the most Ohio State gave up this season.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

In today’s column, we address three of the big ones for 2026Graham RuthvenThu 1 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareHow will the US (the soccer team and the country) fare at the 2026 World Cup?You may have heard there’s a World Cup this year. After all the debate aboutticket pricesandpeace prizesandcooling breaks, an actual soccer tournament will kick off. That’s when the US, both as a national team and a host nation, will truly be judged; when the 2026 World Cup will be deemed a soaring success or a grotesque failure. There will be no in between. No nuance. That vanished from public discourse a long time ago.Fifa has already taken its victory lap, boasting about a record 150 million ticket applications. How many of those applications came from bots, it didn’t specify. Gianni Infantino did, however, claim Fifa’s exorbitant ticket prices are justifiable because without supporters being squeezed for every penny “there would be no football in 150 countries in the world.” Apparently the $7.5bn in revenue Fifa made over the lastWorld Cupcycle wasn’t enough.The USMNT is also expecting an improvement on the 2022 World Cup. A run beyond the round of 16 would represent success for Mauricio Pochettino and his players who went through a sometimes painful process in 2025. From theConcacaf Nations League lossesto Panama and Canada to the friendly victories over Japan, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay, the yearended more positivelythan it started. Will this lead to a strong showing at the World Cup itself?Further questions will be answered next summer. Will President Donald Trump’scosy relationship with Infantinohave any impact on where World Cup matches are played – and where they aren’t? How will fans from countriescurrently subject to a travel banattend matches? Could the searing heat of a North American summer affect the intensity of games? On and off the field, the USA’s measure will be taken.View image in fullscreenArsenal are on top of the Premier League as the new year begins.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockCan Arsenal hold their nerve to end their long wait for Premier League glory?Arsenal have been here before. Exactly four times, to be exact. Each of those four times the Gunners have been top at Christmas they have failed to win the Premier League title. Mikel Arteta could therefore be forgiven for chowing down his turkey and stuffing somewhat nervously this year even with his team in first place.Not least because Manchester City are getting larger and larger in the rearview mirror. There’s good reason to be wary of Pep Guardiola’s team considering they have won their last six league fixtures in a row. What was not so long ago seen as a transitional season for City could turn into another title winning one.Arteta says Arsenal are “actively looking” at potential signings in January. A mid-season addition or two could help push the Gunners towards the finish line ahead of City, Aston Villa and everyone else. However, Arsenal’s substantial summer business was meant to be enough to make them champions.Viktor Gyökeres was supposed to be their Erling Haaland. Instead, the Swedish striker has scored just five goals in 17 league games. Eberechi Eze was signed to give them a different dimension in the final third. Since netting a hat-trick in November’s North London Derby, though, the England international has gone four league games without a goal contribution. Noni Madueke – another summer signing – has missed much of the season through injury.The experience of previous title race failures might help Arsenal handle this specific sprint to the finish. Alternatively, past traumas could add to their nervousness which already appears to be building on the basis of recent shaky victories over Wolves, Everton and Brighton.Tuesday’s emphatic win against Villawas a release of some tension and possibly a sign that Arsenal are embracing the fight. The second half of the season will be a reckoning for Arteta’s title challengers.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso is attempting to oversee a shift in culture at Real Madrid.Photograph: Pankra Nieto/ReutersWho will win the power struggle for the soul of Real Madrid?If Xabi Alonso was ever complacent about the task of overhauling Real Madrid’s playing style and overall culture, he surely isn’t now. Hired in the summer to drag the Spanish giants into a new era, the former midfielder has encountered everything that makesLos Blancosan anomaly in the modern game.Under Alonso, Bayer Leverkusen pressed high. They won the ball back quickly in advanced areas and were among the Bundesliga’s best in possession. Alonso’s Real Madrid side, however, are nothing like the team that surged to the German title two seasons ago. They don’t press high. They don’t win the ball back quickly in advanced areas and they are often lacking in possession.That could be because Real Madrid don’t have players capable of doing these things. Or it could be because they have players unwilling to do these things, Vinicius Junior possibly among them. The Brazilian’s frosty relationship with Alonso is well documented, raising questions over his future at the Santiago Bernabéu beyond this season.This season has been more than just the start of a new managerial tenure, it’s been apower struggle for Real Madrid’s soul. One way or another, 2026 will be a watershed year. Either Alonso’s methods will start to take root, perhaps after some high-profile departures, or the 44-year-old will be spat out by a club that refuses to swallow its medicine.Explore more on these topicsFootballUSAWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.Just four months into the administration, Musk abruptlyannounced his exit. Six months later, it was reported thatDoge was no more. Musk has evensaidhe wouldn’t do it again.‘Moving fast and breaking things’“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”Kamarckcreated and managedthe National Performance Review, whichaimedto improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.By March, Musk had tapered his bold projection to $1tn, savings he told Fox News seemed “really quite achievable” as Doge wielded the axe.As of December, the agency’spurported savings, whichreportshave demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.However much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes.Analysisby the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”Questions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter,disputedthis claim.)But Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”‘They had really no understanding’How much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which haslogged$1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of therightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that hebelievesthe GAO shouldn’t exist.“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”Rather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by theTrump administration– without congressional approval.“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”‘Minimal transparency, maximal authority’When Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency,includingclaims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.Borges resigned in August, andfileda whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”Borges is nowrunningfor a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.Many Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”Approached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Users were shunned associal pariahs or “glassholes”.Despite these setbacks tech firms are persisting with smart glasses. Apple is expected to release a cheaper version of Vision Pro later this year, but the emphasis now is on AI-enabled devices.Reports in the tech press said Apple hadpaused its planned next iteration of virtual realityin favour of wearable AI devices. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is also expected to cut back on its plans for a “metaverse”, which includes its virtual reality Quest headsets. These are less advanced than Apple’s product but at £419 each are considerably cheaper and have cornered 80% of the market.Meta confirmed last month that it was “shifting some of our investments from metaverse towards AI glasses and other wearables”.Apple has refused to comment on the reports that it is scaling back virtual reality headsets.If confirmed, the cuts to Vision Pro would represent a rare commercial flop for an Apple product.When it launched Vision Pro in 2023, Apple hoped the devices, which allow users to interact with apps using eye movements, would have the same success as Macs and iPhones.At the product launch Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “Your surroundings become an infinite canvas … Vision Pro blends digital content into the space around us. It will introduce us to spatial computing.”But consumers balked at the price tag and reviewers complained that the devices were heavy, uncomfortable andlittle more than a gimmick. There was also alarm whenusers were filmed wearing the headsetswhile driving.Even enthusiasts admit the headsets only have niche appeal and that the experience of wearing them can beisolating from other people.The limited number of apps available compared with phones and tablets is also thought to have limited interest in Vision Pro.Morgan Stanley’s tech analyst Erik Woodring summed up its problems. “We can say the cost, form factor and the lack of VisionOS native apps are the reasons why the Vision Pro never sold broadly,” he told the FT.Apple says there are 3,000 apps available for Vision Pro headsets. That is a relatively small number compared with the proliferation after the launch of the iPhone in 2007.Explore more on these topicsAppleVirtual realityComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Today we examine how the White House’s war on vaccines has left the future of a key technology uncertain and up for grabsThu 1 Jan 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe late scientist and thinker Donald Brabenarguedthat 20th-century breakthroughs arose from scientists being free to pursue bold ideas without pressure for quick results or rigid peer review. The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines seemed to validate his claim: emergency conditions sped uptrials, relaxed regulatory sequencing and encouraged scientists to share findings before peer review. Out of that sprang one of the great scientific success stories of our age: mRNA vaccines. These use synthetic genetic code to train the immune system to defend itself against viruses. Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, whose work enabled the mRNA Covid vaccine, went on to win theNobelprize. Their breakthrough suggests that loosening traditional constraints could accelerate major scientific advances.The extensive scientific and logistic infrastructure built during that period is now occupied with turning the technology towards other diseases: flu,HIVand evencancer. Until very recently, the US, which put more than $10bn into mRNA development, appeared primed to reap the scientific and commercial rewards. Despite the deregulatory zeal that birthed mRNA, the second Trump administration has rejected it. Instead, it has been remarkably steady in its commitment to the radical anti-science and anti-vaccine agenda of the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. He has spent the past year undermining and outrightsabotagingthe US’s own success. Over the summer, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a “coordinated wind-down” of federal funding for mRNA research, cancelling an additional $500m in funding for 22 projects.These cuts will be devastating. Developing safe novel therapies depends on long timelines, steady funding and – despite Braben’s thesis – predictable regulation. The abrupt US reversals signal that Washington is now an unreliable partner, willing to walk away after others have invested heavily. And when once-trusted federal agencies stoprecommendingmRNA vaccines ordeliberatelyslow approvals, the harm doubles: it undermines public confidence and cripples the system meant to keep people safe. That’s all toovisible infalling vaccinationrates in the US. The pharmaceutical industry is not a benevolent actor, but these firms want to deliver – and profit from – mRNA technology. An unstable US market makes that significantly more difficult.The future of vaccinationAlthough mRNA vaccines proved their efficacy against Covid, the next frontier remains an open question. Early lab and trial data shows that they excel at priming the immune system, though real-world results are harder to pin down. They can be made quickly, tweaked easily, and a factory that makes one kind of mRNA vaccine should – with some caveats – be able to make any other one too. This means that scientists can test huge numbers of candidates: there are hundreds of vaccines currently in clinical trials, including early-stage work on extremely difficult pathogens like HIV.So far, mRNA’s biggest impact has been on diseases that we already vaccinate against, but not very effectively. For example, flu shots are slow to develop and cumbersome to produce, a terrible match for a virus that mutates every year. In some winters, the standard flu jab protects against serious illness onlyabout 30% of the time. Recently developed mRNA flu vaccines likeModerna’s mRNA1010andPfizer’s modRNAsignificantly outperformed the standard flu jab in final-phase trials. This is another vote of confidence for the technology, but also sets up a potentially clarifying conflict with the Trump administration: the decision on US approval for those vaccines is expected in early 2026 and rests with the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research – which is run byVinay Prasad, a close ally of Mr Kennedy. A negative or stalled result would confirm just how far the administration is willing to go in its anti-mRNA crusade.Ironically, the most ambitious mRNA work has escaped the Trump administration’s notice. Companies are racing to develop personalised cancer vaccines – drawn by both the huge market and the fact that the White House doesn’t seem to view these treatments as “vaccines” at all. As a result, they’ve been largely left untouched. The development of mRNA was not just an academic enterprise. The technology advanced because firms built the infrastructure needed to turn laboratory findings into therapies. Paradoxically for a Republican president, it is this business that US policy now jeopardises.The world’s responsibilityIt will take more than a mercurial Donald Trump to destroy the US’s advantage in mRNA research and production. The technology emerged from an American university, most industry jobs are there, andnearly 75% of all manufacturingcomes out of the US (the remainder is almost entirely in the EU).However, both public and industry researchers are alarmed by the government’s actions, and bothsaythat they willtake their work elsewhereif it continues. It’s quite a leap from threatening to move to actually doing it. Given the circumstances, the UK and the EU should help them along.The EU has made the right noises on recruiting US scientists horrified by Mr Trump,with a proposed€500m from the European Commission and another €100m pledged by France. But it is only a fraction of what the US president has cut, and it remains to be seen if that money will materialise. If Mr Trump’s campaign against mRNA research continues, theforthcoming EU Biotech Actshould make it a priority for Europe to surpass the US as the world’s pre-eminent mRNA research and manufacturing centre. As a bloc, it is already comfortably in second place.The UK has a role to play as well. It is a major vaccine research power and has taken an interest in mRNA cancer therapies andpartnerships with industry. Its manufacturing ambitions have been largely focused on vaccine self-sufficiency but, with several facilitiesalready able to make vaccines, the knowhow is there to be built on.As long as Mr Kennedy is allowed to set policy, American mRNA research will be operating in a hostile environment. This is a critical moment for the technology, with a second generation of vaccines emerging and a plethora of promising long-term programmes that need support. The US underwrote much of the early success of these vaccines, but it was always a global project. The rest of the world must now see it through.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The president threatened to strip his citizenship. Mainstream synagogues slandered him as the spawn of Osama Bin Laden and Chairman Mao. But today,Zohran Mamdanibecame the first socialist mayor of New York City.For all the hysteria, when I look at Mamdani, I didn’t see some radical departure from the past. I see him as the heir to an old and venerable Jewish tradition – that of Yiddish socialism – which helped buildNew York.In some cases, the link is direct. Bruce Vladeck, a member of one of Mamdani’s transition committees, is a well-respected expert on Medicare, but for the sake of this article, his credentials matter less than his surname.Vladeck is the great-grandson of Baruch Charney Vladeck, a Marxist troublemaker from the Pale of Settlement, a tract of land in the Russian empire where Jews were permitted to live at a time of rampant antisemitic oppression. Baruch showed up in New York after the failed Russian Revolution of 1905 with a Cossack’s saber scars all over his face. He later became a socialist alderman and member of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia’s housing administration. Vladeck was not actually his birth name. It was rather anom de guerre, adopted when he joined the Jewish Labor Bund, the socialist, secular and defiantly anti-Zionist movement whose slogan, “here where we live is our country,” would make an apt tagline for Mamdani’s New York.In our city, exiled revolutionaries like Vladeck found fertile ground. At the dawn of the 20th century, New York was home to nearly 600,000 Jews, making it the largest Jewish city on Earth, a title it still holds. They packed 10 to a room, into the squalid tenements of the Lower East Side, where they toiled in garment sweatshops, and where the fires caused by their in-home piecework businesses mirror those caused by the exploding lithium-ion batteries of e-bikes today. They soon transformed into a clamorous, disputatious and utterly radical proletariat – the same sort of constituency that powered Mamdani’s campaign.View image in fullscreenShoppers congregate as vendors sell their wares on the sidewalk outside haberdasheries on the Lower East Side of Manhattan circa 1900.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesWhile New York’s Jewish communities are far too numerous, and far too fractious, to jam into one single story, there is still a narrative that gets spun. It goes like this. After the second world war, Jews made bank, assimilated into America, and fell in love with Israel. (Never mind the many communities this story leaves out – the booming, non-Zionist, utterly unassimilated Satmar community; the Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union; the dykes and freaks and commies and artists; Bernard Sanders. The list goes on.) The institutions associated with the narrative –the Anti-Defamation League, posh New York synagogues – have been Mamdani’s most virulent attackers.Jewish New York’s reckoning with Zohran Mamdani: ‘He’s become a vehicle for our tensions’Read moreThe hysteria of this elite over Mamdani’s ascent would have seemed bizarre to so many of their great-grandparents. In New York at the turn of the century, Jewish workers created a secular, socialist, but specifically Yiddish world. By the time my own great-grandfather turned up in Ellis Island in 1904, this sort of socialism was alive on every Lower East Side street – in the mutual aid societies, debate clubs, picket lines, night schools, and the lectures that Jewish workers obsessively attended. Socialist Yiddish papers sold 120,000 copies a day. The socialist Workmen’s Circle attracted tens of thousands of members in hundreds of branches across America and educated thousands of children at their secular Yiddish schools. Two garment workers unions, led by former Jewish revolutionaries, represented more than 100,000 workers between them. And in 1912, the Yiddish, socialist newspaper The Forwardconstructed a beaux-arts skyscraper on the corner of Rutgers Square on the Lower East Side. “Where is the synagogue of our Jewish workers? Where is the temple of freedom, of equality, of brotherhood?” Forward editor Abe Cahan asked. That building was his attempt at an answer.View image in fullscreenPeople protest against child labor in New York circa 1909.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCahan adorned the Forward Building’s facade with busts of Marx and Engels, but on the Lower East Side, socialism meant more than the words of these two men. It was the idiom of something broad, free and generous – the fight for a better and more beautiful world. To be a socialist meant to be a human, to affirm that there was more to life than the brutish quest for coin. Not just wages, but dignity. Not just bread, but roses too.Or, as Mamdani’s first campaign for state assembly put it – “roti and roses”.Today, just blocks away from the Forward Building is the New York office of the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani joined the group in 2017, and it continues to be his political home. The thick culture the DSA created – of picket lines and soccer leagues, educational lectures and political canvasses and dating nights – recalls that of its socialist forbearers. Over the last eight years, it has also built a formidable political machine. The DSA launched Mamdani’s bids for state assembly, then for mayor. When it came to door-knocking, they were his army.Like the Jewish socialists of old, Mamdani grew his base with militant labor organizing. In 2021, when taxi drivers camped out in front of City Hall, to protest their murderous medallion debt, Mamdani was with them. He moved his assembly office on to the sidewalk, went on a 14-day hunger strike with the drivers, then danced with them when they won their debt relief.I remember the emotion in his voice when he shoutedinto the microphone: “This is just the beginning of solidarity. We are going to fight together until there is nothing left in this world to win.” Those words that could have echoed down Broadway 100 years before.View image in fullscreenThe Jewish Daily Forward building in New York circa 1950.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesLike New York itself, Mamdani’s campaign was multicultural, multiracial, polyglottal. When Andrew Cuomo tried to bait him as un-American, he released ads in Spanish and Bangla, Hindi and Arabic. He ran a campaign devoted to class-first politics that sought to speak to everyone in their own idiom, while never once apologizing for who he was.This too mirrors the tactics of New York’s old school Jewish left. They also lived and struggled in a diverse immigrant world – where their co-worker at the garment factory might be Italian, and where their uncle, the radical lawyer, would defend aboricuacomrade from the cops. They also knew how to organize across difference.AsBen Daviswrote in the Guardianthis April: “Jews in New York voted in thehundreds of thousandsfor socialists for decades.” In the years before the first world war, Jewish districts in New York elected 10 socialist assemblymen, seven socialist city councilmen, and one socialist municipal judge. In 1914, these neighborhoods sent Jewish socialist labor lawyer Meyer London to Congress.View image in fullscreenMeyer London speaks at a rally for striking street car workers in New York on 15 July 1916.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyLondon was not a favored choice – not any more than Mamdani. He had once raised money for guns to fight the tsar. He denounced lynching and supported open immigration regardless of race, and opposed the creation of a Jewish ethnostate on the backs of Palestinians. Worst of all, he was hated by the Tammany machine, which sent thugs to the polls to gin up support for their favored candidate. But unionized garment workers turned the tables, canvassing, door-knocking and poll watching with a fervor that reminds me of the canvasses we Mamdani volunteers undertook on the murderously hot days before the primary. Then, and now, the socialists won their race.Power concedes nothing willingly, and as socialists took political office, they fell ever more under siege. In 1918, London opposed attempts to create a Jewish state against the will of Palestine’s Arab majority. Furious,wealthy Zionistsrallied against him, their denunciations likely costing him his election. (Billionaires such as Bill Ackman ran a similarly vicious, but blessedly futile campaign against Mamdani). With America’s entry into the first world war, jingoistic nationalism swept the country, leading to the arrests of socialist politicians, and the Palmer Raids that savaged the Jewish left. In 1920,five New York socialist assemblymenwere expelled from office on accusations of disloyalty. Three of them were Jewish. During the Red Scare, and later, throughout the McCarthy years, the institutions of the Jewish left would be surveilled, raided and smashed. Partial as it was, this attempted erasure was effective enough that in the year 2025, Jewish institutions could bellow that Mamdani’s politics were foreign to their New York.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani calls for the full enforcement of the city’s sanctuary city laws at a campaign rally in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, on 21 June 2025.Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty ImagesAs Mamdani’s video team churned out content throughout his campaign, they sought to situate him in his city’s socialist legacy. Particularly moving were his history lessons, where he sat at a desk in the middle of the street and expounded on his political forbearers – like East Harlem congressmanVito Marcantonio, and the Yiddish-speaking, socialist birth control pioneerFania Mindell. At the same time, he spoke in the idiom of today’s New York, with its neighborhoods of more recent arrivals. He went onSubway Takesand passed out sweets for Diwali in Jackson Heights, and showed up at the queer dance partyPapi Juiceto ask for votes. He honored the past, but found new voters in new coalitions, in a city that is ever in the process of becoming.Throughout the election, Zionists tried to smear Mamdani as an antisemite. It didn’t work. Not even with these Zionists’ own children; according to one July poll by Zenith Research,two-thirds of Jews under age 40supported Mamdani. There are many reasons for this, including the craven falsity of the charge, which had grown hollow from misuse; the moral anguish of witnessing Israel’s genocide in Gaza; and the fact that Jews, just like everyone else, want affordable rent, free childcare, and buses that are fast and free.But another reason is this. Mamdani walks in an older Jewish tradition. Not that of ritzy Upper East Side synagogues, but of so many of our great-grandparents: the socialist sweatshop workers who fought for a better and more beautiful world.Molly Crabapple is an artist and the author of the forthcoming bookHere Where We Live is Our Country: The Story of the Jewish Bund, which will be published by One World Random House on 7 April 2026Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionNew YorkUS politicsJudaismReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Today Zohran Mamdani’s swearing-in makes this city a real homeMona EltahawyThe new mayor embraces social justice, and rejects hate and nationalism. That’s why we’re so excited to see what he’ll do in officeThu 1 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 12.11 ESTShareOn a cold Saturday morning, a little over a week before the New York City mayoral election in November, I was at a park in Queens to speak at a fundraiser forAsiyah Women’s Centre,the oldest and largest shelter providing support for American Muslim female victims of domestic violence. Vendors selling everything from chai to embroidered Palestinian handicrafts turned out to support the fundraiser; a DJ blasted music and artists painted children’s faces with the colours of Halloween.I chose the vendor with the most protein on offer because I lift and squat more than my bodyweight and must meet a daily goal. “Our kebab is one of Zohran’s favourites,” the man at the King of Kebab stand told me, proudly and unprompted, as he piled my plate with meat.I had not asked him anything about the mayoral race but I knew exactly who he meant, because like Cher, Madonna, Beyoncé and Björk, our mayor-elect is simply Zohran to many of us. And not because we can’t pronounce his family name – I’m looking at you Andrew Cuomo and all who seem to deliberately mangle “Mamdani”. In New York City, and everywhere else I’ve been,2025 was the year when everybody learned his name. And after he is sworn in today on the steps of City Hall – followed bya party for 40,000 in Lower Manhattan– 2026 will be the year of Zohran.I’ve been a New Yorker for 23 years. During that time, I have travelled across the world to give lectures and I’ve never been asked what I think of Michael (Bloomberg), Bill (de Blasio), or Eric (Adams) – our mayors since I moved here. None of them has come close to encapsulating thearduous and necessary complication of identity that many New Yorkers feel in this city of a million Muslims. But ever since he announced his mayoral candidacy at the end of 2024, Zohran has seemed to represent something that my life has bumped up against many times since I have lived here.I’ve spent 19 of my 23 years in NYC in Harlem, where I live in a rent-stabilised apartment in a brownstone owned by a Black woman from the neighbourhood. Mamdani campaigned as an ally to tenants like me,vowing to freeze rentfor 2 million people living in rent-stabilised apartments as part of his focus on affordability. A few weeks before we went to the polls, my landlady and I were catching up in the hall outside her apartment. “I hope you’re voting for Zohran,” she said.During my citizenship oath in NYC in 2011, we were told that in the hall for the ceremony were people from 140 countries about to become US citizens. Few other cities hold the allure of New York in the global imagination. And few other Muslims have reached Mamdani’s level of first-name celebrity status, or the ability to complicate the narrative of what a Muslim is. I am an avowed consumer of cannabis and I cheered Mamdani’s response during the mayoral debates when candidates were asked if they had ever bought marijuana, which is legal in New York. “I’ve purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop,”Mamdani replied, with a big cheesy grin. Fuck, yeah, Zohran!I moved from Egypt to Seattle in 2000, and then to New York City a year after the September 11 attacks. Soon after arriving, I found community with Muslims and we began to call ourselves progressive Muslims. Unlike me, most of them had been born and raised in the US. Those who did not wear hijabs spoke often of how the 9/11 attacks forced an unfamiliar visibility upon Muslims, who comprise less than 2% of the US population. That was especially the case for those whose families were more recent arrivals, compared to Black Muslims who have been in the country as far back as the days of enslavement. “I came out as Muslim after 9/11,” one of my new friends told me at the time, adding that his neighbours and colleagues had assumed he was Latinx. Over the years since, I have lost count of the number of “No hablo español,” that I’ve issued across the city because I’m often thought to be Dominican or Puerto Rican.Mamdani lives in Queens, the site of the fundraiser for the Asiyah Women’s Centre. “The capital of linguistic diversity, not just for the five boroughs (of New York City), but for the human species, is Queens,”Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro wrotein Nonstop Metropolis: A New York City Atlas. There are as many as800 languagesspoken in New York City, and nowhere in the world has more than Queens, according to theEndangered Language Alliance.Donald Trump, whose regime plans to ramp up efforts in 2026 tostrip naturalised peopleof their US citizenship, is also from Queens. As is Republican New York City councilwoman Vickie Paladino, who called for the “expulsion of Muslims” in the wake of the Bondi Beach massacre. In a year when their politics had begun to feel undefeatable, Zohran’s win is a breath of hope.Mamdani excites so many, in the US and abroad, because to co-opt andmisquote Robert Frost, he is the more enticing of the two roads diverging in Queens, and across the US at the moment. He makes more urgent – and youthful – the choice to embrace social justice and reject hate and nationalism at a time when older politicians are succeeding in their bigotry and chauvinism. He will becomethe city’s youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor, and its first mayor born on the African continent. It feels apt that New York is the city that first embraced him.The year after I moved to New York City, my brother and his wife had a daughter – my own immediate family’s first US citizen. Ten years after I moved to NYC,I was arrestedfor spray painting over a racist, Islamophobic, pro-Israel advertisement in the subway. I did it because I did not want my niece and her three siblings or any other American Muslim children to be bullied or to have to choose – as the racists and Islamophobes insist – between being American and Muslim.And now, here in NYC, I can point to Zohran!Mona Eltahawy writes theFEMINIST GIANTnewsletter.

Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in theUSis slightly higher thanin Europe.The real threat facing Europe lies in its own economic and technological backwardness. Between 2008 and 2023, GDProse by 87%in the US, compared with just 13.5% in the EU. Over the same period, the EU’s GDP per capita fell from 76.5% of the US level to 50%. Even the poorest US state – Mississippi – has ahigher per capita incomethan that of several major European economies, includingFrance,Italyand theEU average.Today, roughly half of the world’s 50 largest technology firms are American, while only four are EuropeanThis widening economic gap cannot be explained by demographics. Instead, it reflects stronger productivity growth in the US, largely owing to technological innovation and higher total factor productivity. Today, roughly half of the world’s 50 largest technology firms are American, whileonly four are European. Over the past five decades,241 US firmshave grown from startups into companies with market capitalisations of at least $10bn (£7.4bn), compared with just 14 in Europe.These trends raise a critical question: which countries will lead the industries of the future, and where doesEuropefit in? The race for technological leadership now spans a wide range of fields, including AI and machine learning, semiconductor design and production, robotics, quantum computing, fusion energy, fintech and defence technologies. Europe enters this race at a clear disadvantage.Whether the US orChinacurrently leads the industries of the future remains open to debate, but most observers agree that it’s essentially a two-horse race, with the US still ahead in several key areas. Beyond that, innovation is concentrated in countries such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Israel. In Europe, by contrast, innovative activities are largely confined to the UK, Germany, France and Switzerland – two of which are not even EU member states.It is hardly a surprise, then, that while the US and China dominate global technological rankings, Europe finds itself far from the top. And the outlook is anything but reassuring, given that the next wave of innovation is widely expected to be more disruptive than anything we have seen over the past half century.View image in fullscreenView of Paris. Even the poorest US state has a higher per capita income than several major European economies, including France and Italy.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersThe technological gap between the US and Europe can be attributed to several factors. First, the US has a far deeper and more dynamic ecosystem for financing startups, while Europe still lacks a genuine capital markets union, limiting the scale and speed at which new firms can grow.Second, Europe is hampered by excessive and fragmented regulation. A US startup can launch a product under a single regulatory framework and immediately access a market of more than 330 million consumers. The EU has a population of roughly 450 million but remains divided among 27 national regulatory regimes. An International Monetary Fund analysisshowsthat internal market barriers in the EU act like a tariff of about 44% for goods and 110% for services – far higher than the tariff levels the US imposes on most imports.Third, cultural attitudes toward risk-taking differ sharply. Until relatively recently, a failed entrepreneur in some EU countries (such as Italy) could face criminal penalties, while in the US, a tech founder who has never failed is often seen as too risk-averse.Fourth, the US benefits from a deeply integrated academic-military-industrial complex, while Europe’s chronic underinvestment in defence has weakened its innovation capacity. Technological leaders such as the US, China, Israel and, more recently, Ukraine spend heavily on defence, with military research often producing technologies that have civilian applications.Despite this, many European political leaders continue to frame higher defence spending as a trade-off between security and social welfare. In reality, free-riding on US defence spending since the end of the second world war has limited the type of innovation that could have generated more of both through higher productivity. Paradoxically, sustaining Europe’s social model will require greater investment in defence, beginning with meeting Nato’s new spending target of 3.5% of GDP.If Europe allows its technological lag to grow over the coming decades, it risks prolonged stagnation and continued economic decline relative to the US and China. There are, however, reasons for cautious optimism. Increasingly aware that Europe faces an existential challenge, policymakers have begun to advance serious reform proposals. The most notable examples are the two major 2024 reports onEU competitivenessand thesingle marketby the former Italian prime ministersMario DraghiandEnrico Lettarespectively.With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovationEurope also retains considerable strengths, including high-quality human capital, excellent education systems and world-class research institutions. With the right incentives and regulatory reforms, these assets could support much higher levels of commercial innovation. With a better environment for entrepreneurship, Europe’s high per capita income, large internal market and elevated savings rates could help unleash a wave of investment.Crucially, even if Europe never leads in cutting-edge technologies, it could still significantly boost productivity by adopting and adapting American and Chinese innovations. Many of these technologies are general-purpose in character, benefiting both adopters and pioneers.All of this leaves Europe at an inflection point. As Ernest Hemingway famouslyobserved, bankruptcy happens “gradually and then suddenly”. So far, Europe’s technological decline has been gradual. But if it fails to confront its structural weaknesses, today’s slow erosion could give way to a sudden and irreversible loss of economic relevance.Nouriel Roubini is professor emeritus at the Stern school of business and the author of Megathreats: Ten Dangerous Trends that Imperil Our Future and How to Survive Them.©Project SyndicateExplore more on these topicsEuropeProject Syndicate economistsEconomicsDonald TrumpGlobal economyEuropean UnionChinacommentShareReuse this content"

Why must we tolerate it?Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.07 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.12 ESTShareI’m becoming concerned that we as a species have gone to the dogs – quite literally. Somewhere between the rise of boutique pet grooming and private members’ clubs for canines, dogs appear to have become our preferred species for social interaction.Parks, beaches, cafes – even offices and yoga studios, which in the past were areas for human exclusivity, or at least priority – are all frequently shared zones. That means you must joyfully tolerate being sniffed or enthusiastically pranced at. Your belongings, likewise, are subject to dog paws and noses. Object, and you’ll be met with looks of discord, as though you’ve confessed to disliking sunlight or laughter. Or the pet person thinksyou must be frightenedand insists “He/She won’t hurt you!”What happened next: Valerie the dachshund taught us how to survive – and thriveRead moreIf a human, especially a small child, pressed up against strangers, making prolonged eye contact while drooling, there’d likely be reprimands and reining in. But when a dog does it, it’s apparently “adorable”.We seem to have entered an era of canine exceptionalism. A new dog on a bush walk now attracts at least as much excitement as a new baby. People flock to stroke the spaniel, and entire conversations unfold between strangers about breeds and training techniques.Across cities, the cult of the dog is expanding with impressive speed. In London, there are private members’ clubs for dogs – actual clubs, with menus, treatments and membership fees that would make most humans blush. In Sydney’s more affluent suburbs, dog grooming salons, resembling human day spas and offering pawdicures, are the new retail must-have. And then of course there’s puppy schools and puppy yoga, where the dog is essential to the practice.A woman in my old apartment building regularly transported her dog in a pram, complete with blanket and an air of maternal pride. Every afternoon she’d walk the dog,in the buggy, along the harbour foreshore. At Christmas, she put it in the back of her convertible, surrounded by wrapped presents, for a photoshoot. She then drove off with her canine companion in the front seat on Christmas Day, presumably for a special lunch.Dog ownership has taken on a deeper emotional charge. For some, the pet has become a permanent stand-in, replacing partners or even friends. A dog’s love, after all, is uncomplicated. It doesn’t ghost you or critique your life choices. You can project whatever you like on to it, and it will happily wag along. It’s always ready and willing to accompany you as you head to the shops, the cafe, the park and even to work.I can’t help wondering where that leaves those of us who still prefer human company. Increasingly, we seem to be the awkward ones, the ones who don’t kneel to greet passing labradoodles or maintain a separate Instagram account for our pets. The ones who dare to prefer human conversation to pet companionship.Dog play afternoon: dachshunds overrun Hyde Park for Christmas walkRead moreDogs are loyal, affectionate, non-judgmental. They don’t argue or forget to text back. Yet there’s an awful lot of emotional heavy-lifting we’ve assigned them. In a world that feels complicated and lonely, dogs have become our emotional support systems, our confidants, our social icebreaker and, in some cases, our replacements.I’m really hoping that humanity stages a comeback. That we rediscover the quiet joy of connection not mediated by fur or fetch. I still believe the efforts required to maintain human relationships are overall rewarded. If we give up, we are fast-tracking the road to silo solos, made up of Karens and Kevins who never learned about give and take between humans.So for now, if you see me in the lift, politely avoiding the dog in the designer raincoat, be kind. That look on my face is me wondering whether it’s the world, not me, that’s gone barking mad.Farhana Dawood is a journalist and academic. As a journalist she has worked for the BBC, ABC and SBS.

Do nothing about itGaby HinsliffFrom Agatha Christie doing the dishes to the cancer surgeon inspired at the theatre, an idling brain suddenly seems able to join the dotsThu 1 Jan 2026 10.51 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 13.47 ESTShareIf you really want to solve a problem, try doing nothing about it. Fold some laundry. Stir a risotto. Go for a run, watch a film, try to entertain someone else’s baby: anything that involves pottering about in an undemanding yet still vaguely engaged way, which absolutely couldn’t be classed as work but isn’t totally vegetative either. It may not be the productivity hack any go-getter wants to hear, but it’s surprising how often a spell of aimless noodling around frees an otherwise overworked human brain to make the kind of lateral mental leap that helps everything fall into place. And I’m not just saying that to justify a New Year’s Day spent lying hungover on the sofa, ploughing through the last of the Christmas cheese.For the eminent cancer surgeonMichael Baum, it was a night off with his wife at the theatre that allowed him to suddenly join the dots. After watching a scene in Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia where one character explains chaos theory to another, Baum had his own personal eureka moment: what if this mathematical concept, used to describe complex systems that may seem haphazard but have a hidden underlying pattern to them, could also explain the otherwise puzzling way in which cancer grows and spreads? The result of that one stray thought as the interval curtain rose was an innovation in chemotherapy, and a gratifying rise in survival rates.Though the history of science is littered with accidental breakthroughs discovered in pursuit of something else entirely, what Baum was describing sounds more like a kind of glorious inefficiency: a victory born of knowing exactly when to stop trying. The story only came to light after Stoppard’s death, when Baum was movedto write to the Timesthat the playwright couldn’t have known how many lives he had inadvertently saved. But with all due respect to the power of drama, perhaps it wasn’t really the play that saved them so much as the permission it gave a doctor to switch off and relax.View image in fullscreen‘Agatha Christie used to work out plots for her murder mysteries while washing up.’Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesAfter all, the kind of pottering that frees a mind doesn’t have to be particularly high-powered. Archimedes supposedly had his breakthrough lolling in the bath, watching displaced water slop over the side.Agatha Christieused to work out plots for her murder mysteries while washing up, arguing that “the purely mechanical labour helps the flow of ideas, and how delightful to find your domestic task finished with no actual remembrance of having done it”. Even I have learned over the years that when I’m stuck on a piece of writing that won’t fall into shape, the quickest way of fixing it isn’t to hammer away at it grimly for hours but (sorry, boss) to shut the laptop and do something completely different for a bit. Somehow, in the process of taking the dog round the block or grumpily stacking the dishwasher, things more often than not arrange themselves. The trick is to divorce the busy conscious mind from some deeper subconscious part of the brain, which can carry on percolating things even when it doesn’t feel as if you’re thinking at all. It’s different from consciously working, but also very different from loafing: if anything the closest parallel is with dreaming, and the way it allows a mind to rerun the mental videotape of the day and make sense of everything you couldn’t process at the time. And, as with sleep, the busier you are, the more you probably need it.Recently I heard a former Downing Street aide suggest only half-jokingly that governments should adopt what universities call a reading week (or strictly speaking, what a reading week would be if students didn’t mostly treat it as a chance to go home and get their laundry done). What he meant was a break, long enough to do some actual thinking, from constantly running to catch up with whatever outrage is currently fuelling the social media news cycle. If Keir Starmer’s government is often criticised for lacking a grand vision or intellectual hinterland, in part that’s surely because nobody in this punch-drunk administration ever has time to develop one: to reflect on what has worked and what hasn’t, to make the less obvious connections, and let some original ideas bubble up.There’s no way a government as unpopular as this one would ever dare say it was taking time out to think deep thoughts, of course, for fear of the inevitable public backlash against what would be perceived as either slacking or unbearable pomposity. Yet the irony is that many of us are probably secretly craving something similar. According toa recent TUC survey, more than half of British workers say their jobs have got more intense in recent years: women are particularly likely to feel uncomfortably stretched, which may reflect the fact they’re more likely to work in public sector jobs such as health and education, where rising workloads and shrinking headcounts, coupled with government productivity targets, have systematically squeezed all the slack out of the day. For too many of us, work intensity means having no time to think straight during the day, and getting home too knackered to do anything much but slump and scroll. What is being lost is the kind of free-floating time that allows a relaxed but still intellectually curious mind to slide usefully sideways.Paradoxically, it’s technology that may also offer the best chance to claw some of it back. As AI starts to take on more and more routine tasks at work, employers will face a choice over how to use the human time saved. They can either simply seize the opportunity to make humans redundant and max out their profits in the short term, or they can gamble on a longer path to future productivity gains by giving some of that time back to their employees – not as the endless paid leisure time of Keynesian fantasy but to do the kind of original and creative thinking or training that large language models still can’t replicate. (One obvious template isGoogle’s 20%ruleto promote innovation back in the 00s, under which programmers were offered a day a week to play around with side-projects on the company’s time: the commercial rationale was that while most would come to nothing, there would be enough original ideas generated to justify the time seemingly wasted.)Too utopian? Maybe. But for now, there are worse ways to ease yourself gingerly into January than to remember that time spent doing what looks like nothing much can be time spent achieving more than you actually realised.

It’s been a wild ride to get hereBen CollinsMy transformation was most apparent the day I realised that a digital rectal examination can be life-savingThu 1 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 18.06 ESTShareFor the past four years I’ve been breaking every rule of appropriate, normal behaviour. I’ve poked, probed, inserted, stabbed and cut people in their most intimate body parts. I’ve examined dissected bodies and riffled through a bucket of human hearts. I’ve been baptised in every bodily fluid known; dodged spurting blood, spilt oozing pus and been caught out by the force of amniotic fluid erupting from a caesarean section.Studying medicine at the age of 47, I realised in my first semester that this was not going to be like my previous experiences. Feelings of fear and ineptitude have been my almost constant companions as I was thrown into challenging situations.At first just asking a patient about her depression seemed paralysingly inappropriate. Who was I to stumble into the private world of a stranger, when I would normally simply smile and mind my own business as we passed in the street?At 47, I’m retraining to be a doctor 2,000km from home. The challenge is immense | Ben CollinsRead moreShe kindly tolerated my nervous questioning, becoming the first of many of my forgiving patients to say: “You’ve got to learn somehow.”Then came the patients willing to let me stick a large needle into their vein. And the incredibly generous women who allowed me to learn how to examine their newly born babies, causing tears all round while checking for hip dysplasia.With the onslaught of study and constantly asking patients if I could squeeze, tap, listen and feel their various body parts, I found myself becoming someone else. Searching for signs of disease through the intestines of the cadaver was just a normal Wednesday morning, and discussing how someone would prefer their death to play out was the topic for after lunch.The transformation was most apparent the day I realised that a digital rectal examination can be life-saving. Until that point I’d seditiously protested to my fellow students that sticking your finger up the patient’s arse was bad for us and worse for them. But then a urology professor showed me how it could be minimally traumatic for the patient and clinically illuminating. The prostate was hard, lumpy and asymmetrical, and even I could immediately tell this was cancer and treatment should be expedited.The terror continues now that I’m poised to start my first job and can no longer loudly assert that I am just a student, minimising the expectations of my colleagues and patients. I have not quite come to terms with calling myself a doctor because it sounds somewhat fraudulent.But I also occasionally admit to myself that I am pretty thrilled about being a junior doctor at 51. I am blown away at the momentary connections I get to share with people in the most extraordinary moments of life. I am in the front row at the birth of their children, I am there when they learn of a newly discovered brain tumour. What do you say to someone faced with their own death? I can’t speak for the patients but even in my fledgling state I feel I have been able to make some small positive contributions.Here’s what I learned in medical school – beyond the curriculum | Roland BullRead moreAnd occasionally the fog of ignorance and insecurity parts for just a moment to provide a glimpse of what it might be like to be an experienced doctor. As a student I was struck one day when a seasoned paediatrician glanced at a three-second video of subtle movement of a baby in its mother’s arms and immediately diagnosed a seizure disorder with a high risk of significant lifelong consequences. I was in awe of his skill.The experience was still just hanging on to my straining grey matter a year later in the emergency department, when I was the first to assess a baby brought in by her mother concerned about some unusual movements. She also had a short video of a momentary jerky movement. The chances of seeing this condition once were low so seeing it a second time and being able to suggest the diagnosis to my supervising doctor was maybe a fluke. But knowing I may have played a small role in getting this child treatment that could prevent a life of disability is a nice thought to hold on to.Looking back on the four years since I resigned from my previous career as a small-town journalist, I feel a mixture of excitement, pride and exhaustion. It’s been the most stressful and anxiety-ridden episode of my adult life but also such a satisfying achievement that I feel has set me up for what is hopefully a very rewarding 20-odd years of my next career.Ben Collins is a former ABC journalist in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where he grows tropical fruits, builds and sails traditional wooden boats, and will imminently be an old but junior doctorExplore more on these topicsDoctorsOpinionHospitalsHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)commentShareReuse this content"

Midlife crisis? No thanksEmma BrockesAt 50, I find myself in a gazing-up-at-trees phase. What does it all mean? It’s not completely clear – but it’s certainly bothering my kidsThu 1 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareAccording toresearch undertakenby Stanford Medicine in 2024, adult human beings are subject to two “massive biomolecular shifts” – spikes in ageing, in other words – one at 44 and another at 60, confirming what most of us instinctively know to be true: that we get older in jagged bursts – not with gentle, steady progression. As the new year issues its annual invitation to stocktake, the thing I keep thinking is where we might place the equivalent emotional pivot points, those periods in which, after years of – God willing! – pottering along feeling roughly the same, suddenly, one day, there’s a change.I bring this up because I seem to be in the middle of one, an inflection point that manifests in the number of times on the walk back from the school drop-off I stop to look at a bird in a tree, or a snail on a wall, or any number of other overwrought visual metaphors that allow me to feel momentarily like I’m inside a poem byGerard Manley Hopkins. Hard to put one’s finger on what’s going on, but it has to do with the sense of an ending, which, if it’s sad at all, isn’t sad-sad; rather, it occupies that category of sadness I think of as the anticipation of future nostalgia.These feelings of transition are largely brought on by external factors – in my case, my kids’ last year of primary school – but are also, obviously, subject to cultural cues. I turned 50 at the end of November, which in any age prior to ours, would put me safely on the other side of a full-scale midlife crisis. But in an era in which 50-year-olds still dress precisely as they did 20 years ago – as if they’re about to commute to work via skateboard – everything has been pushed back by a decade. And so here I am, in what I have come to think of as my looking-at-trees phase, which last hit with this intensity in my early 30s and before that, adolescence.That seems about right, doesn’t it? Three big pivot points in a life when one becomes, briefly but acutely, aware of time passing, and which in my experience, tends to hit during even-numbered years (for that reason, I’ve always preferred the lower pressure of odd-number ages). There’s that line fromDon DeLillo’s Underworldin which he remarks of a couple working out on their running machines, “they were training to live forever” – and it’s the faltering of that delusion that ushers in these mind-blowing periods. In other words, I’m doing what everyone does as they age, which is to assume they are the first people in history to have experienced something people have been experiencing since the beginning of time – in this case: intimations of mortality. (See also: having a baby.)By the way, children don’t like their parents entering this mode, partly because, at least in my case, it triggers observations like, “Weird to think one day our cats will be dead and we’ll be so sad”; and partly because it forces them to confront the horrifying possibility that their parents have interior lives as real and awkward as their own. That’s the other thing about these pivot points: their unavoidability. I’ve had occasional success when it comes to big, decisive life events of finding ways to cheat the impact by feeling the feelings ahead of time, at a lower temperature, and then sailing through the actual event relatively unscathed.I managed to do this last year when I moved countries after 17 years and did most of my grieving in advance, bit by bit, so that I was blindsided only twice: once when walking away for the last time from the school my kids had been at since kindergarten – and feeling, to my utter amazement, almost panicked by the size of the grief. And the second time, spontaneously bursting into tears at the awfulness of saying the goodbyes I’d been so busy rationalising away – I’d forgotten to factor in what it would actually feel like.By contrast, these more generalised periods of change don’t work like that, and it’s my assumption there’s no hack that gets us around them. Why would we want to, in any case? There’s that thing the director and actorLena Dunhamsaid, which is that, sometimes, it’s nice to do – or in this case – feel the thing you’re supposed to be feeling at the time you’re supposed to be feeling it. I feel that way now, as time concertinas. Looking ahead, what I wonder is how this period of my life will appear looking back, just as when I look back to last year, it appears in my memory as if through deep water. It seems like decades ago now.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionNew yearHealthMedicineGirlsTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

A ‘Dear’ or ‘Sir’ wouldn’t hurt once in a whileThu 1 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 12.50 ESTShareHow do you feel when big corporations address you directly? (In other words, when they use the second-person pronoun “you” in their communications.) Do you feel like you’re valued? That you’re being treated as an individual? Or does it make you want to grab their CEO by the scruff of the neck and tell them to shut up?It’s impossible nowadays to buy food, walk down the street or even open your emails without businesses trying to chat you up. A carton of Alpro oat milk shouts “Hey you!” from the dairy aisle. A restaurant you visited once sends a circular with “We miss you!” in the subject line. You get a bill from Octopus Energy with 41 uses of this cursed pronoun, but it never once addresses you with “Dear”.This technique, known as direct address, isn’t new. In 1888, Kodakwas selling cameras with the slogan: “You press the button, we do the rest.” But it feels like it has been gaining ground recently, so much so that this hill on which I would gladly die sometimes feels a lonely one.A recent study showed that most consumers respond better to adverts thataddress them directly. But to me, it just feels disingenuous. Take the Kodak slogan: at the time, photography was a specialised profession. The first Kodak camera was simple enough for anyone to use. The slogan’s direct address reinforces this, giving the reader a false sense of power that still feels patronising 138 years later.Because, as with smartphones today, the real power lies with the device itself, not to mention the company that is profiting from it. It’s one thing to sell me a product, quite another to con me into feeling self-actualised for simply pressing a button. In the more formal world of the 1880s, direct address must have felt bold, perhaps a little transgressive. But now it has become the default style of the ruling class. “Good to see you, Max,” chirps ChatGPT on the rare occasions I log on to it. Someday, this machine may take my job and reduce me to beggary. Given this, it could at least call me “sir”.Max Fletcher is a London-based writerExplore more on these topicsAdvertisingThe hill I will die onShops and shoppingInternetOnline shoppingcommentShareReuse this content"

Whether you agree with him over this or that utterance or the broad sweep of government policy, he has, unquestionably made his contribution to Tottenham, in north London, whose people he has represented for a quarter of a century, to parliament, as a senior MP, as foreign secretary and now as an important figure with several key portfolios.So when a lieutenant of Nigel Farage, admittedly no fan of Lammy’s,suggests, without notable contradictionor condemnation from Reform, that Lammy “should go home to the Caribbean”, one is tempted to look at that askance. But then, in the year just past, when bigotry in frontline politics took off its training wheels and othering became the sport that everyone can play, the notion that someone who clearly belongs here should not belong here ceased to shock.Bad stuff happened in 2025. The big stuff you know: the violent, toxically nativist besieging of asylum seeker hotels and the condoning of it by rightwing politicians and media outlets. The deployment up and down the country by hard-right activists of the British and St George’s flag, as a symbol,not of collective adhesion (as it surely can be) but of intimidation. Thevery public claimsthat Farage, a man with pretensions to lead our country, hurt people as a racist school bully and refuses to atone or suitably acknowledge their hurt now that he is a dog-whistling adult.But I’m also thinking of less high-profile stuff. Like the friend who went for a weekend out of London into summery, leafy Middle England and, while waiting at a road junction, was assailed as a “black bitch” by a car passenger waiting at the lights, seeking to prove to an even younger passenger – perhaps his own son – that he wasn’t constrained by the strictures of woke.Like the student who, along with his father, entered a pub in the West Country – to sample the local colour, watch a bit of football – and was advised to leave because it wasn’t a good or safe place for “Pakis”. Like the health worker friend whose job entails driving into towns and villages, who continued to do so amid the summer explosion of union flags but who said that as a black man entering those places, he felt, for the first time, the need to watch his back. All were acting as if they belong, with infinite justification. All were given reason to doubt. Diehard populists and racists want that kind of Britain and they’ve had a good year. According toa new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the number of people absorbing and mirroring hard right narratives is rising. Time to take stock: divided, resentful, hostile to all but a default culture – is that the sort of country the rest of us want?Against this backdrop, and at a time when a small but growing minority says you have to be white to be British, I have been thinking about minority belonging and attachment. I was born here, schooled here, have worked and paid taxes here, have served communities: but as the son of Windrush parents, how solid is my footing here? My late parents arrived in the 1950s and thought their status was secure. Then came the 1971 Immigration Act, which ripped up the rights they had as Commonwealth citizens and necessitated that they scramble to find the money to solidify their status under the government’s new arrangements. As a child I overheard the strained discussions about where the money was going to come from. The sound of shock and uncertainty.We are settled, but never quite cosy. How can we be? Using theNationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the home secretary can pull the rug out from under a British citizen, without notification, if doing so meets their particular criteria of the public good. Earlier this year,research by the Runnymede Trustsuggested that 9 million people – mainly those with dual nationalities – are vulnerable to losing the citizenship they thought was theirs, with minority citizens 12 times more vulnerable than white. This is us: you belong until, maybe, one day, you don’t.Go home, Farage’s man said, and with that he echoed the exhortation of choice from nativist crowds outside asylum seeker hotels this summer. In the 50s and 60s, my parents’ generation of Windrush-era migrants used to hear that a lot too. But then, as now, it was a nonsense. Home to where? Where you have lived the longest? To your last port of call? To wherever will have you? We don’t know. That’s why politicians sought to shuttle folkoff to Rwandain the hope they would sort out the home/belonging conundrum themselves.Where am I from? Where’s home if not here? Well certainly there is a quiet, leafy bit of Jamaica that my parents left in the 50s and returned to almost 40 years later. But this year, having paid the fee and explored my DNA, I’ve found there is a viable case that home could be a lot of places. Via Mum, according to the Ancestry results, there are traces from Benin and Togo, with a good bit of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, a smidgen of Nigeria, a little bit of Mali and a sliver of north-east Scotland. There’s even a drop of Iceland. Go figure.From Dad, a bit of Benin and Togo, a bit more from Côte d’Ivoire, but most notably Nigeria. I am unsurprised. A Nigerian friend once glanced at a picture of my father and said, never mind Jamaica, “He’s from Nigeria: no question”. But here, again a mix: a chunk of Devon and Somerset, a little bit of Cameroon and Mali. Some Senegal, some Panama and Costa Rica. And then a trace of the Netherlands. Well, I do enjoy trips to Rotterdam.I find all this energising, and certainly it challenges the idea that we are identity parcels labelled from one destination, ready to be returned to sender.I am not a citizen of nowhere, as demonised by the populists, but through history, politics, cruelty and happenstance, a creature from almost everywhere. My guess is that many of you are the same – and that David Lammy is similar, too.That’s the truth of it, and a conversation about home and belonging that starts from there would undoubtedly be more positive.

Then, slowly, a small miracle took placeThu 1 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 07.37 ESTShareVery few of us find fame quite as late, or quite as brutally, as Cecilia Giménez did in the summer of 2012. The Spanish amateur artist was already 81 when her efforts to restore a decent, if unremarkable, fresco of the scourged Christbrought her a renownthat almost destroyed her.Almost overnight, Giménez, whodied on Mondayat the age of 94, was stripped of her quiet existence in the north-eastern Spanish town of Borja, and recast as the well-meaning and unwitting creator of what would become known around the English-speaking world as Monkey Christ. In Spain, the meme phenomenon was dubbed Ecce Mono (Behold the Monkey), a play on the painting’s Latin title Ecce Homo (Behold the Man).For weeks, months and even years, the side-by-side images of Elías García Martínez’s original and Giménez’s unfinished restoration went viral globally, becoming shorthand for bungled efforts and disastrous outcomes.There was, however, more to that summer’s events in Borja’sSantuario de Misericordiathan the initial reports –including my own– suggested. Giménez, who was married in the church, had already spent two decades tending to the fresco, trying to protect it against the ravages of time and water damage. She was also only midway through her restoration, and had headed off on a two-week holiday when news of Monkey Christ started spreading.“Reporters told the world the story of the old woman who couldn’t paint and had ruined a painting,” Giméneztold the Guardian in 2015. “That’s not true. It is true that I haven’t done many portraits. But if it hadn’t been for me, the painting would have probably disappeared long ago.”View image in fullscreenBefore and after: the Ecce Homo mural and Giménez’s restorationComposite: Ricardo Ostal/APBy then, though, the damage was already done. Stressed and embarrassed, she lost a lot of weight as she worried about the consequences of her well-meaning actions, and the ridicule they had brought on her home town.But little by little, a small miracle took place. The people of Borja rallied around Giménez, congregating outside her house to applaud her, and the town became a popular, if unlikely, tourist destination. These days, the Santuario de Misericordia is home to a busy museum celebrating the church’s renown, and to an equally busy shop selling every conceivable piece of Monkey Christ merchandise. From shelf after shelf, the familiar and oddly benign image of Giménez’s handiwork stares down at visitors from wine bottles, teddy bears, T-shirts, mugs and mousepads.The hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who have flocked to Borja over recent years have brought fame – and a not insubstantial amount of cash – to the town. That money doesn’t just pay the salaries of the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers; it also covers the care home fees of local people who would not otherwise be able to live there. Among the home’s residents were Giménez herself and her surviving son, who has cerebral palsy. And then in 2023, anaffectionate comic operacalled Behold the Man opened in Las Vegas, celebrating Giménez and her incredible impact on Borja.When Imet Giménez in Borjain the winter of 2018, her memory was beginning to fail and so her niece, Marisa Ibáñez, sat in on the interview. By then, Giménez, who clutched a large handbag crammed with press cuttings, had made peace with what had befallen her and told me she would do it all again.“It was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it’s been a good thing for Borja,” she said. “People from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That’s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don’t cry any more because I can see how much I’m loved.”When I think of Giménez, who was laid to rest on Tuesday afternoon, I’m reminded of The Saint, ashort story by Gabriel García Márquez. It tells the story of a man who spends years in Rome, hoping to persuade the Vatican that the miraculously weightless and perfectly preserved body of his daughter is proof of her candidacy for canonisation. Only at the end of the story does it become clear that it is the father, through his long years of patient devotion to his daughter’s cause, who is the real saint.And so it was with the elderly and devout woman from Borja. We were all too busy chuckling over the meme to see that the incomplete restoration was never the story – the restorer was.In her many years of quiet devotion and in the dignity with which she endured so much, Giménez was a rare blaze of grace and humility in an ever-darker, ever-crueller world. That – and not Monkey Christ – was her life’s work and its legacy.Towards the end, Giménez’s dementia proved unexpectedly merciful, devouring the bitter and painful memories of her humiliation and leaving her with only positive recollections. She had, Ibáñez told me, “turned it into a beautiful story”.The headlines of the past 24 hours have spoken of “the woman who immortalised the Ecce Homo” and “the woman who turned Borja’s Ecce Homo into a global attraction”. But as her niece pointed out when we spoke a couple of years ago, Cecilia Giménez can be summed up in a single word: “You can look up lots of adjectives to describe her but I think the one that describes her best is ‘good’. It’s a word that’s used so lightly that we don’t realise what it means.”Sam Jones is Madrid correspondent for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

With just one audacious tweak, the hit show promises to become even more satisfying – and full of bombshellsElle HuntThu 1 Jan 2026 16.05 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 19.54 ESTShareNew year, new killing spree. This is the third time the BBC has dropped a new season ofThe Traitorson or close to 1 January, enshrining a great new British tradition of easing into the new year with a month-long “psychological game of deception” – and, after a slow-burn start to the first season back in 2022, audiences have now learned to bay for fresh blood at Claudia Winkleman’s bell.This fourth “civilian” season comes just a month afterThe Celebrity Traitors finale, which drew a record 15m viewers, sent some of its contestants’ profiles skyrocketing (and called others into question – Nick, what happened?) and is still generating headlines from the retrospective play-by-play.By this point, The Traitors is about as close as we come to appointment viewing in the streaming age, singlehandedly convincing audiences to stump up for TV licences. Yet, after the barnstorming success of The Celebrity Traitors – and that jaw-dropping finale, which saw Alan Carr, the best-worst Traitor ever, somehow seize victory from his loyal faithfuls – even diehards fans might well be asking themselves: how can this new season top that?By changing the game, of course. Episode one makes clear almost from the jump – after a typically camp opening sequence showing Winkleman in a 4x4, shadowed by an owl – that in this season, not even her appointed traitors can expect to have total control. “Just when they think they know how to play …” Winkleman murmurs, brushing a telltale red cloak.Last year the show sought to keep contestants on their toes by having them boot three of their own from the train, before they had even reached the castle. This year everyone makes it to The Traitors HQ, with introductions made along the way. With 22 starting players, the show does a good job of suggesting who we need to pay attention to. There’s 62-year-old Fiona from Swansea – in the mould of season one’s Amanda, dialling up the dither to evade suspicion. Thirty-something Scot Stephen – who plans to draw on “having to be different people”, growing up queer on the isolated Isle of Lewis. Cool, calm and collected comms head Rachel – who once successfully breached security, pretending to be the Irish president’s daughter, and has been manifesting Winkleman’s tap on her shoulder.They skew older than last year’s crop and, mercifully, less jittery. Some, such as crime writer Harriet, 52, and Amanda, 57, a retired police detective, have already resolved to conceal their professions. Others – such as Hugo, a barrister and self-described “psychopathic teddy bear”, and 34-year-old accounts guy Sam, poised to be this season’s love-to-hate player – have brought nothing but brazen confidence. Meanwhile, in a series first, there’s a shock reunion outside the castle doors between nursery teacher Netty, 42, and personal trainer Ross, 37 (lapsed acquaintances), which promises a new dynamic to play with.Strikingly, all of them want to play as traitors, shocking even Claudia with their bloodlust. It suggests a slight change in tack with casting, prioritising those with a sheer love of the game. Last year’s contestants, selected by “the pub test”, quickly turned on each other like rats in a cage, veering between the fight-or-fawn response at the round tables in a way that was certainly not strategically productive, and occasionally unpleasant to watch. No doubt the pressure will get to this lot, too, but they at least seem prepared.The hype around The Traitors is also acknowledged in the episode, with the contestants shown to be thrilled by the famous castle and “queen Claudia”, suggesting a slightly more meta production. (Winkleman congratulates them on arrival: “You made it off the train – that doesn’t always happen.”) But, the audience has already been let in on the coming twist: on top of the traitors selected by Winkleman at the first round table, there’s now a “Secret Traitor” who knows their identities, nominates who they may kill and is the only player to have total oversight of the game. Not even those watching at home know who, among the supposed faithfuls, is beneath that scarlet cloak.It’s an audacious decision, shaking up the format at the series’ peak, but one that could stymie The Traitors’ emergent flaw, where only the most gullible faithfuls have a chance of making it to the end. Indeed, the impact on gameplay is seismic, and immediate. Winkleman wastes no time in selecting her traitors, but the triumph of her chosen three is short-lived once they learn they’ll have to murder to order. (“I do not require middle management,” grumbles one.) Their stricken expressions as they realise that their strategies have been totally upended are immensely satisfying to watch and promise great telly ahead.The first challenge, too, delivers spectacle with 100 coffins suspended across a loch. Some contain cash, and must be towed to shore – but there’s another twist, forcing the players to reveal their suspicions about each other on the fly and make split-second decisions about who to shield from banishment. When a secret blood tie between faithfuls is revealed near the episode’s end, you’re left to anticipate what gems the producers must be holding back. (The season two Ross and Diane bombshell was delayed until episode three.)Having grown the series’ following with The Celebrity Traitors, the BBC could easily have rolled out another civilian season using past templates and felt sure of a record-breaking audience. Instead, they’ve upped the ante and made the format even twistier. Episode one, with its rapid, punchy reveals, leaves us and the players with plenty of threads to pull on – and exudes the producers’ confidence in the coming payoff.The Traitors aired on BBC One in the UK and is on iPlayer now. It will be available to stream on Channel 10 in Australia from 2 January.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here are some of the best examplesByAlexis PetridisThu 1 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 1 Jan 2026 13.44 ESTShare20. Maxine Nightingale – Right Back Where We Started From (1975)It’s hard to imagine anyone’s heart not being lifted a little by Right Back Where We Started From: the euphoric rush of new love rendered into three minutes of cod-northern soul (performed, unexpectedly, by various ex members of ELO, the Animals and 60s soft-poppers Honeybus). Avoid the 80s cover by Sinitta at all costs.19. CMAT – Nashville (2022)A song about fresh starts for anyone who’s made a new year resolution with no intention of sticking to it.CMATannounces her departure for Tennessee, organises a farewell party (“We’ll cry to K-pop and tequila shots”) and gives her friends presents to remember her by. One problem: she’s made the whole story of her emigration up.18. The Carpenters – We’ve Only Just Begun (1970)We’ve Only Just Begun had unpromising beginnings – a jingle on a US TV advert for a bank, opportunistically picked up on by a hit-hungry Richard Carpenter. Enter his sister, Karen, whose incredible vocal – alternately joyous and tender – transformed a song intended to flog mortgages into an authentically moving hymn to new love.View image in fullscreenRichard and Karen Carpenter on the BBC’s In Concert series.Photograph: Tony Russell/Redferns17. Astrud Gilberto – Beginnings (1969)Originally a hit for Chicago, Astrud Gilberto’s cover of Beginnings turns a fabulous song into a masterpiece: lush, funky, epic. “It’s only the beginning of what I want to feel for ever,” she coos from its tumbling drums to its exhilarating brass to her breathy, wide-eyed vocal, the whole thing sounds the way that falling in love feels.16. Joe Smooth – Promised Land (1987)Written for a primarily Black, gay audience in the teeth of the Aids epidemic, a lot of early house tracks were effectively songs of resistance and optimism. Promised Land might be the greatest of them all: the cosseting warmth of its sound underscoring its assurance that everything can and will change.15. Florence + the Machine – Dog Days Are Over (2008)A song that acknowledges new beginnings and fresh starts can be intimidating, involving dragging yourself out of your comfort zone. “You can’t carry it with you if you want to survive,” admonishes Florence Welch in what sounds like a note to self: the stridency of her tone and the thunderous power of the music seems to be pushing her on.View image in fullscreenJarvis Cocker of Pulp performing at Glastonbury, June 1995.Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns14. Pulp – Something Changed (1995)“When we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing / That in a matter of hours we’d change the way we were going”: the soundtrack for the kind of new beginning that’s not planned or resolved, the sweet, soft-hued Something Changed marvels at the wonder of life-altering coincidence.13. The The – This Is the Day (1983)The The’sSoulMining was an album recorded under the influence of the then-largely unknown drug MDMA, which possibly accounts for This Is the Day’s cocktail of fragile introspection (the verses) and fuzzy, hopeful elation (the chorus): life’s a mess, it compellingly argues, but from this point on it’s going to get better.12. Otis Clay – The Only Way Is Up (1980)Yazz’s chart-topping 1988 cover is better known, but for sheer grin-inducing punch-the-air jubilation, Mississippi vocalist Otis Clay’s original can’t be beaten. The strings are pure disco exhilaration, but the vocals are steeped in gospel: he sings like a man who’s genuinely known tough times, and can barely contain his delight that they’re over.View image in fullscreenGloria Gaynor in 1979.Photograph: Richard E Aaron/Redferns11. Gloria Gaynor – I Will Survive (1978)It’s been overplayed to within an inch of its life, but I Will Survive became ubiquitous as a queer anthem and the divorcee’s karaoke belter of choice for a reason. Its lyrics perfectly fix the emotional effort involved in picking oneself up and starting again; Gloria Gaynor sings the hell out of it.10. McAlmont and Butler – Yes (1995)A new start is made with a triumphant up-yours – lent an extra gossipy frisson by Bernard Butler’s acrimonious split from Suede – set to what may be the most glorious, dizzyingly uplifting melody of the Britpop era, delivered with the perfect blend of pathos and panache by David McAlmont. Magic.McAlmont and Butler – Yes9. Diana Ross – I’m Coming Out (1980)Disco-eraDiana Rosswas big on anthems of rebirth – see also 1979’s fantastic I Ain’t Been Licked – but I’m Coming Out is the classic: written by the Chic Organisation with her gay following in mind, the bounce in Nile Rodgers’ guitar and Bernard Edwards’ amazing bassline could make a devoted pessimist feel positive about the future.8. Bronski Beat – Smalltown Boy (1984)Like a queer analogue to the Beatles’ She’s Leaving Home, a song about new beginnings that concentrates on the reasons why one might be driven to make a fresh start. Its mood is sombre and haunted, but there’s a promise of something better beginning in its urgent dancefloor beat and instrumental middle eight.View image in fullscreenFrom left … Larry Steinbachek, Jimmy Somerville and Steve Bronski of Bronski Beat.Photograph: David Corio/Getty Images7. Peter Gabriel – Solsbury Hill (1977)In which the recently ex-frontman of Genesis reflects on his decision to quit – “my friends would think I was a nut” – and comes to the conclusion that he was absolutely right: he will, he vows “show another me”. He’s left wreathed in smiles, with a racing heart, a mood that seeps into song’s subtly, but nevertheless effortlessly uplifting music.6. David Bowie – A New Career in a New Town (1977)An instrumental that nevertheless perfectly fits its title: a tentative intro explodes into music that sounds fresh and optimistic, topped off with breezy harmonica heavily influenced by Mr Bloe’s 1970 hit Groovin’ With Mr Bloe.David Bowiereferenced it on I Can’t Give Everything Away, the leave-taking closing track on his final album, Blackstar.5. Public Image Limited – Public Image (1978)A new beginning in the most literal sense. PiL sonically heralded the arrival of post-punk, furiously excoriated the bandJohn Lydonhad left behind and loudly announced things would be different from now on: “I’m not the same as when I began … it’s my entrance, my own creation.” It’s still indecently exciting.4. Nina Simone – Feeling Good (1965)Forget Feeling Good’s grisly 21st century fate – doomed to be gormlessly belted out by sundry X Factor contestants, Michael Bublé and, dear God, the Pussycat Dolls – head to Nina Simone’s definitive reading, and gawp at its gradual, increasingly elated build from emotive a cappella intro to show-stopping, this-is-my-moment finale.3. The Beatles – Here Comes the Sun (1969)Somewhere in the hereafter, one rather imagines George Harrison allowing himself a wry chuckle at the fact that Here Comes the Sun has been streamed 1bn more times than any other Beatles track. You can see why: filled with a lovely sense of gentle cyclical renewal, it’s the musical equivalent of a reassuring hug in the face of uncertainty.2. Curtis Mayfield – Move on Up (1970)It says something about its sheer quality that a song so familiar hasn’t lost its power: from the first insistent burst of brass through Curtis Mayfield’s constantly urging lyrics – “Take nothing less than the supreme best / Do not obey rumours people say” – to its dizzying chorus, it makes striving to change sound like a blast.View image in fullscreenStevie Nicks and John McVie of Fleetwood Mac in 1977.Photograph: Richard McCaffrey/Getty Images1. Fleetwood Mac – Don’t Stop (1977)There’s a hint of well-that’s-easy-for-you-to-say about Don’t Stop: it was written by Christine McVie for her husband, John, after their marriage had broken down and she’d embarked on an affair with Fleetwood Mac’s lighting director, urging him to think of her departure as a new start. But nonetheless, it’s preposterously effective: the cantering rhythm urges you forward, the melody is buoyant, Lindsey Buckingham’s vocals and guitar alike are emphatic and persuasive, the lyrics carry no hint of the bitterness that marks Rumours’ many other songs about starting afresh, and Christine McVie’s carefree piano lines are an airy delight.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockDance musicIndieSoulDiscoCMATfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s still a class above all other spy thrillersThe racy espionage blockbuster caused a global frenzy a decade ago – and set an unbelievably high bar. As Tom Hiddleston’s M16 agent Jonathan Pine returns to take down a new supervillain, he just about pulls it offJack SealeThu 1 Jan 2026 17.05 ESTShareFinesse was the selling point ofThe Night Manager when it debuted in 2016. It was a class above other spy thrillers, setting itself among moneyed elites – rotten ones, but elites nonetheless – and furnishing itself with luxury locations. In Tom Hiddleston it had a lead with a reputation that signalled that the often tacky espionage genre was looking to improve itself. Based on a book by John le Carré and airing on the BBC in the dying days of the era when that carried heavyweight global cachet, its pedigree was impeccable.A large part of the rarefied atmosphere the series created, though, was in being one and done: it swept in, won a ton of awards, then swooshed away, leaving behind a delicate waft of something impossibly exclusive. Lesser shows would have hastily cashed in with an inferior second season, but The Night Manager could not be so vulgar.A decade later, it’s back. Whether it’s the new Amazon co-production money or the frenzy among platform bosses to make spy things that might be a bit like Slow Horses, the programme has been lured into the fray again. Hiddleston and co-starOlivia Colmanare here for season two, with a third run already on its way.View image in fullscreenTom Hiddleston and Camila Morrone in The Night Manager.Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Ink FactoryThe elegant Jonathan Pine (Hiddleston), who began the story as an ex-soldier manning the night desk at five-star hotels before being provoked into joining MI6 when international master criminals whacked his girlfriend, is still in the secret service but no longer in the field. He suppresses the trauma he suffered in season one by working a different kind of hotel-related night shift: running an unglamorous surveillance unit that monitors the CCTV of London’s swankiest establishments, watching for behaviour that raises a terror flag.Pine’s crew are oddballs who are part of MI6 but excluded from the main building, instead operating from faceless premises down the road. They talk warily of the bigwigs at HQ, “River House”, who have given them a nickname: the “Night Owls”. Hang on! Has The Night Manager gone fully Slow Horses? Only for half an episode: when the sight of a familiar face shocks Pine so much his complexion changes from magnolia to ivory, he’s soon turning himself into a proper spy again.Hiddleston remains a divisive presence. He’s either a 21st-century take on a James Bond-style hero, single-handedly bringing down the billion-dollar business of a criminal mastermind without any ludicrous gadgets or retrograde chauvinism, and without being cringingly smarmy about it all. Or he’s a ridiculous attempt to bring modern sensitivity to an essentially boorish and silly genre, and is cringingly smarmy. It depends on your taste.‘We’re your dream throuple!’ The Night Manager is back – and it’s even steamierRead moreIt doesn’t matter too much, because what elevated the original Night Manager wasn’t Hiddleston, but who he was up against. If Hugh Laurie and Tom Hollander didn’t immediately sound like obvious casting for pitiless arms dealer Dickie Roper and his psychopathic lieutenant, Corky, the way they subverted their own chummy poshness quickly convinced us that our man Pine had walked into the very heart of darkness. These are the extremely bad men who really run the world, we were willing to believe, and we’ve sent someone to fight them armed only with strong morals and crisp linen.The new Night Manager tries to sustain that Roper bogeyman vibe, without Roper himself. The operation Pine is now infiltrating, a Colombian arms cartel, is linked to Roper, and Pine has Roper-themed flashbacks. Roper looms over all. But the big man has gone, and his replacement, Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva, who was a drug lord in Narcos: Mexico), is a much more generic antagonist. Doubtless he’ll be getting help from inside MI6 – Paul Chahidi, Hayley Squires and Indira Varma are superb as the new faces there, alongside a rehired Douglas Hodge as the upstanding if perhaps not hard-nosed enough Rex Mayhew. But, the show loses its naughty glint when Pine isn’t directly up against other members of the British upper classes. Although the drama still feels like cashmere and silk, the blade stashed in the folds isn’t so sharp.There is something fundamentally gauche, too, about the way season two methodically tries to rebuild the dynamic of the first run. Pine suffers another tragedy, adopts another fake identity and, without being sure who he can trust back at base, pitches himself into another game of bluff with another nefarious kingpin who could suss him at any moment – potentially aided by said supervillain’s disaffected moll (Camila Morrone). None of this is to say The Night Manager is suddenly average: it still floats far above most of the competition. But it no longer feels pristine.The Night Manager aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now. It airs on Prime Video on 11 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewTom HiddlestonOlivia ColmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s 8.30pm andDavid Attenborough– 99 years young, in customary short-sleeved blue shirt and chinos – is on the hunt for Tottenham’s most elusive resident. He gets settled on a camping chair. Waits. Emits a tiny rhapsodic gasp as the creature in question appears. It’s a … fox.“It’s still a huge thrill to see one suddenly emerging from the bushes,” he whispers to camera of a sight so bog-standard most Londoners wouldn’t bother looking up from their phones. “A totally wild creature!” Attenborough holds out a hand. Murmurs a delighted “hello”. The fox comes within a few inches of the greatest natural historian and broadcaster this country has ever produced, then slinks off into the night. What an encounter! And if you think that’s exhilarating wait until you see his reaction to a pigeon getting on the tube.For those at the precarious stage of the holidays where a poultice for the heart is urgently required, I give you Wild London. An exquisitely cheerful, beautifully produced, unexpectedly moving special, captured over Attenborough’s centennial year, in which he seeks out the wildlife of the capital and we discover that the secret to a good life isn’t actually a parasite cleanse or a facial for your vagina – it’s appreciating what’s on your own doorstep. Which in Attenborough’s case is a megacity home to 9 million people, 2.6m cars, 607 sq miles of concrete, asphalt and steel, and more wild animals than seem possible in such unnatural circumstances. Plus, of course, one vanishingly rare David Attenborough. “Throughout my life I’ve had the good fortune to travel the world witnessing many spectacles,” he says in a black cab home to Richmond. “But this is the place to which I’ve always returned.”View image in fullscreen‘Still a huge thrill’ … David Attenborough with a fox in Wild London.Photograph: BBC/Passion Planet Ltd/Gavin ThurstonAnd so to Hammersmith station, through which Attenborough once regularly commuted, his day “always brightened” by the sight of … yes, I too was thinking a rat! But no. Pigeons. Hopping on and off trains before the doors close with the chutzpah of Indiana Jones grabbing his hat, while commuters look on obliviously and Attenborough explains how pigeons typically use the sun and magnetic fields to find their way, but in urban areas have learned to navigate using landmarks, roads, even train lines. Honestly, does British telly get any better than this?Next, peregrine falcons, whichHamza Yassin fans will knoware now nesting in pairs all over London. When Attenborough moved to the capital in the 1950s they were virtually extinct in the UK. Today? “They’re thriving in London in greater numbers than almost any other city in the world.” There’s breathtaking footage of the fastest animal on Earth soaring through the city, nesting in the Houses of Parliament, Charing Cross hospital and factories on the Thames, which work as ideal substitutes for their natural cliff habitats. “London’s concrete canyons”, Attenborough calls them. “Plenty of opportunity to make a killing in the city.” The writing, as ever in his films – which he has always insisted on refining and rewriting himself – is lyrical, mischievous, glorious.So much evokes childlike wonder: “green squadrons” of parakeets, honeybees drunk on fermenting nectar, Aesculapian snakes along Regent’s Canal, emperor dragonflies breeding in the pond outside the Natural History Museum and, most astonishingly of all, the return of wild beavers to a London wetland. A species that disappeared from the UK about 400 years ago. “If someone had told me when I’d just moved here that one day I’d be watching wild beavers in London I’d have thought they were mad,” he says. “Imagine what else can be achieved if we let nature back into our cities.”It’s not only beavers that blow his mind. “Oh, what a lovely thing,” Attenborough says, holding a four-week-old peregrine falcon chick. He marvels at a vixen hiding a chicken bone under a car’s windscreen wipers. He’s tickled by the “hedgehog highways” the owners of London’s 4m private gardens have introduced, cutting holes in fences to allow males to travel up to two miles every night in search of a mate. In Hyde Park he witnesses a face-off between some territorial coots and a frankly terrifying herring gull, whose taste for pigeon meat “has given him the glossiest plumage on the shores of the Serpentine”. Without getting into the gruesome details, I found myself jumping up and screaming three words I never thought would fall out of this Londoner’s mouth: “Come on, pigeon!”What is most moving is seeing the common urban spectacles the rest of us take for granted, or don’t see at all, elevated to the giddy heights of an Attenborough documentary. Whether he is witnessing a herd of fallow deer cross an east London street to feast on someone’s garden roses, or narrating the high-stakes drama of a mother trying to hide her fawn from an off-lead dalmatian sniffing about the bushes of his local park, it’s this endless capacity for wonder, on his own doorstep and everywhere else, that is most humbling. This one human animal has changed the way we see the natural world. Whatever will we do without him?Wild London aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsDavid AttenboroughTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

When was the last time you were clean-shaven?DoubleRDinerI’m an ambassador for Marie Curie andshaved it off live on X over lockdown. I’ve had the moustache since I was 23. It’s not itchy. I have to trim it, else it comes down over the lip and gets thick and bushy. I’ve tried going full walrus, but it doesn’t look good.Were the physical comedy greats from the silent era such asBuster Keaton, Harold Lloyd andMax Linderan inspiration for you and your brother [Barry] getting started in slapstick?TomboYes. Slapstick is something we’ve always found funny. Laurel and Hardy were our favourites. You can’t go wrong with visual comedy. There can’t be many people that don’t laugh at somebody falling down. We were brought up in showbusiness. My dad [Gene Patton, who worked with Peter Sellers] was a comedian and very visual. Our mum was a dancer. Our two older brothers were in the business. We’d been brought up in and out of the theatre all our lives and found it natural to be on stage.Was there ever any rivalry between you and your older brothers Jimmy and Brian, AKAthe Patton Brothers?Top TrampJimmy was 16 years older than me and in the business when I was born. Brian is 14 years older; he’s 92 in December. They sang, danced and did comedy. They were always on Saturday night telly through the 50s and 60s, tap-dancing with Ronnie Corbett and Harry Secombe. We used to tap-dance, but I wasn’t brilliant. When we were Butlin’s redcoats back in 1966, I had to learn to ballroom dance as well. We dropped the dancing in the early 70s and went pure comedy. My sister, Sheila, was a dancer, and my brother, Colin, was a motor mechanic. Sadly they’ve all gone. It’s just me and Brian left.‘To me, to uzi’: why Paul Chuckle as a gangster isn’t such a dramatic career changeRead moreDid working with your brother Barry for so long bring you as much happiness as it brought your audience?RoheonI think more. Anybody that watched us live could see the fun we had on stage. It was the same with filming – just look at the ChuckleVision outtakes. We loved each other and just had fun. He’d say something that made me laugh and I’d say something that made him laugh. I miss him dearly. That’s the biggest thing I miss – working with him on stage – because we did so together for over 50 years.What’s your favourite episode?CropolitePlaying football at [former Rotherham United stadium] Millmoor was a good one. We had fun making them all. ChuckleVision was on for 23 years, so several generations grew up with us. I can’t go down the street without somebody wanting a selfie. It takes me ages to go around the supermarket. It’s a lovely feeling and I never get fed up with it.What’s the strangest place someone’s tried to do “to me, to you”?NowtonttellyWell, never in the gents toilet, I’ll tell you that! I was in the Maldives, walking down the street because my wife wanted to go shopping, and this little guy came out of the shop and went: “To me, to you.” I said: “How do you know that?” He said: “Two years in England. It was my favourite show, I watched it all the time.”We’ve had some great comedians go on to be noted actors in theatre: Max Wall, Ken Dodd, etc. Any ambitions to do Samuel Beckett or Shakespeare?LowerColon“To me, or not to me, that is the question?” I doubt very much I would be able to learn those lines, but if it was offered, I’d have a go.View image in fullscreen‘Bring it on!’ Paul Elliott (Paul Chuckle) in Fall to the Top.What was your first reaction when you were offered the role of a ruthless London gangster in Falltothe Top?ingledoody“Bring it on!” I thought: well, that suits me down to the ground. I used to bully Barry around in Chuckle Brothers. Why not go one step further?How about being the next Bond?MurdomaniaWell, the retired James Bond, at my age. Who wouldn’t like to play James Bond?Enjoyed yourlockdown DJ sets. What is your approach when it comes to jockeying the discs? What’s your go-to floor-filler?And were“2 metre U”Covid face masksyour own idea?qbflestrin and PizantiI do all sorts. I do one-hour spots as a guest DJ – singalong, house music, whatever they want. Tsunami [by Dvbbs and Borgeous] is a good floor-filler. I’ve been clubbing all my life. Even now, I still go. I’ll finish panto, then me and the wife will go clubbing. We saw Judge Jules in Falmouth the other week. I’d love to do Radio 1’s Essential Mix. They just haven’t asked me. In terms of the face masks, we were walking to the local Co-op in Doncaster over lockdown, and outside they had two full-sized cut-outs of me and Barry, saying: “2 metre U.” I thought: “Cheeky sods, using our names and catchphrase.” Then we thought: “Hang on, there’s something to add here. Let’s do “2 metre U” masks with our picture on.” They sold very well.Who is the most famous person to tell you they love your work?TooMuchSpareTimeWe were filming theNational Treasures sketch for Red Nose Day. We were just leaving, going down the stairs, and Liam Gallagher came up two steps at a time, really quickly. My wife, Sue, said: “That’s Liam Gallagher.” I said: “Was it?” I shot back up the stairs behind him, and said: “Liam. Can I have a selfie?” He said to his girlfriend: “Get the camera out. Take a picture.” So he got a picture with me and I got a selfie with him.Who do you think is funnier on Gogglebox –your grandnephew Pete or your grandniece Sophie? I say Pete.ArthurThistlewoodI think they’re just as fun as each other. Why haven’t I been on Celebrity Gogglebox? They’ve never asked!How would you and Barry have best handled the Kraytwins if they started taking libertiesin your manor in 1963: gang war, settle it like gentlemen, or from you to them?Mr_202We’d have nailed them, then backed off slowly.Which would you have preferred? Fame and a successful TV career, or Rotherham United in the Premier League?stephenw1979That’s a tough one. I’d love to see Rotherham in the Premier League, but I think fame and success because, when you’re in the business, it’s something you crave. We were working men’s clubs, nightclubs, theatres and pantomimes, hoping one day we’d get that break, which we got after 23 years slugging around. We won Opportunity Knocks in 1967 and we won New Faces in 1974. But it wasn’t until 1984 that we got noticed. We did a tour over Easter with Roger the Dog, who had his own BBC One children’s show.I remember doing a matinee in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, with an audience of 28 people in a 1,000-seat theatre. As Dad told us: “Always give 100%, whether 1,000 people have paid £20 each or 20 have paid £20 each.” We just had a laugh and made it like a little party. What we didn’t know was that at the back of the theatre, the producer and director of Roger the Dog were watching. We got a phonecall the next day asking us to go for lunch. We ended up wearing dog costumes in Roger the Dog, which we borrowed from It’s a Knockout, and asked if we could call the characters the ChuckleHounds.At the end of the series, they did a survey around the country asking people what they thought was the best part of Roger the Dog. And 97% said the ChuckleHounds! So they gave us our own series, which went on to become ChuckleVision, and it’s all gone from there. And here we are.Fall to the Top is coming to streaming platforms later this yearExplore more on these topicsCultureFilm & Music reader interviewTV comedyComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)TelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her practice was so finely wrought that it existed only in the experience between a work’s idea and its absorption. Ceal handled this equation deftly and with perfect poise, but it was a perilous and naked process with little or no place to hide, or none.Resolving the relationship between an idea’s inception and its manifestation became increasingly fraught for her and many works never made it to fruition. Therein lay her courage. This is why I wanted to add something to last month’s obituary of her byJonathan Watkins.Ceal was exceptional and brave. Her work laid her bare to the vicissitudes of existence because that’s what it was made from. Her practice was so embedded in her life that living with a brain tumour for 23 years took a toll on it, despite her continued defiance and disregard for the time limits allotted to her by her prognosis. Her brain/work nexus was so unusual that her brain surgeon took an exceptional diagnostic interest in her art. But this same brilliance meant that she could not bear to be seen to lose control and therefore preferred to isolate herself than reveal any cracks. She continued to incubate ideas but often failed to realise them and over time this began to frustrate and disappoint her.View image in fullscreenFloyer bites her nails during Nail Biting Performance at Documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 2012.Photograph: Uwe Zucchi/EPA/ShutterstockBut in her last month, in the palliative care unit in a hospital dedicated to Saint Francis near Zoo station in Berlin, she was freed from this burden and, in the face of death, became briefly once more the artist she had been. Despite the terrible attrition in her body, she was purely and unequivocally Ceal, strangely vital and resolute. Many people visited her, which encouraged the dormant performative aspect of her practice.On the wall was a wooden crucifix. She kept pointing at it and it was clear that it represented death, though she was still alive and present. She told us, as she tried to grab a glass of water, that she no longer knew if she were very old or very young. Then we watched her as she formed an idea: could we get her some colouring-in books? Adding later that she would only need black crayons. I bought her the books and the crayons, but they remained untouched; the idea was the point.Ceal Floyer obituaryRead moreShe became increasingly inaudible over her longer than anticipated hospital stay. On what would become her last full day, she raised herself up from sleep when we arrived, reached for, and clung on to, the triangular bar above her bed, holding on to it for what felt like an unbearably long time. It was clear it meant life in the way the crucifix on the wall meant death. Occasionally, Ceal shook the bar, as if willing it beyond its inert capabilities. Eventually, she let her hand drop and signalled to us to get her a nurse and, more clearly and audibly than had been possible for a long while, she answered to the doctor’s offer of morphine, “Yes please.”And in the while they took to go and get it, as I stood beside her bed, she lifted her hand and gave the middle finger to the cross on the wall. The gesture was unambiguous, audacious and courageous: I was her audience and her viewer, and she was giving death the middle finger with me as her witness. Aware and pleased by my reaction (I was both shocked and impressed), and with the slightest of feline smiles on her face, she allowed the nurse to give her the morphine and did not, to my knowledge, really resurface.Explore more on these topicsPerformance artArtTacita DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take your pick from “alien offshoot mushroom, going the gym to get slim”; “my dream house is a negative space of rock”; or, indeed, “when I was a child I wanted to be a horse, eating onions, carrots, celery”. But it’s an ostensibly more straightforward line, fromCruise Ship Designer, that seems destined to attract the most attention. “I make sure there are hidden messages in my work,” says vocalist Florence Shaw as the track draws to a conclusion, the muscular guitar riff that’s driven it along devolving into a janky, trebly scrabble.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Secret Love.Photograph: Patrick JamesonInitially, the lyric appears to characterise whatDry Cleaningdo, and Shaw in particular. From the moment they first appeared with the 2018 EP Sweet Princess, the south London quartet have attracted adjectives such as “surreal”, “enigmatic” and “inscrutable”. Most of the British bands who emerged around the same time bearing a roughly equivalent blend of post-punk guitars and spoken-word vocals sounded angry or sarcastic or straightforwardly comedic. Dry Cleaning, on the other hand, seemed mysterious. Shaw’s lyrics were collages of overheard remarks, recycled YouTube comments, lines from adverts and non sequiturs, delivered in a voice that was too icy to sound whimsical. It’s variously been characterised as “anhedonic” and “achromatic”, but might more straightforwardly be described as sounding politely bored. She occasionally shifts from speaking into singing in an untutored voice that brings to mind Stuart Moxham of Young Marble Giants’ line about their understated vocalist Alison Statton sounding “as if she was at the bus stop or something”. It was all intriguingly confusing: here were songs that could indeed contain hidden messages, that seemed like puzzles to be unpicked.But the line in Cruise Ship Designer is more complicated than a straightforward description of her artistic process. It’s delivered not by Shaw, but via her, as the song’s ghastly protagonist mouths hollow, self-regarding platitudes about his chosen profession: “Designing cruisers is, for me, a privilege and a lesson … it’s a powerful boat for a powerful mind.” In context, it seems to be mocking the idea of larding your work with hidden messages as hopelessly pretentious: and if that’s what you thinkI’mdoing, runs the subtext, you’re dead wrong.Dry Cleaning: Cruise Ship Designer – videoAnd for all the peculiar imagery (“salt, sugar, vivid dishcloths, lava skylight, mouth of hell”), the songs on Secret Love suggest that Shaw’s real skill as a songwriter may lie in something more prosaic and straightforwardly affecting than setting conundrums for listeners to unravel. When she’s not skewering the pretensions of cruise ship designers – or, rather, using the figure of a cruise ship designer to interrogate the ways people feel driven to justify their more suspect decisions – she’s very good at drawing haunting vignettes of apparently mundane lives that, on closer inspection, are spiralling out of control: the narrator of My Soul/Half Pint, who presents her refusal to clean her house as a bold feminist protest, but is far more troubled than she first appears; the influencer of Evil Evil Idiot, spouting wellness advice that’s not just useless but potentially harmful; the edgelord depicted in Blood, whose cynicism and misanthropy curdles into gory violence.The lead character inLet Me Grow and You’ll See the Fruitopens the song hymning the pleasures of a solitary day off – “no one coming along with a video call or a survey or a dick pic” – but ends it blurting out their loneliness and alienation: “The world is laughing at me, I am such a disaster.” These are songs that never just feel like someone being clever, although clearly the lyricist behind them is. Nor do they feel weird for weirdness’s sake: they have a genuine gut-level emotional impact.Dry Cleaning: ‘We bond over food a lot. It’s a big part of the band’Read moreYou could point to the sharpness and empathy of Shaw’s lyrics as one reason why Dry Cleaning stand out amid the vogue forsprechgesangindie. There is also the band’s ability to tie her lyrical flights to concise, pointed, punchy songs, and to their musical expansiveness. If vinegary distorted guitar is still their main thrust on Secret Love, the sound of the album – produced by fellow left-field traveller Cate Le Bon – ventures noticeably beyond that territory, into machine-driven 80s funk on openerHit My Head All Day; ominous sounding, slow-burn atmospherics on Evil Evil Idiot; I Need You’s synthesised drones. There’s even a hint of warped folk about the guitar figure that drives Secret Love (Concealed in a Drawing of a Boy). It all works, to powerful effect. The sense of a band who have outgrown their original remit, outstripped their initial WTF? novelty value, and are shifting confidently into new spaces, is difficult to miss.Secret Love is released on 9 JanuaryThis week Alexis listened toSharp Pins – PopafangoutThe Christmas/New Year lull gives you a chance to catch up on stuff you missed, and Sharp Pins’ lo-fi recreation of c 1965 pop is a delight: it’s obviously not doing anything new, but it does what it does beautifully.Explore more on these topicsDry CleaningAlexis Petridis's album of the weekIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

I actually had my eyes closed and mouth open at certain key points, and was grabbing the seat in front of me with both fists. It also may yet prove that, yes,Hugh Jackmanreally is the greatest showman (his role here is much more interesting than his bland impersonation of PT Barnum) and his co-star Kate Hudson brings just the same performance megawattage.Mike and Claire Sardina, terrifically played by Jackman and Hudson, were a Milwaukee married couple with kids from previous relationships who in the 90s formed a cheesyNeil Diamondtribute act called Lightning and Thunder; they became a cult hit in their home state and even opened for Pearl Jam whose guitarist Eddie Vedder good-naturedly joined them on stage for an encore. But things were not easy for them, and this film broods on how tough it is when the lightning of ill fortune strikes more than once.It is in fact adapted froman existing documentary of the same titlefrom 2008 by Greg Kohs about this stranger-than-fiction world, a film that was heavily reliant on the couple’s family archive of home video – and it’s fair to say that the documentary puts more emphasis on the delusional and absurd aspects of Mike and Claire’s life. But that’s not how this film from writer-director Craig Brewer reinvents their story. He,Jackman and Hudson turn the laugh-at into laugh-with. Jackman absolutely crushes it as a Neil Diamond impersonator, sounding almost like him, and looking almost like him; he’s perfectly plausible as someone who isn’t supposed to be in the big league but who clearly has the chops (and the pipes) to carry a show. Mike is a Vietnam veteran and recovering alcoholic who insists on playing his guitar at 12-step meetings so the other people in AA have a sense of his journey. It’s very funny when he practises singing Diamond’s Cracklin’ Rose at home in his underpants and painfully strains a groin muscle while cavorting.Hudson is also excellent, doing her own singing as Claire, who before she joined Mike in the Neil Diamond tribute world had a thriving act as Patsy Cline; she is shown belting out Cline numbers although there is one Cline standard that this film interestingly misses out. Michael Imperioli plays a Buddy Holly impersonator called Mark and Mustafa Shakir is a James Brown act called Sex Machine. Ella Anderson plays Claire’s teen daughter Rachel, and King Princess is Mike’s daughter Angelina of about the same age – and their burgeoning friendship is another underplayed aspect of the film’s likability.Irony and satire have been surgically removed from Mike and Claire’s heart-stoppingly eventful life stories, and in their place Brewer substitutes those qualities that the couple themselves would have been aware of: the vulnerability and loneliness of trying to make it in the margins of the music industry, or for that matter making it anywhere and in any business. This is a never-say-die story and its cheerful optimism makes it a calorific Christmas treat.Song Sung Blue is out on 25 December in the US and 1 January in Australia and the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmPeter Bradshaw's film of the weekDrama filmsHugh JackmanKate HudsonNeil DiamondreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a story about a salaryman faced with the humiliation of unemployment who decides that he has no other choice but to commit mass murder. It starts out like an Ealing comedy-type caper then somehow morphs into something else: a portrait of family dysfunction, fragile masculinity and the breadwinner crisis, the state of the nation itself.23 JanuarySaipanIrish footballer Roy Keane is already something of a legend: this film may well cement that status. It is about the “Saipan incident”, which ignited a culture civil war on the subject of rebellion and disobedience. The ferociously opinionated Keane, while training on the Pacific island of Saipan in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup, was fiercely critical of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy’s methods, and the gaffer sensationally sent Keane home after a tirade from his star player that reportedly included the phrase: “You’re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse!” Should sportspeople swallow their objections for the patriotic good of the team or boldly speak up? Éanna Hardwicke plays Keane and Steve Coogan plays McCarthy.23 JanuaryIs This Thing On?The formidably versatileBradley Cooperreturns to comedy – or anyway the subject of comedy – with this new movie that he directs and in which he takes a supporting role. The title is, of course, what despairing standup comics say about their microphone when they are not getting any laughs; it could also be a metaphor for non-communication in a relationship. Will Arnett (from BoJack Horseman and Arrested Development) plays Alex, a guy going through a divorce who accidentally discovers that he has a talent for standup comedy; the experience lends a bittersweet new dimension to his single status. The film is inspired by the British comic John Bishop, who blundered into comedy in the middle of his own marital breakup.30 JanuaryWuthering HeightsView image in fullscreenHere comes the bride … Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyEmerald Fennell, the Oscar-winning creator of Saltburn and Promising Young Woman, now takes on her biggest project yet: an adaptation of Emily Brontë’s classic novel, with Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as the smouldering, saturnine alpha hero himself, Heathcliff. A mild culture war has already begun with Fennell casting a white actor as Heathcliff, a character Brontë described as “dark-skinned”, while Andrea Arnold cast mixed race actor James Howson for her version in 2011. (It wasn’t an issue for William Wyler in 1939 who cast Laurence Olivier.)13 FebruaryThe Secret AgentKleber Mendonça Filho’s film is set in the Brazilian dictatorship of the 1970s, in which an academic is on the run from the authorities after discovering high-level corruption. The film’s visual brilliance, sensual big-city intrigue, shaggy-dog comedy, gruesome lowlife walk-ons and epically languorous mystery create something special. It’s like Antonioni’s The Passenger with hints of Elmore Leonard, Quentin Tarantino and Meirelles and Lund’s City of God.20 FebruaryIf I Had Legs I’d Kick YouRose Byrne has been winning prizes and raves on the festival circuit with this drama from writer-director Mary Bronstein about a therapist whose life appears to be collapsing with far more catastrophic finality than those of her patients. She has a disabled daughter and a useless absentee husband played by Christian Slater – and emotional and behavioural issues of her own which surface when she tries to get therapy from a colleague.20 FebruaryThe Testament of Ann LeeView image in fullscreenPersecuted … Ann Lee, played by Amanda Seyfried, in The Testament of Ann Lee.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA vehement, fervent drama from Mona Fastvold, co-written with her partner, the Oscar-winning Brady Corbet. Amanda Seyfried plays the historical figure of Ann Lee, who endured religious persecution in 18th-century England as leader of the fundamentalist Shaker movement. It looks sometimes like a Lars von Trier nightmare, or Robert Eggers’ horror film The Witch, and sometimes like a weird but spectacular Broadway musical melodrama, in which the shaking and shivering of the dancing faithful – ecstatically submitting to divine joy – is shaped into a choreography not unlike the musical Stomp.20 FebruaryThe Bride!Titles with exclamation marks are generally making a tacit claim for comedy or melodrama or craziness over and above what you might expect, so it’s difficult at this stage to judge the tonal register for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s remake of The Bride of Frankenstein. In 1935, it featured Boris Karloff as the monster and Elsa Lanchester as his spouse; now it’s Christian Bale as the creature and Jessie Buckley as his soulmate. Let’s hope Gyllenhaal will avoid the classy solemnity that Guillermo del Toro favoured for his own recent Frankenstein.6 MarchA Private LifeThis is a genially preposterous psychological mystery caper from film-maker Rebecca Zlotowski, channelling De Palma or Hitchcock. It’s the tale of an American psychoanalyst in Paris, watchably played by Jodie Foster speaking elegant French, who suspects that a patient who reportedly killed herself was murdered. Things get weirder when a hypnotherapist regresses her into a past-life dream state in which she and this patient were lovers during the Nazi occupation.6 MarchSound of FallingView image in fullscreenGuilt, shame and yearning … Sound of Falling.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA mysterious and uncanny prose-poem of guilt, shame and yearning in Germany in the 20th century – and the 21st. It is a drama of intergenerational trauma, taking place in the same location in four different time frames, on a farm in north-eastern Germany. Gradually connections between the characters reveal themselves, and the film also hints at more characters and more uncanny and foretold events yet to come.6 MarchLa GraziaPaolo Sorrentino has rediscovered his voice, his wan humour and his flair for the surreal and sensational setpiece. This wintry, elegant study of grief and regret, starring veteran Italian actor Toni Servillo, wears its dreamy melancholy and ennui like a well-tailored if fussily old-fashioned suit.20 MarchProject Hail MaryPhil Lord and Christopher Miller, known for wacky comedies like The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street, now take on a high-concept sci-fi mystery based on a novel by Andy Weir (whose The Martian was filmed by Ridley Scott).Ryan Goslingplays Ryland, a high-school teacher who some time in the future wakes up on a spaceship called the Hail Mary, cruising through the galaxy, with no memory of how he came to be there and with all his crewmates dead. Now Ryland must piece together what he was supposed to be doing and how to save planet Earth.20 MarchTwo Prosecutors(dir. Sergei Loznitsa)An icy chill of fear and justified paranoia radiates from this starkly austere and gripping movie from Sergei Loznitsa, set in Stalin’s Russia in the late 30s. With its slow, extended scenes from single camera positions, it mimics the zombie existence of the Soviet state: there is something of Dostoevsky’s The House of the Dead and Kafka’s The Castle.27 MarchThe DramaZendaya and Robert Pattinson star in what promises to be a fraught romantic dramedy from Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli, who had a huge hit with Dream Scenario, featuring Nicolas Cage as a boring professor who keeps showing up in people’s dreams. Now this glitzy couple are preparing to get married, but there’s a gobsmacking revelation just before the big day. This is going to test Pattinson’s comedy chops.3 AprilMichaelA musical biopic of Michael Jackson directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Jackson’s nephew Jaafar Jackson (son of Jermaine), who is making his acting debut. Like the stage show MJ the Musical, this is expected to stop tactfully short of the King of Pop’s later controversy, taking us from his early years in the Jackson 5 up to his breakthrough to global megastardom.24 AprilThe Devil Wears Prada 2Just about the most anticipated sequel of the decade, this is the follow-up to the sensational fashionista comedy withMeryl Streepbreathing fire as fashion-mag editor Miranda Priestly, transparently and cheekily based on Vogue editor Anna Wintour. (It may explain why Streep has never attended Wintour’s New York Met Ball.) It was the film that also made superstars of Anne Hathaway as Miranda’s terrified new intern Andie, Emily Blunt as her haughty senior assistant Emily Charlton and Stanley Tucci as the witty and wise designer Nigel. They all return for more fashion crimes and misdemeanours.1 MayThe OdysseyNo director thinks bigger or films bigger thanChristopher Nolan, and it is perhaps not surprising that he should want to take on Homer’s The Odyssey. (What next? the Book of Genesis?) This is his version of the epic poem that has been the template for storytelling in the west for thousands of years. Matt Damon leads an all-star cast as Odysseus, the Greek king of Ithaca condemned to roam the world after the fall of Troy, yearning to be reunited with his wife Penelope.17 JulyThe Social ReckoningNo one in the movies did more to warn us about the dysfunctional origins and effects of social media than Aaron Sorkin by writing The Social Network; it was directed by David Fincher withJesse Eisenbergas Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. This is not exactly the sequel many were demanding, but more a conceptual follow-up based on a true story – directed as well as written by Sorkin. Jeremy Strong plays the older, more torpidly calm Zuckerberg and Mikey Madison is Frances Haugen, former head of Facebook’s civic integrity team who blew the whistle on the site’s practices.9 OctoberFocker In-LawHere is the latest in the imperishable Meet the Parents series, with its sublime belief in the overwhelming comedy power of the “Focker” surname, but it has to be said the name “Martha Focker” on its own grants this franchise entry to the Hall of Fame. Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner are reprising their roles as the oldsters who disapprove of a certain prospective son-in-law and Ben Stiller, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson reprise their roles, though are in danger of themselves becoming the senior generation. Beanie Feldstein and Ariana Grande are part of the new intake.25 NovemberDune: Part ThreeDenis Villeneuve’s mighty Dune franchise, based on the Frank Herbert sci-fi classic, began way back in 2021; it was precisely the kind of big-screen showstopper that the cinema industry needed for its post-Covid fightback. Part Two arrived last year, and now here is the final swirling sandstorm episode; Timothée Chalamet is back as Paul Atreides with Zendaya as Chani – and Rebecca Ferguson is, of course, Paul’s demanding mother, Lady Jessica. We shall see if Anya Taylor-Joy (as Paul’s sister, Alia) and Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan have roles that last more than a few moments on screen.18 DecemberBitter ChristmasPedro Almodóvar’s new film is a comedy, returning him to his home turf, with Spanish star Bárbara Lennie. She is Elsa, an ad exec who suffers from a panic attack after the death of her mother during a long weekend in December. She takes off on holiday to Lanzarote, while her partner stays behind in Madrid and this story – in classic Almodóvar style – runs alongside a parallel strand to that of a director and screenwriter.Release date tbcDiggerHollywood has been pondering the question of when and whether Tom Cruise was going to pivot away from action spectaculars like the humongous Mission: Impossible franchise and back towards the challenging indie fare with which he had once associated himself, in films such as Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia and Michael Mann’s Collateral. Well, this could be the moment. Cruise plays the lead in the new film fromAlejandro González Iñárritu, which describes itself as “a comedy of catastrophic proportions”.Date tbcI Love BoostersView image in fullscreenFuturist adventure … from left, Naomi Ackie, Taylour Paige and Keke Palmer in I Love Boosters.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyDemi Moore had a career-redefining smash with the sci-fi horror The Substance, and now she’s back in another futurist adventure, from satirist Boots Riley. At some stage in the world still to come, a group of young people make a living stealing high-end garments from couture stores; but they might have taken on too much when they take aim at Moore’s formidable fashion CEO.Date tbcInkMalcolm McDowell, James Cromwell and Ben Mendelsohn have all taken on the demon-king role of Rupert Murdoch in the past; now it’s the turn of Guy Pearce in this new film from directorDanny Boyle, based on the award-winning stage play by James Graham. It’s about the traumatised rebirth of the Sun newspaper in the late 1960s, with Jack O’Connell as the paper’s launch editor Larry Lamb. A truly British national institution was born from a new exploitation of sex and crime.Date tbcNarnia: The Magician’s NephewFifteen years ago, the Narnia films had looked like a slam-dunk franchise – but nothing happened after the third episode, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in 2010. Now things look like being back on track, with stars Emma Mackey and Carey Mulligan, and directorGreta Gerwig. They now take on The Magician’s Nephew (the prequel which was in fact the sixth of CS Lewis’s published seven-novel series, and the first in narrative order), about the creation of Narnia by Aslan a millennium before the events of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Date tbcPeaky Blinders: The Immortal ManAfter six series on BBC TV, Tommy Shelby is back in a feature-length movie adventure from screenwriter Steven Knight. Shelby is the gang boss, played byCillian Murphy, who ruled Birmingham’s crime world between the wars and whose choice of headgear popularised and yet also stigmatised flat caps for an entire generation of British television viewers. Will this be a shark-jumping moment for Tommy, or his finest hour?Date tbcThe President’s CakeView image in fullscreenBaneen Ahmad Nayyef in The President’s Cake.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThis Iraqi-set film from feature first-timer Hasan Hadi has been a heartwarming festival hit, having been nurtured by producers Chris Columbus, Marielle Heller and Hollywood veteran Eric Roth. Lamia, played by nonprofessional Baneen Ahmad Nayyef, is a little girl who lives with her grandmother in Saddam’s Iraq in the 90s and is tasked with getting the rare ingredients for a special cake to celebrate the president’s birthday. To buy these, she will have to sell her late father’s watch. In classic neorealist style, she has all sorts of hair-raising encounters along the way.Date tbcUntitled Jesse Eisenberg Musical ComedyJesse Eisenberg has graduated from fast-talking acting roles like Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Luthor to director status, and his comedy A Real Pain was last year’s indie smash. Now he’s written and directed a (still untitled) musical comedy – composer still unknown – featuring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti. A shy woman finds herself cast in a local theatre’s production of a musical and gets swept up in smalltown showbusiness.Date tbcWhitney SpringsTrey Parker, known for anarchic, iconoclastic comedies such as TV’s South Park and The Book of Mormon, now ventures solo further into what can only be described as the arena of the problematic, co-produced with Kendrick Lamar. A young black man, working in an educational “re-enactment” event in a slavery museum, makes an unfortunate discovery about his white girlfriend’s ancestors and their relationship with his own forebears.Date tbcThis article was amended on 1 January 2026 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to “Japan’s Saipan island”.

She was surprised and thrilled at the great care many had clearly taken.Taylor said: “Some have included old cut-out pictures which people used to collect and send in letters. Some have drawn pictures or made collages. Many expressed their sadness at the ending of the postal service and the removal of the postboxes.”View image in fullscreenMany responses detailed people’s memories associated with the now-closed postal service.Photograph: The GuardianOne writer included a map marking the last three postboxes in her town. “She talks about being a child on holiday – the process of finding the right postcard to send, thinking about what to write and finding the post office to buy a stamp and send the card,” said Taylor.The writer told Taylor: “Receiving mail was even more exciting, especially post from abroad with different stamps and postmarks. I feel it’s a shame that the generations to come will never be able to send or receive a handwritten card or letter”.Another writer described the excitement of receiving letters from her mother’s sister in Norway. Taylor said: “Before she could read, she recognised her aunt’s handwriting when a letter arrived.“The family gathered round the kitchen table (she uses the now well-known Danish word ‘hygge’) with the smell of the coffee while her mother read the letter to the family. The mother’s voice was warm and her Norwegian accent clear. Now, the writer reflects how much her mother must have missed her sister and her homeland.”The same writer recalls emptying her childhood home where the family had lived for 60 years, and finding carefully saved letters from her mother to her father. She has not read them because she feels they should remain private.View image in fullscreenTaylor hopes to display the artwork she made from the letters in the UK and Denmark.Photograph: The GuardianA 67-year-old woman described receiving thousands of letters throughout her life. Taylor said: “She talks about looking out longingly for the postman as a teenager. She had pen pals across the world and has stayed in touch with some of them throughout her life. She writes to a prisoner in America with a life sentence.”Another writer talked about the Danish writer and philosopher Villy Sørensen, who created a short story called The Missing Letters in which people had stopped writing letters.Taylor said: “Now, it’s become a reality. The last handwritten letter the writer received was several years ago from an old school friend. The post office and all the postboxes near her have all now gone.”Taylor’s previous work has included sets of tiny envelopes made with second world war love letters and large installations of paper poppies.The Danish letters and their envelopes are to be used in a new artwork called Med Venlig Hilsen (With Kind Regards), which Taylor hopes to display in the UK andDenmark.Explore more on these topicsArtPostal serviceDenmarkEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A tree. Evening” will translate as “A loanen. A tree. Dailygan”. Ferguson, research director of the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies at Ulster University, suggested that audiences may develop an ear for Ulster Scots, which has many words with similar roots to English – but that translations might be provided.Ferguson considers it a language, not dialect, one that in the wake of the Good Friday agreement is “discovering itself and trying to find its way in the world”. And it works “beautifully” in the Godot setting, he said.Not least because of “ the sense of waiting and hoping and longing for something; all minority languages are longing for that sort of moment of salvation, that moment of revelation. So, that looking, and hoping, and wishing for a Godot-like figure or moment works very well I think with Ulster Scots because in a sense it’s waiting for its moment to live and find itself again”.It will be performed on Good Friday, 3 April 2026 (Beckett was born on a Good Friday), and is part of a new Beckett Biennale, which over the next 10 years will experiment with unexpected approaches including translations in Aboriginal Noongar, Sami and Inuit , and productions starring homeless actors.View image in fullscreenKeanu Reeves (right) appearing as Estragon in Waiting for Godot, is the latest celebrity to star in the play.Photograph: Andy Henderson/APArts Over Borders, producers of cross-border north-south arts festivals, aims to bring Godot back to its original roots when it premiered in French in Paris in 1953 and in London and Dublin two years later. The biennale aims to be the antithesis of the current trend for productions starring big names.Keanu Reeves is the latest Hollywood star, currently performing on Broadway; double-acts such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, Bill Paterson and Brian Cox, Ben Whishaw and Lucian Msamati, and Robin Williams and Steve Martin are others who have risen to its challenges.Doran appreciates “celebrity Godot” as a vehicle that spreads the word more effectively than anything else. But he believes it can detract from other perspectives, possibilities and insights. “And that’s clearly what we’re trying to do through the different languages, the outdoor setting, the homeless actors.”The Samuel Beckett Biennale will be set in rural and urban settings in NorthernIreland, the Republic of Ireland and England in 2026, returning in 2028.Explore more on these topicsSamuel BeckettNorthern IrelandTheatreIrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

Thriller writer Harriet Tyce, 52, who is also a former criminal barrister, admits her CV has given her “the skill set that could be quite useful”.Her previous books include Lessons in Cruelty and the appropriately titled The Lies You Told.“I spend my life making up horrible ways for people to die and killing people on the page,” she said.“The idea that I might get to actually plot to kill people or to track down a murderer, but, you know, without actual blood being shed, it’s the closest that I’d get to that experience in real life. So quite honestly, what’s not to like?“I’m really good at putting clues together, but I say all of this and I could collapse into a puddle of angst and it might be a complete disaster.”View image in fullscreenContestant Amanda, a retired police detective.Despite her experience in treachery and misdirection, she said her plan is to play down her skills as a novelist and “dial up” her role as a housewife and mother, to keep the heat off her early on. “I’m not going to be dishonest,” she said. “I’m just going to play it down.”Accompanying her within the Scottish castle that hosts the show will be Amanda, a 57-year-old retired police detective from Brighton, who spent a career uncovering deceit and observing shady behaviour.“I’ve done lots of interviews with criminals and victims. You have to put the pieces together to find the truth and see through the lies,” she said.“To be a traitor, you have to be good at lying, have a good poker face and be a master of deflection to prevent you being identified. I’ve learned a lot about being deceptive, devious and cunning.”View image in fullscreenContestant Ellie, a psychologist.Another contestant, Ellie, 33, is thought to be the first psychologist on the show. She said she hoped to bring a “psychological perspective” to the infamous roundtable discussions, after which a contestant is voted out of the game.She said she was hoping to deploy those skills as a traitor – with a tactic of winning over friends early on.“It’s absolutely about trying to form bonds with people early on, because we know that voting around the round table isn’t just about who’s suspicious, it’s also about the bonds that you’ve made with people,” she said.“I am also going to be hiding my occupation as I don’t want people to make assumptions about me.”Also among the hopefuls are Adam, an outspoken builder, James, a poker-playing gardener, and Reece, a 27-year-old sweet shop assistant.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsBBCBBC OnenewsShareReuse this content"

The band’s contract runs until 2029.Ador is also suing an unnamed member of Danielle’s family and the band’s former producer Min Hee-jin for damages and as part of a contract break penalty, alleging they both bore “significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for NewJeans’ departure and delayed return”.‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreSouth Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that the total amount sought from the three individuals amounts to nearly 43.1bn won (US$30m, £22m, A$45m).NewJeans made headlines in November 2024 when they announced their decision to leave Ador, prompting the company to request an injunction barring them from any commercial activities. That request was granted in March.Danielle’s contract has been terminated, the label said on Monday, as it was “determined that it would be difficult for her to continue as … an artist under Ador”.The label claimed that NewJeans’ members had been “exposed to persistently distorted and biased information” which had led to “significant misunderstandings”.The Guardian has reached out to Danielle for comment.According to Ador, three of the group’s four remaining members have decided to stay with the label, while member Minji is still in talks with the company.NewJeans, which made its debut in 2022, is among Hybe’s most successful acts. After the lawsuit against Danielle was announced, fans took to social media with the slogan: “NewJeans is five or nothing”.The dramatic contractual dispute erupted last year following allegations that Hybe had forced out Min, the band’s producer, from her role as Ador’s CEO.NewJeans members later issued an ultimatum demanding Min’s reinstatement, which Hybe rejected. The members then went public with their grievances, alleging the company had deliberately undermined their careers.Vietnamese-Australian band member Hanni Pham claimed that the band had endured mistreatment, including “deliberate miscommunications and manipulation” while working with the label. In October she delivered emotional testimony before South Korea’s parliament over the allegations, saying: “I know it’s not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace.”Danielle has also claimed that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management, an allegation Ador or Hybe have not responded to.In October, the Seoul Central district court rejected NewJeans’s claims that the allegations had caused an “irreparable breakdown of trust” with Ador.Weeks later, South Korea’s employment ministry also dismissed a workplace bullying complaint made by Pham against Ador, stating that the members were not legally employees of Ador, but “exceptional entities”.The spat sparked panic in the K-pop industry, as it fuelled discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.In a joint statement to Time magazineafter the injunction against them was granted, the band said: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”In November, Ador announced that only two members, Hyein and Haerin, would be returning to the agency, sparking fears among fans that NewJeans would split up. But Hanni, Danielle and Minji released a separate statement hours later clarifying that they would also return – but now it is clear, not for long.Explore more on these topicsK-popSouth KoreaPop and rockAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Does fate smile upon those who see the glass as half full? The science writer Sumit Paul-Choudhury believes so.The Bright Side: Why Optimists Have the Power to Change the Worldis his hymn to positivity, though fear not: it’s not a self-help book and there is more to it than platitudes about manifesting and living your best life.The author realised he was a natural optimist following the premature death of his wife from cancer. In the aftermath, he made an active decision “not to spend any more time in limbo than I already had” and “cultivated the idea that the future would be bright”. Optimism is, he says, “central to the human psyche”. It fosters social progress and encourages individuals to be resilient and withstand stress, to be more successful at work and create stronger bonds with friends and family. Among the models for optimism offered here are Ernest Shackleton who, along with his crew, survived being stranded in the Antarctic, and Helen Keller, who lost her hearing and sight after a childhood illness and later, in her 1903 essay Optimism, wrote about discovering hope and joy.Paul-Choudhury is our upbeat, but never Pollyanna-ish, narrator. His reading, like his writing, is thoughtful and pragmatic. Could optimism – the kind that leads people to assume they won’t get cancer, or lose their livelihood – be the result of naivety or delusion? Perhaps, but that isn’t an argument for relentless realism. To consciously see brightness and opportunity rather than misery and calamity, Paul-Choudhury asserts, is to ultimately invest in one’s future and bring about change.Available from Canongate, 8hr 45minAll My Precious Madness by Mark Bowles review – a deliciously sweary, prize-winning monologueRead moreFurther listeningAuditionKatie Kitamura,Penguin Audio,4hr46minTraci Kato-Kiriyama reads this enigmatic Booker-shortlisted novel about a nameless actor preparing for a new role who meets a younger man at a restaurant.

Despite the best efforts of conductor Neal Goren and his hard-working cast it never quite coheresAndrew ClementsThu 1 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTShareNadia Boulanger (1887-1979) is best remembered now as a hugely influential teacher, who spread the gospel of neoclassicism through several generations of composers on both sides of the Atlantic. She was also a conductor and organist, and at the beginning of her career, at least, had ambitions as a composer in her own right, which she largely abandoned in the early 1920s some years after the deaths of both her enormously talented younger sister Lili, and her mentor, the pianist and composer Raoul Pugno.View image in fullscreenAlbum cover artPhotograph: PentatoneIt was in collaboration with Pugno that Boulanger composed La Ville Morte, a four-act opera based upon a play byGabriele D’Annunzio; it was scheduled to be premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1914, but cancelled after the outbreak of the first world war. The opera only survives in a vocal score, and for this first ever recording, taken from performances in New York last year, it has been minimally orchestrated for an ensemble of 11 players. The “dead city” of the title of La Ville Morte is Mycenae, and the tangled story of love, lust and ambition among a quartet of archaeologists takes place among the city’s ruins. Musically it references Wagner, Fauré and most of all early Debussy, but the work never quite convinces in any of those modes, and runs out of dramatic steam well before the short final act, despite the best efforts of conductor Neal Goren and his hard-working cast of four.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

What are some of the simplest switches to make and most nutritious dishes to try with minimum fuss? Vegans share their tips on how to eat a balanced plant-based diet.Eat the worldSophie Sugrue, who last autumn became the first plant-based finalist on MasterChef, says: “It has pushed me to experiment so much more with different flavours from all over the world, because there’s so much naturally plant-based food.” Her favourite cuisines are “Japanese, because although they use fish sauce, it can be subbed out, and they use a lot of tofu; Vietnamese food is incredible, because a lot of people follow a plant-based diet. If you go to a Vietnamese grocery store, you can find loads of substitutes.”Ensure your diet is balancedView image in fullscreen‘I tend to have a little jar of mixed seeds that go on practically everything,’ says Ian Theasby.Photograph: fcafotodigital/Getty Images“Make sure that you’re hitting all of your food groups,” says the dietitianReena Sharma, who suggests using theEatwell Guide. Check that “you still have protein, you still have healthy fats, you still have omega-3”. Although you can also get plant-based omega-3 from things such as walnuts and flaxseeds, the rate at which it is converted to what our body needs is low, so Sharma recommends taking a supplement.Ian Theasby, one half of the vegan meal companyBosh!, moved to a plant-based diet a decade ago; co-founder Henry Firth followed suit a few weeks later. “Mix up your plate so you’ve got a good variety of vegetables,” he says. “Colour is a great way to see if you’ve got variety on there, and then add little bits on. I tend to have a jar of mixed seeds that go on practically everything. It is about making sure that you’re getting a good variety every single day.”Find your go-to protein sourcesView image in fullscreenTempeh is high in protein and easy to digest.Photograph: alvarez/Getty ImagesTheasby gets most of his protein from tofu, lentils and beans: “Ten years ago, I would have looked at those and gone, ‘That is so boring and bland; why would I want to eat any of that?’ But actually, 50% of the protein that I get now is from those three ingredients and they are so wildly versatile.”Don’t be put off if your uptake in beans initially has a gaseous affect, says Rachel Ama, the author ofOne Pot: Three Waysand founder ofAma’s sauceswho went vegan nine years ago. “People always say: ‘The more beans you eat, the more you fart.’ But your body is adjusting, your gut is realigning. So if you do get gassy, it passes; it’s not a for ever thing. Your gut is enjoying it and it’s going to be able to handle it.”‘It’s actually a superfood!’ Why tempeh is suddenly on every menu – and coming to a supermarket near youRead more“One of the big revelations for me was tempeh,” says Richard Makin, the food writer behindSchool Night Veganand the author of Anything You Can Cook, I Can Cook Vegan. “Tempeh is a complete protein source, so it has all the major amino acids. It is much higher in protein than tofu. It tends to be closer to 25g of protein per 100g. Also, because it’s fermented, it is much easier to digest. I try to get tempeh in as many things as possible.”“Stick a block of tofu or tempeh into your pasta sauce and blend, to add additional fibre, calcium and protein,” says Sharma.Embrace tofu“At first I really missed scrambled eggs, because it is just such a cheat code for quick nutrition and tasty meals,” says Theasby. “So we came up with the ‘two tofu technique’.” This involves blending silken and firm tofu witha few other ingredientsincluding black salt (kala namak). “It gives you exactly the same mouthfeel, texture and satisfaction.”“Tofu can get a bad rep,” says Ama, “but if you just cook it nicely …” How so? “Get firm tofu for starters, and either pull it apart or chop it into little pieces. Then toss it in a tablespoon of cornflour, get a nonstick pan, a bit of oil, and cook it. This crisps up the outside layer and makes the inside a bit softer, so you have two texture comparisons. Smother it in a sauce, and then you get the flavour, a bit of crunch and a soft centre, and it’s just a lot more enjoyable and fancy.”“If you freeze tofu you can get an amazing texture,” says Sharma. “You thaw it, squeeze out all the water, and it becomes quite porous, so you can cook it in a broth and it will soak up the flavours. Then you can fry it, or cover it in batter. Or you can get blocks of silken tofu and just pour over chilli oil: it tastes so good and requires no cooking.”Fuel well for fitnessView image in fullscreenPeanut butter and jam bagels are an energising breakfast.Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images/iStockphoto“People say that you can’t get enough protein or energy on a plant-based diet – that is nonsense,” says Theasby. “I run ultra marathons.” How does he fuel himself for that? “For races, which are 31 miles and up, I prep by loading myself up with carbohydrates at least three days before. So that would be a big plate of pasta, sweet potato, or rice. And then on race day, my standard breakfast would be bagels with a good amount of raspberry jam and peanut butter, for fats, proteins and sugars and carbs. During the actual race, it’s just nailing loads of gels.” Afterwards, and during training, he has plant-based protein powders and shakes.Use plant milk and oilWhen baking, says Makin, “I tend to use plant milk as an alternative to eggs. I swap 50ml for a large egg, because it pretty much does exactly the same thing. I tend to use unflavoured, unsweetened soya milk because soy is the plant milk highest in lecithin, which is a naturally occurring emulsifier in soya beans – and also in egg yolks – and it mimics the way an egg binds quite closely.”With regards to butter, says Makin, “Unless you really do need a plant-based butter for buttercream, it is easily replaceable with either vegetable oil or extra virgin olive oil. What I learned from Philip Khoury, an incredible vegan baker and chocolatier, is that if you’re replacing the butter in a recipe with oil, whether it’s vegetable, sunflower or olive, you only need 80% of the butter’s weight because a lot of butter is water. So if you’re trying to convert a recipe, keep that in mind.”Snack well‘Don’t ever assume there’s anything to eat!’ 29 tips for perfect vegan holidays, from where to go to how to orderRead moreMake sure you are organised when you are out and about, in case plant-based options are limited. Sharma says she “always carries nuts”.“I’ve become one of those vegans who will eat raw tofu or tempeh as a snack to hit a macro target for my protein,” admits Makin. “It doesn’t bother me any more, whereas I think five years ago that would have been unthinkable.”Leave the cheeseAma says cheese is the thing she missed the most: “There are some really nice nut cheeses that are super cheesy and umami. But as far as melty vegan cheese, I’m not the biggest fan.”“I still don’t think that we have nailed vegan cheese,” agrees Makin. “There are some products where the flavour is there, but the texture isn’t. I tend to just do without.”Focus on versatile vegBefore going vegan: “Me and aubergine did not know each other, and now we are best friends,” says Ama. “Because it has that unique texture, you can use it to thicken stews or a bolognese, or you can smother it in a teriyaki and have a silky pull-apart texture. It can be used in many different ways and makes a main feast or a side.”“I wasn’t a big fan of mushrooms when I was a kid, because they used to remind me of slugs,” says Sugrue. “Now I’ve opened up to the world of mushrooms: there are so many different types, and you can do so much with them.”Veganise your favourite mealsView image in fullscreenSwap meat for beans and extra vegetables in a stew.Photograph: Carlo A/Getty Images“I like to think that we all have eight recipes that we rotate, and maybe sometimes we’ll switch up the ingredients a bit,” says Makin. “My advice is always to just try to veganise those things, then you tend not to feel quite so dislocated in your diet when you’ve made that switch.”Use the same formula as you would when cooking your favourites, says Ama. “I like to use coconut milk, cumin, turmeric and onions. Instead of adding the usual chicken or whatever meat you’d have, just put beans in it and more vegetables, so it’s not a completely unfamiliar recipe.”When lacking in week-night inspiration, try …“I have atofu tikka masala recipeon my blog,” says Makin. “It calls for vegan cream, which is probably the only processed ingredient in there. But what I found recently is that you can actually just blend silken tofu with a stick blender and it replaces the cream completely. It is delicious and really high in fibre and protein, so it gives an extra nutritional boost. I’ve got acauliflower cheeserecipe as well, which I am obsessed with. It teaches you how to make a really creamy white sauce that doesn’t require any vegan cheese. And then obviously you can use that as a bechamel, in a moussaka or lasagne.”Ama recommends “a big bean dish with black beans, kidney beans, brown beans and beluga lentils. Cook them with cinnamon, paprika, cumin, ground coriander and tomato paste. Add some onions, peppers, tomatoes, veg stock, salt, pepper, then just leave that to simmer on low and let the flavours infuse. It will last you a few days and you can serve it with different things like a jacket potato, pasta, or rice and avocado.” She also rates sweet potato brownies: “They are full of superfoods, like the sweet potatoes, cacao, almond butter and dates,” and even small children go wild for them.Theasby says he lives by the mantra “chop, toss, roast”: “Take a block of tofu. Cut it up into 2cm chunks. Take a vegetable of your choice, be that tomato, aubergine or carrot. Chop that into roughly the same size as the tofu, then toss it in the seasonings of your choice. I always add a little bit of nutritional yeast, because it gives a really beautiful, umami flavour, but also is really good for B12. Toss it with a bit of olive oil. Roast it for about 30 minutes, put it on a plate with some kimchi, hummus and salad. What you’ve got is a plate of excellent food, but also loads of fibre, protein and plants. It is very easy and there is minimal washing up.”Sharma swears by a dish her mother used to cook for her. “It’s an Indian dish called kitchari, and it’s just lentils with rice. You stick it in a slow cooker, or a saucepan on a low heat, and add some spices like turmeric or garam masala, cumin and salt, and you just boil it until it’s like a risotto. You can have it for breakfast as congee, or for lunch or an easy dinner, and you can add extras to it, like pickles, to make it a bit more exciting.”View image in fullscreenKitchari (rice and lentils) with a few extra ingredients.Photograph: Nikolay_Donetsk/Getty Images/iStockphotoSugrue likes to make a pot pie with whatever is left in the fridge: “mushrooms, leeks, onion, garlic, and then I use soy cream to make the sauce. You can add in plant-based chicken alternatives or chickpeas.” Homemade pastry? “No – we haven’t got time for that midweek. It is store bought.” Surprisingly, some of the ready to roll varieties are dairy-free anyway: “There are some good things that you wouldn’t ever think are vegan, that are.”Don’t worry if you have occasional lapses“Don’t beat yourself up if you find it too difficult and occasionally fall off the wagon,” says Theasby. “Most people will find the immediate restriction very difficult, because it is new to them. So give yourself the opportunity to have that cheeky bacon sandwich every now and again, or a plate of scrambled eggs. It is about introducing a lot more plant-based food into your diet, which is great for your health and the planet.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe expertsVeganismFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I remember, I’ll pop it in the fridge and save it to add to a stew or batter, but today’s rolls are my new favourite way of using it up.Beer bread with cheddar and chivesYou’ll need just 150ml beer to make these fluffy, super-flavourful buns. They’re a serious treat, and wonderful straight from the oven or dipped into a hearty stew. To build good gluten strength, especially when working with wholemeal flours, always add any extra flavourings such as cheese and herbs after the dough has had its initial proving time. (Incidentally, you could also use up any cheese rinds you have lying around in this recipe – the buns will absorb their wonderful intense flavours and distribute them throughout the crumb.Makes6 rolls500g bread flour– I used 400g bread flour mixed with 100g wholemeal spelt1½ tsp dried fast-action yeast(about 5g)½ tbsp sea salt(about 7–8g)300ml liquid– a combination of beer or ale and milk or water: I used 150ml leftover beer and 150ml milk60g melted butter, plus extra to finish2 tbsp honey, or sugar120g grated hard cheese– cheddar, gruyère or similar10g chives, or parsley, finely choppedLine a deep, roughly 20cm x 24cm oven tray with (ideally unbleached) baking paper. Put the flour in a large bowl and stir in the yeast and salt. Pour in the liquid, 40g of the melted butter and honey, then, using one hand, bring the mix together into a rough, slightly sticky dough.Turn out the dough on to a clean surface and knead for about eight minutes, until smooth and elastic. Return it to the bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave somewhere warm for about an hour, until almost doubled in size.Turn out the dough again, stretch it out into a rectangle, then scatter with 80g of the grated cheese and most of the finely chopped chives, reserving a little for later. Fold over the dough to enclose the cheese and herbs, then knead into the dough and leave to rest for 15 minutes.Divide the dough into six even pieces and shape each one into a roll; fold any rough edges to the bottom while stretching the dough. Arrange the rolls next to each other on the lined tray, then scatter over half the remaining cheese. Cover again and leave to rise for another 45 minutes, again until doubled in size.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake the rolls for about 25 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Remove, brush with more melted butter, then sprinkle over the last of the cheese and herbs, and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteBreadBeerBakingCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"
