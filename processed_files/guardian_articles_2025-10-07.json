It’s quietly confident TV that brims with insightLucy ManganTue 7 Oct 2025 17.30 EDTShareAimee Lou Wood made her screen debut, as the endearingly unfiltered Aimee in Sex Education, in 2019. It’s been a deservedly busy six years since then for the actor, involving three more seasons of Sex Education, co-starring with David Morrissey in the sitcomDaddy Issues, a major role in the triumphant third season ofThe White Lotus, plus stage and film work, too.On the small screen, Wood specialises in vulnerability – the kind of characters who survive life despite having a layer of skin missing. You watch in the nail-biting hope that their courage will be enough to see them through and that the people they meet will be kind. It makes sense that Film Club, Wood’s first foray into writing (with Ralph Davis), is built round another variation on this theme.Evie (Woods) and Noa (Nabhaan Rizwan, so good in everything and just perfect here) have been best friends since university, where they started a weekly film club that has endured ever since. These days it is usually just the two of them, a sweet, gentle, funny pair, dressing up in suitable costumes every Friday night after Noa clocks off work as a family lawyer, and enjoying their time together. Now, however, they do so in Evie’s mum’s garage because Evie hasn’t been able to leave the house since her “wobble” six months ago, the exact nature of which is gradually revealed over the six-episode run. Evie set-dresses the garage appropriately for the film every week (an abundance of tinfoil, tubing and bubble wrap for Alien, huge flowers and lollipops for The Wizard of Oz and so on). It is a cocoon, a refuge and potentially a dependency.Then Noa is offered a job in Bristol and must take it. For the first time their friendship will be tested by distance, and the consequences of Evie’s agoraphobia made yet more oppressive. And, of course, it means any unspoken feelings that may or may not exist become harder to ignore. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and especially so when you cannot visit on a whim, or you spy hints of possible love interests on the new horizons one half of the unit is facing towards.Around the central relationship, which does much to restore the lost art of yearning to its rightful place, are a variety of noisier ones offered by Evie’s family. There is her mother, Suz (Suranne Jones, most recently seen in the virtually back-to-back seriesHostageandFrauds– it is Jones’s world now and we just live in it, which is absolutely fine by me), who is a wonderful creation. Fiercely loving, endlessly energetic and high-maintenance, you can see the fear for her daughter electrifying every nerve beneath the impeccably groomed surface. If she stops moving, she’ll collapse. She inadvertently terrifies Noa but has made Evie’s boyfriend, Josh (Adam Long), virtually part of the family. His is a simple soul whose sunny outlook and ever-readiness for an outing (“I think we need a good fat potter, Suz,” and off they go round the local department store) soothes the jangling in the maternal breast. Her other daughter, Evie’s sister Izzie (Liv Hill), has a darker outlook and drier wit that does not.View image in fullscreenA wonderful creation … Aimee Lou Wood (left) as Evie and Suranne Jones as Suz in Film Club.Photograph: BBC/Gaumont/Ben Blackall/PAFilm Club slots in to the growing subcategory of comedy about mental health, particularly women’s, written (or co-written) by women. It is perhaps not as dense or sophisticated as, for example, Aisling Bea’sThis Way Up(about a twentysomething recovering from “a teeny-tiny nervous breakdown”), or Nancy Harris’sThe Dry(about the whys and wherefores of alcoholism) and it is very different in tone from the brutally confrontationalSuch Brave Girls. But like all of them, it has a deep intelligence and psychological acuity underlying and informing all the jokes, and like them it also makes a point of looking beyond the suffering caused by mental illness to an individual and out at all the ways in which it can change dynamics and, especially without help, frustrate lives.Film Club is a quiet, careful but confident thing. It was clearly written by two people who know where their strengths lie (above and beyond Wood’s startlingly accurate Buffalo Bill impression and Rizwan’s flawless channelling of Jeff Goldblum) and it is impeccably cast. A bit more torque and a bit less whimsy might be welcome, but that is to quibble. Wood’s star and CV continue to shine.Film Club aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsDramaTV reviewAimee Lou WoodTelevisionMental healthSuranne JonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Well it’s tough being a ToryJohn CraceRobert Jenrick gives Conservative conference delegates permission to be the worst possible versions of themselvesTue 7 Oct 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareIf Andy Burnham hadn’t already made an appearance – why stop at leading Labour when you can also lead the Tories? – thenRobert Jenrickwould definitely qualify as the Conservative party conference’s very own Andy. The unwanted guest at the wedding. The man who turns up at every fringe. Flutters his eyelids and says: ‘Who me? As leader? The thought never crossed my mind.’Sadly for Kemi Badenoch, she can’t just starve Jenrick out. Pretend he doesn’t exist. As Honest Bob is her shadow justice secretary, she was rather obliged to give him a slot on the main stage. This was the moment he had been waiting for. He needed no second invitation. A chance to commune with his people. To look into their souls. To tell them that it wasn’t racist not to want too many black people together in one place.And his people were ready for him. The hall was roughly two-thirds full, half of them still awake. Which, by the standards of this conference, just about counts as a full house. Maximum engagement. There were people here who were alive after all. Not everyone had come together merely as a communal act of self-annihilation. Honest Bob appeared from behind a screen and the front few rows all stood up to give him an ovation. He raised his arms aloft in triumph. This was going to be his 20 minutes. Let’s get this party started.Only the party in question wasn’t the Conservative party. It was Reform. Which wasn’t quite the category error it seemed. Because nearly all the delegates in Manchester appeared to also be closet Reform supporters. Some of them had sat through endless dreary Reform-lite speeches and been bored to death. It was all too tepid. An exercise in existential futility. Why bother to be half-arsed about it, when you could have the real thing? And Honest Bob was here to give them permission to be the worst possible versions of themselves.Honest Bob led them to the promised land. But he did so ever so gently. This wasn’t a Nigel Farage tirade of hate. More an am-dram performance of The Producers.‘’ Light touch, tongue in cheek, authoritarianism with a shiny, happy face. Putting the fun back in fascism again.Look guys. We’ve been doing this all wrong. We’ve been making all this far right stuff sound too military. A bit 1984. But Honest Bob was here to tell you he could do being unpleasant to foreigners for jokes. Hell, what’s a bit of incitement to burn down migrant hotels between friends. Just the wokerati trying to stop you having a laugh.Lure them in gradually. Start with a few gags. At least what passes for gags on a conference stage and Honest Bob had given this all a lot of thought. Then this was basically a leadership speech. One that could run in parallel with Kemi’s. He was the leader-elect. He came not to bury Kemi, but to praise her. He just had a funny way of showing his loyalty.You can see the ambition, the desperation carved into every pore. The man who has never really believed in anything. The remainer Cameroon turned dodgy minister dishing out planning permissions to someone who then donated to the Tories turned, well, rightwing gobshite. Any way the wind blows. All that matters is career advancement. To be someone. Even if it takes his party down a cul-de-sac of irrelevance.“It’s tough being a Tory,” Honest Bob confided. But don’t worry! That’s why he was no longer a Tory. And no one in the hall need be either. Just a smooth transition to Reform that no one would even notice. Just dare to be you. Give in to your primal desires. Having planted that thought, he went back to some rambling jokes about Liz Truss, Keir Starmer. Not because they were funny but because that’s the template for a leader’s speech. Amazingly, he even got some laughs. The punters wanted him to succeed. Kemi must have been looking on in horror.There was also a bit of backstory. Poor, deprived Bob. Honest Underdog Bob. The authentic voice of the people. Only he could be trusted to deliver what the masses wanted. The chattering classes were being put on notice. Their day was done. They were wrong on the climate crisis. They were wrong on immigration. They were wrong on everything. The attorney general was basically a traitor. An enabler of terrorism. Channel your inner hate.Then the coup de théâtre. Honest Bob held up a box and pulled out a judge’s wig. An object of reverence, he said, before explaining his heartfelt contempt for all of them. Just letting criminals off. Dozens of judges with leftwing sympathies. Don’t they know that in the good old days all judges would salivate at the prospect of donning a black cap for a shoplifting offence? Bob wanted those days back. The chance for politicians to appoint their own judges. To reintroduce the death penalty. Especially for foreigners. Coming over here and not taking the trouble to make themselves white.Enough was enough. Honest Bob was reaching the end of his slot. It was time for the scumbags to die. The people had had enough of being taken for a ride. The collapse of the old order was in sight. And he was banging the nails into the Tory coffin in their own back yard. A new order is coming, he shrieked.That was the sort of reception Chris Philp could only dream about. He had been been on first up and the only people in the hall were those who had found themselves locked in from the night before. His reputation precedes him. He, too, tried the gags approach and died on his arse. He couldn’t read the audience and ended up being the only person laughing at his own jokes. No one even applauded when he trotted out his own Reform policies.There again the Philpster can’t even convince himself he’s serious. He’s like a child who is trying a bit too hard. Then it takes a special type of person to enthuse this Dignitas-adjacent crowd. And that person would be Honest Bob.

But when it came to training and racing I took it really seriously. I did everything I could to reach my very best and always go as deep as possible. I had that determination to perform.”The 39-year-old Welshman pauses as he thinks of his old contemporaries Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins: “Cav was obviously a lot more outspoken. I didn’t tend to tell people what I was hoping to do. And Brad’s spoken recently about how he had troubles in the past while he portrayed the whole rock-star image.Israel-Premier Tech to change its name and move away from ‘current identity’Read more“I was the total opposite to both of them, just a normal bloke from Cardiff who you would go down the pub with and have a pint – who then ended up winning the Tour. That’s the bit people might find weird when they don’t really know me. They don’t see the hard work you do from November to the race in July. They just see the finished product and assume that it’s easy, especially when you’ve had a long career.”Thomas shakes his head. “But to continue at that level needed determination, discipline and commitment, and that was hard. That was one thing I wanted to get across in the book.”Thomas’snew autobiographycovers the gamut of his extraordinary career, from the incredible highs to the harrowing lows. As accessible and appealing as Thomas himself, the book is at its most compelling when it charts the ambition and suffering which means that he is very far from the “normal bloke” in a pub.“Yes, yes,” Thomas says in a soft echo when I ask if that suffering defines professional cycling. He recalls riding most of the2013 Tour de Francewith a fractured pelvis. He finished second last out of 141 riders but still played a part in helping Chris Froome win the race. That matched his final position in 2007 when he was the youngest rider on the Tour and essentially a track racer who had no experience of climbing brutal mountains. “In ’07 and ’13 I was suffering every day and that’s when you find you can go deeper and suffer a lot more than you think. You finish the day and think: ‘I’m completely spent, there’s absolutely no way I can go again.’ But you have dinner, go to sleep and get up – ‘Right, let’s do it.’ There’s no part of you that will quit. That just makes you stronger.”View image in fullscreenGeraint Thomas enjoys his victory in the 2018 Tour de France, when he became the first Welshman to win cycling’s most famous race.Photograph: Stéphane Mantey/APThomas adds: “The training is the hard bit. The racing is easy when there are fans and emotion and adrenaline. That’s the fun bit. It’s all those hard yards you’ve got to do that take such self-discipline. A lot of the time you’re on your own. There’s no one stood there, making sure you go out and do it.”Now that it’s all over, with Thomascompleting his final race last month, will he miss aspects of that suffering? “I will miss the intensity, the routine and having that goal to work towards and that pressure. That’s been my life for 20-odd years. You wake up every morning knowing what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. That’s what I will have to find again otherwise you go a bit crazy. I want to do an Ironman or something to push me mentally and physically.”Thomas’s longevity is, perhaps, the most admirable aspect of his career. “I think so,” he agrees. “I heard the other day that my 18 years from my first Tour to my last Tour was the longest by any rider during that time. It’s something I’m really proud of. All the wins are great but being able to be competitive and stay at the top for that long is special.”He picks out hisTour de France victory in 2018and his Olympic gold medalsin 2008and 2012 as “huge” highlights but he is “just as proud of coming back from all the disappointments and injuries”.Thomas probably should have won one more Grand Tour andlosing the 2023 Giro d’Italia hurts the most. He seemed on course to win the race until, on the penultimate day, he lost the lead surprisingly to Primoz Roglic. “The Giro was definitely tough and the one that got away. But I don’t have any regrets.”Last year Thomas proved his enduring quality when he made his fifth Grand Tour podium by finishing third in the Giro – behind Danny Martínez and theimperious Tadej Pogacar. “I was super-proud of that,” Thomas says. “Obviously a pretty special guy in Pog won the race. So it was almost like a race for second. Danny pipped me but to be on the podium at 38 made me just as proud as winning the Tour.”Assessing the greatest riders he competed against, Thomas discusses Peter Sagan and Froome before making it clear how Pogacar is the most brilliant of them all. “Sagan was super-talented and, while he wasn’t built like a climber, some of the climbs he got over and the races he won were incredible. Froomey as well, especially considering his [Kenyan] background. He just had that engine, that raw talent. But it’s hard to see past Pogacar. He’s definitely the best of the generation and it’s unreal what he’s doing, winning one-day races all the way through to Grand Tours, smashing everyone in the Alps. It’s insane.”View image in fullscreenA youthful Geraint Thomas (far right) alongside Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh after winning Olympic gold in the men’s team pursuit at London 2012.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThomas is convinced that Pogacar’s success is built on pure talent and hard work and he argues that the sport is cleaner than ever. “100%. It’s easy for me to say: ‘Well, if I can win the Tour clean, then anyone can’ – but for me it taints the present that we still have to speak about doping a lot. At the same time, [such scrutiny] really helped clean up the sport. I think there is a hell of a lot more testing in cycling than other sports.”There is a sobering passage in his book where Thomas remembers how, in 2006, he rode briefly as astagiairefor the Spanish team Saunier Duval. He did not extend his internship and two years later Saunier were caught up in a doping scandal and forced to leave the Tour in the middle of the race: “Had I joined Saunier Duval or Phonak/iShares [a team infamous for doping controversies], I might have seen a whole other world. How would I have reacted, as a young man surrounded by the powerful and habitual? I’m fortunate I never had to find out.”Thomas says now: “I was lucky I didn’t go into that team and was never put in that position. Sky came in and the whole British Cycling mentality was my safety net.” He spent 15 years with Team Sky, whose sponsor name changed to Ineos Grenadiers in 2019, but the legacy of Dave Brailsford’s project has been tarnished by numerous controversies which have never been fully answered. Surely there were times when Thomas went to the management to ask what the hell was happening – from theJiffy-gate scandalsurrounding Dr Richard Freeman to therevelations this yearthat David Rozman, a long-term member of the Ineos staff, had left the Tour after the International Testing Agency launched an investigation into alleged messages he exchanged in 2012 with the convicted doping doctor Mark Schmidt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not saying they’re all dodgy, by any means, but if someone’s been in the sport 15 years, the possibility of them having some sort of link [to a drugs’ cheat] is pretty high. It’s been tough, all these things happening over the years with the team. But, as a rider, all you can do is worry about yourself and the next race.”Rozman was also part of the BritishCyclingsetup at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and so Thomas has known him for a long time. Was he surprised by the news of Rozman’s links to Schmidt? “I wasn’t surprised that he knew some doctor that ended up being a bit suspect. But just because you know someone doesn’t mean you’re guilty. I was surprised at how quickly it blew up and the bad press he was getting.”View image in fullscreenGeraint Thomas (right) on his last ride as a professional cyclist, stage six of this year’s’ Tour of Britain which ended in his home city of Cardiff.Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty ImagesSurely he understands that Ineos and Rozman were being asked legitimate and important questions? “Yes, but I think it could have been looked at without it all coming out. I think if you looked at other teams as intensely, then there will be lots of questions about them. It shows we’re held to a different standard than a lot of other teams.”Ineos have struggled competitively in recent years and it makes sense that they will offer Thomas a new role next year to help improve the team’s engagement with their riders. “It will be looking at their goals and how they’re going to execute them. So it’s a role where I’ll work alongside the coaches and the DS [directeur sportif] and be that go-between between senior management and the riders – with the goal of stepping up myself in years to come. I’ve got lots of knowledge and experience when it comes to racing but there will be a lot of learning for me from Dave as well.”Thomas stresses: “We still need to dot the i’s and cross the t’s so nothing’s definitely done or official yet. But I think I can help them out a lot going forward so that’s exciting.”So many different emotions swirled through himon his final day of racingas the Tour of Britain ended in his home town of Cardiff. “I felt a lump in my throat and was almost choking up on the bike in the last 3km. Some riders were coming up and saying: ‘Oh, G, it’s been amazing to ride with you, it’s been an honour.’ I was trying not to pay too much attention because it was getting me emotional.”He remembers that, “in the final kilometre, me and Swifty [Ben Swift] were riding next to each other. We grew up racing together when we were 12 and so to finish alongside one of my best mates was super-special.”What did he think as he crossed the finish line? “The main thing was just trying not to cry because I realised that chapter was over and it’s not a sad moment. It was joyous and happy. I was like: ‘I can’t start bawling now.’”Thomas smiles, but soon the ambition that defines him returns as he looks to the future. “It’s something that’s always been in me, wanting to push myself and do the best. Even in school, with GCSEs or A-levels, even though I was busy racing my bike, I still wanted to do well. So whatever I end up doing now, I definitely still want to be as good as I can be.”According to G by Geraint Thomas is published by QuercusExplore more on these topicsGeraint ThomasCyclingTour de FranceTeam IneosinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a threequel tothe original movie Tron from 1982, a film that was mould-breaking and boldly pioneering for its day in a way that eludes this one andits predecessor Tron Legacyfrom 2010. Tron: Ares (almost) comes to life just once – when Evan Peters gets a smack in the face from Gillian Anderson playing his mum, in an old-fashioned bit of analogue reality. That’s a bit of firm parenting you might feel like handing out to every producer involved in this film, and it’s sad to see the estimable Greta Lee and Jodie Turner-Smith being made to look so lifeless.The situation now is that an evil AI corporation with the unsubtly gangster-ish name of Dillinger has become a rival to the virtual reality firm Encom, originally set up in the 80s arcade-game era by genius trailblazer Kevin Flynn, played byJeff Bridges. This Dillinger (originally set up by Encom executive Ed Dillinger, played by David Warner) is led by the founder’s odiously nerdish grandson Julian (Evan Peters), who has a grand plan to design and create profitable things such as indestructible soldiers and tanks in the virtual reality grid and then export them into actual reality using a kind of 3D printer.The problem is that however fearsome, these things crumble into dust after 29 minutes. But Encom’s current CEO Eve Kim (Greta Lee) has discovered the MacGuffin-y “permanence code” which can keep these things alive for ever, and even keeps it on her person on a very low-tech flashdrive. So the ghastly Julian sets his attack dog on her: Ares, the humanoid uber-warrior which can leave the VR world for 29 minutes at a time but which, in the time-honoured way of robots, is beginning to show signs of not doing what he’s told. Jodie Turner-Smith plays Ares’s deadpan second-in-command Athena and poor Bridges has a leaden legacy cameo in wise white robes, like a Poundshop Jor-El on Krypton.And Ares himself – the hero of the title – is played by Jared Leto with hipsterish long hair, beard and faintly all-knowing smile, touches that were perhaps created by typing the words “extremely annoying” into an AI human creation programme. No one who remembers the90s TV classic My So-Called Lifewill ever find it in their hearts to be totally rude about Mr Leto, and I was incidentally very entertained by his broad (and critically misunderstood) comic turn inRidley Scott’s film House of Gucci. But Leto is unremittingly, unrelentingly awful here, although he isn’t helped by a limp plot point which is supposed to allow him to show flashes of “empathy” for Greta Lee’s character and subcontract all the badass wickedness to Athena, thus making her marginally more interesting. It is supposed to be adorable when Ares says how he loves 80s synth pop and that Depeche Mode are better than Mozart.And in keeping with the brand-identity of the franchise, there are motorbikes from the VR netherworld which whizz about the place in long straight lines, conforming to the rectilinear design of antique arcade games (or indeed nightclubs); one even shoots out a death ray which slices a cop car in two. But there is no drama or jeopardy or human interest anywhere. This franchise now looks about as urgently contemporary as an in-car CD player.Tron: Ares is out on 9 October in Australia and on 10 October in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmTron: LegacyScience fiction and fantasy filmsJared LetoGillian AndersonJeff BridgesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Experts tell us how to rebuild our capacity for joyAdrienne MateiTue 7 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 12.01 EDTShareAmericanssay they’re more dissatisfiedwith life than ever before.Anhedonia, a loss of enjoyment in usually pleasurable things, andhypernormalization, the experience of daily life amid disconcerting societal change, can lower one’s wellbeing. Even “little treats” – accessible delights like a walk, a piece of cake, a streaming binge – can stop feeling good in this context.“Part of the issue of living in such a stressed-out world is some conglomeration of burnout and compassion fatigue and doomscrolling, but also, not doing anything about it,” says Michael Steger, founder and director of the Center for Meaning and Purpose at Colorado State University.But joy is crucial for resilience and forward motion. “Being able to actually feel the pleasures of being alive … and having agency over what we’re doing is actually a path of our liberation and a sign of our liberation,” activist Adrienne Maree Brownsaidin July.For those experiencing depression or prolonged stress, clinical care from a qualified counsellor or psychotherapist can be invaluable. However, it is possible to bolster one’s baseline capacity for pleasure, priming the brain to more easily access motivation and happiness. Little treats will not fix everything, but here’s what experts say about appreciating them anew.Anticipate the treatYour walk or pastry may be as objectively good as ever, but can feel dull if your brain isn’t lighting up in anticipation. That has everything to do with dopamine, experts say.Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that mediates “the pursuit of pleasure – the hope that something good may happen”, says Dr Anne-Noël Samaha, an expert in the neurobiology of rewards and motivation at the University of Montreal. When people feel anhedonic, she says, it’s because they’ve lost the drive to pursue pleasurable things.“Research suggests anticipation can produce more dopamine activity than the reward itself,” psychiatrist Dr Sanil Rege says. When that motivational spark is low, even activities we used to enjoy can feel unrewarding. “The brain isn’t registering them in the same way,” he says, “and the cycle that normally turns small pleasures into ongoing sources of motivation breaks down.”Create a ritualBecause the brain is built to anticipate and predict, the way to boost pleasure isn’t bigger rewards or willing yourself to enjoy things more, but creating routine.If your go-to treat isn’t “hitting” anymore, “monotony, steady, repeated action, is actually the clue here. Over time, it builds a foundation that makes those bigger bursts of enjoyment possible again,” says Rege. It’s the accuracy of our brain’s prediction, “not the size of the treat”, that ultimately restores pleasure, he says.For example, it can be tempting to grab a pastry on a whim. But Rege suggests starting a Saturday morning ritual at your favorite bakery instead. All week you know it’s coming, which builds anticipation. “By the time Saturday arrives, it’s not just about the pastry – it’s about the ritual, the familiarity, and the little story you’ve built around it,” says Rege. Anticipation activates dopamine long before your treat arrives. “Your brain isn’t only enjoying the croissant. It’s enjoying the expectation, the confirmation,” he says.Don’t go it aloneYou may be catching on that the treat itself is just one part of accessing enjoyment. Another way to boost pleasure is to make it social. “Just buying stuff is not going to cut it,” says Samaha. “What we need is to stay connected with other people.” Making a standing date with a friend to grab coffee or knock anerrand off your to-do listcan amplify the emotional payoff.Research backs this up. “Anything social … makes people happier than an activity done alone,” says Dr Sonja Lyubomirsky, a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California whose work focuses on happiness. In fact, treating someone else might do more for your mood than treating yourself.Learn to savor sparks of joyIn an emotional rut, pleasures can seem weak and fleeting. When that happens, Steger recommends a practice called “savoring”, which is similar to mindfulness. When you’re enjoying something, invite your attention to rest on the moment, he says. Then, expand that joy by examining it. What were you thinking, or was your mind clear? Did your mood subtly shift or did it improve significantly? What were you paying attention to – the quality of the light, birdsong, the grass beneath your feet?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you’re feeling anxious about an event and decide to skip it, that can feel good in the moment. But over time such decisions can reinforce the idea that you’re “never going to have a nice social life”, he says.Rather than use treats to quell bad feelings, see them as rewards for solving problems and improving your life. For instance: “If I finish this task, I’ll give myself a treat. If I make that phone call that I have been avoiding, I’ll give myself a treat,” says Lyubomirsky.Effort can make a treat more satisfying, according to research. “There have been some studies in rats showing that they will prefer rewards that they had to work for over rewards that they get for free … One theory is that effort is a reward in itself,” says Samaha.Reminisce about the past – and narrate the presentIf the present feels muted, try thinking about the past.“We’re starting to see a science of nostalgia build,” says Steger. Reflecting on your past; your relationships, accomplishments and growth; and difficult things you’ve already surmounted, can give you the sense that you’re “in the middle of an interesting story and a good life”, he says. This can strengthen your sense of belonging and resilience.Conversely, try thinking about the present as something you’ll reflect on in future. “Five or 10 years from now, a future you is going to try to find things to feel nostalgic for. You don’t want them to skip over this whole phase of your life, do you?” says Steger. The idea isn’t to force joy into bleak moments, but to start noticing what might later feel meaningful.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard believing in meritocracy, yet finding yourself polling at 15%. It’s even harder having wanged on mercilessly for decades about natural selection, yet now constantly finding yourself appearing in the same sentence as the phrase “facing extinction”.And it’s harder still to find polling guru John Curticedoing panels at your conferencein which he outlines the route back to even the same time zone as being in contention. “You’ve got to get yourself back to base camp,” Curtice explained in one mild-mannered drive-by on Sunday. “At the moment you frankly can’t even see the Himalayas.” Given the well-documented traffic issues on Everest these days, we have to face the possibility that more people have reached the summit of the world’s highest mountain this year than have joined the Conservative party.To the party’s gathering in Manchester, then, where the leadership of Kemi Badenoch continues to come off as a performance art piece entitled All Fall Down. It’s not so much a conference as one of those soap montages that signal the death of a character. By the time Robert Jenrick was on stage at midday holding up a judge’s wig like a sock puppet and promising to “take our country back” (again),20 councillors had defected to Reformsince breakfast. The conference is so mad and sad that it features an exhibition of Margaret Thatcher’s clothes, which various Tory ugly sisters and brothers have been metaphorically trying to squeeze themselves into ever since the party ousted her a full 34 years ago. After this many failed impostors, it’s just possible they should smash the glass slipper and get on the apps instead.Begging the party to swipe right – quite a bit further right – we have Jenrick, the endlessly metamorphic shadow justice secretary who’s had more eras than Taylor Swift. If you felt a seismic straining in the north-west this week, that was Jenrick desperately trying not to do an Andy Burnham and cast this conference as The Official Launch Party of a Showboy. Here, he’s been at pains to suggest, he’s just one of the team – just a humble fledgling content creator as at home in the world of short-form video as he is halfway up a lamp-post in a tight polo, carrying a six-pack of made-in-China St George flags.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick at the 2025 Conservative party conference.Photograph: Gary Roberts Photography/ShutterstockRegrettably – or, as far as he’s concerned, fortunately – some recorded comments of Jenrick’s from a Conservative association dinner back in March wereleaked to this newspaper, in which he lamented a visit to Handsworth in Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face”. A few sentences further on, Jenrick stated “it’s not about the colour of your skin or your faith”, which gave Badenoch the leewayto defend himthis morning, although she did explain: “I don’t think this is where the debate should be, about how many faces people see on the street and what they look like.”I’m sure she doesn’t. Then again, Badenoch is a master of this kind of insouciantly robotic understatement, apparentlytelling a meetingof Conservative association chiefs a couple of days ago that the party’s poll ratings are “not where I want us to be”. Which reminds me that John Curtice had a few other truth bombs to drop. “The Liberal Democrat vote is now much more geographically concentrated than your vote,” he informed Tories at his conference event, “and the electoral system is now treating you like it treated the Liberal Democrats. And so although the Liberal Democrats are just behind you in the polls, they are going to almost undoubtedly win more seats than you.” Oof.It must be said this wasn’t the vibe you’d have got from shadow chancellor Mel Stride’s speech. “Let’s face it,” claimed Mel hilariously, “we’re the only party that gets it.” Nkay. Go on. “And that means we have to face some hard truths to which other parties turn a blind eye.” By way of an example, he announced the Conservatives would slash the civil service to 2016 levels. And yet, where was the hard truth – namely that the civil service has ballooned since then because of all the extra stuff it’s had to do since Brexit, the Conservative party triumph with the world’s longest list of small print?Still, there has been the odd bright spot. Unable to accept that the lethal force of the term “Boriswave” is going to permanently do for him, the undead Boris Johnson has spent recent days mounting embarrassing rearguard actions against his own policies. On Monday, he could be found popping up in frantically casual fashion to say he “went far too fast” on net zero, and that he personally “got carried away”. Of course, of course. Ever since Reformstarted saying“Boriswave” every five seconds, Johnson appears to have shed devotees at a quite alarmingly fast rate. Nigel Farage is his political Mounjaro. Even Johnson’s most devoted superfan, Nadine Dorries,has been seduced. She’ll still love him and everything, but it must be tough for Boris to face up to the fact that Nadine has defected to a party whose biggest diss literally has his name in it.Elsewhere, the Tory leadership prefers instead to suggest the party eating its lunch is touting policies that fall apart under scrutiny. As Badenoch whined this week: “Reform is saying stuff because it hasn’t thought it all through.” Well, yes. In time-honoured tradition, they are just saying some shit to get elected. Which is, let’sactuallyface it, a little something they learned from their predecessors. More than anyone else on the political spectrum, the recent iteration of the Conservative party popularised the idea that actions did not have consequences, that cake could be both had and eaten, and that there were no trade-offs on the route to what Badenoch was this weekstill calling“the sunlit uplands”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet incredibly, after having had to live through the post-2016 convulsions alongside the rest of us, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves failed to realise that their own bullshit would also not survive contact with the reality of government. As waspointed out at the time, Starmer and Reeves sought power by making ridiculous promises about what they wouldn’t have to do, either because they were hopelessly naive, or just hopeless. They are now reaping that particular whirlwind, which will reach category 5 with next month’s budget.Thus it increasingly feels as though cautionary tales are this country’s only remaining manufacturing success story. Jenrick’s speech today ended with him gibbering: “I can feel Britain’s fortunes turning.” We all can. Perhaps the kindest way of putting it is that the Conservative party is part of the new “left behind”.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservative conferenceOpinionRobert JenrickKemi BadenochNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Zack Polanski, the Green party leader, said it was racism.0:46Robert Jenrick complains of ‘not seeing another white face’ during Birmingham visit – audioThe Right Rev Dr Michael Volland, the bishop of Birmingham, said the comments “have the potential to generate anxiety and stir up division and … can feed into a harmful narrative that provides fuel for a fire of toxic nationalism”.Andy Street, the Conservative former mayor of the West Midlands, said Jenrick was wrong in saying the multi-ethnic neighbourhood of Handsworth was not integrated, while Labour’s Richard Parker, who succeeded Street as mayor, said he was “incredibly sad but also very angry”.“Birmingham is a proud, diverse city built by generations from every background. We don’t separate people by the colour of their skin – and that’s what Jenrick has done here with his comments,” Parker said. “What also concerns me is that there were Conservative politicians in that room, from our region, and they didn’t speak up. Silence in the face of this kind of rhetoric is not leadership.”Jenrick was repeatedly pressed over the comments on the day of his speech to the Conservative party conference.In the remarks in March, Jenrick was recorded as saying: “I went to Handsworth in Birmingham the other day to do a video on litter and it was absolutely appalling. It’s as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country. But the other thing I noticed there was that it was one of the worst integrated places I’ve ever been to. In fact, in the hour and a half I was filming news there I didn’t see another white face.“That’s not the kind of country I want to live in. I want to live in a country where people are properly integrated. It’s not about the colour of your skin or your faith – of course it isn’t. But I want people to be living alongside each other, not parallel lives. That’s not the right way we want to live as a country.”On Tuesday he repeatedly told interviewers that he stood by the comments and did not resile from them as it would be wrong to “shut down an important debate that we have to have as a country” about integration.When a Sky News journalist put it to him that his remarks could embolden far-right groups who did not want to see black and brown people living in the UK, Jenrick said it was “an absolutely disgraceful and ridiculous” question and accused the journalist of trying to silence debate about integration, which he said in itself could fuel extremism.In an interview for the Telegraph’s Daily T podcast, Jenrick was pressed on whether he would complain that an all-white area was too monocultural, if he really was making a point about how society should be integrated and reflect the makeup of the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Decolonise the countryside, decolonise the National Trust. The left do make those arguments … What I said is that it’s not about the colour of your skin or your faith. My point is that we have communities that do not reflect the breadth of the people who live in our country. That is self-evidently true.”Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, defended Jenrick, saying he had made a “factual statement” and that there was “nothing wrong with making observations”. But she also told BBC Breakfast: “I don’t think this is where the debate should be, about how many faces people see on the street and what they look like.”Jenrick’s comments about Handsworth related to a video about litter and fly-tipping that he recorded for GB News. In the footage, he talks about being in Handsworth but is actually pictured walking down a street in nearby Aston. There are no interviews with any local people. A clip of flytipping in Aston put on Facebook by a Liberal Democrat councillor, Mumtaz Hussain, is also shown. Jenrick later went to interview residents in the Conservative area of Sutton Coldfield about flytipping.Responding to Jenrick on Tuesday, Lammy said: “Unlike Robert Jenrick, the public knows Britishness isn’t about retreating into suspicion or judging people by the colour of their skin. It’s about pride in what we build and contribute together. While the Conservative party feeds off division and decline, Labour is delivering the patriotic renewal our country needs.”Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told LBC that Jenrick “has a lot of explaining to do”. She asked: “Is he suggesting that the colour of your skin makes you less British than someone else?”Polanski, the Green party leader, went further, saying: “Jenrick could have visited Handsworth to listen to residents; he chose to pass through and judge them based on the colour of their skin. Instead of getting to know our nation of neighbours, he chose racism. The Tories, Reform and Labour want to divide us. The Greens say: enough.”Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickConservativesBirminghamImmigration and asylumRaceCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

About one in five said they were still undecided.At a rally in east London, Powell said she would be a full-time deputy and would push for a change of approach. “We must be more authentic, telling a stronger story about the purpose of the Labour government and whose side we’re on,” she said.“I’m proud of Labour’s achievements, but we need to acknowledge that mistakes have been made. We can’t sugarcoat the fact that things aren’t going well. We have ceded the political megaphone to our opponents instead of setting the agenda ourselves. I want to help Labour wrest it back.”Powell told the rally that would require “changes to the way we operate”, a hint at the strategy run by No 10 to suspend or isolate critical voices.“When we rely on a narrower and narrower set of voices, groupthink sets in, and that’s when mistakes and wrong turns happen. I want to change this. Unity of purpose comes not from command and control, but by taking people with us and winning the argument,” she said.Powell wanted first and foremost to be a campaigner in the role, she said, but said Labour was losing support on both its right and left flanks, to Reform UK and to the Greens and Liberal Democrats.“We’re in the fight of our lives, and the future of our democracy is on the line,” she said. “Politics has become more fractured and divided. We’re losing support to both sides. Trying to out-Reform Reform doesn’t work.“I’ll get up every day and focus full-time on rebuilding a broad progressive coalition, to put our values into action, reunite the country, standing up for what we believe in, power with a purpose.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It found that many employers are out of step with the generational change in attitude towards drinking because they still hold work social events in bars or pubs or make alcohol a central feature of the occasion.The report highlights how in contrast the restaurant chain Wagamama has replaced alcohol-centred staff socials with explicitly non-alcoholic events such as pottery workshops, yoga classes, running clubs and boxing sessions, which have improved morale and cohesion.The IPPR’s findings are partly based on a representative survey of 2,083 working-age UK adults by the pollsters Public First. “Even as drinking habits shift, cultural pressures in the workplace continue to drive harm,” the thinktank said.The survey found:32% of workers had called in sick the next day after drinking at a work event or with workmates in the last year.41% of 18- to 24-year-olds had been too hungover to work, and 47% of 25- to 34-year-olds.22% of staff in education and 24% in health and social care had cried off work the next day after drinking at or after work in the past six months, and a fifth in both sectors had turned up late the next day.28% think drinking at work events excludes non-drinkers or creates cliques.The IPPR, which is influential with the Labour government, said workplace drinking “is not just a hangover, it’s a productivity crisis”, with alcohol harm now “a national economic problem”.Sebastian Rees, the thinktank’s head of health, said: “On one hand, gen Z are drinking less than previous generations, and some employers are taking welcome steps to move away from alcohol-centred work events. Yet the UK’s professional culture remains deeply rooted in drinking. A pint after work, a glass of wine at a networking event or a social at the pub still sit at the heart of many careers.”The IPPR urged ministers to bring in minimum unit pricing for alcohol in England, which evidence suggests is reducing alcohol-linked deaths in Scotland, and to tell employers to do more on workplace drinking.Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive ofAlcoholChange UK, which funded the report, said it countered “endless alcohol industry overclaim about the economic benefits it delivers”.Alcohol “hampers the daily functioning and performance of our workplaces and overall strength of our economy”, he said. “When alcohol dominates workplace cultures, productivity and wellbeing both take a hit while making life much harder for those of us who don’t drink alcohol or want to drink less.”The Confederation of British Industry said employers must ensure staff do not feel under pressure to drink at work events. “Having clear policies is an important starting point [to making events inclusive] and a growing number of employers have policies specifically about alcohol,” said Matthew Percival, the CBI’s future of work and skills director. “There are many reasons why individuals may not wish to consume alcohol at work events, and nobody should ever feel pressured to do so.”The government declined to respond directly to the IPPR’s report. A spokesperson said: “As part of our 10-year health plan, we are supporting people to make healthier choices through our shift from sickness to prevention as we build an NHS fit for the future. This includes committing to introducing a mandatory requirement for alcoholic drinks to display consistent nutritional information and health warning messages.“The government has also provided an additional £310m to improve drug and alcohol treatment services and wider recovery support.”It continues to review moves to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as changes to alcohol duty and the possible introduction of minimum unit pricing.Explore more on these topicsAlcoholWork & careersHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody is above the law … if Congress will not check this administration, then Chicago will.”The White House accused the mayor of “aiding and abetting criminal illegal immigrant killers, rapists, traffickers, and gang bangers”,Newsweek reported.Illinois officials have long condemned the Trump administration’s plans for a federal takeover. Pritzker previously called on “all to stand up” toTrumpin the face of the intervention during an interview with CBS News in September.“Any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency,” said Pritzker, adding, “I’m going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from using the military to invade states”.Johnson has also vociferously condemned the planned intervention since it was first signaled. During a Labor Day rally, he told a protest in the city: “We’re going to defend our democracy in the city of Chicago. We’re going to protect the humanity of every single person in the city of Chicago.”Illinois senator Dick Durbin condemned the move in a statement issued as troops arrived in the state.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tina Kotek, Oregon’s governor, has denounced any military intervention in the state as a “threat to our democracy” as well as a “wake-up call” for other state officials,in recent comments to NPR.In June, the Trump administrationdeployed national guard troopsinLos Angeles, where Ice agents conducted large-scale raids. Trump also deployed thousands of national guard troops and sent federal agents to Washington DC in August, as part of his unprecedented law enforcementtakeoverof the nation’s capital.Trump has said the moves are necessary to help with immigration enforcement and fight crime. Meanwhile, Democratic leaders locally and around the country have pointed out that crime levels are generally falling.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationChicagoTexasDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dawn broke and his wife and daughter announced they were going to spend the day at the resort city of Eilat; they wanted to avoid their grief for a day. Graziani decided to go alone.“I felt in my heart that I must come here. Today feels different. October 7 – it broke the entire family apart,” said Graziani, a 53-year old real estate agent, as he wet a cloth and wiped sand from a picture of his 21-year-old son, Maor Graziani, who was killed at the Nova music festival.Graziani was not alone in his mourning. He was joined by hundreds of Israelis who came to pay their respects to Maor and the other 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage on 7 October 2023.Tuesday marked two years since Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, marauding through a music festival and Israeli kibbutzim along the border withGaza.View image in fullscreenOren Graziani stands by his son’s memorial at the site of the Nova music festival massacre.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianThe attack was the most brutal in Israel’s history, shattering the country’s sense of safety and prompting Israel to launch a still ongoing war on Gaza that has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and left itaccused by a UN commission of inquiryof conducting genocide in Gaza.The thud of artillery and the whomp of a minigun being fired by a gunship in Gaza just a few miles away provoked no reaction from people attending memorials. In Gaza, no respite was given from the bombing so that its residents could memorialise their own dead. At least 10 Palestinians were killed since dawn on Tuesday.The lingering trauma of the 7 October attack in Israel was plain to see on Tuesday. At the Nova music festival memorial site, where nearly 400 were brutally killed, pictures of those lost were affixed permanently with red metal flowers underneath.“I talked to Maor a minute before he died.The last thing he told me was not to be afraid, that it was OK,” Graziani said. He did not hear from his son again, but held out hope that he was merely missing, not dead.Three days later he was sent a video on Telegram that showed his son’s car being sprayed by bullets while fleeing to a nearby kibbutz – the army called him shortly after to inform him of Maor’s death.Other families who had lost loved ones stood silently and watched as services were held to commemorate the attack. A survivor recounted to a stunned group of American evangelists, who had flown in to commemorate the anniversary, how she was able to flee the scene with the help of Israeli military officers.1:52Families remember victims and hostages on 7 October anniversary – video“I wanted to witness it for myself. It’s such a horrible thing that happened and unfortunately the world and the media is forgetting what happened here,” Hannah Epstein, a 37-year-old TV agent who flew in from Nashville, Tennessee, said while wiping away tears.Other Israelis came out of a sense of solidarity with other victims and to make sure that “this never happens again in the future”, said Hezi Kedem, a 64-year-old owner of a jewellery factory, while he walked among the remembrances.At nearby Be’eri, a kibbutz where 130 people were killed in the attack, most who lived there have still not returned two years on.“Some people will never come back, but I hope that at least 70% will come back. I really want to believe that the army learned from this massacre,” said Miri Ghadmessika, a 47-year-old resident of Be’eri, as she walked through charred remains of her parents’ house. All the doors were off the hinges and broken roof tiles littered the entrance, seemingly unchanged since the day of the attack.View image in fullscreenThe kitchen of a house in the Be’eri kibbutz. Both of the property’s owners, the elderly couple David Karol and Ofra Kediar, were killed.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianNew houses were being built for people from the kibbutz at a site nearby, the frames of the homes already erected. The state wanted to knock down all the damaged homes of the commune in order to make way for new houses, but Miri and a few other residents objected, wanting to keep at least four homes as a memory of what happened that day.Miri has her own memories of the attack, and recounts how militants tried to kill her and her children four separate times, setting her home on fire. Miraculously, her family survived with minor injuries.The charred houses and pictures of the fallen were not the only reminders that Israel had changed. Pistols tucked in waistbands – an increasingly common site after gun permits were widely distributed following 7 October – was a reminder of the sense of broken safety. Attitudes towards Palestinians have hardened too.View image in fullscreenThe kibbutz of Be’eri has started building new homes after many were damaged or completely destroyed on 7 October.Photograph: William Christou/The Guardian“Before October 7, politically I was with the side that said in Gaza and Iran there are mothers and children too, these people want peace. But now, when I see a Palestinian I’m afraid he will kill me, so I want to kill him first,” said Dalia Shaked, a 60-year-old lawyer, as she visited a shelter turned memorial outside Be’ri.In Gaza, despair reigned. “A second year passes while we remain trapped in the spiral of this war. It is an indescribable sensation, a mix of helplessness, exhaustion and the accumulated fatigue of each day in these harsh conditions,” said Abdul Rahman Abu Eid, a 19-year-old from southern Gaza.Abu Eid has been displaced five times during the war and lost three of his cousins, his home, land and all of his possessions. His story is not unique – most Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced several times and have lost many in their family.View image in fullscreenAbdul Rahman Abu Eid has lost family members, his home and much of his youth over the past two years of war in Gaza.Photograph: Amjad TanteshThere is famine in parts of Gaza according to the world’s leading authority on starvation. Most aid agencies blame the famine on the aid blockade Israel has put in place on the strip – Israel denies the claim.Alongside the UN commission of inquiry, human rights organisationsincluding two leading Israel-based groupshave accused Israel of committing a genocide in Gaza. Israel denies this, saying it has only acted in self-defence.Many hope a light at the end of the tunnel is visible, as Hamas and Israel engage in indirect peace talks in Egypt in what Donald Trump has hailed as a “real chance” for peace. The US presidentordered Israel on Friday to stop bombing Gaza, an order Israel has largely ignored.Nonetheless, the renewed momentum behind peace talks has given Abu Eid a modicum of hope that the war that has robbed him of his youth will soon end.“Since it began, the war has completely turned my life upside down. The war has affected every part of my life, physically, mentally, health-wise,” said Abu Eid.In Israel, some took the time off on Tuesday to go visit the Ashdod lookout, from where Gaza is visible. Families lined up behind a telescope, which for 5 shekels gave a view of the mostly destroyed Gaza skyline.View image in fullscreenA view of Gaza from a telescope at the Ahsdod lookout.Photograph: William Christou/The GuardianOn Tuesday afternoon, the tourists came just in time to watch an Israeli jet carry out an airstrike on Gaza.

Over the weekend the national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, was accused of preventing the evidence coming forward, but Downing Street has denied this.Spying charges against Christopher Cash, 30, and Christopher Berry, 32, were unexpectedly dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service last month, which initially only said that the “evidential standard” was “no longer met” a month before a high-profile trial had been due to start.Cash and Berry denied the charges. At the time of the alleged offences Cash was a researcher specialising in China working for the Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, and Berry, a friend, was a researcher based in China. They were accused of passing on information about Westminster that was ultimately sent to Cai Qi, a member of China’s ruling politburo.The aide, the associate, the ‘Chinese agent’ – and the collapse of a long-awaited UK spy trialRead moreThe requirement to describe China as a threat to national security emerged during a separate spying case of a six Bulgarians who had been found guilty of conducting espionage for Russia earlier this year under the 1911 Official Secrets Act, the same legislation under which Cash and Berry were charged.The 1911 act said that a person was guilty of espionage if they acted in a manner “prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state” and passed on information that might be “directly or indirectly useful to an enemy”.According to Parkinson, the court clarified that an enemy for the purposes of the 1911 act “includes a country which represents at the time of the offence, a threat to the national security of the UK” – a decision that was made “some weeks” after Cash and Berry were charged with spying in April 2024.In the light of that ruling, Parkinson said it was “considered that further evidence should be obtained” from the government. In this case, Matthew Collins, a deputy national security adviser, was providing evidence on behalf of the government to explain the wider geopolitical context behind the spying charges.“Efforts were made over many months,” Parkinson continued “but notwithstanding the fact that further witness statements were provided, none of these stated at the time of the offence China represented a threat to national security, and by late August 2025 it was realised that this evidence would not be forthcoming”.“When this became apparent, the case could not succeed,” Parkinson wrote, in a letter sent to Karen Bradley, the chair of the home affairs select committee, and to Andy Slaughter, the chair of the justice committee.The 1911 Official Secrets Act has now been repealed and has been replaced by 2023 National Security Act, which has replaced the term “enemy” with the broader term “foreign power”. It came into force in December 2023.It is understood that government lawyers believe that it would not have been possible to designate China as a threat to national security to accommodate the new case law, because the UK has never formally done so.China was described a “systemic competitor” in the government’s integrated review of 2021, when Boris Johnson was prime minister, and as an “epoch-defining and systemic challenge” under Rishi Sunak, when that was refreshed in 2023.Keir Starmer said the evidence had to be provided on the basis of government policy at the time the offences were allegedly committed – from 2021 to early 2023, when the Conservatives were in power and before the National Security Act came into effect.“All I can say with great certainty is if you’re prosecuting someone on the basis of what the situation was in 2023, you have to prosecute them on the basis of what the situation was in 2023,” the prime minister said.“That’s why the witness statement was prepared in 2023, about what the state was in 2023. And any other approach would mean you wouldn’t be able to prosecute the case. You have to prosecute people on the basis on what was the state of affairs at the time of the offence. Nothing changes that fundamental, whoever is in government,” he added.Explore more on these topicsEspionageChinanewsShareReuse this content"

Separately, in April, he was found guilty of possessing indecent images of children and extreme pornographic pictures including images of bestiality.Police examining his phone after he was arrested in connection with the fraud case discovered more than 600 distressing images, relating to “probably hundreds of victims” who were children. Nearly 300 were category A photographs, denoting the worst type of child abuse images, and 68 of these were moving images or videos.On Monday, he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years for the fraud offences and an additional 18 months for nine indecent image offences, including three charges of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child.In sentencing remarks Judge Berkson said Watkin “clearly” had an interest in viewing “the most vile indecent images of children” and continued to download and possess further images while he was on bail for his earlier arrest.DC Gareth Yates of Cheshire police’s economic crime unit said: “Not only did Watkin deceive his victims by befriending them and taking thousands from them, but he was also hiding a depraved secret habit, sickening his victims further after his hideous secret was uncovered when his mobile phones were downloaded by specialist officers.“It was never going to end well, and his downfall was inevitable. Whether his other victims come forward with their losses, only time will tell.”Explore more on these topicsCheshireHandbagsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

By 2020-22 that gap had widened, so that it would take 52 years of earnings.Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation and the lead author of the report, said: “Wealth gaps in Britain are now so large that a typical full-time employee saving all their earnings across their entire working life would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder.”The gap between the wealth of the average person and someone in the top 10% was £1m in 2006-08, but had widened to £1.3m in real terms by 2020-22, the foundation finds..Broome added: “These gaps are doubly concerning as wealth mobility in Britain is low – people that start life wealthy tend to stay wealthy, and vice versa.”Despite the wealth gap widening in absolute terms, however, the share of total wealth in the UK held by the richest households – known as “relative wealth inequality” – has been “broadly stable since the 1980s”, the thinktank points out. Over that time, total wealth in the UK surged from three times the annual GDP, to almost 7.5 times.So-called “passive” gains, through rising house prices and changes in pension valuations, were the main drivers of the widening wealth gap since 2010, according to the report.These tended to accrue to older, property-owning households, the research shows – worsening the intergenerational wealth divide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In contrast, the typical family in the highest income quintile saw their liquid savings increase by £4,200”, the report finds.Explore more on these topicsInequalityEconomicsResolution FoundationOffice for National StatisticsHouse pricesThinktanksSavingsnewsShareReuse this content"

InGaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it is the profession’s lowest point since 1939.Some will claim failure is inevitable since this conflict is now so embedded and impervious to compromise that it can only be settled at the barrel of the gun, in essence through the repression or erasure of one side.Yet, however entrenched the mutual hatreds, a consensus is building across the west that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modernIsrael, misread how its government might react to the horror of 7 October – and how that would polarise the west.Indeed, the mea culpas and self-justifications have been streaming out of Joe Biden’s former team. In her book on her doomed bid to become president, Kamala Harris writes: “I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn’t do it: while he could passionately state ‘I am a Zionist’, his remarks about innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced.”She adds that Benjamin Netanyahu never repaid the loyalty that Biden had shown because he wanted Donald Trump in the seat opposite him.View image in fullscreenJoe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in July 2024.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesAt its most generous, the Democrats misread the power dynamics. “We did not act like a superpower,” Andrew Miller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, said recently. “Instead of beginning from the proposition that these were problems we could solve, we persuaded ourselves that there was little we could do to move our regional ally Israel.”Trump did not have that inferiority complex. He used his unpredictability as his greatest diplomatic weapon but, like Biden, his special envoy Steve Witkoff became bogged down in trying to find a formula that guaranteed the release of all the hostages without Israelresuming the fighting, as it did in March this year.As successive variations of the Witkoff proposals emerged, France and Saudi Arabia took matters into their own hands, deciding to use a UN conference on a two-state solution as a vehicle for gripping the diplomacy in a different way. The US monopoly on the peace process was broken and the neglected issue of Palestinian self-rule was finally addressed.The ‘day-after’ planBefore the conference, initially due to be held in June but delayed by a month by Israel’s attack on Iran, Emmanuel Macron extracted a letter from the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, that endorsed a plan for the day after a ceasefire under which Hamas would be disarmed and debarred from holding office and a transitional body of experts would be formed to governPalestine“under the umbrella” of a reformed Palestinian Authority. The notion of reform of the PA, often an empty diplomatic vessel, was this time given specifics, including a commitment by Abbas to much-delayed elections and internal change. An international force would be introduced.Many versions of the “day after” plan for Gaza had been circulating since 2024 – one by American and Israeli experts published by the Wilson Center, another drafted by the Rand Corporation, a set of principles issued by the United Arab Emirates and a plan from Egypt. The Saudi-French plan incorporated many of these ideas into what became the New York declaration, passed by the UN conference in July andendorsed by the UN general assemblyin September, with Israel and the US voting against.View image in fullscreen‘We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards,’ said a European diplomat.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne European diplomat said: “Although there was a lot of media heat about the issue ofrecognising Palestinian statehood, that was not where the serious diplomatic breakthrough was. We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards – and to realise that focusing on a ceasefire on its own would not work.”In reference to the US’s over-reliance on Israeli firepower to impose its will, the diplomat said: “We also convinced them they could not go on rolling the dice and thinking it will come up double six.”Critical to the process was a meeting in the White House in late August where Jared Kushner, Tony Blair and Witkoff convinced Trump thatmass expulsions of Palestiniansfrom Gaza was neither necessary nor wise.View image in fullscreenJared Kushner (left) and Steve Witkoff before a press conference with Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne of those present said: “Trump had no illusions about Netanyahu’s reliability and had invested in the Middle East states. He was persuaded that for states such as Jordan and Egypt the spectre of waves of Palestinian refugees spilling over their borders was a red line. Trump agreed to take mass enforced displacement off the agenda.”The other big message out of the meeting was that for the first time it became feasible to try to merge White House and French thinking. Speaking at Harvard University last month, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “President Trump asked some of his close advisers to go to the Arab countries, to go to France, to go to the UK, to gather all the ideas that all of us have been putting together for months and years for what a day after plan would look like.”The aim of the two-state solution conference and the general assembly vote, Barrot said, was to remove the obstacles to the two-state solution, including by Arab states condemning the 7 October attacks and endorsing the declaration’s exclusion ofHamasfrom Gaza.View image in fullscreenThe French foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot (centre) arrives for a UN summit on Palestinians in New York last month.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images“Until that vote, there was no international condemnation of Hamas, no international call for its disarmament, no international goal for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza and Palestine,” Barrot said. “This is done. We have changed the mindset. Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.”The second obstacle, he explained, was to overcome Arab governments’ reluctance to state publicly that they had a goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.Barrot said the new UN text went further than ever before. “We got them … to say that they aspire not only to have a normal relationship with Israel, but to enter into a common regional architecture in the model of Asean in Asia or OSCE in Europe,” he said. “We got them to say things they never said.”So, contrary to appearance, the weeks and days leading up to the general assembly was about the Arab states reaching out to Israel. Far from being rewarded, Hamas, an opponent of a two-state solution, was being ostracised from political power in Palestine, a fate its battered leadership has reluctantly accepted.The Trump planBut for Israel the New York declaration, with its clear references to a Palestinian state and a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, remained unacceptable. So when Trump revealed his plan to the Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the general assembly, the declaration had become the benchmark against which it was to be judged by the Arab and Muslim states.The Trump plan, largely prepared by Blair and Kushner, was necessarilythin, ambiguousand stripped of a timetable. The Arab states had misgivings, but advocates such as Blair argued that if the plan was more specific it would lose the required broad support and critical momentum. The lack of immediate leaks delighted western diplomats since it suggested the Arab states thought they could work with the plan.But while the Arab states left New York, Netanyahu stayed in New York, holding two lengthy weekend meetings with Witkoff. After Israel’sattack on Hamas negotiatorsin Qatar on 9 September – a personal betrayal of Witkoff and Qatar – Netanyahu was persona non grata in the White House. Yet the Israeli prime minister extracted further concessions.The amnesty to Hamas members was only available to those who handed over weapons in front of international observers and committed to peaceful coexistence. More detail was added about the destruction of Hamas infrastructure. Moreover, the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces was blurred, and by the end the IDF would have to withdraw only to a security buffer zone encompassing more than 17% of Gaza until the strip “is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.View image in fullscreenIsraeli army tanks in front of war-destroyed buildings in Gaza City.Photograph: Jack Guez/EPAThe process for this withdrawal “will be carried out according to criteria, and with a timeframe, to be agreed upon between the IDF, the international stabilisation force, the guarantors and the United States”.After the plan’s publication, Netanyahu in a video message assured his domestic audience that Israel’s red lines were protected: Gaza separated from the West Bank, no return by the PA to Gaza, no path toward a “two-state solution” and no removal of Israel security forces from the majority of the Gaza Strip.In trying to assuage the extremists in his coalition, Netanyahu was also doing all he could to persuade Hamas to reject the plan, so he could pursue the military offensive into Gaza City.An answer from HamasEven though the plan did not have a timeline for when the board of technocrats would hand power to an elected Palestinian government, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt urged Hamas to accept many of the unsatisfactory ambiguities that could be addressed later. The war would end.Diplomats said this message was received best not by the Hamas political wing in Doha but by the Hamas fighters inside Gaza, a new younger cadre steeped in the sacrifices made. With wording crafted by Qatar, the Hamas answer was in effect a “yes, but” that was open to many interpretations. Trump, to Netanyahu’s utter dismay, chose to take the Hamas response as an unqualified “yes”. The key was that Hamas was willing to relinquish its greatest bargaining chip: the remaining hostages.Tahani Mustafa, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that since the 7 October attack Palestinian politics has shifted to a more transactional outlook. “Palestinians are looking to someone that can make life bearable, keep them on their land and improve their living conditions. The very bare minimum is what people are asking for. Most Palestinians on the ground have resigned themselves to their fate.”View image in fullscreenTony Blair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APOn this basis, the technocratic body to be chaired by Trump, but likely to be dominated by Blair with some figures from the Palestinian diaspora, could derive its legitimacy through its effectiveness.Blair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine. One of the body’s first tasks will be to build a relationship with Palestinian politics. Blair has close relations with the elites of the Middle East but none with the street, and he may leave to others such as Egypt the task of mediating an intra-Palestinian dialogue on Palestinian unity, a dialogue led by China, that the ageing and authoritarian PA president has sought to sabotage.If elections do occur as promised, it could produce a change. The last time elections were attempted, in 2021 in the West Bank, the democratic appetite was there with 36 lists formed outside the established factions. The key question is what will happen if the elections produce a result that Blair’s technocratic board do not like.As the Gaza war has continued with ever worsening devastation, Israel’s reputation has been shattered. In the Arab world, Israel is now seen as a greater threat to security than Iran. In the global south it is likened to apartheid South Africa, and across Europe the demonstrations and accusations of genocide continue. Growing majorities of American Jews and Democrats disapprove of Israel’s actions.Robert Malley, a US negotiator at the time of the Oslo accords, has just co-authored a book on the impossibility of rational diplomatic answers to the conflict. He said external would-be peacemakers had been “so focused on whether we can get them to agree on what it would mean if there was a Palestinian state, just words on a piece of paper, without coming to terms with the nature of this conflict, the nature of this beast – which was a historical clash of narratives.“From the Israeli perspective, they won in 1948. They won in 1967. And the Palestinians believe that they were victims of a historic injustice in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians expelled, loss of their land.“And so for us Americans to come in and say, ‘well, let’s just paper over these differences, forget about the right of return, forget about Israeli historic grievances and Palestinian historic grievances, put a bow around it and call this peace’ – that was never going to fly with the parties.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsrael-Gaza: two years onIsraelGazaPalestineHamasUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Graphics byPaul ScrutonandHeidi WilsonTue 7 Oct 2025 06.35 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe devastating war in Gaza has entered its third year, standing as Israel’s longest war since the 1948 conflict that led to the country’s creation.The majority of those killed by Israel’s offensive in the striphave been civilians, and the overall total now exceeds 67,000. Entire families have been wiped out in a single airstrike. Sometimes, onlya single individual, frequently a child, is left alive. There are also nearly 170,000 injured. In all, casualties amount to roughly 10% of Gaza’s pre-war population of 2.3 million.There may well be many more dead uncounted in the rubblethat now covers much of Gaza. Those killed by untreated illnesses, poor nutrition, suicide or other causes linked to the conflict are more numerous still. Thousands of people have simply disappeared – lost, incinerated or blown apart by explosions, or held in secret detention by Israel.Israel has controlled and restricted supplies going into Gaza throughout the conflict but imposeda total blockadeof supplies from March to May 2025, saying that Hamas was stealing assistance to pay for its military operations. Though restrictions were eventually eased amid international outrage,famine was declaredin parts of Gaza in August.Declaration of famine in Gaza lays bare Israel’s disregard for humanitarian dutyRead moreThe impact of Israel’s offensive on Gaza has led toaccusations of genocide, which Israel has denied. In September, independent experts working for the UN high commissioner for human rights said that the death toll and destruction in Gazamet its criteria for a genocide. This, too, was challenged by Israel.The war, triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel on 7 October 2023 which killed approximately 1,200 people and took a further 251 as hostages, has devastated Gaza, in physical and human terms. Almost all Palestinians in the territory have been displaced, usually many times. Entire cities have been reduced to dust and broken concrete. Witnesses of attacks, or victimsof the violencearound some food distribution sites, or medicsin overwhelmed hospitalsdescribe “post-apocalyptic landscapes” or “hell on earth”.Below is a summary of the cost of the war forGazaand its people.Dead and wounded67,074Palestinians killed in Gaza168,716Palestinians injured in GazaMore than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed inside Gaza by Israeli attacks. Most are civilians.At least 20,000 are children– about 2% of Gaza’s child population.More than 168,000 have been wounded, many suffering injuries of a type and scale more usually associatedwith professional soldiers in intense combat, according to one recent medical study.Many other Palestinians have been killed by hunger, lack of shelter and medication, accidents, the rapid spread of infectious diseases and the collapse of the healthcare system. Life expectancy in Gaza may have decreased by up to a half in the first year of the conflict,according to a studyin the respected medical journal the Lancet.Dead and wounded graphicView image in fullscreenRelatives mourn Palestinians killed while waiting for humanitarian aid on 18 August.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsraeli officials have previously questioned the death toll given by the authorities in Gaza, saying that because Hamas controls the government there, Gaza’s health officials cannot provide reliable figures.But in September the former Israeli army commanderHerzi Halevisaid more than 200,000 Palestinians had been killed or injured in the war in Gaza .Leaked Israeli military intelligence dataon casualties until May this year suggested that more than 80% of the dead were civilians. “This isn’t a gentle war. We took the gloves off from the first minute,” Halevi said.Destruction and displacement436,000Homes damaged or destroyed (92% of total)2.1 millionPalestinians displaced in Gaza (95% of the population)Israel’s campaign of intense aerial bombing and deliberate tactic of razing territory its troops have seized has led to 78% of Gaza’s estimated 250,000 buildingsbeing damaged or destroyed, generating 61m tonnes of debris, of which about 15% may be contaminated with asbestos, industrial waste or heavy metals.Before-and-after aerial shots of Gaza.Before and after aerial shots of Gaza.A high-rise building being blown up in September.A high-rise building being blown up in September.More than 80% of Gaza’s territory is estimated to be currently under an Israeli military evacuation order or combat zone, or otherwise barred to Palestinians. Most recently, the Israelioffensive into Gaza City, where large numbers of those displaced from elsewhere were sheltering, forced hundreds of thousands to flee.In all, aid agencies estimate that about 2.1 million people have been displaced, 95% of the population. “This is a traumatic, violent process, often repeated again and again. There are people who have lost absolutely everything,” said James Elder of Unicef last week.Hundreds of thousands of people now live in tent cities and severely overcrowded shelters with poor sanitation andaccess to little clean water, including in al-Mawasi in the south.Al Mawasi satellite image.Currently, 1 million people cannot access six litres of drinking water a day, while 500,000 people exist on less than nine litres, just over a tenth of what was available before the war.Medieval mosques, Ottoman-era markets, churches and ancient sites have all sufferedmassive damage or been entirely destroyed.Schools and education518Schools damaged or destroyed (90% of schools)745,000Children and university-age students out of formal educationSince October 2023, 745,000 students in Gaza have been out of school for more than two academic years, including 88,000 higher education students who have been forced to put their studies on hold.Gaza’s educational infrastructure has beenmore or less destroyed: more than 90% of school buildings, 79% of higher education campuses and 60% of vocational training centres have been damaged or destroyed.Schools run by the Unrwa agency have been converted into emergency shelters. They host large numbers of displaced people and are clearly marked on maps, but many have been bombed by Israel, with sometargeted repeatedly.View image in fullscreenStudents doing their homework amid the rubble of buildings in Khan Younis in September 2024.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael says strikes targeted Hamas fighters, claiming they shelter in the buildings and use civilian residents as human shields.Hospitals and healthcare654Attacks on healthcare facilities during the warMore than 1,700Health workers killedAs of last month, just 14 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were even partly functional. Sixteen field hospitals in southern Gaza set up by NGOs and foreign governments provide some replacement care, but these and remaining facilities are often overwhelmed. Bed occupancy reached 240% capacity in al-Shifa hospital and 300% at al-Ahli hospital, both in northern Gaza, medics there reported in late September.Almost all hospitals have sustained some damage from Israeli strikes and one was entirely demolished by the Israeli military. TheWorld Health Organization reported735 attacks by Israeli forces on healthcare in Gaza from 7 October 2023 to 11 June 2025, killing 917 people and injuring 1,411. Medics and paramedics were killed, injured, detained and tortured by Israeli forces.Hospitals graphicView image in fullscreenA doctor at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City after an airstrike in October 2023.Photograph: Mohammed Saber/EPAMedical officials in Gaza said Israel’s restrictions on medicine entering Gaza meant that manyessential treatmentswere unavailable and equipment unusable, leaving them even less prepared to deal with those injured in the war, or suffering from diseases caused or compounded by lack of shelter, food and clean water.Hunger and aid shortages400Malnutrition-related deathsAccording to the UN,400 malnutrition-related deaths, including those of 101 children, have been documented since the beginning of the conflict, most in recent months. Tens of thousands of children are now on emergency feeding programmes. In August, UN-backed experts declared a famine in parts of Gaza. Aid workers said in October that most pregnant mothers in Gaza were eating one meal a day.Famine deaths graphicIsrael has imposed tight restrictions on aid entering Gaza throughout the conflict, and its destruction of agricultural production inside the territory has led to scarcity. Any improvement during the brief ceasefire from January to March, when restrictions were lifted, was reversed when Israelunilaterally resumed hostilitiesand blocked all supplies for two months until, in mid-May, controls were eased again.The controversial Israel-and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation was set up to hand out food, but this led to more than a thousand deathsunder Israeli fire. Much aid delivered into Gaza has been lootedby gangs and desperate, hungry crowds. The produce and goods now available in markets is unaffordable for most of the population.Footage from a food pointIsrael says it does not limit aid shipments and blamed logistics failures at aid agencies, or Hamas theft of food aid, for any shortages.Environment1.5%Proportion of Gaza cropland that can be farmedSince 2023, the Gaza Strip has lost97% of its tree crops, 95% of its shrubland and 82% of its annual crops, making food production at scale impossible. The destruction will have long-term impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, food security and the health of residents, ecologists and academics say.In August,new UN figuresshowed that only 1.5% of cropland was accessible and suitable for cultivation. Toxic residue from munitions and fires has polluted the soil and water supplies.Crop damage graphicSince October 2023, Mine Action partners have documented 132 explosive ordnance incidents that killed 47 people, including at least 14 children, and injured 249 people, including at least 71 children.“The situation is going from bad to worse. If this continues, it will leave a legacy of environmental destruction that could affect the health and wellbeing of generations of Gaza residents,” said a United Nations report last week."

Now 23, she grew up in this tiny community in Israel’s farthest south-west tip, and its flower-lined paths hold some of her happiest memories.It is also the place whereher parents were murdered by Hamas gunmen on 7 October 2023, and her brother Rotem was badly injured. Their mother, Shachar, used her own body to shield him from the bullets, saving his life in a last act of love.“I do miss Holit. It’s a big question that I ask myself every day, whether I can go back to live there. It seems like I don’t have an answer, and I don’t think I will be able to get one until I try,” she said.View image in fullscreenShir Matias (right) with her sister Shakked and brother Rotem at their former home in the Holit kibbutz before it was knocked down.Photograph: Jude TurgemanThe kibbutz residents were a small, close knit group of about 230 people, ripped apart by the massacre two years ago. Fifteen were killed, including two Thai farm workers, and another six taken hostage. Survivors were all evacuated that same day, when the army arrived in the afternoon.Barred from returning to their homes for nearly two years, most have since been living in hotels and temporary houses. More than 1,000 cows in the kibbutz dairy are the only permanent residents of a place now given over to ghosts and memories, its entrance guarded by a single bored soldier.View image in fullscreenEmpty houses and facilities at the Holit kibbutz.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe playground is covered with two years of dust, paths and patios are overgrown, and the quiet that originally drew residents here is eerily absolute, apart from when Israel bombsGaza. It is so close, little more than 1 mile away, that big explosions have enough force to crack the ceiling plaster and shake the wires loose in the empty homes.Now the government has authorised the community’s return, and together they have set a date of next July, after the Israeli school year ends. For Nir Sultan, whose parents-in-law were also killed here, that feels both too soon and too far away.View image in fullscreenNir Sultan: ‘It seems like a brave thing to do, to return.’Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe attack was the deadliest since Israel was founded, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, including –according to Israeli government data– 39 children. Another 251 were taken hostage, the youngest a nine-month-old baby.“It seems like a brave thing to do, to return,” Sultan said. “On the one hand I don’t know if it’s enough time, on the other hand I want to come back today, I want to be home.”Holit is starting construction of a new kindergarten, intended as a bold vote of confidence that life can return and a tool particularly to draw young families.View image in fullscreenEmpty houses and facilities at Holit.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThey are advertising for new residents, and have already had some interest from people willing to consider moving in despite the tragedy and the terror, or perhaps because of it. “Maybe they understand that if we aren’t here, it will be a problem for Israel,” said Sultan.Originally established in the 1970s as a settlement in the Sinai peninsula when the area was under Israeli occupation, Holit moved to its current location after a peace deal that restored Egyptian control of the Sinai.It is part of a string of communities along the edge of what Israel calls “the Gaza envelope” – because of the way it wraps around the thin strip of Palestinian territory along the coast – that are now grappling with how to rebuild and whether to come home.Founded as part of a state-building project that aimed to contain Gaza by populating its borders, many were rooted in secular, leftwing Zionist tradition. Victims of the 7 October attacks included a large number of peace activists working for coexistence and a Palestinian state.Matias’s parents were among the founders of a bilingual school that taught children in Hebrew and Arabic under the slogan “Jewish-Arab education for equality”.Their neighbour Hayim Katsman, killed protecting another resident, was an academic and activist who spent weekends trying to protect Palestinians in the occupied West Bank from violent settlers.His sibling Noy Katsman has repeatedlypleadedthat his brother’s violent death should not eclipse his life’s work, and the family’s grief should not be used to justify inflicting pain on Palestinians.View image in fullscreenRotem Matias sits in the window of his family home before it is taken down.Photograph: Jude TurgemanOver the last two years in Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 67,000 people, the vast majority of them civilians, and its blockade created a famine. Genocide scholars, rights groups and aUN commission of inquirysay Israel is committing genocide.The attack had a different impact on Sultan, a mother of three who thinks Israel’s war is necessary. She still sometimes feels astonished that her family escaped alive after hours hiding in a room without a lock. Her husband held the door shut as gunmen repeatedly tried to force their way in, and she tried to keep their young boys quiet.“My dream was that Gaza would open up, and there would be peace,” she said. “Now I think only for myself, that I need to save myself and my kids. If I want my kids to grow up properly, I can’t let it happen again. And they (Hamas) said it will happen again.”“Chaim [Hayim] Katsman believed in coexistence, and what did it get him?” she added. “So it’s hard to think differently right now.”The trauma of Holit and other communities attacked on 7 October holds a grim fascination for some Israelis who were isolated from the direct horrors of that day.View image in fullscreenLior Klajman at the Holit kibbutz cowshed, which still operates even with the kibbutz empty.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianSometimes unannounced visitors turn up at the community dairy and ask manager Lior Klajman: “Tell us how you survived,” a brutally casual request to relive a day of intense fear and losses that he finds infuriating and disrespectful.Others have come to wander through survivors’ temporary housing in a nearby kibbutz, treating their upended lives like a visitor attraction, “just walking there with their dog in the afternoon, to look at us like we are in a zoo”, he said.Sultan once snapped at people gathered to watch her do laundry, letting out a loud mock lion’s roar and telling the stunned group: “If you look at me like I am in the zoo, I’ll act like an animal.”Visitors who travelled to this area in order to remember 7 October can do it at the site of the Nova rave, where there is a new access road through land that two years ago was scattered with cars and belongings abandoned in terror, and a parking lot for a steady stream of visitors.View image in fullscreenAn inscription saying ‘After the fall there is spring’ near the demolished Mathias home.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHolit’s residents don’t need a memorial to fix their memories.

It was “as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country”, he said.After highlighting the lack of white people, Jenrick said it was not about “the colour of your skin or your faith” and he wanted people to live alongside each other.David Volante, a shop manager at a pawnbrokers on Soho Road and director at the Soho Road business improvement district (BID), said Jenrick’s comment on not seeing another “white face” was a “highly inaccurate” portrayal of the area.“I’m on [Soho Road] up to 50 hours a week from working and leisure time and there’s countless white faces on the road. As a white British man, I don’t feel under any minority, or under any safety threat to myself at all around here.”View image in fullscreenBusinessperson David Volante (left) pictured with Bob Balu, the chair of the Soho Road business improvement district, says: ‘As a white British man, I don’t feel under any minority.’Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianSteven McLean, 54, who grew up in Handsworth in the 1970s, said the area had got a “lot of bad press over the years – some for good reason, a lot of it for bad reasons”, and described Jenrick’s comments as “purposefully incendiary”.McLean, who was not aware of Jenrick’s comments before being asked, said “we know who that statement is for”, adding: “There’s a lot of sentiment that’s going to be whipped up. I think at best it’s careless.”Maria, 65, who runs Davies’ West Indian Bakery on Soho Road and did not want to share her last name, was also not aware of Jenrick’s comments. When asked about the remarks, Maria said they were not true and her customers were diverse. “We have Chinese, we have white, we have Asians, we have eastern Europeans, we have Africans. I’m African, so it’s very diverse to me.”According toBirminghamcity council, the ethnicity of Handsworth is 25% Pakistani, 23% Indian, 10% Bangladeshi, 16% Black African or Black Caribbean, 10% mixed or other ethnic group and 9% white.0:46Robert Jenrick complains of ‘not seeing another white face’ during Birmingham visit – audioA 23-year-old woman born and raised in Handsworth, who did not want to be named, said the area was “quite nice if you get to know it” adding diverse communities “contribute a lot to this area”.The woman described Jenrick’s remarks as “not great” and said they came from someone who was not born or raised in the area. “They just depict what they see on the outside.”She added: “If you were to come at a specific time, yes there might be more Asian people or more mixed people than white. But sometimes if you come, you might find more white people than there’s mixed people. So it depends what time you come, which area you go to.”View image in fullscreenSteven McLean, who grew up in Handsworth, described Jenrick’s comments as ‘purposefully incendiary.’Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianA spokesperson for Jenrick initially declined to comment on the Guardian’s revelations. But later on Monday, Jenrick defended his comments, saying: “Six separate government reports over 20 years have highlighted the problem of parallel communities and called for a frank and honest conversation about the issue.“The situation is no better today. Unlike other politicians, I won’t shy away from this issue. We have to integrate communities if we are to be a united country.”In the comments, made at the Aldridge-Brownhills Conservative Association dinner on 14 March, Jenrick also said: “I went to Handsworth in Birmingham the other day to do a video on litter and it was absolutely appalling. It’s as close as I’ve come to a slum in this country.”Bob Balu, the chair of the Soho Road BID, who was born in Handsworth and now lives in Wolverhampton, said the description of Handsworth as a “slum” was wrong.“I’d love Robert to come here and sit with us, have a coffee or cup of chai, and tell me exactly what he’s saying” he said, adding: “We’ve got a waiting list of businesses. International businesses want to set up business in this ‘slum’.”View image in fullscreenParminder and Harbinder Bansil think Jenrick may have made the comments to get publicity.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianVolante, who also criticised Jenrick’s description of a “slum” as “ill-informed”, said Jenrick’s comments could have a “massive” impact on businesses in the area.“When people are making accusations and comments like that, it gives people an easy choice to go somewhere else to spend their money. It doesn’t help businesses, it doesn’t help the local community and it’s very damning to everybody.“This is not a no-go zone, this is an area where people walk in harmony on the street, acknowledge each other and get on respectfully. Those kinds of comments are a detriment to people’s livelihoods,” he said.Parminder Bansil, 70, and Harbinder Bansil, 67, whose son lives in Handsworth, said they were hoping to move to the area and did not agree with Jenrick’s comments.Harbinder said she volunteers with the local Gurdwara, adding: “The Gurdwara helps anybody and everybody, whatever colour, whatever age you are.”Parminder added Jenrick may have made the comments to get “publicity”, adding “the more controversial comments they make, the more publicity they’re going to get”.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickBirminghamRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Milei! Milei!” thousands of diehard supporters chanted as the 54-year-old libertarian kicked off a concert at the city’s Movistar Arena – a 15,000-seat venue which has previously hosted rockers including Liam Gallagher, Judas Priest and Megadeth.Milei basked in the adulation, throwing his leather-clad arms into the air, and took a sip of water before proceeding with his nine-track set of mostly 1980s rock anthems. “I’m human,” he told the packed stadium. “It might not seem like it, but I am.”Mileiwon poweralmost two years ago, vowing to save his country’s notoriously haywire economy by “exterminating” inflation and taking a metaphorical chainsaw to state spending. “Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of a tragic era for the world, these elections represent a tipping point in our history,” the Mick Jagger-impersonating crooner-turned-politiciandeclaredas he took office in December 2023.For a while Milei’s ferocious austerity campaign appeared to be working –for some people at least– with the president’s success in taming triple-digit inflation drawing international plaudits.Farage, Trump, Musk: your boy Javier Milei just took one hell of a beating. Why so quiet? | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreDonald Trumpcelebrated Milei’s quest to “Make Argentina Great Again”. The Tory party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said she hoped to become a British version of Argentina’s president. The conservative historian Niall Ferguson flew to Buenos Aires to interview Argentina’s president and celebrate the “stunning recovery” his “shock therapy” had produced.“With his shaggy sideburns and loopy facial expressions, there is more than a hint of the Mad Hatter about him,”Ferguson wrotein July. “[But] Milei is delivering a man-made miracle that should gladden the heart of every classical economist and quicken the pulse of all political libertarians.”In recent weeks, however, the wheels appear to have come off Milei’s revolution. Doubts over his political future have spooked markets and triggered a sharp sell-off of Argentina’s currency, the peso, with the government depleting its scarce international reserves in order to contain that run.In August,Milei was pelted with stonesby protesters amid growing public anger over a corruption scandal involving one of the most powerful people in his administration: his sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei.In September, Milei’s La Libertad Avanza partysuffered a humiliating defeat in the provincial election in Buenos Aires– where nearly 40% of Argentina’s population lives – and there are fears amongMileistasthat their candidates could receive a similar drubbing in nationwide midterms at the end of this month.On Sunday, a close Milei ally, José Luis Espert, was forced to pull out of that election after he was forced to admit that he had received a $200,000 payment from an alleged drug trafficker.“[Milei] is in a deep crisis: of governance, of the presidency itself, of popular support, of his ability to connect with young people,” said Sebastián Lacunza, the journalist who broke that scandal.Lacunza said he believed support was rapidly draining away from Milei as a result of questions over his ethics, as well as the human consequences ofhis drastic spending cuts. “The ‘chainsaw’ cuts have hit sensitive areas: pensioners’ incomes, top public paediatric hospitals, universities and households facing soaring costs for utilities and food.”The crisis is so severe that last month Trump stepped in with an emergency bailout of up to $20bn, with the US president declaring: “We’re backing him 100% – we think he’s doing a fantastic job.”Even Milei loyalists who flocked to Monday’s show admitted Argentina was in dire straits. “The country is a shambles. We’re not going to say it’s great – it’s a shambles,” said Oscar Luis Osorio, a 54-year-old shopkeeper who came dressed as a lion.“But we have to wait,” Osorio added, pointing out that Milei was less than halfway through his four-year term.Emanuel Lacuadra, a 27-year-old gig worker and student, shrugged off the Espert scandal. “I support the government almost unconditionally. There are many in the opposition who will try everything to bring it down, but for my part, I’ll always support it,” Lacuadra said, calling Milei’s presidency “a historic, unique moment – not only for Argentina but for the world”.Analysts paint a far less rosy picture of Milei’s predicament as he nears the start of his third year in power.“I would describe him as a president in economic, political and social default,” said Paola Zuban, a political scientist and co-director of the polling firm Zuban Córdoba.Zuban recalled how Milei won power in 2023 promising not only an economic revolution, but a moral one too, with his pledges to combat deceitful elites he called “la casta” (the caste). That message had been severely undermined by the recent scandals involving his close allies.“With these corruption scandals, that moral bond has been broken. Expectations have fallen, trust has eroded, and that’s what has triggered this major crisis the government is facing today – one I believe it has little chance of recovering from,” Zuban said.Facundo Nejamkis, the director of the consulting firm Opina Argentina, described “a growing dissonance between how the government presents itself and the reality people live”. “The government talked about a ‘miracle’ that no Argentine can see in their daily life,” he added.Nejamkis saw Monday’s concert as an attempt to revive Milei’s faltering movement. But outside the area, even fervent Milei supporters wondered whether it was a wise move, given the headwinds buffeting their cause.“It seems ill-timed, at the very least,” said one prominent pro-Milei activist, who asked not to be named.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Still, his backdrops are fabulous – usually more interesting than his subjectsCharlotte JansenTue 7 Oct 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 19.03 EDTShareAt the entrance to the National Portrait Gallery’s new Cecil Beaton exhibition, there’s a wall-sized reproduction of a 1948 colour transparency, originally printed in Vogue. In it, eight coiffed white women wear elegant evening gowns by designer Charles James, chatting and preening in an 18th-century style French-panelled room. They engage only with each other, uninterested in the camera, looming larger-than-life above us. The effect on the viewer is of being excluded, unseen. This feeling only mounts as you proceed through Cecil Beaton’s Fashionable World, a show that presents the photographer as a sharp-tongued socialite obsessed with high society, beauty – and himself.Beaton’s first exhibition at the NPG was in 1968. It was then the first ever solo show by a photographer at a British museum. Sixteen surviving silver gelatin prints from it are presented in the show’s first room. They are lavish, theatrical portraits of brooding beauties with dark-painted lips, a swansong to the age of elegance.He photographed Greta Garbo dressed like a clown. She thought it was a private shoot, but the picture ended up in VogueBeaton was known as the “King of Vogue” – he worked for the magazine for almost half a century, but was also a very willing subject himself. The exhibition includes an edifying caricature of him by Anthony Wysard and photographs by Dorothy Wilding and Francis Goodman. Each shows his panache as a performer – he never plays the same character twice. As soon as he had the right kit for it, he started to take self-portraits, though you can never be sure which pose represents the real Beaton. The wall text points to a telling diary entry he wrote as a child: “I don’t want people to know me as I really am, but as I am trying and pretending to be.”View image in fullscreenA very willing subject … Cecil Beaton, c 1935.Photograph: The Cecil Beaton Studio Archive,This made him a good fashion photographer, but not a good portraitist. The expressions of his sitters are flat, the poses repetitive. Beaton’s backdrops are often more interesting than his subject – he experiments with foils, fabrics and fresh flowers, adding different transparencies and textures to the image. This understanding of textiles made him a great success as a costume designer, from the clothes he made for his little sister for a ball to his Oscar-winning creations forMy Fair Lady, which end the exhibition.The show includes a segue into a small selection of Beaton’s war photography. His photograph of a three-year-old blitz victim sitting in a hospital, head bandaged and clutching a doll, appeared on the cover of Time magazine and became world-famous. Yet some other pictures seem to aestheticise conflict – soldiers have smouldering stares like models in a fashion shoot. They are shown in a room next to glossy portraits of smiling Royals – another frequent subject.It is uncomfortable to see how narrow Beaton’s idea of beauty was, especially when you remember the notorious incident in which he included an antisemitic slur (so small that a magnifying glass had to be used to see it) in a cartoon he drew for Vogue. I am drawn to a 1929 picture of the Chinese American actor Anna May Wong, in which she poses laconically, while Beaton brings all his romance and photographic technique to the image, to scintillating effect. The portrait stands out for its beauty but also because Wong is the only woman of colour I see in the exhibition, which has more than 200 works. It’s a reflection of the times, but also where Beaton was looking and what he was interested in – white women with classical, slightly masculine Edwardian features. His work wasn’t about representation, but the artificiality of it all becomes wearying.View image in fullscreenEven his wartime soldiers look like fashion models … Aircraft Recognition Room, 1941.Photograph: The Cecil Beaton Studio Studio AOne of Beaton’s first subjects outside his family was the late historian Steven Runciman. They met at Cambridge after Beaton accidentally set fire to a passerby’s straw hat, when he chucked a cigarette out of the window. Beaton described Runciman as “huge and ugly and strong”. But in the picture, he seems pensive, shy, a young man holding a flower. Beaton saw something else in him. It’s one of the few moments of emotional depth in the show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It all gets borderline stalkerish in the scrapbooks he kept on Greta Garbo, with whom he had an on-off romance. He once photographed her dressed like a clown in a ruff – and though she thought it was a private shoot, the picture ended up in Vogue. There seems to have been few limits to what Beaton would do to climb the social ranks – he even tried to have his family home’s postcode changed to W1.It seems difficult to get away from Beaton at the moment. Another show on him atLondon’s Garden Museumhas only recently closed. Fantasy and frolics are fine but A Fashionable World is pat, reinforcing a very English idea of beauty and fashion that now seems constricted and parochial. It might be Beaton’s world, but I’m glad I don’t have to live in it.Cecil Beaton’s Fashionable World is at theNational Portrait Gallery, London, from 9 October to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designCecil BeatonExhibitionsNational Portrait GalleryPhotographyMy Fair LadyreviewsShareReuse this content"

If only it didn’t end in such a cruel way …Jack SealeTue 7 Oct 2025 17.20 EDTShareWith niceness in short global supply, a little bit on TV can go a long way. Reality competitions thrive on it: a large part of the joy of The Great British Bake Off, say, or The Great British Sewing Bee, or the one where people make clay pots, is watching nice people do nice things. Apart from that time when Sky History accidentally let someone with neo-Nazi tattoos on to a woodworking competition and the whole thing had to be binned, the producers of a certain type of reality show are usually pretty good at casting the right type of participant: earnest, self-deprecating, amusingly eccentric.Race Across the World replaced arts and crafts with overseas travel, but it was another show where the pleasantness of the personnel was as important as the activity they did – and the BBC Two hit is a big influence on Channel 4’s new nice-reality effort, Worlds Apart. Another distant starting point, this time Tokyo, is the place where we once again meet pairs of contestants who will work in tandem to try to win a cash prize. The first twist here is that they’re strangers, not friends or relatives. The second is that each duo has a huge age gap: the younger member is mid-20s at most, while the elder is late 60s at least. The young people have never or rarely been abroad, while the older ones’ life situations had made them think they would never globetrot again.View image in fullscreenVal, who hopes this trip will end a spell of feeling ‘down’, with her new teammate Aaron.Photograph: Channel 4As the youngsters are set the preliminary challenge of finding their partners by following cryptic clues through city streets, the stipulation that they can’t be seasoned travellers has one clear benefit: their lack of privilege makes them easy to root for.

Katie, a 21-year-old from Warrington who works with elderly people, could never afford to holiday so far away. Nor could Lawrence, a 24-year-old London office worker who confesses that his days playing truant from school have left him with some catching up to do. The clue that is meant to lead him to 68-year-old Rosie, who is waiting patiently on a park bench within sight of a public toilet, features the phrase “caught short”, which Lawrence has never heard. He wonders if “caught” relates to fishing or tennis. “Every day’s a learning day,” he cheerfully says later, when Rosie explains.Among the representatives of the older generation are divorced 69-year-old Tony, widowed 80-year-old Barbara, and 73-year-old Colin, who describes himself as “a bit of an acquired taste” and is carrying a suitcase that’s so old he has to lift it because it doesn’t have wheels. Val, 71, says she hopes this trip will end a spell of feeling “down”. Their vulnerability makes their delight at meeting a new friend who will benefit from their wisdom all the sweeter. Barbara and Kate gushing over each other’s clothes and makeup like best pals, or Rosie and Lawrence quickly learning how to combine her knowledge with his optimism are scenes of such wholesome purity that you want everyone to succeed in the tasks they’re given.The tasks, however, are where Worlds Apart somewhat falls apart. Each pair has to play a little game that showcases a different part of Tokyo’s culture: distinguishing real sushi from the lifelike plastic models shown in restaurant windows, or working out which of a set of quotes are Buddhist sayings and which are lines from movies. Charlotte, a Swansea 25-year-old whose chattiness has got her into trouble on the checkouts at Asda because talking to customers affects her “scan speed”, is paired with Colin and his ancient suitcase, and asked to decipher emojis that have been arranged to represent common English idioms. Once Colin has explained to Charlotte what an idiom is, they can begin.As a competition, this just isn’t exciting or interesting enough. Clearly, the presence of octogenarians means there can’t be challenges as expansive and energised as travelling hundreds of miles by road, rail and water, as happens on Race Across the World, but these parlour games really are underpowered.But boredom is suddenly replaced by outrage when the scores are revealed, potentially leading to one team being eliminated and causing several contestants to look bereft at the prospect of losing their new companion. It feels cruel to break something as lovely as the bond between a lonely pensioner and a bewildered, disenfranchised young adult – each in their own way excluded from society, but with so much to offer – just because the reality-contest format demands it, especially when the show doesn’t implement that format very effectively anyway. Worlds Apart has something precious at its core but is too contrived to let it blossom. Niceness only gets you so far.Worlds Apart is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hail to a lost era of multiplex entertainmentJordan ProsserTue 7 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 20.29 EDTShareAt the threshold between life and death sits the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra … and at the threshold of many a millennial adolescence (including mine) sits 1999’s The Mummy, a story about a hot lunk (Brendan Fraser) and a sexy nerd (Rachel Weisz) learning first-hand the consequences of expatriating cultural artefacts.A turn-of-the-millennium Spielbergian blockbuster with shades of the superhero craze to come, Stephen Sommers’ desert romp remains dizzyingly fun to this day. Both masterfully well-made and refreshingly horny, it is one of the last great examples of a specific mode of multiplex entertainment now all but lost to the sands of time: the mid-budget action-adventure movie.Eat the rich … before they eat you: in praise of body horror classic SocietyRead moreFor an 11-year-old in 1999, blissfully ignorant about the folly of colonialist fantasy, nothing was more important than the adventure movie – your Mummies and Jumanjis and Jurassic Parks and even, dare I say it, your Wild Wild Wests. These films seemed to mirror coming of age; their characters existed on the knife-edge of discovery. Frightening but never harrowing, libidinous but never obscene, these films promised young audiences a world beyond this one, filled with swashbuckling danger and forbidden sensation. (And all this for seven dollars at the Pacific Six Cinemas at the Tuggeranong Hyperdome.)Universal execs in the early 90s originally sought to update 1932’s seminal The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, as a low-budget horror for the modern era. But the film they ended up greenlighting drew just as much from 60s sword-and-sandal epics and 80s action comedies: one part Cleopatra, two parts Romancing the Stone, with its resurrected antagonist less a lovesick corpse than a bronzed-up Terminator. Sommers handles these tonal shifts flawlessly, from sprawling action set pieces to Buster Keaton-inspired comedy beats to genuinely grisly moments of horror: a particular instance of a scarab beetle crawling under a sidekick’s skin rivals onlyHook’s Boo Boxin my pantheon of childhood traumas.To render its hungry scarabs, biblical plagues and walking dead, The Mummy embraced Industrial Light & Magic’s still-developing CGI technology. And while the effects themselves may look hokey by today’s standards, they still stand out for how thoughtfully they’re integrated with the film’s more tactile elements – its gargantuan handbuilt sets, lavish costumes and gooey prosthetics – without ever subsuming them.View image in fullscreen‘Every character on screen exudes sweaty sexual energy’ – including an ‘oily-pecced Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep himself’, pictured here with Fraser.Photograph: Keith Hamshere/APA climactic sequence of Fraser’s Rick O’Connell taking on a troupe of CGI mummified guards (a clear nod to Ray Harryhausen’sjanky stop-motion skeletons in 1963’s Jason and the Argonauts, and just as impressive to audiences of its day) remains thrilling not because the effects are “believable” but because of how well the digital objects complement the real-world choreography – as opposed to a lone human actor thrust into a green screen void, forced to fight their way out.Also key to The Mummy’s enduring legacy is its status as asacred text of millennial bisexual awakening. From floppy-haired Fraser to smoky-eyed Weisz, from Oded Fehr as a face-tatted desert warrior to an oily-pecced Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep himself (once his skin grows back), every character on screen – regardless of gender or narrative affiliation – exudes sweaty sexual energy. What’s more, there is unfakeable chemistry between the two romantic leads. This may be a film essentially populated by action figures but at least these action figures have genitals under their jodhpurs – as opposed to those in our now-mandatory biannual superhero corporate retreats, whereeveryone is beautiful but no one is horny.no one is “born bi,” you watch The Mummy at a formative age and the whole cast turns you bi— elle 🐉 (@Elle_Enasalin)December 30, 2020Alas, the Mummyverse would quickly fall victim to the same overindulgence that now defines pop culture; trust a studio exec to ignore their own film’s warning about meddling with the dead. 2001’s The Mummy Returns somehow managed to be both too Spielbergian with its grating child sidekick and too Marvelesque with its soupy third-act CGI. 2008’s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor barely bears mentioning, while 2017’s attempted Tom Cruise reboot was so universally loathed that it single-handedly kiboshed the studio’s plans for an MCU-style interconnected Dark Universe.But as a standalone object of weapons-grade entertainment, 1999’s The Mummy remains an oasis in a desert of faceless tentpole film-making: a relic from a time when Hollywood’s biggest hits could pay homage to their past while still breaking new ground.The Mummy is available to stream on Binge and Prime Video in Australia and HBO Max in the US.

So why did the German artist want to postpone his new show?Tue 7 Oct 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareAndreas Gursky started out shooting mostly black and white landscapes on a handheld camera, but in the 1990s he switched, taking the pictures that he has now become famous for. Out went analogue and in came epic panoramas that were digitally stitched together, capturing in intricate detail and colour stock exchanges, factories, Amazon warehouses, 99 cent stores, Olympic skiers and the crowd at a Madonna concert.“My works,” he recalls, “were selling for more and more.” In fact, his rising status in the art world was reflected in his photographs inside Prada and Gucci stores – the former was taken while he was waiting for his wife, who was shopping there. Then, in 2011, Gursky’s 1999 colour photograph Rhein II, a horizontal vista of the river flowing across flat fields near Dusseldorf, stunned auctioneers when it fetched $4.3m (£2.7m), almost double its estimate, making itthe most expensive photograph ever sold. “How do you deal with a thing like that?” he says. Rhein II held that record until 2022, when it was overtaken by Man Ray’s surrealist masterpiece Le Violin d’Ingres, which went for $12.4 million.Angela Merkel didn’t want to be shot from behind. I guess it wasn’t a very charming offerGursky’s huge works are incredibly complex, often taking several years to complete. On average, he finishes three a year. He makes them by taking a series of pictures, sometimes at different locations, then suturing the parts he feels fit together into one single, impossible image. Given their ambition, their complexity and their scale, Gursky’s pictures have been likened to paintings. The scale is crucial: “They’re really done as big as I can,” he says. “You can’t get bigger technically.” People may not realise how much effort goes into making them – does that bother him? He shrugs.View image in fullscreen‘How do you deal with a thing like that?’ … Gursky with Rhein II, then the world’s most expensive photograph.Photograph: Joerg Koch/DDP/AFP/Getty ImagesWe are speaking via Zoom but a week later we meet at White Cube Mason’s Yard in London, where he is installing his new exhibition. There is an entourage of technicians and assistants buzzing around. Although the exhibition includes just 16 pieces, Gursky says: “I don’t think I’ve ever presented such different types of work.”It was all planned this way, though. The show features Gas Cooker, one of his earliest works. Dating from 1980, the shot gives a slightly elevated view of the hob at his student flatshare, its three rings eerily illuminated. Another image shows German activists in trees protesting against the destruction of a village, their sign in German saying: “The view from here is shit.”There’s a new, melancholic image of a glowing steel ingot, a swansong to the Rhine’s precarious steel industry. And then there’s one of Gursky’s first iPhone pictures, a playful diptych of his wife at home adding a block to a tower of Jenga, with a box on her head. In short, this show reveals other sides to the German artist, more tender, intimate and spontaneous – quite a contrast to the distant observer, the mass-scale creator.I was under huge pressure to create for the exhibition – then an image fell into my lapA few months ago, he called gallerist Jay Joplin and asked to postpone the show. “He said, ‘No way, no deal – I’ve given you the best date in the whole year. You have to cope and get it done.’” So he made 10 new pictures for the show. “That’s a lot for the way I work.”For someone who has spent most of his career meticulously constructing images that couldn’t exist, Gursky, now 70, seems to take delight in the simplicity of the iPhone. The exhibition includes several smaller-scale, more diaristic snapshots, from a newborn family member to a folded towel fallen into a bath. Shot from above, the towel seems suspended in space, with bubbles of water around its still folded form. Get up close and you can see the pixels fuzzing at the edges.View image in fullscreenA swansong to industry … a glowing steel ingot in Thyssenkrupp, Duisburg, 2025.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeIt sounds like the kind of thing only a hugely famous artist could get away with. But it underlines what Gursky has always been interested in: how we see the world in photographic fragments. “The towel fell into the bathtub by mistake,” he says. “Underwater, it looked like magical realism. I just loved the way it looked. I was under huge pressure to create for the exhibition, then an image fell into my lap. I pressed click and there it was.”The towel appears next to another new image: a remake of a quintessential work made in 1993. He says the new shot is better. It depicts an apartment building with 1,122 windows in Paris. The new version consists of several pictures taken in winter, meaning the sun wasn’t too glaring and the curtains were mostly open, allowing dozens of tiny vignettes into people’s lives. As you move closer, more and more details emerge – you could spend hours looking at it. But move back and it’s a gorgeously rich abstract expressionist piece, a composition of squares, from black to pastel-coloured.“It’s about the inner life of the building,” he says. “It’s a panopticon of habits, tastes, and how people like to furnish their flats.” It’s also a paradox of an image – the picture gives a view of almost the whole building, which would be impossible to see in reality. It is the result of a series of photographs of segments of the building, shot from the hotel opposite then spliced together.View image in fullscreenShame about the view … protestors in Lüzerath, 2023.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeSide by side, the two pictures show how far-ranging Gursky’s interests and influences are. Another new work is sure to cause a bit of excitement: a picture of a famous English pop star. He won’t reveal who, although they met through Joplin. The musician was a fan of Gursky while the photographer, in turn, had “never heard of him”. Still, they became friends and Gursky accompanied the star on tour. The picture is taken from behind the musician as he performs in a glittering Gucci ensemble. Beyond is the stadium crowd, a sea of shimmering, cheering, screaming faces and iPhones. Gursky once asked Angela Merkel if he could shoot an image from a similar vantage point but the former German chancellor refused. “I guess,” he says, “it wasn’t a very charming offer – to photograph her from behind.”When we speak via Zoom, Gursky remembers an evening he spent in the pub with his then fellow studentThomas Ruff, when both were at the fabled Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. A respected German art dealer walked up to them and declared: “You guys are going to be famous!” Gursky says: “At the time, I couldn’t have imagined I would become an artist and that I would exclusively devote my life to photography.”View image in fullscreenKomori by Gursky, which features in the show.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeGursky speaks from his vast, bright studio in Düsseldorf, where he has been based since those 1980s student days. He shares the building, a former electricity factory, with Ruff, as well as artists Laurenz Berges and Axel Hütte. The building has been transformed over the decades they’ve been there by architectsHerzog & de Meuron, who designed Tate Modern in London. There’s now a gallery there that houses some of Gursky’s art collection. “It’s mostly German artists from the Rhineland area,” he says.Gursky is one of the world’s most feted photographic artists. You could almost say his success seems preordained: his grandfather Hans and his father Willy were both successful commercial photographers who trained him in the techniques of advertising photography from a young age. When he got to art school, he says, “I have to admit there were advantages. I was very familiar with the technique – but it was also an enormous disadvantage, as I was shaped by the aesthetics of advertising photography. I had to lose that along the way, somehow.”At the Kunstakademie, he studied under Bernd Becher, one half of the hugely influentialhusband and wife duocredited with kickstarting the Düsseldorf school of photography – the biggest art movement in Germany since Bauhaus. The Bechers encouraged their students to bring a detached, dispassionate perspective to documentary photography; a bleak view of postwar Germany’s faltering industrial landscapes and architecture.“We worked at their place,” he recalls. “There were only six of us in the class, so it was very intimate and intense.” They taught Gursky and his cohorts “how to see – and you do that best if you concentrate on one subject in depth”. His time with the Bechers “led decisively to me deciding to become an artist – just seeing the way the two of them worked and what could be done with photography.”The White Cube exhibition is a testament to Gursky’s very particular way of seeing: seismographic, at times deadpan, and never short of awe. In a world flooded with thoughtless photographs quickly forgotten, everything hanging in this gallery was made for a reason. “Content plays a big role,” he says. “But it’s only after I have taken a photograph that I really discover what an image is about. I ask myself, ‘Is it relevant for society – or is it just formalism?’” And if it’s the latter, what does he do? “Then I delete it,” he says.Andreas Gursky is atWhite Cube Mason’s Yard, London, from 11 October to 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsAndreas GurskyPhotographyExhibitionsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Were the thieves merely low-level opportunists, or were bigger forces at work?ByPhilip OltermannTue 7 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 11.28 EDTShareOn 16 October 2023, a young man and woman sat down in the back row of the second-floor reading room of the university library of Warsaw, Poland. Their reading cards carried the names Sylvena Hildegard and Marko Oravec. On the desk in front of them were eight books with yellowing pages that they had ordered up from the library’s closed-storage 19th-century collection: rare editions of classic works of poetry, drama and fiction by two greats of the Russian canon,Alexander Pushkinand Nikolai Gogol. They studied the books closely, taking photographs on their phones and measurements with rulers.When the duo did not return from a cigarette break and the invigilators checked their desk, they found that five of the eight books had gone. One of the missing Pushkin works was a narrative poem about the adventures of two outlaws, The Robber Brothers. It was as if the thieves had wanted to send a message.In the days that followed, a more thorough investigation of the library’s stocks revealed that a further 74 books of Russian literature had been stolen in the weeks, or even months, leading up to the final swoop. The thieves had managed to avoid detection by replacing the books they had stolen with what one newspaper described as “high-quality facsimiles” of the originals. They did not have to worry about causing a scene when they left the building. Most books in the Warsaw library have been fitted with a magnetic strip that raises an alarm at the exit unless deactivated. But older books went without this, as an expert had advised that the glue on the magnetic strip could damage the paper.The books’ disappearance made headline news in Poland. “It was like gouging out the crown jewels,” said Hieronim Grala, a former diplomat who helped the university assess the damage. Established in 1817, in a period when Poland was ruled by the Russian tsar, the library collection has been shaped by complex historic ties to Russia. “Those books were given to Poland at very significant historical moments,” said Bartosz Jandy, the Polish chief prosecutor who was tasked with investigating the thefts. “The fact that they are a testimony to Russian imperialism doesn’t mean they don’t belong to our heritage.”The Warsaw book heist was not an isolated incident but one of the final stops on an unprecedented grand tour of bibliophilic crime, which snaked its way from north-east to south-west Europe between spring 2022 and winter 2023. As many as 170 rare Russian books, valued at more than £2.5m, vanished from the shelves of the National Library of Latvia in Riga, two university libraries in Estonia, Vilnius University Library in Lithuania, the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, the National Library of the Czech Republic in Prague, Bibliothèque Diderot in Lyon, the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the University Library of Languages and Civilisations in Paris, the Bibliothèque de Genève in Switzerland, the State Library in Berlin and the Bavarian State Library in Munich. “In terms of scale and sophistication, we have never dealt with anything like this before,” said Laura Bellen of Estonia’s southern district court, one of the first public prosecutors to investigate these thefts. “Libraries just aren’t used to thinking of themselves as targets for major crime.”MapThe thieves’ tactics in each of these cities were broadly the same: two people would use fake identities to order up rare Russian books from the stacks. If they were being watched closely, one would distract the librarians while the other walked out with the books. Their cover stories varied, and they were not always the same two people. In Warsaw they posed as Slovakians, in Helsinki as Poles. In Riga, they claimed to be Ukrainian refugees who wanted to research Russian history. In Paris they were Bulgarians studying “democracy in Russian literature of the 19th century”.As early as the spring of 2022, authorities had begun to suspect that these were not isolated crimes. In December that year, police in Latvia arrested a man whose DNA had been found on books left behind during the theft at the National Library in Riga eight months earlier. The suspect owned library cards from Munich, Vilnius, Paris, Kyiv and Vienna, as well as a collection of library stamps and tools for restoring printed matter, such as a set of needles and spools of thread. Burly and balding, with salt-and-pepper stubble, the man was identified by his passport as Beqa Tsirekidze, a 46-year-old Georgian citizen. Investigators discovered he had a background in antiques dealing and a criminal record for theft. His DNA also matched that found at the scene of the April 2022 book thefts in neighbouring Estonia, where he was extradited and put on trial.Tsirekidze’s arrest was far from the end of the story. During two trials in Tartu and Tallinn in the first half of 2024, he remained tight-lipped about whether anyone had commissioned him to steal books, even though this would have alleviated his sentence. He was given a compound sentence of three and a half years in prison. “I would say it’s rather likely that there is some kind of other force that made him carry out these thefts,” said Bellen. “But we don’t have any evidence of who that may be.”To solve the continent-spanning riddle of the Pushkin heists, a moment of pan-European cooperation was required. In March 2024, the EU crime-fighting agency Eurojust set up a joint investigative team consisting of police from France, Lithuania, Poland and Switzerland. Georgia, which is not formally a member state of the cross-border crime agency but only an “operational partner country”, was invited to join, too.These countries were unified in their determination to crack the crimes, but their working theories weren’t necessarily the same. Were all the thefts masterminded by the same set of people, or were authorities looking at rival gangs, competing with each other for the same prized titles? Above all, there was the uneasy fact of the thefts’ timing. The crimes began two months after Putin had announced the full-scale invasion ofUkrainewith a speech that evoked the “culture and values, experience and traditions of our ancestors”. In the aftermath, relations between Russia and the European Union had reached new levels of hostility. Was this a bunch of small-time criminals making use of lax security, or were investigators looking at something bigger, a state-sponsored Russian exercise in recouping cultural heritage that had been scattered across the continent? “In my opinion,” said Jandy, the Polish prosecutor, “it’s impossible that a group of thieves initiated this action without the involvement of a state.”The common denominator in all the thefts was the work of Alexander Pushkin, the early 19th-century Romantic poet and playwright. Outside Russia, Pushkin is mainly known for two works that inspired operas by Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades. He is otherwise little read. “The problem with Pushkin is that he was mostly a poet, and poetry is very difficult to translate,” says Pierre-Yves Guillemet, a London-based bookseller who specialises in Russian literature.In Russia, on the other hand, Pushkin is regarded as a foundational figure. Over the past two centuries, his ambiguous politics have enabled very different regimes to embrace him. “He was definitely a great patriot, and like nearly his entire aristocratic class, he was a monarchist,” says Andrew Kahn, a professor of Russian literature at the University of Oxford. Yet there was rebellion in Pushkin’s writing, too. In his youth he wrote a poem,Dagger, which celebrated regicide, and he was personal friends with some of the key players in the failed 1825 coup d’etat against the Russian empire.In 1937, Stalin chose to mark the centenary of Pushkin’s death with statues, commemorative exhibitions and plays, and new multilingual anniversary editions of his books. It was, in part, a calculated move to create a unifying figure that the multi-ethnic empire could rally around. Later, in the twilight years of the Soviet Union, dissident writers such as Andrei Sinyavsky tried to wrestle Pushkin back from the hands of the communists, emphasising his sensuality and eroticism over his ideological leanings.View image in fullscreenA defaced monument to Alexander Pushkin in Bahrianyi Park (formerly Pushkin Park) in Kyiv, Ukraine, November 2023.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesIn the 21st century, however, the Russian state has chosen to emphasise his most jingoistic works. Pushkin supported the violent suppression of the November uprising of 1830-31, in which Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Ukrainians revolted against the Russian empire. His poem about the revolt, To the Slanderers of Russia, suggested that the choice for the Slavic peoples was either to merge their streams “into the Russian sea” or simply to “dry up”. In November 2022, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, released avideo of himself recitingTo the Slanderers of Russia, interspersed with images of US president Joe Biden and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Earlier that year, as Russian troops advanced into Ukrainian territory, theyput up placardswith Pushkin’s portrait in towns they captured.Ukrainians who grew up on Russian culture in the post-Soviet era have come to see the veneration of Pushkin as propaganda, and a smokescreen for war crimes. “The world is still so sentimental about Russia’s great cultural heritage,” says Oleksandr Mykhed, a Ukrainian writer and literary scholar. “It makes it so easy for Russians to say: we will kill you and then we will ask for sorrow and forgiveness, and then we will kill another people in another country, but what can you do, our soul is just a mystery.”One of the striking things about the thefts was how straightforward many were. The first “heist” was barely worthy of the name. Between 24 March and 8 April 2022, Beqa Tsirekidze was able to borrow 10 volumes of rare books from the Tallinn University Academic Library, including an 1834 edition of Pushkin’s The History of Pugachev. The only criminal energy required was resisting the urge to return them.In April 2022, Tsirekidze and an accomplice visited the National Library in Riga, Latvia. They were able to order an 1829 edition of Pushkin’s Poltava – worth an estimated €10,000 – to the library’s unsupervised main storage reading room, alongside two other valuable works. To prevent theft, most academic libraries in Europe rely on trackable tags that are typically glued on the inside of a book’s back cover. In Riga, the thieves merely found a quiet corner, scraped off the tags, put the books under their sweaters and walked out.What about the supposed “high quality” of the forgeries some of the thieves left behind? Nick Wilding, a British-born Renaissance historian who is also one of the world’s leading specialists in print forgeries, is sceptical about that description. In 2012, Wilding gained international fame for de-authenticating a copy of Galileo’s Sidereus Nuncius, a treatise that includes the first printed depiction of the moon as seen through a telescope. Its forger, Italian librarian Marino Massimo de Caro, had taken great care: he had made his own paper, then artificially aged it by steaming it in sulphuric acid on a low heat. The only things that aroused Wilding’s suspicion about the book’s authenticity were a minor irregularity in the library stamp and a typographic impossibility. By De Caro’s own account, it took him over a year to make his master forgery.View image in fullscreenA university employee presents a fake copy of an 1822 poemKavkazskiy Plennik: Povest(The Prisoner of the Caucasus) by Alexander Pushkin at the University of Warsaw Library in 2023.Photograph: Wojtek Radwański/AFP/Getty ImagesBy contrast, Wilding reckons that most of the Pushkin and Gogol facsimiles could have easily been made in a day. Photos of a facsimile of one 1802 book show a stark contrast between the pristine paper colour of the title page and the yellowed pages of the rest of the book. To trick overworked librarians at the checkout desk, Wilding believes that the thieves merely copied and pasted a facsimile of a work’s title page into a less valuable 19th-century book, possibly a second edition of the same work. At Tartu University in Estonia, librarians found that Pushkin and Gogol books were forged by simply stuffing pages from 19th-century German books into the original leather or paper bindings. “It’s pretty amateur,” he told me. “I’m not sure forgery is even the right word, they are so bad.”All this left investigators with one central question: were these thefts really the work of a team of criminal masterminds, or just a bunch of chancers grabbing cultural treasures that were there for the taking?After Estonia and Latvia, the thefts moved further north to Finland in spring 2023, and on to Lithuania in May. Then they hit France. In July 2023, 10 books were stolen from the Diderot Library in Lyon, including an early copy of Pushkin’s Boris Godunov worth an estimated €70,000.In Paris, a librarian named Aglaé Achechova noted this development with alarm. Achechova is head of the Russian collection at Paris’s University Library of Languages and Civilisations (Bulac) and in July 2023, she sent an email to her French colleagues. “As a former curator of 18th-19th century books in the Pushkin memorial museum in St Petersburg, I am convinced that this was a commissioned theft,” she wrote. The thieves who stole these books, Achechova believed, must have been hired by a wealthy collector. She warned her colleagues that the collection at their university might be next.Until the Pushkins started to vanish across Europe, the most spectacular book crime of recent times was the so-called“Feltham heist” of 2017, when a gang of Romanians abseiled into a warehouse near Heathrow airport to steal 200 rare books valued at more than £2.5m. Because the gang left behind a considerable number of books, the thieves were initially thought to have been working from a master list provided by a book collector. But by the time of their 2020 trial, this theory had been discarded. “The suspects stole as many books as they could carry, and there was no obvious thought put into selecting one book over another, other than [taking] the ones with ornate fonts,” DI Andy Durham, the lead investigator in the case, told me. The thieves appeared to have struggled to offload their goods, eventually burying their entire haul under the floorboards of a house in the Romanian countryside.Achechova believes the Pushkin thefts were different and that there really was a rogue collector or knowledgable dealer behind them. What convinced her, she said in her email to colleagues, was that all the books that had been stolen up to that point were “legendary items for any serious Russian-speaking bibliophile”.From a collector’s point of view, what makes the stolen Pushkins so alluring is less the ideology contained within their covers than the fact that they were published before the author’s death at the age of 37. (In an echo of his verse novel Eugene Onegin, Pushkin died in a duel with a French officer rumoured to have had an affair with his wife.) The two other authors whose books were second and third on the list of stolen works in 2022 and 2023 were Mikhail Lermontov and Gogol, who lived until just 26 and 42 respectively. Tolstoy, by contrast, died aged 82. “It’s the same logic you have with rock stars: the younger they die, the more valuable they become,” says Guillemet, the bookseller.In the late 2010s, so-called “lifetime editions” of Pushkin sold for remarkable sums. In 2018, an 1829 edition of the narrative poem Poltava went for £32,500 – more than double its estimate – at an auction at Sotheby’s in London. In 2019, a first edition of Eugene Onegin, estimated at £120,000,fetched £467,250at Christie’s. In the wake of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the biggest auction houses in western Europe havestopped working with buyers and sellers in Russia, which has throttled the supply of rare books and further driven up the prices of works that are available.In her email to colleagues, Achechova attached a list of the rarest Pushkin books in Bulac’s own collection. “In a way, we began to wait for the criminals to arrive,” she told me. They did not have to wait long. Three months later, on 9 October 2023, two men claiming to be Bulgarian nationals registered at Bulac and ordered precisely the titles highlighted on Achechova’s list.Unlike at previous libraries, the men found they were only able to look at the Pushkins under the eyes of watchful staff. That evening, Bulac’s management contacted Paris police, but the thieves made their move before the authorities could act. Overnight, they broke one of the street-facing windows with an iron bar and entered the reading room they had visited during the day. Finding that the most valuable books had been locked away in the basement, the thieves left the premises with only a few handfuls of worthless pamphlets. Worse still, in entering through the broken window they had injured themselves and provided detectives with further evidence: the next morning, police found bloodstains on one of the wall racks and on the yellow carpet.A week after the botched attempt in Paris, the final Pushkin thefts in Warsaw took place. And the following month, in November 2023, librarians at the Bavarian State Library in Munich discovered that they, too, had been targeted. Two books by Nikolai Gogol, published during his lifetime, had vanished and been replaced with facsimiles. What was notable about the theft was that the two books were volumes two and three of a four-volume collected works of the writer. The thieves had ordered up and inspected all four volumes but decided to steal only two, further hardening the impression they were ticking off a list.That November, eight months after Eurojust’s joint investigative committee had been formed, it notched up its first success. Mikheil Zamtaradze, a Georgian citizen who had been identified as a suspect in connection with the thefts in Paris and Vilnius, was arrested at Brussels airport and extradited to Lithuania on a European arrest warrant. On 24 April 2024, four further Georgian nationals were arrested in Georgia, followed by a fifth suspect on 16 May.During the interrogation of the suspects in Tbilisi, the investigators achieved a breakthrough. In custody, one suspect confessed that she was one of the pair who had stolen the books in Warsaw. Finally, it seemed, investigators had a source who could shed light on the inner workings of the Pushkin heists.On 21 October 2024, the woman identified on her Warsaw university reading pass as “Sylvena Hildegard” appeared in front of a judge in Tbilisi. Her real name was Ana Gogoladze. The courtroom was packed with spectators, friends and members of her family, and the 23-year-old woman, who had dyed red hair, initially appeared nervous. As she described how she had gone about stealing the books, her voice became calmer.A month before the Warsaw theft, Gogoladze had received a message from her husband, Mate Tsirekidze – the son of Beqa Tsirekidze, the man convicted earlier that year for book thefts in Latvia and Estonia. Gogoladze and Mate had married a few years earlier and become parents, but at the time that Mate contacted her on Telegram, they were on bad terms. She was raising their child as a single mother in Tbilisi, while he was mostly working abroad as a builder. His message contained an unusual proposal: Mate asked if she would accompany him to Poland to steal rare books. Since she needed the money, she begrudgingly agreed.In Tbilisi, Mate’s sister handed them fake IDs and their plane tickets to Warsaw. On arrival, they checked into a guesthouse, and the next day they registered at the library under their fake names. Gogoladze, who has no university education and reads only basic Russian, did not bring any expertise to the job. She told the court that she had only recognised Nikolai Gogol’s name on one of the book’s covers because it reminded her of her own. After the theft, the couple threw away their fake IDs and travelled by taxi to another Polish city whose name Gogoladze could not recall, before moving on to Vienna, where they handed the stolen books to a contact and flew back to Tbilisi.Far from resolving all the questions swirling around the thefts, Gogoladze’s testimony had thrown up numerous new puzzles. If she and Mate had stolen only five books, who took the other 74 books missing from Warsaw? And then there was the fact that when Gogoladze and her husband returned to Tbilisi, her sister-in-law handed them back the five books they had stolen and told them that they were worthless: they were replicas that had already been forged by someone else. It was a crushing blow for Gogoladze. Instead of receiving a handsome reward, she was reimbursed only for her travel expenses. By the end of the year, she and Mate had split up again, this time for good. (In February 2025, Mate, Gogoladze and three other defendants were found guilty of stealing Russian books from libraries in eight EU countries. All were sentenced to several years in prison, with Gogoladze receiving a suspended sentence.)Rather than a coordinated effort by a single gang, Gogoladze’s testimony suggested an alternative possibility: the Pushkin thefts as a Marx Brothers-style farce, in which competing gangs swapped real books with fakes at dizzying speed. According to several sources involved in Eurojust’s joint investigative committee, there was significant disagreement among the national crime agencies looking into the thefts. The Georgian prosecutor was convinced that some of the books that Gogoladze had taken in Warsaw were real, and that her sister-in-law had simply lied to her in order to swindle her out of a reward. The Polish side was not so sure. They believed that the young couple had indeed stolen worthless facsimiles, possibly as a carefully planned attempt to cover the tracks of an earlier heist.View image in fullscreenA book of Alexander Pushkin’s poetry amid debris in a damaged apartment in Donetsk oblast, Ukraine, January 2024.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesConflicts over what may seem like minor details pointed to a broader debate: the more sophisticated the operation, the more plausible the theory that the Russian state had played a role in its facilitation. Prosecutors from EU states became increasingly frustrated with the narrowness of the charges brought by the public prosecutor in Tbilisi – one source told me that more suspects allegedly involved with the thefts should have been charged – as well as the glacial pace of court proceedings, which were slowed down by high-profile trials of pro-European protesters taking place at the same time. Georgia, one prosecutor from a European country told me, was “scared of doing anything that could worsen its relationship with Russia”.The lack of a breakthrough was also testing everyone’s patience. Fourteen months into the investigation, the National Library of the Netherlands belatedly reported that six rare Pushkins had also been stolen in March 2023 from its premises in The Hague, not far from Eurojust’s headquarters. Instead of zeroing in on a mastermind, there was a sense that the scale of the crime they were uncovering was ever-expanding.It was not until April of 2025 that the picture began to become clearer. Mikheil Zamtaradze, the man arrested at Brussels airport in November 2023, appeared in front of a court in Vilnius, Lithuania. He was accused of stealing 17 books, worth more than €600,000, from the city’s university library in May 2023. Zamtaradze, a thick-set 50-year-old Georgian with a high forehead and a chinstrap beard, did not deny stealing the books. He did, however, present the theft as a crime of opportunity. He told the judge he earned an income by buying and then selling old items, and that he had visited the Lithuanian capital with the intention to buy books, not to steal them.Evidence presented in court painted a different picture. From library staff, the judge heard how Zamtaradze had charmed them and how he had moved piles of books between different rooms to confuse the supervisors. Information obtained by French investigators also showcased Zamtaradze’s ingenuity: when visiting the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris later the same year he did so with what appeared to be a broken arm, hiding stolen pages inside his sling. He created basic forgeries by printing copies of the title pages in his hotel room with a colour inkjet printer – so cheap that he threw it away when the cartridge ran out. GPS data from his iPhone showed that Zamtaradze had spent much of 2022 and 2023 jetting across the European continent, visiting not just Lithuania but Poland, Germany, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Ukraine – a remarkable itinerary for a father of five who claimed to be unemployed and on benefits.Zamtaradze presented himself as a lone wolf. In cases where there was a proven personal connection to other suspects, he claimed not to have been in touch with them for years. But booking receipts and CCTV footage showed Zamtaradze had often stayed in the same hotels – sometimes the same hotel rooms – as the other Georgian suspects he claimed to have not been in touch with. One of these, a 45-year-old used car salesman called Robert Tsaturov, was a former acquaintance from military service years, though messages extracted from his phone suggest their relationship wasn’t exactly one of equals. “You’re pissing me off,” Zamtaradze admonished his former comrade in one message; “You’re a good kid,” he praised him in another. “Are you [expletive] blind or just pretending,” reads the transcript of a voice message dated 4 August 2023.One particularly damning exchange fell into the hands of France’s art police unit because Zamtaradze had typed it into his phone right underneath a CCTV camera on the terrace of the François-Mitterrand site of the Bibliothéque nationale de France on 25 October 2023 while on a cigarette break. In it, Zamtaradze appears to be directing Tsaturov to swap out a book with a forgery inside a library: “Act cool and everything will be fine,” he wrote. “No one is following you, it’s just your inner fear. The most important thing is the discreet exchange, everything else is irrelevant.”In June 2025, Zamtaradze was found guilty and sentenced to three years and four months in prison in Lithuania. By the end of the trial, the judge concluded that the accused had not acted alone but operated within “an organised group whose members, having divided roles among themselves, sought to carry out a premeditated plan to steal books and exchange them”. Mikheil Zamtaradze and Beqa Tsirekidze had been the group’s brains, while a host of relatives and old acquaintances acted out their scheme. Within this group, there appeared to have been a degree of coordination but also an element of competition and mutual deception. When interrogated by Polish investigators after the Vilnius trial, Zamtaradze claimed it was he who had stolen the books from the Warsaw library, pipping Mate Tsirekidze and Ana Gogoladze to the post and leaving them to steal worthless forgeries.One larger question remained: on whose orders were the Georgians acting? On this, Zamtaradze was surprisingly forthcoming, though his story sometimes strained credulity. While in Vilnius, he said, he had received a phone call – apparently out of the blue – from a man saved in his phone as “Maxim”. He described the man as a Russian collector and dealer of rare books to whom he had sold antiques in the past. On the phone, Maxim allegedly expressed an interest in old books by Pushkin, and Zamtaradze had sent him photos of the most valuable Pushkins in the Vilnius library. A week later, Maxim sent Zamtaradze 12 forgeries of the same titles via a coach from Minsk, Belarus. These were of considerably higher quality than the amateurish copies that Zamtaradze had manufactured in his hotel room. Zamtaradze claimed that he entered the library, swapped the originals for the fakes, and placed the originals in a parcel on a coach back to Minsk. In return, he claimed to have received cryptocurrency worth $30,000.In court, Zamtaradze gave his buyer’s full name as “Maxim Tsitrin”, though no person with that name is known to operate in the Russian rare books trade. There is, however, a Russian book dealer named Maxim Tsipris, who is executive director of Moscow-based online bookstore Staraya Kniga (“Old Book”). In a2019 interview, Tsipris described “lifetime editions by classic authors” as the “most interesting” items on his shelves. In a phone call, Tsipris confirmed he had received my email outlining the story Zamtaradze had told the court, but failed to take up his right of reply.Whether Tsipris is the buyer of the stolen books is not known – some inside observers of the Russian book trade suggest he is too small a player to orchestrate such a large crime, and speculate that Zamtaradze may have been trying to frame him. It is also possible that there were many different buyers. According to the internet history on his iPhone, Zamtaradze searched for a Russian auction house that specialises in books, Litfund. Its director is Sergey Burmistrov, a bibliophile with impressive contacts in high office: he has previously offered expert consultancy to the Russian ministry of culture and used to run a magazine for book collectors, having been appointed to the role by Mikhail Seslavinsky, the head of the federal agency for press and mass media. After its foundation in 2014, Litfund quickly became a market leader and now operates from offices in Moscow, St Petersburg and Krasnoyarsk. In July 2023, Litfund set a new Russian record for the sale of antique books, when a copy of Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin went under the hammer for 26m rubles (£233,000).Librarians in Warsaw believe that just a few months before this record sale, Litfund also auctioned off Pushkins that had been freshly stolen from their shelves. Checking this claim is not easy, mainly because information about the content of these suspect lots has been scrubbed from the internet. Litfund’s website says the relevant lots have been “moved, deleted or may never have existed”. There is similarly no record of these lots on Bidspirit, an Israel-based web portal that tracks international auction sales. But a snapshot of the catalogue of the sale archived on Wayback Machine shows that on 22 December 2022, Litfund’s St Petersburg house did fetch 12m rubles (£107,000) for “one of the rarest editions” of Pushkin’s poems, which carried a Warsaw University Library stamp on its front page.When I contacted Burmistrov via email to ask whether Litfund had sold stolen editions of Pushkin, he told me: “We do not sell any books that carry on their pages any stamps or marks indicating their belonging to any existing state libraries, and our experts are very careful about it; we work in accordance with existing Russian laws.” Yet on 20 April 2023, Litfund sold another edition of Pushkin’s poems, this one for 2.6m rubles (£23,000). And a screenshot of the picture in Litfund’s catalogue, taken by Warsaw librarians before it was scrubbed from the web, once again shows a Warsaw University Library stamp on the first page, as well as imperfections that the librarians say were distinct to the copy held by them. Burmistrov did not respond when I put these allegations to him in an email.The mysterious novelist who foresaw Putin’s Russia – and then came to symbolise its moral decayRead moreEven if these books were indeed sold through Litfund, this does not prove that the auction house commissioned their theft. Meanwhile, the idea that the Kremlin coordinated the repatriation of valuable cultural heritage remains extremely speculative. The apparent unwillingness of Russian authorities or private companies such as Litfund to aid in the European investigation, however, suggests they are at the very least comfortable with the current outcome. Of the approximately 170 books that have gone missing, none of the originals have been recovered. “I don’t have any hope we will get them back in the near future,” said Jandy, the Polish prosecutor. “That would need cooperation with Russia, and while we’re almost at war that’s impossible.”In an article for the Russian edition of Forbes magazine published in 2024, Burmistrov waved off the allegation that the Pushkin thefts could be traced to Russia or were even part of “a special operation to export Russian books from Europe”. But his article strikes a bullish note. European libraries did not do as much to protect these valuable literary works as their Russian counterparts, he claimed – a result of a lack of interest in Russian culture, owing to geopolitical tensions. That common criminals were able get their hands on lifetime-edition Pushkins in the first place, Burmistrov seemed to imply, was above all a sign of European weakness.Additional reporting for this piece by Natalia Jalaghonia and Ada PetriczkoListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.This piece was amended on 7 October 2025 to replace an image which incorrectly identified a fake volume of Pushkin poetry.

I hope they draw strength from each otherTue 7 Oct 2025 07.06 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 07.47 EDTShareIt’s amazing how much of my life has been shaped by Crumpsall when I think about it. Which I hadn’t until last Thursday,and the horrific attack on the Heaton Park synagogue.Crumpsallis a small area of north Manchester, 1.2 sq miles with a population of 18,000. When I became seriously ill at the age of nine I was initially taken to Crumpsall hospital. When I finally went back to a special school two years later, it was Crumpsall Open Air; when I went to synagogue, it was Higher Crumpsall.For many years, I took Crumpsall for granted at best, or dismissed it. It was associated with some of the most painful parts of my life (illness) and my least favourite (religion). I preferred to talk about Cheetham Hill, less than two miles away, because it seemed cooler and more secular, though in reality it was often impossible to separate the two neighbouring areas. Ironically, and stupidly, I also preferred Cheetham Hill because it seemed more street; more dangerous.I moved away from Manchester to university in Leeds and then to London decades ago. My parents continued living in a middle-class Jewish suburb calledBroughton Park, within a mile of where they had both grown up. It seemed suffocatingly insular to me. And then when my sister and I moved away, they downsized to a home a couple of roads away. When Dad died nearly 20 years ago, Mum stayed there in her tiny house in her tiny close.For a long time I couldn’t bear going there. It felt so claustrophobic, physically and socially. I always wondered why she stayed there. However much I loved her (and believe me I adored her), I was snobbish about where she lived, and thought she deserved a bigger, better world. She was a fish out of water in the close – an observant but largely secular Jew (if that’s not a contradiction) living among a largely Hassidic community. The area had become more and more religious over the decades –or as we Jews called it, frummer and frummer.In a time of hate and rancour, two Jews sought to pray – and were killed. Let Manchester be a turning point | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreBut what did I know about smallness and insularity? In the final few years of Mum’s life, I spent more and more time in the house, both with her and without her. When she was in hospital with various ailments, I often stayed there alone while visiting her. And when she was back home recovering, I stayed there because I wanted to be with her.I began to love both the house and the community. Or should I say communities. In the decades I’d been away, more and more Muslims had moved into Crumpsall and Cheetham Hill. They did not displace Jews, they lived largely separate lives, peacefully side by side. It wasn’t just different religions, it was different degrees of religion. So ultra-frum Jews lived along frum and not-so frum Jews, and likewise ultra-frum Muslims lived alongside frum and not-so frum Muslims. Rainbows within rainbows. Far from being the shtetl that my parents’ generation thought it was, Crumpsall/Cheetham Hill was fantastically, cinematically diverse. (It really would be a wonderful location for a movie.)Of the18,000 people who live in Crumpsall, just under 10,000 are Muslim, 1,000 are Jewish and 4,000 are Christian. Inthe 2021 census, 0.5% of the English and Welsh population identified as Jewish, while 6.5% identified as Muslim. So both the Jewish and Muslims populations of Crumpsall are roughly 10 times the national average. Alongside the 4,600 residents born in the Middle East and Asia (roughly 25%), more than 1,000 came from Africa. Affluent areas bordered on some of the most impoverished in the country.There’s a Tesco about five minutes’ walk away from Mum’s old house. It’s huge and I’ve never seen a supermarket that caters for so many cultures. Mum used to wonder why I spent so much time there, or wandering along Cheetham Hill. I told her I found it inspirational – all classes, religions and races going about their business under the one grey sky. I couldn’t get over my belated discovery – that the place I’d dismissed as parochial was one of the greatest melting pots on the planet.And, five days after the terror attack, it still is. While politicians and men of God and populist journalists try to sow division in Crumpsall, while they tell us that the attack was an inevitable result of the British government’s recognition of Palestine as a state, or its refusal to clamp down on demonstrations about the genocide in Gaza, or its failure to police synagogues, it’s important to remember that this grotesque attack was an outlier. It was the actions of a single man (though others have been arrested in connection with the incident), not one community waging war on another as some would have us believe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the morning of 7 October 2023, I was sitting on a train with my son and husband on our much anticipated way to pick up a new puppy. Life seemed predictable enough.I open my phone and see that something is happening on the Gaza-Israel border. I call my mum as usual, waiting to hear her cheery, relaxed voice telling me that she is in the safe room with Dad, telling me there is nothing to worry about. She doesn’t answer. Neither does my dad. I look again at the news feed. I call my brother and he answers. His voice is so different, altered, that I know already, before he tells me, that the worst has happened. “Terrorists broke into the kibbutz,” he says. “Dad said in his last call that he can hear Arabic. Soon after that, we lost him.”I have seen so many people on the news whose life was upended. Their eyes letting you know they have not yet understood what they have lost. Now it is me, us. The flood is in full motion, and the debris has yet to settle. Maybe everything will be OK in a moment, maybe the damage can be contained.My son is looking at me above his laptop. I move to a different seat so I can call people. By the time we arrive in York I will see the brutal execution of my childhood carer Bracha Levinson, now almost 80 years old, as it was livestreamed on her Facebook page by the terrorists who seized her house. Then I see the reporter Muthana Al-Najjarcovering the Hamas takeover of Nir Oz(I still cannot believe that a journalist was attached to the terrorists, his coverage then legitimised, quoted and shown by major media outlets), standing 100 metres from my parents’ home saying “we were able to enter a kibbutz; the most important kibbutz of the occupation”. I recognise the turn in the road and the lamp-post. Around him are armed terrorists. There is the sound of fire; on the screen, the mood is of ecstasy.I remember thinking: “Not one of our loved ones will survive.” At some point I saw the footage from the terrorists’ camera showing fire bursting from the windows of our home. Even so, days later I will still not believe that the house was burned down. Not until my brothers send me images and footage.By the time we reached York, I called the dog breeder to say I would not be coming for the puppy. I said: “A war has started. My parents are probably dead. My community has been taken over by terrorists.”I remember sitting on the train home, trying to contact people and find out where my friends and family were, while also trying to moderate what my son was seeing and being told. The images of that day were beyond anything any of us could have imagined. Our neighbour’s 12-year-old son, Erez, being taken by several terrorists; my maths teacher, Margalit Moses, driven on a golf cart in the direction of Gaza.People were sending Telegram videos that seemed impossible. One of my mother’s friends, 86-year-old Yaffa Adar, being taken to Gaza, also on a golf cart. A video – also taken by Al-Najjar – of my friend’s daughter Shiri Bibas and her two little sons, with whom I had played a couple of months previously, being rounded up by several armed terrorists, the fear in her eyes paralysing. I think those images were designed to break and terrorise those of us who were not there.It seemed to take for ever for the Israeli army to arrive. Then began the agonising wait for information. Later in the afternoon there came a single image of a group of survivors. My mother and father were not in it. A message came from my sister-in-law: they could not find my parents.For days and weeks afterward, as members of the community I grew up in helped forensic teams collect and identify the bodies, we scoured the internet for traces of our loved ones. We saw torture and mutilation; we saw the horrified faces of those we loved. We never found any footage of my father; we have no visual clue to what he thought, felt, experienced.Over the following days, the picture slowly became clearer. My elderly parents, Yocheved and Oded Lifschitz, were taken hostage from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz with 74 other members of our community. My father was 83, my mother 85. In the chaos and terror of that day, one in four members of our small community was murdered or abducted. Seventeen days later, my mother emerged fromHamascaptivity. Before being taken away by the Red Cross, she turned back and shook the hand of her captor. “Shalom,” she said. The image was broadcast around the world: a simple, human gesture in the midst of unimaginable horror. Five hundred and two days later, my father’s remains were returned. He was killed in Khan Younis, Gaza, just two miles from our home.These events and their mediation through the footage taken by the Hamas terrorists that day terrorise me and have inflicted a deep wound. All that has taken place in the two years since, our desperate campaign to save our hostages, my father’s horrific end,the war, the devastation of Gaza, has compounded it. Both my parents were peace activists all their lives. My mum still is, as are most of my family. We know that hate and revenge cannot bring even a momentary relief from the pain.I am writing this through my tears. As time passes, talking about the events become harder, not easier. The children of my friends are still held hostage and the weight of what followed is heavy. To myself I call dwelling in what happened “swimming in the trauma”. We are used to telling the story in order to campaign for the release of the hostages, mourning is a privilege we cannot afford,and two years on, our campaign continues.Not one word of this is written as justification for the war between the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas. I have been consistently against it from the beginning. The people of Gaza have suffered beyond imagination. I am horrified by the decisions of the Israeli government, but I am also insistent that Hamas is not some benign agent of resistance. Because I know what they did that day. Hamas betrayed its own people – they ensured the suffering of them along with the suffering of us, who lost so much because of its murderous ideology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My UK community is facing unprecedented antisemitism, and my community in Israel has fought its government for two years and has been betrayed again and again. Across the fields from my destroyed kibbutz, the devastation in Gaza is visible and visceral. It horrifies me. At the same time, the moral carte blanche so many former friends and colleagues seem to afford Hamas and Islamic Jihad makes me despair.Yet, I am humbled and encouraged by the faith in humanity I still see in freed hostages like my mum, and in my friend Galit Dan, whose daughter Noya and mother Carmela were brutally murdered holding each other. I cherish new and old friendships across the divide with Palestinians who, like me, want a long-term agreement. They are able to show empathy towards me in a way many British self-proclaimed friends of the Palestinians cannot. For too many of the latter, it seems a zero-sum game in which one side should win and the other must lose. For us, the wish is for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians .In the past two years, hate seems to be in fashion. I hear death chants at Glastonbury and see posters saying “destroy Israel” at San Fermín. From Hamas to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, people are shouting, “May your village burn.” And I think: my village did burn. Are these chants the best we can wish for one another?Then there is my mother’s handshake, that moment of impossible grace, that instinct for making peace that has touched so many. There are many of us that long to build bridges. It takes two to make peace, my mum reminds me time and again. We made peace with the Germans, she adds and we will make peace with the Palestinians. Sometimes I find it hard to believe her. The algorithm is so set on rewarding our craving for hate. Compassion seems slippery in comparison.Today marks two years since that day. Sixty-four members of my kibbutz were murdered then or afterwards, in captivity. Forty-eight hostages remain in a devastated Gaza. We are told there may soon be a deal. I cannot bring myself to imagine it. Too many times we have been told it was about to happen, only for hope to dissolve again. May we find in ourselves the strength to end this war for all our sakes.Sharone Lifschitz is a London based film-maker and academic, originally from Kibbutz Nir Oz, whose parents were taken hostage on 7 OctoberDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Thou art more sappy and more decadent. Rough winds do shake … OK, enough of that. I apologise for the cod Shakespeare but I just couldn’t help myself. Taylor Swift mania is at fever pitch and I have found myself swept up in the chatter about the lyrics from her new album,The Life of a Showgirl.Swift has routinely been described as a lyrical genius, and not just by 11-year-olds. Sir Jonathan Bate, a Shakespeare scholar, once called her a “literary giant” and used her work as a teaching aid. On her latest album the billionaire liberally sprinkles in plenty of Shakespeare references, but what’s really got people talking are the (supposed) allusions to fiance Travis Kelce’s “magic wand”. If you’re not interested in a blow-by-blow account of the magic, I’d advise you to do a vanishing act because I’m about to quote from Swift’s song Wood.“Forgive me, it sounds cocky,” the modern-day Shagspeare writes. “Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see / His love was the key that opened my thighs.” Swift then references Kelce’s podcast, which is called New Heights, singing: “New Heightsof manhood, I ain’t gotta knock on wood.” In case you weren’t quite catching her drift, there’s also a reference to a “hard rock”.None of this is remotely risque in the grand scheme of things, but there’s something about Swift’s squeaky-clean brand that makes it all feel a bit ick. I’m not being prejudiced, OK? I don’t care what a consenting adult does with another consenting adult in private. Love is love! But, my God, I wish some of these heterosexuals would stop shoving their lifestyles in our faces.To be fair, while Wood may not be Swift’s strongest work (she has some very strong work!) there is stiff competition when it comes to cringe lyrics. Forgive me, it sounds cocky, but I’m going to take it upon myself to rate some of the most embarrassing lyrics of all timeright here, right now.The first category is songs with factual errors that even a slightly stupid child could spot. Top prize here goes to Jake Paul, an American YouTube personality who also dabbles in boxing and rap. In 2017 he came out with a song calledIt’s Everyday Bro, which featured the memorable line: “England is my city.” The weirdest thing about this is that even though Paul has admitted hewrote the line, Nick Crompton, a British influencer who presumably has a passing understanding of his country’s geography, is the one who sang it. Crompton then rhymed city with “litty” and wasnever heard fromagain.Category two: lyrics that sound as if they were hallucinated by ChatGPT. The Killers obviously get a mention, with their famous line: “Are we human, or are we dancer?” But the winner isDes’ree’s Life(1998), which contains the immortal lines: “I don’t want to see a ghost, It’s the sight that I fear most, I’d rather have a piece of toast, and watch the evening news.” This segment has been widely panned but – like all great art – it makes you think, right? With the news the way it is, I think I’d take the ghost sighting myself right now.Next up we have budget brags. I’ve invented this category entirely forTinie Tempahand his 2010 hit Pass Out, where he sings: “I live a very, very, very wild lifestyle … I’ve got so many clothes I keep some in my aunt’s house.” So bathetic, it’s beautiful. That song also includes the line: “I’ve been Southampton, but I’ve never been to Scunthorpe.” It’s hard to explain the splendour of that to an American, but I’ve tried.Last up: unnecessary mentions of cancer in otherwise upbeat techno bops. Yep, it’s Snap!’s classic song Rhythm Is a Dancer coming in top here, with the line: “I’m serious as cancer when I say, ‘Rhythm is a dancer.’” Surely it wasn’t that hard to find another rhyme, was it? Anyway, time to wrap this up with a line from my forthcoming studio album, The Life of a Freelance Writer: “I’m as urgent as a rash when I say I have to dash.”Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then came a devastating textRanjana SrivastavaMisfortunes shouldn’t have to compete to be meaningful but a combination that fills me with dread is cancer and mental illnessTue 7 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 17.57 EDTShare“So, what do I say when they call me for surgery?”“Well, that shouldn’t happen because I will talk to them.”“But if they do?”“Don’t attend the appointment.”“Just like that?”“Yes, you wouldn’t recover well from a major operation.”“I agree, doc.”My patient, in her 60s, has two separate cancers, neither curable, both life-threatening. Keeping her well is a balancing act, hence my advice to avoid operating on one cancer at the cost of withholding treatment for the other. She also has long-term depression and has dependant relatives who are also unwell and never come with her.Misfortunes shouldn’t have to compete to be meaningful but a combination that fills me with dread is cancer and untreated mental illness.Cancer attracts significant government and philanthropic money, public sympathy and a support network deep and wide. When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, there is a clear pathway of care even though the road can be unnecessarily bumpy. Between the researchers who come up with discoveries and clinicians who use them on patients are any number of people who enrich the ecosystem: nurses, social workers, allied health and volunteers. Just last week I shared my umbrella with an octogenarian who has sat with inpatients every week for 20 years.Mental illness is the poor cousin to physical conditions. Although it is the subject of greater awareness and increased funding, as they say, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. It is difficult for people to access comprehensive care and practically impossible to receive continuity of care, arguably the most important part of recovery. In an excellent public hospital system in so many ways, I find the gap in outpatient care and support services for mental illness incomprehensible.Why do the children of elderly patients stay away? Loneliness makes them get sicker and stay sicker for longer | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThis leaves my (already disadvantaged) patients with a dual diagnosis in the invidious position of receiving the same treatment as a prince for one illness and a pauper for the other.Having emailed the surgeon and received an immediate acknowledgment, I turn to my patient.“Now that surgery is off the table, let’s talk about the rest. You need radiation for a growing lump. For this, we need to pause your other therapy.”Sensing her hesitation, I reassure her that I will personally clarify things with the many people peripherally involved in her care before consolidating her visits to one clinic and one team. At some point, as I am juggling typing and talking, she asks what “all this” means but with no time left to ascertain what she really means, I say something anodyne. She thanks me graciously and leaves.I feel self-satisfied, even a little smug at how much was achieved in our allocated 20 minutes which became 40.She had avoided major surgery that might well have proved fatal. The radiation oncologist had issued her an urgent appointment. And she had met a specialised cancer nurse who would be an ongoing help.If I had to rank the patients I helped on the day, I would put her at the top. So, the blow is especially devastating when, just hours later, I receive a text from the clerical staff.“The patient is so upset that she has asked to cancel all her appointments.”My only possible conclusion is that the patient is upset with me.An explanatory email from the patient follows. “I have nothing against the doctors, but everything is too much, and I just want to be left alone.” This only exacerbates my guilt.Then, this text from a colleague who has intuited my alarm. “I guess we will have to wait until she has a crisis.”An avoidable crisis is what every oncologist desperately works to avoid, so the patient’s decision to opt out of treatment right after meeting me strikes me as a personal failure.Thankfully, I suppress the instinct to call her. The last thing an overwrought patient needs is to be browbeaten into submission, even if it is to protect her own health.I wonder if I could have taken things even more slowly (and kept other sick patients waiting) and been more attuned to her emotions (at no additional cost).And I regret that my fervour for treating her cancer got the better of my duty to protect her mental health. But I can’t help thinking that what brought her undone was the cognitive overload of my consultation layered on top of brittle mental health never adequately addressed.When someone mentally unwell is diagnosed with a physical illness, mental healthcare should be expanded; instead, vulnerable people just grow more vulnerable.I am an oncologist. Please don’t ask me to write a business case | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreEveryone I know struggles to access timely psychological and psychiatric assistance. But in a cancer clinic where there is also a race against time, the practical reality is that people give up – both doctors and patients. If one would not expect a mental health professional to treat cancer, shouldn’t the reverse also apply?This is why every public hospital cancer service would be enriched by an embedded counsellor or psychologist. Most patients would be well served, with only those needing step-up care referred to a dedicated psychiatrist for periodic guidance. Given the ubiquity of mental illness and its many intersections with cancer, this would be money well spent.I confess my problem to a nurse who gives it a day before contacting the patient. I hate to ask how much listening and understanding it took to get there but have never been so relieved to receive a simple text.“Just confirming your patient has agreed to attend all her appointments.”Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

It won’t come from Badenoch – it may come from a new generation of one-nationersTue 7 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 09.21 EDTShareBritain needs the Conservative party. That’s a line I never expected to write. For most of my life under their fiefdom, the “natural party of government” has commanded the media, business and political donations. It has presided, especially since the 1980s, over capital supremacy at the expense of labour, sky-high inequality, public service degradation and me-first individualism.So it should be a joy to read its obituary everywhere, as it apparently faces “oblivion”, “the abyss” and “extinction”. The prospect of Britain without a Tory party is hard to grasp. But we may miss them if they are replaced with something worse. The next iteration of the right risks being the Trumpist, foreigner-persecuting world of Nigel Farage andTommy Robinson. Kemi Badenoch’s opening conference speech walked her party further along that plank: mimicking his policies, she makes Faragism respectable, a small step for Danny Kruger defectors.Polling at 16%, its membership has fallen below the soaring Greens, suggests Prof Tim Bale, expert on conservatism. Tory voters under 50 are rarer than red squirrels, less educated older voters their last domain, says Bale. Tories, in one form or another, have never placed less than second in a parliamentary election since the reign of William of Orange. No wonder their demise feels so astonishing.They could still save their skin, butBadenoch chooses the annihilation path. She dives after Robert Jenrick, who apes Reform UK. No centre-right parties chasing after far-right populists have ever succeeded, warns Prof Robert Ford, a political scientist at Manchester University. None. They get devoured by those they mimic. Committing to leaving the European convention on human rights and abolishing the Climate Change Act, she actively repels lost Tory voters. “She swims against the tide of opinion,” warns Bale. Why? She is attempting to woo the traditional Tory media – the Sun, Telegraph, Mail, Express – as they shift towards Reform.She ignores the more than a third of remainers who used to be Tories, horrified by her Brexit reprise in leaving the ECHR: it risks ripping up the EU trade deal and Good Friday agreement, deepening the defence and political rift with Europe. Same story on abolishing the Climate Change Act, with its net zero target, enacted by Theresa May,who is appalledat Badenoch’s “catastrophic mistake”. A majority of 2024 Tories worry about the climate. An alliance with Reform might save some Tory seats, but delivering a Reform-led government would finish off her party. Here’s a problem: if she increases the Tory vote with a few points reclaimed from Reform, that now helps Labour.She ends any pretence of a broad church, more a one-pew confessional. An immigration“removals force”, modeled on Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), would seize 150,000 people a year, including those with decades of indefinite right to remain. Even supporters would be shocked to see people who have been legally residing for years in their neighbourhood or workplace – the corner-shop owner or GP nurse – dragged away by force.What a curiosity to watch this self-destruction. What began with Brexit infiltrators, John Major’s “bastards” taking over the party, ends with its remnants becoming more extreme. Anyone (but them) can see the gaping vacancy in British politics where traditional conservatism used to be. That yawning space belongs to one-nationers – moderate, socially liberal, pro-business, pro-Europe, pro-competence, aiming at low taxes and a smaller state, but only where pragmatically possible. Where are they now? Outside active politics: the expelled Dominic Grieve stays out of the party, the expelled David Gaukehas just rejoined, suspecting the computer accepted him unknowingly. Inside, the MP Karen Bradley is one who speaks openly to me of the need for that “grownup” party of old.Michael Heseltine shows the Tories’ theirmoral duty to fight off Faragewith a rallying roar in the Observer: “The rightwing equivalents to the fascists of the 1930s are back on the march.” And later, “to describe [asylum seekers] as thieves or rapists … encourages the worst sort of prejudice.” He excoriates leaving the ECHR and abandoning climate change laws. But he’s still a Tory, with “no faith” in Labour’s ability to rebuild the economy. “We must make clear that we will never have any part in the populist extremism of Nigel Farage.” Badenoch only attacks Reform’s incompetence, drawing no moral red lines.Some one-nationers survive inside this regime, keeping their heads down. I talked to a few, who don’t want to be quoted: Badenoch banned all sectarian groups. The Tory Reform Group exists, just; One Nation hardly breathes. The groupNext Gen Toriesare the young ones tugging centre-wards, demanding an increase in housebuilding, championed byDavid Willetts, whose pioneering book The Pinchaccuses the old of stealing the futures of the young. But bare-knuckle fighting was never in One Nation’s DNA: it should be now.For a pin-prick of light, meet Cody Butler, a possible signpost. A 20-year-old student, he has just formed the One Nation Conservative Network. Not one of those camp young fogeys with a kitsch obsession with the Iron Lady, he’s well versed in Tory history, seeking a return to Macmillanism, marking Thatcher as the point when it all went wrong. He’s the right age to help shape a credible revival a decade ahead. What would it take?No point in a new leader without a turn to Heseltinian conservatism to fight off Farage, and Tommy Robinson thuggery. Oppositions do influence governments: no sooner had Starmer raised spirits with his moral indignation for “the battle for the country’s soul” than his home secretary clamped down on migrants with leave to remain in a Badenoch-lite style. A better brand of conservatism would do the country good; the alternative is terrifying. But it may be too late and the party too far gone, about to be eaten alive by Farage.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochReform UKConservative conferenceTommy RobinsonLabourMichael HeseltinecommentShareReuse this content"

What took us so long?Tue 7 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 13.39 EDTShareAcouple of weeks ago, I got an email about a press trip I would never countenance. It was long haul and it was about fitness, so it would have involved a lot of exercise and early nights. Even if I enjoyed those things, I wouldn’t have been desperate to spend a week with other people who enjoyed them. But even as I was hitting delete, I started to wonder what that would actually be like: being somewhere different, without anyone to please except myself, without anything to do except exactly what I wanted. Plainly, it would be amazing. So I said “yes” and it turned out they meant the other Zoe Williams, the one who is a doctor and used to be a Gladiator, and is incredibly fit already, and yes, in retrospect, that should have been obvious all along.So, without meaning to and without going anywhere, I’ve arrived in the fastest-growing travel demographic: thefemale solo traveller, aged 45 to 60. One tour operator, Jules Verne, said nearly half (46%) of their bookings are now people travelling alone, and 70% of those are women. They have families, they have busy social lives, they have partners, their world is absolutely lousy with people theycouldgo on holiday with – and that’s why they (we) need a holiday on their own.The more adventurous the travel, the more people are doing it alone. People are big into hiking, cycling, kayaking, all the things that couples are least likely to be aligned on in their enthusiasm. If anyone is also sick of dragging teenagers to the wonders of the world, just to watch them be on their phones and field questions such as “how much longer do we have to be here?”, they are too discreet to mention it.The real puzzle is why it’s taken so long to get here. My stepmother, who is completely modern in every way, would get arrested before she’d go into a Belgian restaurant on her own, and even though I mock her for this constantly, I must have had a vestige of it myself, to be this old before it even occurred to me to travel solo. Now I just have to go somewhere.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTravelling soloOpinionWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Ever since foolishly calling a snapelectionwhich delivered a deadlocked and divided national assembly, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has found himself trapped in a modern political version of the same plot.On Monday morning, the third prime minister Mr Macron has appointed in just over a year became the latest to throw in the towel, after only 27 days in the job. Hours after unveiling his ministerial team, Sébastien Lecornustood downfollowing a backlash from centre-right allies, who objected to the number of carryovers from François Bayrou’s previous administration. By Monday evening, Mr Macron had persuaded Mr Lecornu toconducta round of last-ditch negotiations to try to resolve the crisis. Should he fail, the president has hinted that the next step will be a second dissolution of parliament and fresh legislative elections.Such dizzying chaos and dysfunction is bringing mainstream French politics into disrepute, at a time when Marine Le Pen’s far right National Rally enjoys a substantialleadin the polls. For this ominous state of affairs, Mr Macron bears a heavy responsibility. His centrist alliancelostits outright majority in the parliamentary elections of 2022, and was then defeated by a leftwing coalition in the snap poll he called last year. But he has ploughed on as if nothing had changed, pressuring successive prime ministers toproposeunpopular austerity budgets without a mandate.Persisting with this doomed approach, as bond markets increasinglytargetthe EU’s second largest economy, has been irresponsible. Repeatedly, Mr Macron has called for mainstream politicians to compromise and reach a consensus in the national interest. They have signally failed to do that. But the president himself has been the most obdurate, refusing to make any meaningful concessions. In particular, Mr Macron has failed to acknowledge that the public mood (and parliamentary arithmetic) will not permit deficit-cutting measures that primarily come at the expense of public services and the less well-off. Calls from the left for an annual 2%wealth taxon super-rich households, for example, have been resolutely ignored.As the risk of economic instability mounts, with knock-oneffectsfor the rest of Europe, France needs to find a way out of the impasse. Even if Mr Lecornu manages to patch things up with the centre-right Les Républicains party, the resulting minority government will almost certainly meet the same ignominious fate as its predecessors. Fresh legislative elections, given the polls, would carry a risk of handing power in parliament to the National Rally, or producing further deadlock. But the present political paralysis and infighting is a gift to Ms Le Pen ahead of presidential elections in 2027.For Mr Macron, who arrived in the Élysée with the avowed intention of preventing the further rise of the far right, the twilight of his second term has turned into a political humiliation. Abroad, he has played a central andvaluablerole in shaping Europe’s response to a new era of geopolitical instability. But domestically, a combination of hubris and economic rigidity has left himisolatedand terminally unpopular. It is highly unlikely that he will himself resign, and Mr Lecornu may yet succeed in keeping the show on the road for a while. But France deserves better from its president and its political class.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But if ministers intend to reduce illness, clarity and courage will be requiredTue 7 Oct 2025 13.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 14.30 EDTShareCalls by cancer experts toban sunbeds in the UKwill not be heeded straight away. So far, no minister or opposition party has signalled support for a step that many would regard as overly restrictive. Nor has the public been consulted. While World Cancer Research Fund (a British charity) supports a ban, Cancer Research UK has stuck to issuing warnings.But withskin cancer rates rising, and evidence that the existing ban on children using sunbeds is being flouted, it is unsurprising that cancer doctors think more should be done. The ban on children using commercial sunbeds in the UK was introduced in 2010. Since then, Australia has banned such businesses altogether. Prof Paul Lorigan and the other authors of anarticlein the British Medical Journal argue that a law like Australia’s would be the most cost-effective way of cutting melanoma cases – even if it included compensation for businesses. Evidence suggests that young women in deprived parts of northern England are at particular risk.As with other activities and products that are known to cause cancer or other illness, the alternative is tighter regulation and public education aimed at persuading people to make healthier choices. On tobacco, the UK has chosen a ban – albeit a gradual one, with a bill outlawing the sale of tobacco products to anyone born after 1 January 2009. The new law will also ban the sale of vapes to children, and further restricts advertising andsmoking in public places. By contrast, on junk food and alcohol Labour hasfailed to live up to pre-election promises, with tighter rules on advertising delayed, and England so far not following Scotland with a minimum unit price for alcohol.Public health campaigners are only too aware of such inconsistencies. When it comes to the powerful food and drink industries, successive governments’ commitment to preventing illness is in tension with an avowedly pro-business approach.The question of exactly which risky activities should be banned will always be a difficult one in a liberal society. People take chances with their health and safety all the time, and value the opportunity to make their own choices and mistakes. But as health officials have pointed out in relation tohigh-risk cosmetic surgery, the UK’s free-to-use national health system makes the potential downsides of such decisions harder to brush off. Choices are not simply at an individual’s “own risk” when adverse consequences and costs are shared.With “sin taxes”, as they are known, another kind of cost-benefit analysis comes in. While the pleasure derived from alcohol, and the profits made from selling it, are two reasons why there is little appetite for restrictions, another is that the Treasury earns around£12.5bn in dutiesfrom sales each year.As with sunbeds, public health experts point out that poorer people are at highest risk from obesity and alcohol-related harms (though one recent survey found that those in wealthier families were more likely to havean addiction problem). Attempts to shift consumer behaviour must never be a substitute for tackling thesocioeconomic determinants of poor health, including inadequate incomes and housing. But nor can the dangers to health from gambling, ultra-processed food, sunbeds and other risky products and services simply be ignored. If ministers want the public to trust them, prevention in healthcare needs to be more than a buzzword.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The proportion is no doubt even higher now.Unless the moneyed classes stop seeing vocational learning as good only for other people’s children, the prime minister’s intention to do away with the 50% target for participation in universities may only reinforce inherited inequalities.Rob HullChair, New City College Group, London and south EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The high-speed rail contractor has recently done considerable damage to potential archaeology on the nationally important registered battlefield at Edgcote, a Wars of the Roses battle fought in 1469.HS2 stripped 30cm of soil from an area equivalent to around 16 football pitches to allow storage of hundreds of thousands of tons of earth dug out along the route of the new railway. The archaeology of battle sits in the topsoil and understanding its distribution is key. HS2’s contractor undertook a geophysical survey prior to work beginning. But this method is not designed to find the types of small artefacts typically found on a medieval battlefield. If it had used a systematic metal-detecting survey instead, such material would not have been lost.This is baffling, because HS2 has an otherwise good track record on archaeological investigation, including on the Edgcote battlefield part of the route.So why has it happened? The real villain of this piece is the current permitted development rules, which allowed HS2’s contractor to press on with work on the battlefield once it had been told by planners that an environmental-impact assessment was not necessary.We think of permitted development allowing house owners to build extensions, but they also let major engineering works to be undertaken outside normal planning scrutiny. This prevents an assessment of the impact of development on heritage and crucially fails to require any archaeological investigations before work begins.The Battlefields Trust does not seek to limit householder extensions or prevent development that preserves or enhances battlefield sites. But permitted development rules need to change if they are to stop damaging our heritage.Simon MarshBattlefield research and threats coordinator, Battlefields TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The provision of alternative leadership for churches that hold to this view is a bit like having a football team where players are not only permitted to disagree with the manager’s preferred system, but can also expect a second manager to be appointed to meet their needs.For those frustrated by the six months we have to wait for Sarah Mullally to start work as the next archbishop of Canterbury, might it be worthwhile for the Church of England to use the time to move beyond its endless tangles over matters involving gender, sexuality and race, and consider what it really wants to offer?Children are growing up in a world with the exciting reality of greater connectivity and astonishing advances in artificial intelligence, so need a dynamic, inspirational and intelligentChristianitythat speaks into this. May the new archbishop be granted all the wisdom, skill and grace to make this happen.Keith GriffinHolmfirth, West YorkshireThe Rev Martine Oborne is right when she says we rejoice in the appointment ofSarah Mullallyas the new archbishop of Canterbury. All decent, reasonable and intelligent people would agree, whatever their religious beliefs or none. It is clear what she is up against. So let’s say it loud and clear. It’s called misogyny!Those churches in London that passed resolutions to limit women being vicars and who are opposed to women administering bread and wine are misogynistic. The seven serving bishops who say they welcome Mullally as their new archbishop but wouldn’t receive communion from her are hypocrites and, again, misogynistic. And highly insulting.The Church of England, including Sarah Mullally, cannot have it both ways. Either women are seen as equal to men or they are not. And if they can’t accept the ministry of women they should leave and let the church get on with the business of the Christian ministry.Andrew GrovesEype, DorsetThe piece by the Rev Martine Oborne has quote marks around the word “enthroned”, as if it was some weird relic word. Archbishops of Canterbury are indeed enthroned there, no fewer thanthree times: in the choir, the chapter house and on the chair of Saint Augustine.Mark Ynys-MonGlasgowA Hindu philosopher once said to me: “You Christians make extraordinary claims about God, yet you live such ordinary lives. In India, our saints radiate God through their very being.”Your leader on the new archbishop of Canterbury (The Guardian view on the first female archbishop of Canterbury: a choice that offers renewal and hope, 5 October) is spot-on in every point, but misses the most salient: the visible manifestation of a life rooted in prayer. To impact a secular world where the rumour of God is so diminished, an archbishop must incarnate their spiritual transformation above every policy or practical initiative.RevDr Nicholas BradburyOxfordIt seems to be obligatory to use the phrase “declining congregations” in every Guardian article on the Church of England. Please remember that there are at least 700,000 people at Anglican churches in England every week. This is similar to the 800,000 or so people who attend a professional football match in England every week.Julian SharpeLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Because goodness knows, if the move to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia seemed like a bad idea, the reality was even worse.Henderson’s reputation was trashed after he was accused of putting financial gain before hissupport of LGBTQ+ rights. He was booedon England dutyby the Wembley crowd. Even afterjumping back to Ajaxin January 2024, it felt as if the collateral damage continued. Henderson, who is now at Brentford, was overlooked by Gareth Southgate for his Euro 2024 squad, having been involved throughout qualification. It was the beginning of a long international exile.England eye up Uruguay and Japan tests as part of World Cup preparationsRead more“I am not going to lie … over the past couple of years I have had some tough moments,” Henderson says. But according to him, it was not so much what he lived, rather what he left behind that was the struggle.“It felt like a break-up,” Henderson says of the end of his 12‑year association with Liverpool, a period when he captained them to every top honour and embedded himself in the fabric of the club and city. The way he tells it, there was simply an emptiness.“I couldn’t watch a lot of Premier League games and I certainly couldn’t watch Liverpool. I probably picked the right place for that because I was halfway around the world! Because I was at Liverpool for so long and had such an attachment, I found it really difficult when I left.“If you asked a lot of players when they left a club where they had been for so long – not just Liverpool – I think they’d say it was hard. With time, things change. You move on. But I would say that was probably the most difficult time.”Henderson is asked whether, with the benefit of a bit of distance, he regrets going to Saudi. It is the trigger for a long answer, within which he says it was not the reason why he missed out on playing at the European Championship. He does not mention it but the injury he sustained with Ajax in March 2024, which ruled him out for almost two months, was a factor. Yet he does get around to embracing the question. And he does not run from it.View image in fullscreen‘I found it really difficult when I left.’ Jordan Henderson could not watch Liverpool play after captaining them to every top honour, including the Champions League in 2019.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Uefa/Getty Images“In hindsight, maybe I would have made different decisions. You can look back and think: ‘Maybe I could have done this differently or maybe have done that.’ But there were reasons for it and I did not do it off a whim. In the end, it has made me stronger.”This is the bit that Henderson wants to push; his capacity to overcome, to use negativity as fuel. It has been a driving force throughout his career and it has underpinned his latest chapter, theEnglandcomeback story under Thomas Tuchel that nobody saw coming.Henderson had been ignored by the interim manager Lee Carsley for the three camps last autumn, and even Tuchel, who started work in January, admitted he was not in his initial thoughts. That was until the German came to hear players and staff talking constantly about Henderson, his influence on and off the pitch. When Tuchel got in touch in February, he realised pretty quickly that he had to involve him. Henderson has played in four of Tuchel’s six matches and hopes to feature in the Wembley friendly against Wales on Thursday and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga next Tuesday.The 35-year-old has been derided in some quarters as a glorified cheerleader – presumably by people who attach no value to leadership within a squad; the ability to maintain standards, to handle the pressure. But he is perfectly entitled to point out that Tuchel would not call on him unless he could bring something to the party on the field.There is a school of thought that says Southgate could have done with Henderson at Euro 2024 as a young team were buffeted by criticism; a steady hand on the tiller, maybe just as a substitute. Experience may not be glamorous but it ought not to be a dirty word. So many tournament-winning nations have relied on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has quickly become one of their main distributors in possession, be it from deeper areas or when probing further forward. One statistic from Opta stands out. Henderson has made seven defensive line-breaking passes in the league. Brentford’s next best player in the category has two.Then there is the Jude Bellingham factor. In other words, Henderson’s friendship with the Real Madrid star, whom Tuchel hascontroversially overlooked for this campbut will surely recall in November. Henderson hit it off with Bellingham after the latter was called into the England squad for the first time five years ago and it is reasonable to wonder whether he sees something of his younger self in him – the passion, the work ethic, the maturity, the obsession with winning.View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham are close friends, a factor which Thomas Tuchel appreciates.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PATuchel likes the fact that Bellingham listens to Henderson, which again has been taken negatively; more evidence that Henderson is there for the vibes and not the football. But how can this be anything other than a string to his bow? “I have shown what I can do for England over the years and I am still playing at a high level,” Henderson says.“Outside, people can think what they want – media or whoever. The most important people are the manager, the coaching staff and the players. Ask them what they think; if I am a cheerleader when I am here. I don’t think one of the best managers in Europe would be choosing me just to do that.“I am here to perform – whether that is in training every day, whether that is when I am on the pitch.

The important thing is we manage it really well. Last season shows that when it starts clicking we know how good we are.”The grim reality is that Meadow Park is no longer fit to host Arsenal matches. Despite investment to have the venue meet Uefa’s minimum standards, the facilities are nowhere near good enough for Champions League football. That does not stop it being a powerful cauldron, though, with the Gunners’ hardcore fans rocking the North Bank and leading the thunder of noise through the open ground as they kickstarted their title defence.“We’ve got to act like we’re the champions and people are coming after us to win it off us,” Steph Catley said beforehand.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo scored her third goal of the season to get Arsenal’s title defence under way.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesIf that was the energy in training and in the dressing room it spilled on to the pitch in style. Arsenal were up for this game. Very up for it. Beth Mead and Chloe Kelly slotted either side of their England teammate Russo, in two of five changes from the weekend, and it was Mead who drove the ball into the box for the opening goal, dancing through the middle before clipping the ball to Russo, who fired past Christiane Endler.Arsenal were soon punished, though: the goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar fluffed her pass to Catley, landing it straight at the feet of Dumornay, the midfielder forcing a save before rolling the rebound into the empty net. It was calamitous and five minutes later the visitors had the lead against the team who beat them 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-finals last season.The Lyonnes press mercilessly hustled away possession in the Arsenal third and the ball fell to Dumornay, who fired in from the edge of the box, with Van Domselaar, somewhat inexplicably, rooted to the spot.“The motivation is always there, I always like to adjust the mental preparation,” the manager, Jonatan Giráldez, said when asked about the impact of the semi-final meeting last season. “We can’t forget what happened last season, but we need to use it in the right way.”Slegers said: “Errors happen from time to time but if they happen too often of course there’s something there. It looks silly from the outside but it’s not that all of a sudden they can’t pass that ball, it can be something intangible that you can’t put your finger on sometimes.

The absence of Leah Williamson’s leadership qualities – in addition to her composure and vision on the ball – is being felt more and more as each game comes and goes.The frenetic energy of the first half was carried into the second. There was no heroic comeback, but the battle raged until the end as Arsenal fought to get something from the game and Giráldez’s side sought to kill off those hopes.Defeat is not a total disaster for Arsenal, who endured a bruising 5-2 loss against Bayern Munich in their opening group‑stage game last season before going on to win Europe’s premier competition for the first time in 18 years.That defeat contributed to Jonas Eidevall’s exit and Slegers’s temporary promotion that was made permanent three months later. The task, though, is to figure out the causes of an alarming slide, with their winless run extended to four games and the team needing to do something about it quickly.“What we know about this team is they’ve gone through hard times before and they’ve always come back,” Slegers said.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champion's LeagueArsenal WomenOL LyonnesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There is believed to be an appetite from the club’s American owner, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment (KSE), to increase that to 70,000, which would significantly boost match-day revenues, and there are more than 100,000 supporters on the waiting list for season tickets.Uefa allowing domestic games abroad is a sad turning point, ending soccer as we’ve known it | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreArsenal set up a working group last year to examine the feasibility of any redevelopment, with sources indicating that discussions are continuing and that no decision has yet been made. A number of options are understood to have been looked at, including changing the gradient of the stands to allow the addition of thousands more seats, or a much smaller upgrade that would mean less disruption.It remains to be seen whether a larger-scale redevelopment would mean Arsenal having to play matches elsewhere – something the club avoided when they left Highbury – after a report in the Telegraph on Tuesday claimed a temporary move to Wembley could be on the cards. Arsenal played their home Champions League fixtures at the national stadium between 1998 and 2000.It is understood that Arsenal did not apply to host matches at Euro 2028, with a potential redevelopment of the Emirates Stadium in mind, while the co-chair Josh Kroenke said in July that an upgrade was being discussed.“It would be premature to talk about any plans in depth, but the internal conversations are starting to occur about it,” he said. “It is not an easy renovation, but we see the possibilities of what’s there.”Arsenal spent more than £250min the summer transfer window and KSE is said to be ready to commit more funds to upgrade the Emirates Stadium, having made significant changes behind the scenes in recent weeks. After the surprise departure of the vice-chair Tim Lewis, Stan and Josh Kroenke will remain as co‑chairs, with the managing director, Richard Garlick, promoted to chief executive and the KSE representatives Kelly Blaha, Otto Maly and the film producer and director Ben Winston – son of Prof Robert Winston – joining the club’s board as nonexecutive directors.Maly is a commercial real estate and development expert who was involved in KSE’s construction of the 100,000-seat SoFi Stadium – home of the Los Angeles Rams American football team – and could play a role in any expansion of the Emirates Stadium.David Raya, meanwhile, has become the latest first-team regular to agree an improved contract, with the Spain goalkeeper understood to have been given a pay rise on the £100,000-a-week deal he signed when he joined from Brentford last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gerrard won 114 caps, the first of them coming in 2000, and he appeared at six major tournaments. Yet success eluded him, with one of the major issues being the cliques from Liverpool,Manchester Unitedand Chelsea.Football Daily | Kevin Keegan, a Wembley toilet and why England fans should cherish this eraRead moreGerrard had Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher with him fromLiverpoolwhile the United set featured Ferdinand, Gary Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney. From Chelsea there was Ashley Cole, John Terry and Frank Lampard.Gerrard struggled to dovetail in midfield with Lampard, while Scholes also failed to fit in. There was a problem with the system, Gerrard said, with a central midfield two not working. But the problems ran deeper than that.“I think we were all egotistical losers,” Gerrard said. “Because I watch the telly now and I see Carragher sitting next to Scholes on this fan debate and they look like they’ve been best mates for 20 years. And I see Carragher’s relationship with Neville and they look like they’ve been mates for 20 years.“I’m probably more close and friendly with you [Ferdinand] now than I ever was when I played with you for 15 years. So why didn’t we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?“Why are we all mature enough now and at stages in our life where we’re closer and more connected? Why couldn’t we connect asEnglandteammates back then? I think it was down to the culture within England that we were all never connected. All in our rooms too much. We weren’t friendly or connected. We weren’t a team. We never at any stage became a real good strong team.”Gerrard was asked by Ferdinand whether he enjoyed being in the England squad. “I hated it,” he said. “I hated the rooms. In my early days, I’d have days where I was down, like low down. ‘I’m in this room for seven hours, what am I going to do?’ I used to love the games. I used to love playing for England. Really proud. I used to enjoy the training sessions but it was 90 minutes a day. And then I was just on my own in London or Romania or wherever.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard and Steven Gerrard during England’s defeat by Croatia at Wembley in a Euro 2008 qualifier.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was like I didn’t feel part of a team. I didn’t feel connected with my teammates with England.

But also there should have been more emphasis on the staff to go to us: ‘Listen, you need to forget that now. We need to connect from day one – more activities, more out of your rooms, more time together.’ Because I think if we’d have been more of a team, more together and liked each other more, it would have come out in the performances more.”Gerrard also discussed his career as a manager, lamenting how his time at Aston Villa ended in 2022 when he could not “pull it back because you know that the dressing room is maybe not going to help you pull it back … That was tough.” He said he had “unfinished business” as a manager, having left Saudi Arabia’s Al-Ettifaq in January, and that he would jump at the right opportunity. He is under strong consideration for a return to Rangers, where he started out in management, after the sacking of Russell Martin.“There’s a part of me that still feels that there’s a bit of unfinished business in terms of wanting to go in and face another couple of exciting challenges,” Gerrard said. “But I want a certain type of challenge. If, in an ideal world, they come available, I’ll jump at them. If they don’t, I won’t go back in.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandSteven GerrardLiverpoolManchester UnitedChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

England, Ireland, Scotland, France and Italy, along with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, made clear on Tuesday that players who join the proposed new competition will be ineligible for international selection and have confirmed they will not support the venture.R360’s backers, fronted by the former England international Mike Tindall, had been hoping to launch their multicity franchise tournament next year but have now been told to back off in no uncertain terms. “As a group of national rugby unions, we are urging extreme caution for players and support staff considering joining the proposed R360 competition,” read a statement issued by the world’s leading unions.Returning James O’Connor keen to add ‘stardust’ to Leicester’s attackRead more“We all welcome new investment and innovation in rugby and support ideas that can help the game evolve and reach new audiences but any new competition must strengthen the sport as a whole, not fragment or weaken it.“Among our roles as national unions, we must take a wider view on new propositions and assess their impact on a range of areas, including whether they add to rugby’s global ecosystem, for which we are all responsible, or whether they are a net negative to the game.”A counter-thrust has been likely since R360 confirmed its intention to press ahead with its launch towards the end of next year, amid particular concerns in England that their Women’s World Cup-winning Red Roses squad were being targeted. The lack of detail surrounding R360’s plans has also served to unite the traditional unions.The statement read: “R360 has given us no indication as to how it plans to manage player welfare; how players would fulfil their aspirations of representing their countries, and how the competition would coexist with the international and domestic calendars so painstakingly negotiated in recent years for both our men’s and women’s games.“The R360 model, as outlined publicly, rather appears designed to generate profits and return them to… a very small elite, potentially hollowing out the investment that national unions and existing leagues make in community rugby, player development and participation pathways.“International rugby and our major competitions remain the financial and cultural engine that sustains every level of the game. Undermining that ecosystem could be enormously harmful to the health of our sport. These are all issues that would have been much better discussed collaboratively, but those behind the proposed competition have not engaged with or met all unions to explain and better understand their business and operating model.“Each of the national unions will therefore be advising men’s and women’s players that participation in R360 would make them ineligible for international selection.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its reply read: “The series is designed with bespoke schedules for men’s and women’s teams and R360 will release all players for international matches, as written into their contracts.” R360 added: “Why would the unions stand in their way? We look forward to submitting to the World Rugby council for sanctioning next summer as planned.”The R360 response also struck back on the issue of player welfare. “So many players love what R360 can do for them and the game. Player welfare is one of the key reasons for creating our global series, which will greatly reduce player load and capture the attention of a new generation of fans globally.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionEngland rugby union teamNew Zealand rugby union teamAustralia rugby union teamSouth Africa rugby teamIreland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Lawyers representing Sanchez in a criminal case against him have not responded to the lawsuit.Sanchez could also face jail time in the criminal case. So far Indiana police have charged him with felony battery, battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle. The felony battery charge could result in a jail sentence of up to six years, if Sanchez is found guilty.Police say the case revolves around a dispute over a parking space. Tole says he went to pick up used cooking oil at an Indianapolis hotel shortly after midnight on Saturday. He says he was then confronted by Sanchez, who tried to enter his truck. Tole says he though Sanchez was “trying to kill me” and used pepper spray to protect himself. When the spray did not stop Sanchez advancing on him, Tole said he stabbed the former quarterback “two or three times”. Sanchez then allegedly threw Tole against a dumpster before “a look of shock” came across the former quarterback’s face and he “took off”. Detectives have reviewed video footage of the incident.“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion county prosecutor Ryan Mears said on Monday.Photos circulating on social media show Tole with a deep cut to his cheek. Sanchez was treated in hospital for stab wounds to his torso.Sanchez told police “all he could remember was grabbing for a window.” The 38-year-old was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts’ game against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. He was replaced in the Fox Sports booth by another former quarterback, Brady Quinn.“This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we’ve received over the past few days,” Sanchez’s brother, Nick, said in a statement on Monday. “Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.”The New York Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009NFLdraft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolisFoxUS sportsUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Bangladesh are a nation who scraped through the qualifiers for the World Cup back in April, have played no international cricket since then, and whose domestic structure is still almost entirely amateur; their coming within a whisker of slaying the giant of the No 2-ranked side in the world was never in the script.England were extremely fortunate to be on the right side of two controversial TV umpiring decisions, which handed Knight lives on nought and 13. The rules surrounding use of the decision review system state that in the absence of any definitive evidence to the contrary, the initial on-field decision should stand. Here, though, the third umpire chose to overturn an on-field “out” decision against Knight, ruling the batter had not edged Marufa behind the stumps despite the fact that UltraEdge appeared inconclusive.Then, Bangladesh celebrated Shorna Akter’s diving catch at cover in the 15th over and Knight walked towards the pavilion, but the on-field umpires were unsure and the third umpire, after a lengthy review, deemed the pictures were inconclusive as to whether Akter had grounded the ball in breaking her fall.In between, Knight used DRS to overturn a leg-before decision for Marufa, somehow surviving the scratchiest of starts – at one stage she was 14 from 44 balls – to bring up the half-century that enabled England to stagger across the finish line.“I certainly had a little bit of luck today but the year I’ve had I deserved it,” Knight said. “I just tried to ride that and make it count.“It’s my first innings in an ODI since January, so it was always going to take a bit of time to find my feet. The hardest thing sometimes coming back from injury is rhythm. It can take a bit of time to get back, so I’m delighted I was able to spend a bit of time out there and get through that pressure.”The match has put a substantial dent in England’s net run rate, which had been healthy after last week’s astonishing10-wicket win against South Africa; they sit above Australia only by virtue of the reigning champions’ washout against Sri Lanka at the weekend.This should have been an easy chase for England after a leisurely batting performance by Bangladesh, who scored just 178 despite batting for all but two balls of their 50 overs. The tempo of the innings was typified by Sobhana Mostary, who – seven years on from her one-day international debut – celebrated a maiden half-century, but took 92 balls to reach the milestone.View image in fullscreenBangladesh’s Marufa Akter was left frustrated by the decision review system.Photograph: Pankaj Nangia/Getty ImagesAmy Jones and Tammy Beaumont both fell victim to the hooping inswing of Marufa, before the leg-spinner Fahima Khatun reduced England from 69 for two to 78 for five, removing Nat Sciver-Brunt, Sophia Dunkley and Emma Lamb. The left-arm spinner Sanjida Akter Meghla then curved one in to Alice Capsey, rapped her on the back pad and sent her packing lbw.After her own early dismissal for a duck, popping up a soft catch to Dean at short extra cover, Bangladesh’s captain, Nigar Sultana, had been seen encouraging her players from the dugout to up the pace. “I wanted them to play until the last ball,” she said.But Bangladesh’s innings only came alive at the very end – 48 runs coming off the final seven overs, thanks to an exciting, unbeaten 43 from 27 balls from the No 9, Rabeya Khan. In the end it was not quite enough to enable the giantkill.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamWomen's Cricket World CupCricketWomen's cricketCharlotte EdwardsShareReuse this content"

We urgently need a plan to end overfishing, one that follows the science and puts our seas on a long-term path to recovery – ensuring a new generation of coastal prosperity. But this requires leadership. Ministers must act now to redefine the future of fishing, so that those that fish in harmony with nature are prioritised over those that devastate our seabed and empty our seas.”Britain’s fish populations are in a ‘deeply troubling state’ – reportRead moreNorth Sea cod is at critically low levels, yet continues to be overfished. The same is true for Celtic sea cod, Irish sea whiting, Irish sea herring and North Sea and east English Channel horse mackerel.About a quarter of the UK's 105 fish stocks are overexploitedCallum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the University of Exeter, said: “These results highlight the gross mismanagement of the UK’s greatest natural asset – its seas. The government has the best fisheries science at its fingertips, and even when data are scarce, the course to restoration is clear. Our seas are already at risk from oil, sewage and agri-chemical pollution; habitat destruction; and the climate crisis. We need to move away from brute extraction, regardless of collateral damage and set a new course to make fishing fair, evidence-based and above all sustainable, so that it works within nature’s limits.”The evidence shows that sensible management can increase fish stocks to healthy levels, sustaining the fishing industry and allowing the wildlife to recover. The UK’s best-performing stocks, including West of Scotland haddock, western Channel sole and North Sea plaice, have remained healthy and sustainably fished since 2020, in large part thanks to catch limits set in line with scientific advice.But there are regional disparities: the Irish Sea is the worst affected, with overfished stocks rising from 27% in 2020 to 41% today, and in the Celtic Sea a third of stocks are overfished to critically low population sizes, and many more overexploited. Western Scotland is the healthiest region, with 62% of stocks assessed as healthy and only 12% overfished.Oceana UK is calling for ministers to deliver a strategy to end overfishing by the end of next year, put in a legal deadline to rebuild fish stocks, and publish an annual parliament-scrutinised audit of fish stocks.Clive Mills, a Sussex fisher, said: “We don’t have another 10 years, I promise you that now. I have seen it since I was a young lad out on the boats, I’m now 66, and I can tell you we are on the edge of a precipice. We’re taking too much, too fast. If fishermen are going to be true to themselves, we’ve got to stop. Fifty years ago, when they brought in fish quotas, we asked ‘what are those for?’ To protect the future of fishing, we were told. And we all thought, that would be good, we need a future for fishing. But we haven’t stayed that course, and now here we are. It’s got to stop.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Defra are working with the fishing industry to promote British seafood and manage stocks sustainably – and have announced a brand new £360m fisheries and coastal growth fund to drive growth in the sector.“We are committed to restoring our stocks to sustainable levels and have made significant progress over the past five years, while continuing to support the long-term viability of our domestic fishing industry.”Explore more on these topicsFishingFishOceansBrexitMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

Dogan is being tried on appeal in Nîmes in southern France.Pelicot said he met Dogan, an unemployed builder, on a chatroom called “against her knowledge” and told him clearly that he drugged his then wife and was seeking men to come to rape her.“He had that information from the start,” Pelicot said, adding that he told Dogan by phone: “I’m looking for someone to abuse my wife after I’ve put her to sleep without her knowledge.” Pelicot saidhe had admitted drugging his wife, raping her himself and inviting men to rape her. “They all knew, they all came with the same intention,” he said. “I always said she was sedated.”Pelicot, a 73-year-old former electrician and estate agent, is one of theworst sex offenders in modern French history. He is serving a 20-year prison sentence after crushing sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into his then wife’s food and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious in their bedroom in the Provence village of Mazan between 2011 and 2020.For Tuesday’s hearing he was transported from his high-security prison in southernFrance, where he is in solitary confinement, to the Nîmes appeals court to give evidence as a witness in a secure witness box, flanked by four police officers.Gisèle Pelicot, 72, who became an international feminist hero after she waived her right to anonymity in the trial last year, sat calmly in court with her youngest son, Florian.Who are the men convicted over rape and assault of Gisèle Pelicot?Read moreDogan, 44, was one of 51 men convicted. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for raping Gisèle Pelicot. He is the only man to contest his conviction, telling the appeal trial: “I never intended to rape that lady.”Dominique Pelicot told the court he had given Dogan specific instructions because Gisèle Pelicot was drugged and was not to be woken. “I said precisely on the phone there was to be no tobacco, no scent, he was to wash his hands, no violence, it would be filmed. All these things left him in no doubt of her state. He had to get undressed at the entrance to the kitchen on the patio because if there was a problem, I didn’t want him to stay,” he said.He said Dogan, who had driven about an hour from another village after telling his wife he was going out, arrived around midnight. Pelicot said he at first got lost and he went out on foot to guide him to the house.Asked if Dogan was upset to see Gisèle Pelicot lying unconscious on her bed, Dominique Pelicot replied: “No, it suited him.”He said there was a camera on a tripod in the room, so there would have been no doubt the rape would be filmed. He said Dogan stayed for about two hours. He said Dogan even asked for his help in the rapes that night. “He asked me to lift my wife’s leg and wanted to put her head in a certain position because she couldn’t do it,” Pelicot said.He said Dogan “took pleasure” in the situation.Asked about Dogan’s assertion that Pelicot told him it was a game, he replied: “No, I never said that.”Pelicot said of Dogan’s appeal: “I think it is indecent.”The trial continues until Thursday.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceRape and sexual assaultEuropeViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

The profiles of 10 children were posted online and the hackers threatened to publish more material unless they were paid.Announcing the arrests, Will Lyne, the Met’s head of economic and cybercrime, said: “Since these attacks took place, specialist Met investigators have been working at pace to identify those responsible.“We understand reports of this nature can cause considerable concern, especially to those parents and carers who may be worried about the impact of such an incident on them and their families.“We want to reassure the community and anyone affected that this matter continues to be taken extremely seriously. These arrests are a significant step forward in our investigation, but our work continues, alongside our partners, to ensure those responsible are brought to justice.”The Met’s inquiries continue.Kido, which has 18 sites around London, told parents the breach happened when criminals accessed their data hosted by a software service called Famly, which is widely used by nurseries to share photos and information with parents.Anders Laustsen, the chief executive of Famly, said: “We have conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and can confirm that there has been no breach of Famly’s security or infrastructure in any way and no other customers have been affected. We of course take data security and privacy extremely seriously at Famly.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

She said there would be an option for parents to give permission to their children to use social media from the age of 13.It is hoped the ban could come into effect as early as next year.It follows the lead of Australia, which isintroducing a ban on social media platformsincluding Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube for under-16s, and Norway where the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has also said he would enforce astrict minimum age limitof 15 on social media, raising it from 13.Støre said last year that it would be “an uphill battle” but that politicians must intervene to protect children from the “power of the algorithms”.Denmark’s minister of digitalisation, Caroline Stage, said her government’s announcement was a “breakthrough”. She said: “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: we’ve been too naive. We’ve left children’s digital lives to platforms that never had their wellbeing in mind. We must move from digital captivity to community.”In her speech, the prime minister cited figures showing that 60% of 11- to 19-year-old boys did not see a single friend in their free time, while 94% of Danish children in seventh grade had a profile on social media before they were 13.“Mobile phones and social media are stealing our children’s childhood,” she said.The announcement comes after Denmarksaid in Februarythat mobile phones would be banned in all schools and after-school clubs. The decision was made on the recommendation of a government wellbeing commission, set up to investigate growing dissatisfaction among children and young people, that found children under 13 should not have their own smartphone or tablet.The findings of research into the impact of social media on children and young people is forcing governments around the world to reconsider access to social media. In June, Greece proposed the EU set an “age of digital adulthood” that would prevent children from accessing social media without their parents’ consent.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkSocial mediaInternet safetySmartphonesChildrenMobile phonesInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

He also expressed now poignant hopes that his best music was yet to come, and that “apart from acts of God, I will be around for another 60 years and doing it until I drop”.Interviewed in aBoom Radiospecial to be broadcast on Wednesday, veteran broadcaster and station presenter Horne recalls meeting Lennon at his Dakota building apartment, outside of which the songwriter would be shot dead five years later by Mark David Chapman.Lennon told Horne: “I know the difference between the phone being normal when I pick it up and when every time I pick it up, there’s a lot of noises.“[The administration was] coming for me one way or the other; I mean, they were harassing me. And I’d open the door and there’d be guys standing on the other side of the street. I’d get in a car and they’d be following me in a car and not hiding.”Lennon said while he couldn’t prove tapping at the time: “I just know there’s a lot of repairs going on in the cellar [of the Dakota building].”He was not the only rock star the US administration had qualms about, he said. “Mick [Jagger] had to vanish up his own manhole to get Keith [Richards] and the rest of them in to tour even. I mean, he did a lot of behind-the-scenes work just to get ‘em to be allowed in. So all of us have problems. It’s just that I wanted to stay here.”Of his solo Walls and Bridges studio album, which went gold in the US, and was written and recorded during his 18-month separation from Yoko Ono, Lennon confessed he “couldn’t stand to listen” to the studio tapes at first, and thought to “just throw this away”. He then played them to friends “and they said: ‘Hey, it’s all right.’ So I said: ‘It’s all right. Oh it’s not bad at all. I quite like some of it myself. OK, let’s put it out.”Describing his day-to-day life, he said: “Basically it’s a bedroom, a studio, a TV, a night out, back home.”Horne reveals he was nervous before the interview, with Lennon putting him at ease and even baking chocolate cookies for him. But sitting cross-legged on the singer’s white shag pile carpet to interview him, Horne “realised as I looked down that I’d spilt some chocolate crumbs on this pristine white carpet, and I was trying desperately to sort of pick them up one by one so that he didn’t see that”.Horne reveals the full story in a broadcast special of how he managed to land the interview with the former Beatle and what happened behind the scenes, while playing some of the interview on Boom Radio at 9pm on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsJohn LennonThe BeatlesCapital RadioSurveillancePop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Experts at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) calculated this is enough wheat to bake more than 4bn loaves of bread – a year’s supply.Due to the drought this year, 2025 is expected to be another poor year for harvest. Farmers battled record hot and dry weather and irrigation bans, and struggled to plant their crops.Two of the worst three harvests on record have happened this decade, and the conditions are expected to continue to worsen as climate breakdown brings longer periods of dry weather coupled with heavier, more extreme rain which can cause floods. The worst year was 2020 and third worst 2024.The climate crisis is creating uncertainty for farmers, with different types of growers experiencing boom and bust years.Winegrowers said 2025 will be a vintage yeardue to the number of sunny days, andapple orchards have seen a bumper crop.Tom Lancaster, the ECIU’s land, food and farming analyst, said: “This decade has already seen some of the worst harvests on record after extreme rainfall made it impossible for farmers to drill and manage crops. And this year we’ve seen the opposite as crops suffered in the hottest and one of the driest springs and summers on record.“This is what farming in a changing climate looks like.Extreme weatheris making our bread less British, as millers have to turn to imports due to shortfalls in UK production, costing British farmers billions in lost income and reducing our self-sufficiency in our main, staple crop. Although we can do more to support our farmers to adapt to these extremes, only reducing planet-warming emissions to net zero can prevent these losses to extreme weather escalating in the years to come.”The lack of wheat is putting pressure on supplies abroad. Other countries are having their own problems with war and extreme weather shrinking their yields. Millers are importing record levels of wheat to mill flour for bread, cakes and biscuits. In autumn last year imports of wheat were double the five-year average and UK self-sufficiency in wheat dropped from 96% in 2023 to 79% in 2024.Colin Chappell, an arable farmer from Lincolnshire, said: “I have never known a more challenging time to farm. As a farmer, I am used to managing the worst the weather has to throw at me, but recent years have become impossible. Months of rainfall are followed by months of drought, seemingly without a break, and I am now facing a second terrible harvest in succession.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Keir Starmer’s Labour government has declared theprotection and enhancementof national parks to be vital to its mission to restore nature and boost the nation’s health through access to green spaces. Ministers celebrated the parks last year on the 75th anniversary of their creation.But a suggested change being promoted by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to the planning bill would remove a key duty on councils and other public bodies to protect and enhance the nature and wildlife within national parks, seriously weakening the protections for these much-loved areas, charities say.It is understood discussions on the changes are ongoing within governmentand that ministers have until Monday to come forward with amendments to the planning bill. However, a government spokesperson told the Guardian that it was untrue that these changes were being discussed.Rose O’Neill, the chief executive of the Campaign for National Parks, said there was no evidence that the duty to enhance the parks was stopping growth. She said the last-minute proposal was a kneejerk reaction backed by no evidence.“Keir Starmer has talked so much about his love of national parks,and the Lake District, so we are appealing to him to stop this,” she said. “We don’t think removing this duty will do anything to boost growth; in fact, it will slow down development. There has been no public consultation on what amounts to a serious weakening of protections for national parks and landscapes. It was only in December last year that this government was celebrating them on their 75th anniversary as part of Labour’s postwar legacy.”Currently, public bodies have to “seek to further” the statutory aims of national parks, which are to conserve and enhance their natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage, early in any planning process and to mitigate any damage. The duty, contained within the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, was supported by Labour in opposition.Any weakening of protections is likely to make it easier to build roads and other major infrastructure within national parks, including Dartmoor, the New Forest and the Lake District, the organisations say.The Guardian recently revealed that the UK ranked asone of the worst countries in Europein terms of sacrificing green space to development. Thousands ofEnglish nature sitesare at risk under Labour’s planning proposals.In a letter to Starmer on Tuesday, the 170-plus groups – including the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, the Rivers Trust and the National Trust – said national parks and landscapes were enjoyed by 245 million visitors a year, generating £36bn for the economy. They appealed to Starmer to step in and ensure there is no rollback of protections, citing his declared love for the Lake District.The letter said: “[National parks] were established after the second world war as part of national renewal, driven by a Labour government who understood the value of such places for the nation and that the simple joy of beautiful landscapes was part of what makes a good life, which should be the right of every citizen whether they live in a town, city or the countryside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She is set to announce her support for changes to the bill in the hope that it will pass the Lords and receive royal assent before her budget next month. She hopes that the building of 1.5m homes and key infrastructure projects will fill £3bn of an estimated £30bn hole in the finances.But in the letter delivered on Tuesday, the nature organisations said the health of the environment underpinned the health of the economy.“Skewing this balance will have devastating consequences – and future generations will inherit the mess,” it said. “Clement Attlee’s postwar government understood this: it is why they created national parks and national landscapes … protecting landscapes alongside rapid housebuilding.”A government spokesperson told the Guardian: “These claims are untrue. We will deliver the infrastructure and 1.5 million homes the country needs while preserving the natural beauty of our Protected Landscapes.”Explore more on these topicsNational parksPlanning policyGreen politicsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

A study published in May of this year found that nearly 40% of glaciers aredoomed to meltbecause of global heating. If such heating increases by 2.7C, which the world is currently on track for, as many as 75% will disappear, causing sea level rise and mass displacement.Across the American west, glaciers have shrunk significantly since they were first documented in the late 19th century, according to the article.The new research focuses on four Sierra Nevada glaciers – the Conness, Maclure, Lyell and Palisade glaciers – that are among the largest and likely oldest in the range. Their longevity amid climate warming makes them “bellwethers” for examining glacier disappearance in the west, the article states.This Patagonian village has glacier-fed rivers and majestic scenery. The only problem? SewageRead moreResearchers looked at recently exposed bedrock around the glaciers and took samples to determine how long the area was covered by ice. They found that the glaciers have covered swaths of the range for much longer than previously known – since before humans occupied North America.California’s glaciers reached their maximum positions as early as 30,000 years ago, the article’s authors wrote, and one of the glaciers researchers looked at is thought to have expanded 7,000 years ago, earlier than previously believed. The disappearance of glaciers, for the first time in human history, shows the dramatic effects of the climate crisis, one author of the study said.“We’ll be the first to see the ice-free peaks,” said Andrew Jones, the study’s lead author and a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told theSan Francisco Chronicle. “This has ecological implications for plants and animals. And it’s a symbolic loss. Climate change is very abstract, but these glaciers are tangible. They’re iconic features of the American West.”Explore more on these topicsGlaciersCaliforniaClimate crisisMountainsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The prosecution said Khan responded with a video on 14 October, which was played to the jury.In it Khan appears to say: “Englishman Nigel, don’t talk shit about me. You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me.“Don’t talk about me more. Delete the video. I’m coming to England. I’m going to pop, pop, pop,” quoted the prosecutor, Peter Ratliff. He told jurors that Khan had made “gun gestures with his hand” when he said “pop, pop, pop” and pointed to a tattoo of an AK47 assault rifle on his face.Farage said that Khan’s video was “pretty chilling”, adding: “Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried.”“He says he’s coming to England and he’s going to shoot me. I understood that very clearly indeed, as did many people who saw it at the same time.”He added: “In high-profile politics, a lot of nasty stuff gets posted. A lot of nasty stuff gets said. What you don’t see is an individual say on social media they are coming for you directly, and secondly the means by which they are going to do it.”Khan “live-streamed” his journey across the Channel and was arrested on 31 October after arriving in the UK, the court was told by a police officer. Ratfliff told jurors that Khan had a “very large presence online” under the TikTok username “madapasa”, amassing hundreds of thousands of viewsThe defendant, who denies threatening to kill Farage, was said to have told police in an interview in November last year that he had attempted to come to the UK “10 times”, and was in Dunkirk when he recorded the video in which he is alleged to have threatened to kill the politician.The court heard that Khan told police through a interpreter: “I didn’t say: ‘Nigel Farage delete that video or if you do not delete that video I’m going to shoot you.’ I said: ‘Pop, pop, pop.’“It was never my intention to kill him or anything – this is my character, this is how I act in my videos. In every video I make those sounds, I say: ‘Pop, pop, pop’.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

So I’ll be able to tell you more in due course, but we are in discussions as you’d expect.”The prime minister declined to go into further details about what ministers were asking from Brussels. “I’m not going to go into the details, but I’m going to tell you in clear terms as you would expect we are discussing this with the EU and with the US.”Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said it was “vital” to “protect trade flows between the UK and EU” and that he would meet industry leaders on Thursday. He added he was “pushing the European Commission for urgent clarification of the impact of this move on the UK”.In its plan presented to the European parliament on Tuesday, the European Commission also proposed slashing the existing quota for duty-free imports and obliging foreign suppliers to declare where the steel was melted and poured to prevent China sneaking products in through other countries.Senior officials said rules would be an “important stepping stone” to progress negotiations with the US and prove to Trump that the EU had a common foe in Beijing.“The European steel industry was on the verge of collapse – we are protecting it so that it can invest, decarbonise, and become competitive again,” the bloc’s commissioner for industry, Stéphane Séjourné, told an event in Strasbourg.The proposals are designed to replace a quota system that has been in operation for the last seven years and which is due to expire in 2026, and is now seen as not fit for purpose. To do nothing could have been “fatal” for the industry, one EU official said.The source said the new proposals were intended to act as “an important stepping stone” in negotiations with the US over the scrapping of the current 50% tariff on EU steel imports by signalling joint opposition to Chinese steel dumping.However, Gareth Stace, the head of the industry body UK Steel, said Brussels doubling its tariffs would pose “the biggest crisis the UK steel industry has ever faced”.He called on the government to “recognise the urgent need to put in place its own measures to defend” the UK steel industry – which is still reeling from a 25% tariff imposed by the US president earlier this year – from the threat of millions of tonnes of world steel diverted away from US and European markets. This flood of imports could be “terminal for many of our remaining steel companies”, Stace said.Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary at steelworkers’ union Community, said the new measures posed “an existential threat” to UK steel.Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer with the GMB trade union, called the tariffs a “hammer blow” that “could be the end of steelmaking in the UK if proper safeguards aren’t secured”.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, denied the move was hostile to the UK, noting that once it had submitted the proposals to the World Trade Organization the commission would discuss an “allocation of the steel quota for UK”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will impose a 50% tariff on imports beyond the quota and oblige countries exporting into the bloc to state where the steel was melted and poured to prevent circumvention of the sanctions.Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein will not be subject to tariff quotas or duties owing to their close trading relationship in the European Economic Area, the EU has said.Alongside the proposal, the EU is seeking a “metals alliance” with the US to ringfence their respective economies from overcapacity.“TheEuropean Unionneeds to act now, and decisively, before all lights go out in large parts of the EU steel industry and its value chains,” said the president of industry group Eurofer, Henrik Adam.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsEuropean UnionTariffsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Payouts could start early next year, it said.UK regulators step up crackdown on firms chasing cut of car finance payoutsRead moreIt relates to the alleged large-scale mis-selling of car loans involved in the payment of “secret” commissions to car dealers, and millions of car buyers unknowingly paying more for their finance than they should have.Launching a consultation, the FCA said that based on the number of consumers it estimated could take part in the scheme, lenders could end up paying out £8.2bn in compensation, though the expected £2.8bn of running costs that firms would also have to meet would take the total bill to £11bn.However, the regulator said that it was a complex issue and “not everyone will get everything they would like”. But it added that it was keen to create the best possible scheme “and draw a line under this issue quickly”.The FCA said in August that it estimated “most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement”. At that time, it said it was unlikely the cost of the scheme would be much lower than £9bn, and could be up to £18bn.Now it says that based on its proposed scheme, it expects eligible consumers to receive an average of about £700 an agreement, though it adds that there will be “a wide range” of payouts, with many consumers receiving more than that, “and a large number receiving less”.Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the FCA, said: “Many motor finance lenders did not comply with the law or the rules … it’s time their customers get fair compensation. Our scheme aims to be simple for people to use and lenders to implement.”The vast majority of new cars and an increasing number of used vehicles are bought with motor finance – typically either a personal contract purchase plan or a hire purchase agreement. More than 2 million people use motor finance each year, with £39bn borrowed in 2024.The compensation scheme has been unveiled despite a supreme court ruling in August thatlargely overturned a previous rulingthat could have led to compensation payouts of up to £44bn.That is because the FCA had been running its own investigation into “discretionary commission arrangements” (DCAs) – a particularly controversial type of car finance that was banned in 2021. With these deals, motor finance lenders – typically banks – gave dealers the power to set interest rates on car loans, with dealers getting more commission the higher the interest rate. This practice allegedly incentivised dealers to overcharge customers.The scheme that the regulator is consulting on will largely focus on people whose deal included a DCA, which was by far the most common commission arrangement before it was outlawed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once the scheme goes live, lenders will contact those who have complained. If they do not hear back from someone after one month, the lender will assume they should review their case. Those who have already complained before the scheme gets up and running are likely to receive compensation faster. Those who have not complained will be contacted by their lender within six months of the scheme starting and asked if they want to “opt in” and have their case reviewed.Meanwhile, those who do not receive a letter – for example, because lenders no longer have their details and cannot trace them - will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim.Consumers who have already been compensated for complaints covered by the scheme would be excluded.In many cases the payouts will be boosted by interest – based on the annual average Bank of England base rate a year plus 1% from the date of overpayment to the date compensation is paid. The average amount of interest people would get is estimated at 2.09%.The FCA will run an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the scheme.The Finance & Leasing Association, a leading trade body for the motor finance sector, said: “We remain concerned that the costs are too high, but this is a 360-page document which will require much scrutiny over the coming weeks as we assess the best way to get redress to those consumers who lost out, while keeping the motor finance market stable and competitive.”Explore more on these topicsMotor financeMotoringConsumer affairsConsumer rightsFinancial Conduct AuthorityFinancial sectorRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

He ruled that the charge was “null” and “unlawful”. After the chief magistrate’s decision, Ó hAnnaidh, who was referred to by his anglicised name, Liam O’Hanna, in court documents, told dozens of his supporters who had gathered outside: “This entire process was never about me. It was never about any threat to the public, it was never about terrorism – a word used by your government to discredit people you oppress.“It was always about Gaza, about what happens if you dare to speak up.” He accused the British government of attempting to silence the band.Responding to the impending appeal,Kneecapsaid: “Once again this is a massive waste of taxpayers’ money, of police time, of court time. Once again there are endless news reports about Mo Chara, about Kneecap but we are NOT the story.“We will fight you in your court again. We will win again.”Goldspring’s decision was welcomed by Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, in apost on X. She said: “These charges were part of a calculated attempt to silence those who stand up and speak out against the Israeli genocide in Gaza.“Kneecap have used their platform on stages across the world to expose this genocide, and it is the responsibility of all of us to continue speaking out and standing against injustice in Palestine.”Kneecap were also investigated by police for their 28 June performance at Glastonbury festival, where they led a packed crowd in chants such as “Fuck Keir Starmer”. However, Avon and Somerset policesaid in Julythat no further action would be taken “on the grounds there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence”.Kneecap said it had been plain that no law was broken in their performance at Worthy Farm, accusing police of making a political decision to open an investigation, describing it as “state intimidation”.Explore more on these topicsKneecapCrown Prosecution ServiceProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Macron was re-elected in April 2022 for a five-year term, but since snap legislative elections in 2024 his appointees as prime minister have been unable to summon a parliamentary majority to pass a budget.“Time is of the essence,” Philippe said. “We are not going to prolong what we have been experiencing for the past six months. Another 18 months is far too long and it is damaging France. The political game we are playing today is distressing.”Philippe, who polls suggest is the best-placed candidate to lead the political centre in the next presidential elections, was not alone among Macron’s former prime ministers in distancing himself from the beleaguered head of state.Gabriel Attal – whose brief tenure as France’s youngest-ever prime minister ended last year when Macron called the snap vote that produced France’s present hung parliament – said he no longer understood the president’s decisions.Attal, who now leads the main pro-Macron party, told French media that after burning through five prime ministers in under two years it was “time to try something else”, criticising what he called Macron’s “determination to keep control”.The calls came after the outgoing prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was appointed only 28 days ago, resigned with his 14-hour-old cabinet on Monday but was asked by Macron to hold last-ditch talks with party leaders to try to rally support.Macron gave Lecornu until Wednesday evening to try to “define a platform for action and stability”. However, in a sign of the difficulties he faces, the far-right National Rally (RN), the largest single party in parliament, refused to attend.“These umpteenth negotiations no longer aim to protect the interests of the French people, but those of the president himself,” said the party, which polls suggest would finish first in an eventual parliamentary election but is unlikely to secure a majority.In a scathing editorial, Le Monde said the crisis was a “tragic farce” and “yet another demonstration of the unravelling” of Macron’s second mandate since his re-election in 2022. “The president finds himself in a major crisis,” it said.The newspaper castigated France’s “entire political class”, which it said was “incapable of rising to the challenge”, preferring to posture in the run-up to the presidential ballot due in 2027 rather than “build a compromise essential for the months to come”.France has been in political crisis for more than a year since the 2024 election – called in response to far-right successes in the European parliamentary elections that year – produced a parliament divided between three more or less equal blocs: the left, far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no majority.Among other options, Macron could reappoint Lecornu, select another new prime minister – possibly a non-party-political technocrat – who would become his eighth, or dissolve parliament again and hold new legislative elections.He has long said he is reluctant hold fresh legislative elections, which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament, but on Monday hinted he may be prepared to do so if Lecornu fails in his last-chance mission.Macron has also repeatedly insisted he will not resign before the end of his mandate in 2027.1:47French PM Sébastien Lecornu resigns after less than a month in office – videoThe calls from Macron’s allies echoed similar demands from the president’s opponents on both the left and far right, including the far-right RN president, Jordan Bardella, who on Tuesday said he, too, backed fresh parliamentary elections or an early presidential ballot.“I call on the president of the republic to hear the suffering in the country, to come out of his isolation, and to dissolve the national assembly,” Bardella said. “We must go back to the French people so they can choose a majority for themselves.”What happened on a chaotic day in French politics – and what next?Read moreLecornu met on Tuesday with the leaders of Macron’s centrist alliance and the conservative Les Républicains (LR), with the parties reportedly agreeing that finding a deal to urgently pass next year’s planned austerity budget must be the top priority.The political crisis is being played out against the backdrop of France’s deepening financial woes: its debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest and almost twice the ceiling permitted under EU rules, as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%.Lecornu will need the support of others, however, including the centre-left Socialist party (PS), to have any hope of a majority in parliament to approve the legislation. The PS has called for “a change of course” under a new “leftwing government”.Lecornu became the shortest-lived prime minister in modern French history when he resigned, the country’s fifth prime minister since Macron’s re-election in 2022 and the third since the parliamentary dissolution of last year.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Among the topics up for discussion are trade and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is critical to Canada’s economy and is up for review next year.Trump said he was willing to revisit the free trade agreement, which was enacted during his first term, or seek “different deals”.“We could renegotiate it, and that would be good, or we can just do different deals,” he said. “We’re allowed to do different deals.”Trump exhibited a fondness for Carney, something he did not display toward Carney’s predecessor, Justin Trudeau. He described Carney as a “world-class leader” and said he is a tough negotiator.“We want Canada to do great,” Trump said. “But you know, there’s a point at which we also want the same business.”Asked why the US and Canada have failed to reach a deal on trade, Trump said it’s a complicated situation.“We have natural conflict,” he said. “We also have mutual love.”Carney balked at the word “conflict”.“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works. But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are simply voting with their feet,” he said. “I talk every day to ordinary citizens who are changing their vacation plans, and I talk to large business owners who are moving reward trips away, or executive business trips.

Carney is looking to get some relief on some sector-specific tariffs, but expectations are low.“Improving relations with the White House ahead of the USMCA review is certainly an objective of the trip, but opposition parties and part of the Canadian public will criticise Prime Minister Carney if he doesn’t achieve some progress on the tariff front at this stage,” said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMark CarneyCanadaTrump tariffsInternational tradeGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Until now, there hasn’t been much consistent research to explain why depression affects females and males differently, including the possible role of genetics.”The study acknowledged explanations have been put forward spanning behavioural, environmental and biological domains, includingmen being less likely to seek helpleading to under-diagnosis, and environmental exposures such aswomen being more frequently exposed to sexual abuseand interpersonal violence.The study stated that together these factors highlight the need for a “multifaceted approach” to understanding the underlying mechanisms of depression but proposed that a “key component of the biological mechanisms underlying these disparities could be differences in genetics”.The researchers analysed the DNA from five international cohorts – Australia, the Netherlands, United States and two from the United Kingdom – with a final sample size of 130,471 women and 64,805 men with major depression, and 159,521 women and 132,185 men without the diagnosis.They also found stronger genetic correlations in women between depression and metabolic traits (such body mass index and metabolic syndrome) than in men with the same traits.Dr Jodi Thomas, the lead researcher, said these genetic differences “may help explain why females with depression more often experience metabolic symptoms, such as weight changes or altered energy levels”.The authors acknowledged the study included roughly twice as many women with depression as men, and performed additional analyses to ensure their findings were not due to the difference in sample sizes.They also acknowledged limitations that their analyses were restricted to Europeans only, limiting the applicability of the findings to other populations.Nobel prize in physics awarded to three scientists for work on quantum mechanicsRead moreProf Philip Mitchell, from the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales, said “there has been longstanding debate about the reasons for the consistent finding around the world that depression is more common in females than males, with most studies reporting that women have two to three times the risk of depression compared to men”.“The most dominant theories have been related to social and psychological factors, for example the impact of the female role in caring for families compared to the income earning role of males, or personality vulnerabilities in women,” said Mitchell, who was not involved in the study.“This very interesting novel genetic study in a very large global study provides strong evidence that these differences in rates of depression may in fact be due to genetic factors, with the statistically significant finding of more depression risk regions in the genome in females compared to males, and little overlap in these regions between males and females.“As well as strengthening the evidence that the differences in depression rates between men and women may be largely due to biological factors, it also points to the future possibility of different pharmacological treatments for depression in women and men, as the biological systems coded for by these genetic regions become better understood.”Explore more on these topicsScienceDepressionnewsShareReuse this content"

In the space of five days, the 32-year-old New Yorker married his fiancee, actor Marisa Abela; attended the Venice film festival for the premiere ofThe Testament of Ann Lee, a musical about the Shaker movement in which he stars – and sings – opposite Amanda Seyfried; and began rehearsals for Safe Space, his first produced play.View image in fullscreenJohn C Calhoun photographed circa 1845.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAs well as writing Safe Space, Bogyo appears in it as one of a group of Yale students debating whether Calhoun college, so named in honour of the 19th-century US vice-president and slavery advocate John C Calhoun, should be renamed and his statue toppled. If such a tussle already sounds quaint in 2025, along with the play’s title and its references to “snowflakes”, then that is intentional. Written by Bogyo in 2019 and based on events that occurred three years earlier, Safe Space begins its run one month after thekilling of the rightwing influencer Charlie Kirkat a campus event. Wisely, there has been no attempt made to introduce hindsight into a period piece that is set near the end of Barack Obama’s second term.“It has to feel current but I don’t need it to feel zeitgeisty,” says the tall, toothy, floppy-haired Bogyo over coffee before rehearsals. “It has to deal with things that are bigger than just what you’ve seen on the news recently. The political climate of the world hasn’t moved forward that much from 2016. We’re just looking through a different lens now. Like: how did we get fromtheretohere?”The emphasis, though, is on characters rather than issues. “These kids are trying to find their identity in the age of identity politics.” They include Annabelle (Céline Buckens), a well-meaning white liberal perturbed by what she suspects is institutional favouritism toward her Black friend Stacey (Bola Akeju), and Isaiah (Ernest Kingsley Jr), a soloist in the college’s a cappella group who is pressured to lend his name to the anti-Calhoun cause.The Bin Ladens are a huge family – and the kid I tutored was sweetBogyo says Safe Space is about how we love people with whom we disagree. What experience does he have of that? “When I was younger, I prided myself on not getting worked up by disagreements. But I’ve realised that came with a certain level of privilege. Rarely as a straight white man did I feel personally attacked, so I could compartmentalise an ideology that I knew was problematic. You know, ‘Oh, they’re probably just saying this because of their upbringing.’ I would look for that human level of connection. Those excuses can make you feel flimsy on the inside. That’s something that some of these characters also struggle with.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve realised I had a certain level of privilege’ … Bogyo.Photograph: Rhys FramptonThe statue exists in the play to give the past a concrete physical presence on stage. “There never was a Calhoun statue,” Bogyo tells me, “but the arguments against the name were real.” He was a senior at Yale in 2016 when it all kicked off. What was his contribution? “I made some impassioned … Facebook posts. I said stuff that I thought sounded meaningful but was also a bit cringe. There was the worry that if I didn’t postsomething, I’d be judged for my silence.” He hasn’t stinted on cringe in the play, whether it’s Annabelle’s performative idolatry of Obama, or Isaiah being caught masturbating. The latter scene will cause one former Yale student no end of blushes. “It really happened,” Bogyo says.Bogyo has hitherto been associated with musical theatre, including the West End run of Moulin Rouge!, for which the Observer critic Susannah Clapp called him “the discovery of the evening”. Hardly surprising from a Broadway baby whose mother was an opera singer and whose father was an assistant to Stephen Sondheim. Bogyo Sr also taught Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver to “ribbet” for the original Yale production of Sondheim’s The Frogs.View image in fullscreenA statue of Calhoun is taken down in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2020.Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesFuture writing projects, though, will see Bogyo continuing to dramatise the world of education. For some years now he has run a private tuition company, American Education Experts, and once tutored the children of the super-rich. One family took him to Ibiza on their luxury yacht. Another client was a Bin Laden. Bogyo looks slightly abashed when I bring this up. “They’re a huge family,” he explains. “And he’s a sweet kid.”He has vague plans to write an action caper based on his tutoring experiences, but is currently working on a comedy-drama about SATs, in which he hopes Abela will play a teacher. “The pressures bring out so many interesting qualities in parents and students alike,” he says. Then he heads off to rehearsals where a mock-up of his old Yale dorm room awaits.

Well, girl-women – one a bookish 16-year-old, the other her former 16-and-pregnant mother, the two often blended together into one fast-talking, quick-witted unit. They bantered at 2x speed. They drank cartoonish amounts of coffee – five cups by 8am, if the mother is to be believed. They riffed on everything from Rosemary’s Baby to RuPaul, Jack Kerouac to Britney Spears, West Side Story to Macy Gray. They were the Gilmore girls – Lorelai and Rory, arguably now the most famous and certainly one of the most beloved mother-daughter duos in TV history.Gilmore Girls, which ran from 2000 until 2007, was not a hit in its time. It never reached a wide audience, won any awards, or got the buzz of its more conventionally dramatic peers. But through word of mouth, DVD swaps, millennial nostalgia and the force of Netflix, the show, created by former Roseanne writer Amy Sherman-Palladino, has become one of the most enduring TV hits of the Y2K era, courting fans born long after it aired. (Between January and June 2023, the first seasonclocked over 82m viewson Netflix, where it has been one of the streamer’s most reliable library series since 2014.) Though a year-round show, its hallmarks – all that coffee, cosy knits, school uniforms – have made it synonymous with autumn, a season that does not exist in Burbank, California, where it filmed on a soundstage for the entirety of its run. Every September, like clockwork, viewersflockto fictional Stars Hollow, Connecticut, putting Gilmore Girls in the top 10 most streamed shows in the US.Lorelai, played by Lauren Graham, was a Bangles-obsessed Gen Xer, and Rory, played by a fresh-faced Alexis Bledel, was one of the first portraits of aflailing millennial protagonist. Yet the appeal of their bond – steadfast, supercharged, surrounded by small-town New England eccentrics – spans generations, from boomers who might relate to the frequently icy materfamilias, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), to gen Alpha teenagers drawn to Rory’s coming-of-age struggles. The same goes for the show’s signature rat-a-tat dialogue – a rapid-fire torrent of references and wisecracks. Nothing on TV before or since has nailed the machine-gun rhythm of Gilmore Girls in its prime, so punchy that Graham and co-star Scott Patterson (who played the gruff diner owner Luke) both had toquit smokingto keep up. (The standard Gilmore Girls scriptran 20 pages longerthan an average hour-long series, and filmed in far less time.)View image in fullscreenBreakout star … Melissa McCarthy in Gilmore Girls.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyLike the many beloved ensemble characters of Stars Hollow (pour one out for Miss Patty), Gilmore Girls was always a bit of an oddball. Swift, nimble and uncompromisingly clever, it shared little with the teen dramas popular with its target audience, such as Dawson’s Creek and, later, The OC and One Tree Hill. (Underscoring the show’s status as a diamond in the rough, Adam Brody and Chad Michael Murray both appeared here as early season bit players, before they left for greener pastures.) Unlike the teen soaps, Gilmore Girls focused on quotidian dramas; episodes revolved around Lorelei wearing aninappropriate outfitto a meeting with Rory’s dean, or Rory falling asleep with her boyfriend after a school dance, triggering afull matrilineal meltdown.Everyone has a go, everyone gets got, everyone is a little right and a little wrong, much is said and little changesIn the lane of My So-Called Life, which aired five years prior, Gilmore Girls aimed for emotional realism – the trials and tribulations of grades, boys, friends and prep school, the tangled web of relationships in a small town. I got into Gilmore Girls as a young teenager, poring over the DVDs with my middle school friends, drawn to Rory’s potent mix of relatable awkwardness and aspirational exceptionalism. She was both diffident and driven – unusual for a female protagonist – independent and terribly naive, uninterested in boys until she’s suddenly not (Jess Mariano hive rise). She was an antecedent to millennial shows that more thoroughly dissected their characters’ flaws – particularly Girls, fromnoted Gilmore Girls fanLena Dunham – and, for teen viewers, a lovably wide-eyed guide.Rewatching now, at 32 – the same age as Lorelei in the pilot – I am more fascinated by the show’s scope: a whole town’s worth of memorable characters, mostly women, orbiting around a central maternal lineage. Gilmore Girls was, at its core, about the intricacies of relationships – the ebbs and flows and chemistry and grievances between women, be they friends, such as Lorelei and her perennially sunny bestie Sookie (series breakout Melissa McCarthy), or family.View image in fullscreenFamily – in hyper-speed mode … Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop in Gilmore Girls.Photograph: Warner Bros. Tv/AllstarThe show excelled in mining the spiky push-pull out of the Gilmore Girls’ wildly different dispositions – how we love and resent and mirror our parents, how the apple can look so different, yet fall so close to the tree. I return, every now and then, to asequencefrom the sixth season – the last written by Sherman-Palladino, who departed with her husband/creative partner Daniel Palladino before theverboten seventh seasonover contractual disputes – after Rory has dropped out of Yale (girl!), reconciled with Lorelai and agreed to go to a restored Friday Night Dinner at her grandparents. Modelled on a Woody Allen movie, the dinner careens through shouting matches, tipsy conviviality and some of Emily’s most gloriously mean lines in the series (“I only wish I remembered to call her acocktailwaitress!”). The scene plays like a thesis for the show: everyone has a go, everyone gets got, everyone is a little right and a little wrong, much is said and little changes. And all, of course, on hyper-speed.Time has made the show’s blindspots, on race and LGBTQ+ representation and privilege, more glaring; it is especially obvious to me now how Rory’s exceptionalism was not her intelligence but her opportunities, afforded by rich grandparents and then by a rich boyfriend at an Ivy League school. And Lorelai’s trajectory from runaway teenage mother who found work as a maid to inn manager with a wraparound porch feels ever more like a television fantasy.But that’s perhaps giving a show famous for its obviously empty prop coffee cups too literal a read. For all its emotional dexterity, Gilmore Girls remains, primarily, a comfort show – nostalgic and chipper, its pitched banter and full diner and flip phones and soundtrack of “la la las” like a warm bath. It offers a fantasy of a small town with small concerns, and an unbreakable mother-daughter bond forged on unconditional love, shared youth, classic films and pancakes. Wherever they lead, you want to follow.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the threequel is the festival’s opening gala: Josh O’Connor is the principled young priest who finds himself in the frame when his fierce clerical superior is whacked – and Benoit has to find out the truth.The Secret AgentOne of the best films of the year – perhapsthebest. Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho sets his expansive, freewheeling dramedy-thriller during the 1970s Brazilian dictatorship and Wagner Moura plays a dissident scientist on the run from government forces who want to dispose of him. With its visual brilliance, sensual big-city intrigue and languorous mystery it feels like Elmore Leonard mixed with Antonioni’s The Passenger.The Ice TowerAn eerie and unwholesome spell is cast in this fairytale of deathwish yearning and erotic submission from Lucile Hadžihalilović, whose partner Gaspar Noé has a cameo as a seedy movie director. A teen runaway in 60s France with an obsession with Hans Christian Andersen’s Snow Queen breaks into a movie studio where this story is actually being filmed starring a magnificently chilly Marion Cotillard: it’s a dreamy and narcotic melodrama.Father Mother Sister BrotherJarmuschwon the Venice Golden Lionwith this diverting and beguiling anthology movie, whose cast includes Adam Driver, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore, Cate Blanchett and Tom Waits. It’s a triptych of family scenes: separate scenarios with mischievous, mysterious moments in which they appear to cosmically resonate with each other.BugoniaProlific Greek auteurYorgos Lanthimosis back with another macabre, startling and amusing film featuring his superstar muse Emma Stone. It’s a bizarre black comedy about online conspiracy delusion whose final, sensational montage of images sent Venice audiences reeling out of the auditorium. Stone plays an icy corporate CEO who is kidnapped by crazed eco-activist Jesse Plemons who is convinced she is an evil space alien.DreamsMexican auteur Michel Franco can be relied to deliver the shock factor, and so it proves again with this hypnotically disturbing, chilling satire-nightmare of erotic obsession among the liberal superrich in the US. Jessica Chastain plays a wealthy, entitled heiress (like one of the Roy family in TV’s Succession) who conceives an erotic obsession with one of the ballet stars in the dance school her family bankrolls.HamnetA creative take on the private life of William Shakespeare needs audacity — and directorChloé Zhaohas boldly taken on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about young William, his wife Anne Hathaway and the imagined heartbreak caused by the death of his young son Hamnet, that name so close to that of his great tragic hero. Paul Mescal is Shakespeare and as the grieving Anne, Jessie Buckley is already being spoken of as a best actress contender at the Academy Awards.The Voice of Hind RajabThis docufictional movie had tearful audiences on their feet at Venice: Tunisian film-maker Kaouther Ben Hania recounts the true story of the five-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who was stranded in her uncle’s car during a 2024 assault by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, and desperately stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, begging for help before she was killed, with many others. Ben Hania uses the real audio recording of the girl’s voice and has actors playing the agonised staff on the other end of the line.Die My LoveBig performances, big emotions and big scenes in this movie from Lynne Ramsay, who brings the gothic realist steam heat to this study of a lonely, passionate woman played byJennifer Lawrence– a performance which brings back memories of Gena Rowlands’ work for Cassavetes. Lawrence’s character has postpartum depression, left alone in the house all day with the baby, supposedly writing a novel, while her husband (Robert Pattinson) absents himself.The MastermindHere’s an art heist movie with a downbeat vibe:Kelly Reichardtgives us a non-hero who is anything but a mastermind here, wonderfully played by Josh O’Connor. He’s the art school dropout in the 1960s who conceives a bizarre get-rich-quick scheme: using his wealthy parents’ money, he pays a couple of tough guys and a getaway driver to help him steal paintings from a local gallery.H Is for HawkClaire Foy stars in this adaptation of the classic of nature-writing and memoir. She is Helen who suffers a near breakdown when her father dies and to process her grief and loss, trains a fierce goshawk named Mabel, which is as unsentimental a beast as could possibly be imagined – much prized for hunting. It’s a film perhaps to set alongside Kes?It Was Just an AccidentIranian director and democracy campaigner Jafar Panahi continues to work, continues to be harassed by the authorities, andwon the Cannes Palme d’Orthis year with this satirical suspenser about state violence and revenge. A man suffers an accident at night when his car hits a dog and the careworn mechanic helping out realises with a chill that he knows this man – and he must now exact revenge on him.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalFestivalsRian JohnsonJim JarmuschYorgos LanthimosChloé ZhaofeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a new one on us and yet, why not. All the best children’s stories have gory origins, from anonymous folklore to the Brothers Grimm. Here, the premise is fairly simple: zoo animals are becoming zombified and our heroes, a young wolf (Gabbi Kosmidis) and world-weary mountain lion (David Harbour) plus a growing posse of the non-zombified, must try to a) escape and b) put a stop to the zombification.It’s not the most complex premise – the Barker original, called Zoombies, is an unpublished short story – and this occasionally shows, in that there’s not an awful lot of narrative to go around. The film-makers address this by running a parallel commentary on the story beats and structure from one of the characters, a funny/annoying lemur, who is a horror-movie buff and who has seen all the classics of the genre. (Inspired, no doubt, by Randy from the Scream franchise, with the same flavour of meta analysis.) For children to whom this is an early encounter with that kind of smart aleck, media-savvy, reference-heavy humour, this may well prove delightfully witty, and it does have its moments for the older crowd too. But drawing attention to the film’s employment of tropes and formula isn’t really original enough for this lampshading approach to feel subversive.One of the commendable choices here – from an adult point of view – is that the zombie animals are genuinely fairly horrible, and depending on the children in question, this may well be even more of a bonus for them. A sufficiently horror-hungry kid with macabre taste and an appetite for all things ghoulish will get a kick out of a film that doesn’t hold back, while the more fainthearted little ones will be having nightmares for weeks. That may or may not be good thing – just send the makers of Night of the Zoopocalypse the dry cleaning bill.Night of the Zoopocalypse is in UK and Irish cinemas from 10 October, and in Australian cinemas from 16 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsHorror filmsClive BarkerComedy filmsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

As her superb music is rereleased, her family and fans recall a subcultural greatAlexis PetridisTue 7 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 16.19 EDTShareWhen Joanne Rosenthal was a kid inManchester, gatherings of her religious Jewish family were enlivened by the presence of her uncle’s eccentric wife. “Mad eye makeup; larger than life. You’d say to her: ‘Auntie Avril, can I give you some more chicken?’ And she’d say: ‘Go on, Joanne, my punters love me with a bit of meat on.’ Hang on, what are you talking about, yourpunters?”There would be other “tantalising references to her career on stage” besides, but no further info. “Everyone’s sitting there at Passover or Jewish New Year and no one asks any follow-up questions!” Rosenthal continues. “It’s like everyone accepts that Auntie Avril is this subversive presence. When I told her I was getting into music, she said: ‘Quit school, join a band, get on the road, never look back – you won’t regret it.’ It was a very humdrum, suburban, conformist, normative environment and she kept … going off script.”It was only after her aunt died that Rosenthal really understood the full extent of what had been going on. “I went to help my uncle clear her stuff, and when I walked into the living room, it was like a shrine to her career. Boxes of stuff, floor to ceiling. Posters, flyers, photos, studio masters, tapes, obsolete media like videos, boxes and boxes of correspondence, letters she’d written to Factory Records and EMI.”View image in fullscreenAvril A and friend in a promotional image, date unknownShe had uncovered her aunt’s extraordinary double life: by day, she was Avril Eventhal, a housewife in north Manchester’s Orthodox Jewish community; by night, she was Avril A, star of the city’s gay clubs. She made fabulously low-rent hi-NRG records called things like Hard Up for a Man, Sex Slaves of New Orleans and Man Power – collected on a new compilation, Housewife Superstar – and entirely bizarre videos, somewhere between surrealist performance art and standup comedy: “They’re sort of unsettling,” says Rosenthal, “because they don’t make sense, they’re not wholly sincere and they’re not wholly taking the piss.”But it was for her chaotic live performances that she was locally renowned, despite what you might tactfully call her limitations as a vocalist (“I sound horrendous,” she told one interviewer). “This small round-faced woman with ruddy cheeks, spinning and twirling around wearing a costume that looked like it had been run up on a home sewing machine, topped off with a bright feather boa,” remembers Glenn Routledge, who ended up booking her to perform at the Haçienda. “Avril’s twirling created an apprehension that she was going to fall over, and the singing was sometimes off-key. At first I thought it wasn’t for real and perhaps it was someone’s idea of a joke – I was wrong. The crowd loved and encouraged her … I became an instant Avril A fan.”Other fans were more direct in expressing their devotion. “At one gig in Blackpool, a fan chased her round the stage with a bottle of poppers,” says Adrian Gonnord-Luty, who went from seeing her live to being employed as her driver. “I would have intervened, but it was one of her best gigs!”She had attempted to start a musical career in more conventional circumstances, slogging around the north-west’s pubs and clubs playing MOR rock, much to her “very, very, very religious” family’s disapproval, her progress hampered by what Rosenthal tactfully calls her “unconventional voice”.“Then she organically found the gay scene, where it all clicked,” she says. “She got booked to play at a club called Manhattan Sound near Deansgate – the Smiths played an early gig there. She didn’t know it was a gay club, but her cab driver told her, you know, ‘it’s a gay night, you’d better watch out’. She didn’t care. And I think that night she realised ‘these are my people’. It wasn’t macho guys being sexist jerks, shouting abuse and throwing bottles – she felt safe. And they had a sense of the ridiculous that worked for her. So she became this kind of cross between a northern, working-class Divine and [infamously off-key Cuban singer] Margarita Pracatan.View image in fullscreenFlyer for an Avril A performance at The New Hero’s, Manchester.Photograph: Courtesy Joanne Rosenthal“When I first saw videos of her performing, I thought ‘this is the Susan Sontag definition of camp, it’s so bad, it’s good’. She’s in a leopard print dress, carrying a feather duster, doing these robotic and seemingly nonsensical choreographed routines, engaging with the crowd in a very sweet, loving kind of way. Whenever I’ve reached out to her fans and asked her what the appeal was, the common thread is always ‘I didn’t know what to think, I didn’t know how I was supposed to react’. I think when people disarm you like that, they get you, they grab your attention.”She became a genuine underground phenomenon, billing herself as “fat, 40 and flirty”. She swiftly took on managers, appeared on local radio and got a deal with a tiny indie label: “My favourite discovery was a local chart from the Manchester Evening News,” says Rosenthal. “Joy Division are at No 1, and Avril A’s right at the bottom. She played in London once, supporting the Three Degrees at the London Palladium – I know! – but it was Manchester where she became a legend. Her husband was very supportive, he went along to lots of gigs, but I think he was slightly bemused by it. She used to say ‘he doesn’t really understand’.”Nor, it seemed, did anyone else in the Orthodox Jewish community. “I went for a meeting at her house once,” says Gonnord-Luty, “and she opened the door wearing her full stage outfit – leopard-print dress, white bootees, feathers in her hair. She stepped outside, kissed me on the cheek, and said ‘can you see the neighbours’ net curtains twitching?’ I could. She said: ‘Good – it’ll give them something to gossip about.’”Rosenthal suggests her outcast status might have informed a more serious side to her success. “She performed a lot of Aids benefits, she was successful at a very traumatic time for the gay community. And she was a sort of maternal figure: she got a lot of fanmail from young gay men, pouring their hearts out. One says his family have disowned him and he isn’t invited to his brother’s wedding, and he’s asking her what to do. And she wrote back saying, ‘My family don’t really want much to do with me, it’s only my husband’s family will see me – it’s their loss. As Gloria Gaynor said: we will survive’.”View image in fullscreenAt home with AvrilAn ankle injury brought her career to an end in the early 90s. “It shook her confidence, and she stopped performing,” says Gonnord-Luty. “I think she had a breakdown. I tried to get her out – we went to Flesh at the Haçienda and she was mobbed, everyone wanted to know when she would perform again. She just said ‘soon’, but we didn’t stay long. She was overwhelmed.”She never really made a comeback and died in 2017. That would have been that, had Rosenthal, a professional museum and gallery curator, not assembled the stuff she found in her late aunt’s living room into an archive. When she gave a presentation about Avril A in Sheffield, a mutual friend alerted audio-visual archivist Alex Wilson, whose label Memory Dance specialises in “work from the archival fringes” – previous releases have featured avant garde jazz, electronica and post-punk.You might consider Avril A wonkily ploughing through her signature song Paris Is for Lovers to be out of the label’s remit, but Wilson says he sees her “in that wonderful lineage of eccentric British outsider artists … People who ploughed on for the sake of it, not the fame of it. Of course, Avril was different because she wanted fame, but the fact that she never made it yet inspired a devoted faithful was so touching to me, I knew it would resonate.” And besides, he thinks her forgotten recordings have a value in the grim climate of 2025. “As soon as Avril came into my headspace it screamed pure joy, happiness, and a proper northern laugh. And we all need a bit of that,” he says. “Especially now”.Housewife Superstar is out now on Memory DanceThis article was updated on Tuesday 7 October to correct Adrian Gonnord-Luty’s surname.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockCabaretManchesterGreater ManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Impressed? OK, what if I told you that all this merely describes the first album on the shortlist?Such is the radical eclecticism of female trioAdwaith’s Solas, a double album, sung in Welsh and recorded in various locations including the Outer Hebrides and the drummer’s parents’ barn. How, I wondered – just 20 minutes into a playlist of 15 albums that stretched over 10 hours – was anything expected to beat this?When I agreed to be a judge for this year’s WMP, now in its 15th year, it wasn’t as if I was unaware of the strength and diversity of Welsh music. Previous winners have included Joanna Gruesome’s noise-pop debut Weird Sister, harpist Georgia Ruth’s Week of Pines andlast year’s winnerBlood, Sweat & Fears by rapper Lemfreck.But still, there were dazzling records on this shortlist by artists I’d never even heard of, though in the case of Tai Haf Heb Drigolyn’s Ein Albwm Cyntaf Ni, my ignorance can perhaps be excused given that was only physically released on a limited edition cassette run of 50, and its biggest bit of press to date seems to be an enthusiastic endorsement from 67-year-old punk poet Attila the Stockbroker in the Morning Star. It turned out to be a defiantly lo-fi yet irrepressibly melodic way to spend half an hour.I had my own favourites on the list – indeed, I had to resist wearing myTubsT-shirt for the judging session for fear that it might have been deemed a subversive attempt to swing the jury in favour of my favourite indie band in years. The Tubs’ debut Dead Meat hijacked my stereo throughout 2024 in a way that bordered on obsessional. Cotton Crown was a strong follow-up, not least because the band’s ability to marry sunny jangle-pop with sharp lyrics about deteriorating mental health reached its zenith on the final track Strange, in which singer Owen Williams opened up about the suicide of his mother, the musician and writerCharlotte Greig. Choosing to focus on the more peculiar aspects of grief nobody prepares you for – the way friends would only bring it up when they were high, the things Williams might say to play it down (“I say it makes me more interesting / Then we laugh, and then it’s all fine”) – this was evidence that Williams is one of the most insightful lyricists around at the moment.Kelly Lee Owens’Dreamstatealso made a big impression on me – a synth-driven reframing of daydreaming as an act of resistance to capitalism. It opened with precision-honed dancefloor tracks but also slowed down the tempo for a few ballads in its relentless quest for transcendence.Other judges on the panel passionately championed their own choices. We went through the shortlist album by album, covering anthemic emo (Breichiau Hir’s Y Dwylo Uwchben), uplifting Taylor Swift-esque pop (teenage singer Buddug’s Rhwng Gwyll a Gwawr), inventive solo piano compositions (Cerys Hafana’s Difrisg), diaristic dreamscapes (Gwenno’s Utopia), Emitt Rhodes-style power pop (Keys’ Acid Communism), cinematic electronica (Siula’s Night Falls on the World), drunken punk (Panic Shack’s self-titled debut) and – what else? – a psychedelic concept album about a utopian village in which the local mill is powered by music (Melin Melyn’s Mill on the Hill). The Gentle Good’s Elan was notable for its track Desert of Wales, a collaboration with Rajasthani folk pioneers SAZ. Sage Todz’s Stopia Cwyno (which translates as Stop Moaning) involved the rapper exploring his own version of Welsh patriotism.And yet despite the formidable competition, there was one record that seemed to encapsulate everything so vital and vibrant about this shortlist. Don Leisure is the stage name of producer Aly Jamal, a crate-digging hip-hop artist who was invited to get inventive with the freshly digitised catalogue ofesteemed and historic Welsh label Sain. Like a one-man Welsh Avalanches, Jamal dived into the nooks and crannies of the catalogue, digging out some extremely niche cuts from the 60s and 70s – alongside more present-day recordings – and transforming them into fresh new sounds. It wasn’t just that I hadn’t heard this source material before – I had no idea Welsh music had ever sounded like this.‘Together in creativity for peace!’ Sain, the indie label pushing Welsh music forward for 56 yearsRead moreListen to Tyrchu Sain blind and you’d probably guess its source material was taken from across the globe – there are harpsichords, spiritual chants, psychedelic rock riffs. Even the more traditional material, such as Delwyn Sion’s Aros yn Dy Gwmni, is given a crackling makeover: Gruff Rhys is enlisted to transform Sion’s original into a gorgeously dreamy outsider pop song.Jamal has talked about how digging into the history of Welsh music led to him think about his own family’s roots in India and east Africa. That’s maybe the genius of Tyrchu Sain: that it feels like a tour of the world as well as a tour of Welsh music history; a record that encompasses the past, present and burning bright future of Welsh music.Explore more on these topicsMusicAwards and prizesPop and rockHip-hopFolk musicPunkPsychedeliacommentShareReuse this content"

Threw up’: 10 extraordinary life lessons from Ozzy Osbourne’s new memoirThe man who ended up smoking 30 cigars a day after trying to quit cigarettes also comes across in his book as level-headed, self-aware and savagely funny. Here’s what the late rock legend can teach us about addiction, fame and how to choose just the right support actElle HuntTue 7 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 05.32 EDTShare“Here’s the thing, man,” wonders the lateOzzy Osbournein his new memoir. “Why would anyone want life advice fromme?”Yes, hegave us Iron Man, War Pigs, Planet Caravan and so many other metal classics. But, by his own admission, Osbourne was also a criminal, a cheat and an addict, who routinely risked his and others’ lives and bit the head off a bat. (In his defence, he says, he thought it was a toy.)For all his mistakes and misdemeanours, however, Osbourne comes off well in Last Rites (written with Chris Ayres): self-aware, level-headed and savagely funny, and not just by rock star standards.Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home review – an extremely moving look into the rock icon’s final monthsRead moreOsbournedied in July aged 76, less than three weeks after performing with the original Black Sabbath. Like a dispatch from beyond the grave, Last Rites documents his struggles behind the scenes with Parkinson’s disease, high-stakes spinal surgery in 2019 and successive complications.But it wasn’t all bad, Osbourne adds, typically self-effacing: he also voiced King Thrash in Trolls World Tour, and made a song with Post Malone.Reflecting on his golden rule as the “Prince of Darkness”, he writes: “I had 70 great years, which is a lot longer than I ever expected or probably deserved.” Here are 10 takeaways.View image in fullscreenBlack Sabbath in the 1970s, from left: Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Ozzy.Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage1. Where there’s a will, there’s a wayOsbourne credits his career to his dad, who bought him a 50-watt PA system on hire purchase for £250 – £2,000-3,000 in today’s money, and an “astronomical sum” for a factory-worker father-of-six in Birmingham.Ozzy’s greatest regret was that he never thanked him: “Without that PA system, I’d never have left Aston.”Aged 19, and fresh out of prison (for burglary), Osbourne put together his first band: the Polka Tulk Blues Band, named after his mum’s preferred brand of talcum powder. But they were always metal, in spirit if not yet in name.Tony Iommi, the guitarist and “unofficial leader” of Black Sabbath, lost the tips of two fingers in an industrial accident. Not to be dissuaded, “He just invented himself a set of new fingertips using an old Fairy Liquid bottle, then re-taught himself how to play,” Osbourne writes.Later Ozzy displayed the same resolve and enterprising spirit to get high, befriending every crooked medical professional who’d write him a prescription. “At one point I had more friends who were dental anaesthesiologists than the average dental anaesthesiologist did.”View image in fullscreenOzzy in his hot tub at his Beverly Hills mansion, 1982.Photograph: Eddie Sanderson/Getty Images2. Anything can be addictive if you’re an addictAs a “world-class” drug addict and alcoholic, Osbourne’s tastes had a tendency to escalate. One pint of Guinness led to nine more, then cocaine, then pills; an attempt to quit smoking resulted in him smoking 30 cigars a day.His only saving grace, Osbourne writes, was that he had “never, ever wanted to shoot up … Needles just freak me out, man.” More or less everything else was fair game, narcotic or no.Ozzy describes being addicted to all manner of drugs, of course, but also sex, fame, fast cars, Yorkshire Tea, English sweets, doodling, wordsearch books, “texting funny shit” to his mates and Peter Gabriel’s album So, which he played so much upon its release that his security guard was forced to take stress leave.At one point, Osbourne was eating so much ice-cream (vanilla and chocolate only, “sometimesstrawberry”), he decided it would be more cost-effective to hire a chef to make it for him. “Big mistake … After a few weeks, I became pre-diabetic.”Even his healthier habits spiralled out of control. In Los Angeles, Osbourne got hooked on apples, and “none of that granny smith bullshit”: they had to be pink ladies, hand-selected from the uber-expensive LA grocer Erewhon. At his peak, Osbourne was eating 12 a night. “I guess I’m a recovered apple-a-holic now.”3. You can buy the Ferrari(s). It doesn’t mean you can driveView image in fullscreenOzzy and another new car, a Volvo, in 1982. He finally passed his driving test at his 19th attempt.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesOsbourne’s last bender was in 2012. “The first sign of trouble,” he writes, was when he bought a Ferrari 458 Italia, then a second Ferrari 458 Italia, then an Audi R8 – despite never having learned to drive.He sat his test in LA: a “piece of piss”, Osbourne writes. “All you’ve gotta do is drive around the block at this place in Hollywood and not crash into anything. They don’t even make you park, never mind do a hill start.”But once back in Buckinghamshire, the Californian driving licence went to Ozzy’s head. He started drinking and driving to High Wycombe to buy coke. “To this day, I have absolutely no memory of ever going to High Wycombe.”Sharon – still in LA, making her TV Show The Talk – eventually got wind, sold all of his cars and got him into AA. “That one bender cost me north of half a million quid.”4. Don’t try that stunt at homeIn 2018, Ozzy was five years sober, a few months off turning 70 and busy preparing for his farewell tour, No More Tours II. (The first No More Tours tour, in the 90s, had been billed as his farewell “before I realised there’s only so much time you can spend in your back garden wearing wellies”.)Life was good, as evinced by his hi-tech bed. Osbourne describes it as having “a “bigger brain than ChatGPT”, with two remotes for him and Sharon to each adjust their separate sides and “motors, wires and gear wheels”.Ever since he was a boy – and through his marriage, much to Sharon’s displeasure – Osbourne had always taken to bed with a flying leap. One night in 2018, he got up to relieve himself before returning to bed with his usual stage-dive. This time, however, he landed on the floor, hard.“To this day, I don’t understand how the fuck I could have missed it … It’s like having a Sherman tank parked in the middle of the room.”5. Always get a second opinion … and read the small printView image in fullscreenOzzy, Sharon and their children Jack and Kelly in the MTV series The Osbournes.Photograph: Getty ImagesIn 2003, while filming The Osbournes,Ozzy had crashed his quad bike, broken his neck and spent eight days in a chemical coma. The failed stage-dive into bed, 15 years later, dislodged the metal holding his shoulders and spine together, necessitating intrusive surgery.Though Osbourne was advised to get a second opinion about having surgery, he wound up going ahead with a specialist he dubbed “Dr No Socks … ’cos he didn’t wear any”. For years after the procedure, he struggled to recover and suffered serious illnesses such as sepsis and pneumonia.Together with the Covid-19 pandemic, this forced the delay, then the cancellation, of No More Tours II, sparking online rumours of Osbourne’s death. At one point he was in intensive care. “I’d never taken so many drugs in my life, which was fucking saying something.”Though Ozzy did not blame Dr No Socks, he regretted not getting a second opinion, he writes. “It’s hard to imagine it could have turned out any worse.”Osbourne’s other big regret was not checking the fine print of his first contract with Black Sabbath. Not comprehending the term “in perpetuity” cost the band their publishing rights, which were signed over to “a bloke called David Platz, who died in the nineties”, and since then his children.Once Osbourne asked his accountant how much that mistake had cost him. The accountant replied reluctantly, and only after being pressed, that it was roughly £100m. “I had to go and sit down.”6. Always leave an impressionView image in fullscreenA ‘world-class’ addict … Ozzy at home in 1988.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesOzzy is ambivalent about Black Sabbath’s devilish reputation, and his own as the “Prince of Darkness” (“not that I knew who the fuck John Milton was”).His first musical love was Cliff Richard; later, he was starstruck meeting Phil Collins. Of the teenage girls who used to run out of Sabbath gigs screaming, he writes: “You’ve gotta remember, a lot more people went to church back then.”Nonetheless, when asked by Sharon to “make an impression” at a big meeting with his American label in 1980, Osbourne’s response was to pull a live dove out of his jacket pocket, having stashed it there for a vaguely-thought-out stunt about peace – and bite its head off. “The place went absolutely fucking nuts. People screaming. Crying. Throwing up.”Osbourne adds that he was 36 hours into a 72-hour bender. “The poor dove didn’t deserve it,” but it did help with the marketing drive for his solo album, Blizzard of Ozz. “People thought I was an absolute fucking lunatic.”Decades later, when Covid hit, Osbourne was shaken by the risks he’d run with the dove and then the bat in Des Moines (though, again – he thought it was a toy). “Of all the bullets I’ve ever dodged, not catching some mutant virus … has gotta be right up there.”View image in fullscreen‘Thirty-cigars-a-day’ Ozzy, with his assistant, Tony Dennis, in May 1988.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images7. Choose your opening act carefullyFor all its occultish stylings, Black Sabbath was “the kind of band that went on stage in our jeans and leather jackets”, Osbourne writes – “a male band … for male audiences”. They struggled when metal started to shift towards spectacle.Picking Kiss to open for their mid-70s tour was a mistake, Osbourne writes, remembering their Spandex jumpsuits, bared nipples, extravagant facepaint and “half a ton of explosives”. Sabbath bassist Geezer “almost had a heart attack” at Gene Simmons, 7ft tall in platforms, waggling his tongue.Meanwhile, “The closest I got to a sexy album cover was me in a werewolf costume,” Osbourne writes. They thought they’d learned their lesson: “You wanted your support act to be good, but didn’t want to upstage yourself. You wanted Status Quo, basically.”Instead, for their 1978 tour, Sabbath wound up booking a little-known LA outfit called Van Halen. After he watched 20,000 jaws drop at Eddie Van Halen’s futuristic performance of Eruption, Osbourne recalls “going back to our dressing room in silence and just sitting there, staring at the fucking wall”. Every night of the tour, Van Halen “just slaughtered us”.8. Marry someone who makes you feel like Ozzy, not JohnView image in fullscreenOzzy and Sharon Osbourne in 2007.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersOsbourne met Sharon through her father, Don Arden, Black Sabbath’s early manager. When Paranoid came out, in 1970, she was about 18 and working as his receptionist.Sharon’s first memory of Ozzy, he writes, was when he came into the office “with no shoes on”. His first memory of her was thinking, some time later, “Wow, what a good-looking chick.”They eventually married (after Osbourne’s divorce) in 1982 in Hawaii; Ozzy concluded the occasion at 5am, passed out in the hotel corridor. “The only consummating that went on was between me and every bottle of booze they had.”Despite their ups and downs (with the nadir of Osbourne being charged with attempting to murder Sharon in 1989, precipitating a five-month separation), Osbourne credits his wife with getting him sober and saving his life.Before, he says, he was living a split existence as John Osbourne, “the guy who lived in a quaint English village, drove a Range Rover and wore wellies”, and Ozzy the rock star. “Once I married Sharon, John never came back … ‘I like you as Ozzy,’ was all she said.”After Osbourne sobered up, Sharon confiscated all tempting substances and stashed them in the “loft of no return” – including a bottle of Scotch kindly sent to him after his quad bike accident, by the now King Charles.9. Interesting people are interesting doing nothing. But it doesn’t have to be broadcastThe Osbournes arguably invented reality TV, but as with much in Ozzy’s life, he writes, it happened by accident.He’d been approached about basing a sitcom on his life, “kind of a rock’n’roll Addams Family”, he writes. But after seeing the Osbournes’ 2000 episode of MTV’s celebrity-home tour show Cribs, “the TV people were like, fuck it, let’s just stick some cameras in their house and see what happens”.Osbourne’s subsequent ascent to “Tom Cruise or Meryl Streep”-level fame went to his head. After four seasons, the entire family was “desperate to get our lives back”, he writes.“I’m fucked if I know how the Kardashians have lasted this long … When the final camera guy left, it was such a relief, man. To take a shit without a boom mic over your head.”Ozzy was likewise sceptical of social media. The expectation to broadcast “if you so much as scratch your bollocks” made him feel wistful for his childhood, when he could stop and smell the roses. “Not that there were many roses in Aston.”10. Ageing is a privilegeView image in fullscreenOzzy during the photo shoot for his Diary of a Madman album, 1981.Photograph: Fin Costello/RedfernsBefore his bed-diving injury in 2018, 69-year-old Osbourne was counting himself lucky to be alive.Many of his peers from the 1970s and 1980s – David Bowie, George Michael, Tom Petty, Michael Jackson, Motörhead’s Lemmy – had died. Meanwhile, Ozzy was planning a tour, despite having lived just as hard, if not harder.In his 30s, Osbourne knocked back four bottles of cognac a day; he later travelled with his coke dealer (or “blow butler”) and had to pop nine pills at once, just “to get a buzz on”. After a near-miss combining codeine and vodka, Osbourne switched to barbiturates – used for euthanasia and the death penalty – because he “thought they were safer”, he writes.It wasn’t just the drugs and the alcohol that he was lucky to survive. In 1982, Osbourne’s tour bus was clipped by a light plane, which crashed into a house, killing his guitarist Randy Rhoads, makeup artist Rachel Youngblood and the pilot; Osbourne was sleeping inside the bus at the time. The quad bike accident 20 years later nearly left him paralysed; instead he was rebuilt into a literal Iron Man, “half-man, half-rivet”.By the time it came to writing Last Rites, Osbourne had made his peace with his mortality. Indeed, he was marvelling that he’d made it this far. “Death’s been knocking at my door for the last six years, louder and louder … At some point, I’m gonna have to let him in.”Last Rites by Ozzy Osbourne with Chris Ayres is published by Little, Brown (£25).

The germ of her book was the idea that “the Soviet Union’s First Ladies were a reflection of the country’s fate”. But on a deeper level, Motherland suggests that the way women are treated – and what happens to them when they refuse to accept that treatment – says a lot about the mindset and culture of a place. Perhaps it says everything.Ioffe and her family left the Soviet Union for the US in 1990, when she was seven years old, which makes her superbly placed to tell this story. Two of her great-grandmothers were doctors; another had a PhD in chemistry and ran her own lab; one of her grandmothers oversaw the plant that supplied the Kremlin’s drinking water. In the context of US history, she writes, these women might be considered exceptional, but in their own country, they were “perfectly average people”. A great unasked question permeates this book: how did we get from the civilisation that produced these kinds of extraordinary “ordinary” women to the Russia we see today?Interspersed with flashes of memoir, family stories and journalistic encounters, the book acts as a gender-inflected primer on the past hundred years of Russian history. It assumes – not unreasonably – that most readers will be unfamiliar with names such as Alexandra Kollontai (diplomat, Marxist feminist), Nadezhda Krupskaya (politician, champion of co-education, Lenin’s wife), Inessa Armand (Bolshevik propagandist, Lenin’s lover) and Nadezhda and Svetlana Alliluyeva (respectively, Stalin’s wife and daughter). Opening with stories of overlooked or misunderstood figures from pre-revolutionary times, Ioffe progresses to encounters with Pussy Riot, anti-war campaigners, and Yulia Navalnaya, widow of opposition politician Alexei Navalny.View image in fullscreenPolitician Nadezhda K Krupskaya.Photograph: Gainew Gallery/AlamyShe writes with warmth, charisma and exuberance and is adept at zooming in and out, mixing precise personal detail with broad historical insights. Motherland is packed with data: at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, women made up 40% of the workforce – and therefore were at the heart of the founding of the Soviet Union (which was, of course, a movement that valued class above gender or any other distinction). The 1930s saw many “fathers of the revolution” being purged – but, as Ioffe points out, “tens of thousands of Soviet women were arrested simply for being the wives of men who had been arrested”. Twenty-thousand women were processed by one camp alone, Akmolinsk Camp for Wives of Traitors to the Motherland.Ioffe’s family history crosses the old borders of the Soviet Union – with ancestors born in both Russia and Ukraine – and at no point does her narrative stray into a hand-wringing plea for Russia. Indeed, this book works well as a complement to Ukrainian writer Olia Hercules’s family memoir Strong Roots, which explains the last century of Ukrainian history and culture through the eyes of female relatives with a matching level of engagement and flair.The characters Ioffe brings back to life are both eyewitnesses and canaries in the coalmine. She remembers her grandmother Emma pointing out the Moscow house of Lavrentiy Beria (Stalin’s grotesque henchman), the address etched in her memory because of the need, when she was a girl, to steer clear of the home of a notorious rapist. In the present day, Emma cannot be buried in the country of her birth because it is not safe for any of the family to return with her ashes. And while this is a history focused on women, it is Ioffe’s father who supplies one of its more memorable lines in his warning that “our homeland [is] a country without a future”. Although she still dreams at night of the Moscow she knew as a child, she realises he is right. Motherland is her cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed explanation of how it got that way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Inadequate staff training coupled with jammed fire doors aiding the spread of the fire and the subsequent release of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas from burning laminates resulted in the deaths of 159 people. The disaster was initially blamed on one of the passengers – a lorry driver and convicted arsonist. The fact that this suspect was also one of the fire’s casualties and thus unable to refute the charges against him was almost certainly part of the reason why the truth about the tragedy took so long to come to light. In 2020, a six-hour documentary revealed that the fire had most likely been started deliberately as part of an insurance fraud.In the first volume of Asta Olivia Nordenhof’s Scandinavian Star sequence,Money to Burn, an unnamed narrator is travelling on a bus through Copenhagen when she finds her attention drawn to an elderly man on the street outside. As the bus moves away, she has the “eerie sense” that she is carrying a part of him with her. Compelled to travel the same route again in search of him, the narrator finds herself in a landscape that is at once alien and deeply familiar. She introduces us to Maggie and Kurt, a couple whose feelings for each other are struggling to survive the pressures of their conflicted pasts. In that book’s final pages, we learn that the root of Kurt’s disaffection might possibly be found in the shattering effects of a bad investment made on his behalf by a man known as T.The Devil Book opens with an extended prose poem in which the narrator informs us of her struggle to write T’s story. “In this volume, two,” she writes, “we were supposed / to follow him/ from childhood up until / the night / when he sat waiting for / the news that / the fire / on the Scandinavian Star / had successfully been / set.” Overwhelmed by the task she has set herself and thrown off course by the pandemic, she approaches the story obliquely, as a form of parable. “I came to think / that I / can do / whatever I want / so this / is my book / this is / for you / this is / an erotic thriller / about businessmen and / the devil.”A tale gradually emerges of a woman who spends lockdown in London with a virtual stranger and who over the course of those weeks relates to him what happened to her a decade before, when she accepted an offer from a man who claimed to be the devil to grant all her wishes, so long as she didn’t question his motives in doing so. As the threads of the two stories become more intertwined, we begin to suspect that they are one and the same – or at the very least that the identity of T is legion, for there are devils everywhere.There is another fire here: a passionate, magnetic commitment to writing as a political actLiterature teaches us that it is the devil who does deals, not God, and that we engage in them at our peril. But what if the narrator herself is the devil? A third narrative comes finally to light – the story of a girl whose childhood was marred by abuse and who spent time in a psychiatric hospital, under pressure to conform with societal norms or suffer more of the same. “[The devil] knows that in the game you’ve set for it, there are two outcomes: submit or remain a monster.” A third way out is finally revealed through a series of poems to the night that are also a call to arms against the forces of capital.Many British readers of Nordenhof’s Scandinavian Star novels will think immediately of the Grenfell Tower fire, which although accidental in origin shares similarities in that the resulting tragedy and loss of life can be blamed at least partly on the devil’s bargain of putting profit over people. In these first two volumes of what is projected to be a seven-book series, the fire on board the ferry and the series of fraudulent business deals that ended in mass murder are a sinister background presence, revealing themselves only in brief flashes of detail or inference yet casting a deepening shadow over everything that occurs. Some readers may question how far it is possible to read The Devil Book as a stand-alone work, when its purpose and meaning is so intricately bound into a larger whole whose final form, at this stage, is unknowable.There will be others – and I count myself as one of them – who will fall in love with Nordenhof’s project purely as text, as properly experimental writing whose moral and artistic purpose are so deeply entwined as to make them inextricable. “Write poems / for we need / that too.” There is another fire here: a passionate, magnetic commitment to writing as a political act. I will continue to follow this series, wherever it goes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The beige rectangular tupperware that contained its wires would, when connected to a TV by the aerial, bring a serviceable Pong copy to the screen.View image in fullscreenArcade fire … East German attractions at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumAt the time, they thought the home-brewed device was a singular example of ingenuity behind the iron curtain. But earlier this year they found anotherSeifendosen-Pong (“soap-box Pong”), along with a copy of a state-produced magazine called FunkAmateurcontaining schematics for a DIY variety of Atari’s 1970s gaming sensation.The discovery rubbed up against received wisdom that the dawn of computer gaming had at best been tolerated and at worst suppressed by socialist EastGermany. Instead, here was evidence that gaming enjoyed a level of official support, including from the regime’s notorious secret service.A new joint exhibit from the Allied Museum and the Computer Games Museum in Berlin brings cold war gaming curios from both sides of the iron curtain to light, including East Germany’s only arcade cabinet, the Poly-Play, which visitors can try out. With honey-coloured wooden panels and a brightly lit typeface, only 2,000 of the machines were made. In the late 80s, adolescents would crowd the cabinets at youth clubs and holiday retreats, to the extent they were available, where they could play a number of games cloned from western originals.But the Poly-Play “was only possible with help from state security,” says Veit Lehmann of the Allied Museum. Lacking programming expertise and manpower, manufacturer VEB Polytechnick turned to the Stasi for help. They were the ones with “the experts and the computing capability” to code the games.Instead of Pac–Man, there was Hase und Wolf–a canine-dodging hare swapped for Namco’s famous cheese-wheel-shaped ghost-evader. There was Hirschjagd(“Deer Hunt”), a repackaged take on the sci-fi shooter Robotron: 2084.There was Schießbude,a copy of a carnival shooting game; a butterfly-collecting title called Schmetterling;a memory puzzler; a skiing game and a racing game among the rest.View image in fullscreenTamed … the Poly-Play Hase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) game.Photograph: VEB Polytechnik Karl-Marx-StadtThe Poly-Play was many East Germans’ first encounter with computers, and it “opened up a completely different world for them”, says Regina Seiwald at the University of Birmingham. “The Poly-Play was seen as a machine for the whole family, who’d enjoy a weekend, go for a walk and then jointly play on one. It was seen as an innocent pastime, but with a bit of technical skills training added in.”But, as arcade-goers in the west commandeered tanks in Battlezone or blasted dragons from jetpack-propelled gunners in Space Harrier, the Poly-Play had all notions of violence removed. The GDR liked to present itself as an idyllic, peace-loving state, and its media law deemed all forms of “calls to violence” unconstitutional. “The GDR’s attitude towards computers was an idea of a harmonic self-image and a fear of the unknown,” Seiwald says.Yet, away from the Poly-Play and its PG approach to gaming, self-described “freaks” gathered at computer clubs to test the tolerance of the police state. The east declared technology an economic priority in the late 1970s but, with the CoCom trade embargo blocking exports to the socialist bloc, western technology was only available through smuggling routes, with ZX Spectrums sewn into car seats or hidden in chocolate boxes for cross-border journeys.View image in fullscreenLong arm of the state … an exhibit at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsState factories did produce their own machines – such as the Bildschirmspiel 01 pong clone and the VEB Robotron series of microcomputers – but only in small numbers. High price tags made them unattainable for most.As early enthusiasts began to establish clubs at universities and youth centres from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig, the state wondered if this youthful interest could help carve a path out of its technical quandary. “They thought if young people spent their time with games and computers, they might develop something better,” says Lehmann. Perhaps, the state thought, this interest could stir new generations into careers in microelectronics, where they might develop much-needed homegrown chips.An oft-repeated phrase among GDR officials, adds Martin Görlich, managing director of the Computer Games Museum, was that “learning from the Soviet Union means learning how to win”. So embracing computing echoed the position of the USSR, which also had arcade games – Frankenstein-like hybrids that blended physical action with screens – and ran its own computer clubs.View image in fullscreenEastern blocks … ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumOf course,the USSR also gave birth to Tetris, the fast-paced puzzler designed by software engineer Alexey Pajitnov to test a new computer. (The game was initially traded between engineers, but led to a dramatic race to secure distribution rights from the Soviet Union between Dutch-born game designer Henk Rogers and Kevin Maxwell, son of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell.)Over in East Germany, citizens often relied on bootlegs to get around restrictions or shortages. Would-be fashionistas stitched their own clothes, musicians cobbled together audio equipment, and enterprising sorts hand-painted banned board games such as Monopoly, with Mayfair swapped for Karl-Marx-Allee and a party conference square taking the place of jail.A DIY approach to computing was thus in keeping with the state’s policy of self-reliance, where civilians were encouraged to knit, build, tinker and repair all they could. Official magazines such as FunkAmateurand Jugend und Technik responded by promoting games – which they called “computer sports” – and publishing programming code. “The GDR was very aware of the constraints it had in technology,” says Seiwald. “People educating themselves in technology, or pushing the boundaries of what was available, was viewed positively.”Tantalisingly for young hobbyists, some of the computer clubs, such as the House of Young Talents in ast Berlin, possessed much-desired Commodore 64 machines, which were far superior to the GDR’s domestic equivalents. Most club attendees were young and male and, unsurprisingly, interested in games above all else.Some learned to code their own games on state computers such as the KC 85 by VEB Mikroelektronik, while others played them, such as René Meyer, who was 16 when he was introduced to a computer club at the University of Leipzig.“The GDR’s home computers were not compatible with other systems, creating a unique ecosystem for computing in the east,” says Meyer, whose favourite game was Bennion Geppy, its hero tasked with traversing dungeon rooms, dodging monsters and collecting keys.Paradoxically, while the state seemed to support these groups – club-goers were sometimes rewarded with fast-tracked routes to engineering colleges – they were also infiltrated by Stasi informants and closely monitored, their computing activities regarded with suspicion. One report from the Stasi archive lists all the games in circulation at the House of Young Talent. Next to acceptable titles such as Superbowl and Samantha Fox Strip Poker, games such as Rambo and Stryker were singled out for their glorification of violence.Later, as internal conflicts within East German society intensified, the Stasi grew more paranoid about war-themed games, computer viruses and anti-socialist messaging in software. Perhaps their fears weren’t unfounded: in neighbouring Czechoslovakia, underground gamers programmed titles such as The Adventures of Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square, a text adventure where the fedora-decked explorer could meet a grisly fate at the hands of bloodthirsty police officers.The east wasn’t alone in its mistrust of technology. In 1984, West Germany banned children from playing arcade games, concerned that they encouraged gambling. Then, it introduced strict age-gating for supposedly violent games, such as the Activision title, River Raid. This suspicion around gaming extends well into the 21st century: publishers have had to alter the content of their titles to get around censor boards. Players of the German version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, for example, were punished with failure if they shot civilians in its notorious‘No Russian’ mission, where terrorists massacred travellers at a Moscow airport.While East Germany promoted decentralised computing, over in the west, the state held a firm monopoly on telecoms, criminalising home networking and especially hacking. In the 1980s, activists in West Germany responded by founding the Chaos Computer Club, which continues to this day, even creating a DIY modem from toilet pipes in protest: the Datenklo (“dataloo”).“The west was very harsh in punishing hackers and crackers,” says Seiwald. “That the GDR was more permissive surprises a lot of people.”Coldwargames: It’s All a Game is at the Alliiertenmuseum, Berlin, until 30 June 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesGermanyCold warPCEuropeBoard gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is the fate of Sian Silver. Played with verve by Liz Ewing, sporting more sequins than is medically safe, she is a 75-year-old singer whose seasons in the fictional town of Sunthorpe On Sea are coming to an end.In this bijou lunchtime musical written by actor turned playwright Hannah Jarrett-Scott and actor turned composer Brian James O’Sullivan, she gives us a taste of her routine: bouncy music-hall numbers, delivered with a cheery smile and brassy confidence.On a miserly £250 a week, and with astage door Johnnystill turning up for her autograph, it is a wonder she has made it this far. Her last show was called Sinatra: Comin’ Atcha. It is not that she is bad, just hopelessly out of time.She is reminded as much by an apparition: the ghost of her younger self, played with sparkle by Julia Murray, who also doubles as Sian’s male visitors in Lesley Hart’s good-hearted production. Like a kid fromFamein silver leotard, leg warmers and flowing red curls, she has none of the regret and resentment of her older self, only positive energy. When she delivers a music-theatre style number such as I Miss My Baby When He Goes Away, she sings it like she means it.By contrast, the older Sian putting on a bright red dress to sing Tomorrow, the big hit from Annie, is creepily disturbing.For all the sweet-and-sour banter, however, the backstage misery of a faded starlet is overly familiar territory. It is hard to sympathise with an entertainer whose delusions of stardom have left her so bitter. Has it really taken her this long to see the emptiness behind the glitz?

Wasn’t that a genre that had peopleabuzzback in the 00s? Its revival by the British Museum’sprints and drawings departmentas a title for an exhibition of modern and contemporary Scandinavian graphic art seems desperate. Forget our oldies like Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci – we’re all about new stuff by hot young Scandi artists! Maybe it’s understandable; after all theNational Gallery is also moving in on modern art. But Nordic Noir shows just how far overeager neophilia can go wrong. A museum that specialises in history has gone fishing in contemporary waters and, like a lonely angler on an Arctic lake, has come up with absolutely nothing.The big surprise is that most of the works here are not on loan. TheBritish Museumowns them. It has “acquired” 400 examples of Nordic graphics with the support of the AKO Foundation. What’s that? It’s the cultural arm of AKO Capital, “one of Europe’s leading investment partnerships” managing “approximately $20.3bn across long-only and long-short equity funds”.View image in fullscreenBland print … The Fallow Deer, 2016, by Mamma Andersson.Photograph: Reproduced by permission of the artist/The Trustees of the British MuseumWhy is the museum working with this foundation to bring us a pile of so-so Scandinavian “modern” art? It’s funny how these long-short funds never apply caution to buying art. A lot of the newest works in this show will, by the law of averages, lose all interest for later generations or quite possibly this generation in a couple of years. In fact they might not have any interest now. But the British Museum has taken on a duty to preserve them for ever, like all its treasures.Like a second-rate corporate art collection, it’s the name of the celebrity artist that counts in some cases, not the work.Ragnar Kjartansson’s woodcut of a yellow and orange flame is pretty cool, right? No, it’s dull as ditchwater. AnOlafur Eliassonis better, but not in the least noir.Mamma Anderssonis touted as a star but her bland print of a fallow deer could be a decoration from Ikea.The exhibition’s thesis does not hold water, not even frozen fjord water. It starts with the great Norwegian symbolistEdvard Munchand posits some continuity in woodcuts, watercolours, screenprints and sketches from his masterpieces to today. This is like saying British art now is in the tradition of Aubrey Beardsley. There may be overlaps but they are random and irrelevant compared with the differences of intent, audience and, let’s not forget, quality.View image in fullscreenNicely cut … Suopan (Lasso), c.1928-34, by John Savio.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumIf the exhibition had no Munch works, its glib claim of continuity between his self-evisceration and the rest might be unthinkingly accepted. Perhaps realising the danger, the curators include only two of his prints. They are devastating. His 1902 colour woodcut Melancholy III depicts a man in black, brooding by a black fjord, under a near-black sky. For a moment the exhibition looks like it might live up to this cracking start. Prints by Munch’s Norwegian Sámi contemporaryJohn Savioshow life in the Arctic north – not in Munch’s league, but nicely cut.Henrik Finnedepicts the flensing of a whale with hard-edged objectivity. The thick, dark ink coolly delineates men going at the great carcass with shovels.But soon you start to wonder, what is this about? None of the artists rival Munch and there is precious little of his soulfulness on show. It all falls apart when abstract prints that are obviously derivative from Malevich and Klee lead to screenprints mourning Che Guevara and what may as well be designs for the filmTroll Hunter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vanessa Baird’s big scary watercolours dig into appalling personal stuff. Her work My Mother is a wizened figure with eyes of hate. In another, an apparent self-portrait, her severed head screams above what looks like her mother’s corpse. Equally worrying isSverre Malling’s hyperrealistic drawing of a possibly maniacal man holding a severed horse’s head. If the entire show attempted to sustain this genuinely noir spirit it might have worked.Even so it seems premature for the British Museum to collect these artists. Baird and Malling are both striking, but are they so good that the museum, that is the nation, needs to own their work?

Having built a career out of overcoming obstacles – breaking out of the shackles of both a girlband (the 55m-selling Pussycat Dolls) and various TV talent show judging panels – a little polite animosity isn’t going to rain on her parade. Later, during a rendition of Maybe This Time from Cabaret, just as hope overcomes despair, she introduces the crowd to her friends “Lawrence and Tony”, AKA the awards she won for her rapturously-received turn in Sunset Boulevard.Billed as An Evening with Nicole Scherzinger, tonight’s aim is to fuse all of her career tangents. Split into two acts, the first focuses mainly on musicals, from Funny Girl to Follies, plus a standard cover of Diamonds Are Forever. More memorable than the songs, however, are the in-between chats, with Scherzinger’s chaotic humour pushed to the fore. At one point, when discussing her heritage, she says “I also have some English in me …” before raising an eyebrow, pointing at her fiance and adding “his name is Tom”. By the time she shuffles off for the interval, having been onstage for less than 50 minutes, there’s a sense of having witnessed a bizarre standup routine.View image in fullscreenIn magnificent voice … Nicole Scherzinger.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockAct two changes that. She tears through I Am What I Am, her magnificent voice ricocheting overhead, and receives extended standing ovations for Sunset Boulevard’s With One Look and As If We Never Said Goodbye, which she greets like old friends. There’s also a new original song, about growing impatient with a long-term partner’s inability to pop the question. Scherzinger, aware of her esteemed environs, introduces it by listing the great wordsmiths of our age: “There’s Keats, there’s Shakespeare, there’s Scherzinger,” she says, before announcing the song’s title, Bullshit. A vampy, retro soul stomper with a country twang in the chorus, it sounds promising.Nicole Scherzinger: ‘One of my favourite British things is the roasts.

By “we” I mean the overnight critics, myself included, who gave largely negative reviews to the musical of Les Misérables when it opened at theBarbicanin October 1985. All the statistics suggest we misjudged popular taste. Since it began the show has been seen by more than 130 million people, has played in 57 countries and been sung in 22 different languages. Faced with such daunting figures, I am reminded of George Bernard Shaw’s comment when he was accused of damning a Parisian boulevard comedy that had been a huge popular hit: “Forty million Frenchmen,” said Shaw, “can’t be right.”View image in fullscreenSimplified moral dilemmas? … Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, with Michael Ball as Marius, in Les Misérables, 1985.Photograph: Michael Le Poer Trench/©CMLBut, as Les Mis celebrates its 40th birthday, it seems a good time to re-assess the show and ask why it has lasted so long. The first thing to say is that there is a vast difference between the show I saw at the Sondheim theatre last week and the one at the Barbican 40 years ago: the songs may be the same but the context has radically changed. When Les Mis opened it was jointly produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company andCameron Mackintoshand was judged as a company product as much as a commercial musical. Re-reading the original reviews, almost all of them invoke Nicholas Nickleby which was produced by the RSC, directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird and designed by John Napier. The big difference is that Nickleby was a two-part, seven-hour show that reflected the whole of Dickens’s novel; Les Mis was inevitably a drastic reduction of a 1,300-page epic and was viewed as much from a literary as a musical standpoint.Even the show itself is not the same as the one I originally saw. That ran for three and a half hours. It now comes in at under three. Cameron Mackintosh tells me that cuts were made from the start when the production moved to the West End and then to Broadway in accordance with the overtime rules of successive musicians’ unions. Even more to the point, the production at the Sondheim is totally different from the one I saw at the Barbican. The new one is the work of Laurence Connor and James Powell but the really big changes are in the design and lighting. John Napier’s original sets were architectural: Matt Kinley’s designs are pictorial, rely on sombre projections inspired by Victor Hugo’s own paintings and even, in the labyrinthine sewers, reminded me of Piranesi. Paule Constable’s lighting is also extraordinary: at one point light filters vertically through imprisoning iron grilles, at others it comes in horizontal volleys to suggest the eternal pursuit of the ex-convict, Jean Valjean.Key songs have become anthems of freedom and revolution sung by people who have no idea these songs come from a musicalCameron MackintoshMy original complaint was about the simplification of the novel’s moral dilemmas: never about the production. But this time round I worried less about the adaptation and was impressed by the hurtling speed of the staging and the shadowy beauty of the design. This still begs the big question of why a show loftily condemned by the critics, with the notable exceptions of Michael Coveney, Sheridan Morley and John Peter, is now celebrating its 40th birthday. One answer lies in the faith of its creators. Common sense dictated that Les Mis should close after its allotted eight-week run at the Barbican. Mackintosh, backed by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil (the show’s original begetters) and lyricist Herbert Kretzmer, decided otherwise, which is why Les Mis is still with us today.Mackintosh has his own theories about the reasons for the show’s longevity. “It has much to do,” he says, “with youth. Hugo wrote mostly about young people fighting for their beliefs and a better world. New generations of young people are the mainstay of our audience as they rediscover Hugo’s timeless characters and have empathy with them. That’s why several of the key songs have become anthems of freedom and revolution around the world sung by people who have no idea these songs come from a musical.” Mackintosh adds that he “never imagined that schools with children as young as eight would perform the show as well as come to see it in a theatre. Because the show was put together by Trevor and John as an ensemble piece – with 32 actors playing nearly 300 roles – it has also become a training ground for every generation of young talent. What is fascinating is that most of the current cast were not even born when the show was first staged.”View image in fullscreen‘A powerful moment that sends the audience out for the interval on a high’ … the cast of Les Misérables sing One Day More, at the Barbican, 1985.Photograph: Michael Le Poer Trench/© CMLI have my own theories as to why the show has outlived most of its original critics. VS Pritchett once wrote that Hugo’s genius was “for the creation of simple and recognisable myth” and what we get in the musical of Les Mis is a potent combination: the hope of redemption combined with the spectacle of poverty. The power of these two factors theatrically is confirmed by the two productions that sit alongside Les Mis in Shaftesbury Avenue. One is James Graham’sPunchwhich likewise celebrates the individual potential for spiritual re-birth. AndOliver!is about the fight for justice in a world of urban degradation.You still hear the people sing: Les Mis protest anthem blazes from France to ChinaRead moreIn fact, there is an umbilical connection between Les Mis and Oliver! as Mackintosh explains: “It was while seeing my 1977 production of the Dickens musical and while listening to the Artful Dodger singing Consider Yourself that the character of the urchin, Gavroche, from Hugo’s novel popped into Alain Boublil’s head. By the end of the evening he had his next project. So I was always destined to be the midwife!”I would offer yet another explanation for the survival of Les Mis: it offers audiences the kind of emotional kick that you normally associate with opera. There is a classic example at the end of Act One when a disparate range of characters – the persecuted Valjean, the policeman Javert, political insurrectionaries and ardent lovers – join forces to sing, from their different perspectives, One Day More. It is a powerful moment that sends the audience out for the interval on a high.I still think there are things that get lost in turning the novel into a musical and I doubt that many people know what is really going on in the re-creation of the 1832 uprising. But seeing Les Mis for a second time was a chastening experience and one that reminded me that there are two things that audiences crave in the theatre and that are all too rarely found: an optimistic philosophy and a direct appeal to the heart.Les Misérables is booking at theSondheim theatre, London, until 3 October 2026Explore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsWest EndBarbicanCameron MackintoshVictor HugofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of the unpublished poems are housed in the National Library ofIreland(NLI), where the poet bequeathed his literary papers before his death in 2013.Whether or not they should be published was an “absolutely core question”, said Matthew Hollis, a poet and a long-term editor of Heaney, who worked with the poet’s family and fellow editors Rosie Lavan and Bernard O’Donoghue over the last decade to put together the collection, published by Faber this Thursday. “If an author chose not to publish a poem, does anyone else have the right to do so?”However, given that Heaney had passed the poems to the NLI, “we didn’t get a sense that he wished them to remain private”, said Hollis. Some of the poems they looked at had not reached a state of completion that “perhaps Seamus himself would have been satisfied” with, which is why he may have set them aside. The chosen unpublished poems are included in the appendix, so as to separate them from the works published in Heaney’s lifetime. The book also features a commentary by the editors, which “situates” the poems.View image in fullscreenSeamus Heaney at home in Dublin Bay in November 1979.Photograph: Jane BownReading his 12 collections together, there is a “clear sense of moving between subjects and periods”, said Hollis. The first four have a “common project in the ground and in the bog metaphor”, which he used to write about Ireland’s history and the Troubles; there is then a “middle period” focused on domestic life and fatherhood; and finally a later period in which he “seems to face out and addresses worldly subjects”, including 9/11 and the 7/7 bombings.Fitting into that middle period is Chair, Pocket Knife, Guitar, an epithalamium – or wedding poem – written for Christopher. Across three stanzas, Heaney writes about his small son rocking in a chair, a pocket knife he bought for him in France, and the guitar he got the day he started school, which speaks to Christopher’s musical career, his “deep and lasting passion”, said Hollis. Each of the three objects are symbols “of sharing a moment in which the two of them are simply just there together”.Unlike other unpublished poems, some of which had tens of pages of drafts, there seems to be just one version of Chair, Pocket Knife, Guitar in existence. Heaney may have had more focus writing the poem because it was for an occasion, said Hollis. “It seems to have arrived with confidence, with force, and with purity of heart.”Putting together the collection, Hollis was struck by “quite how hardworking Seamus Heaney was”. When writers reach a reputation so “internationally profound”, there can be “an assumption that somehow it’s easy for them, or that they simply have a supreme gift that the rest of us don’t have.”But Heaney’s many drafts make clear “how many avenues he would turn up and then turn back having not reached the right place”, said Hollis. He had a busy life as a lecturer and father, and “quite a number” of drafts are time-stamped “three o’clock in the morning”. Some poems would take years to arrive in their final form. “Even knowledgable readers may be surprised at the depth and the vigour with which Seamus would work in order to bring the latent poem to the surface.”Chair, Pocket Knife, GuitarThe slatted folding chair you sat upon,The scantlings and ad hoc stuff of that playroomYou screened out as you just rocked on and onIn perfect time before the television,To-day let all that tick-tock bric-a-bracCome like a drumstick stick-man rolling home.The one-blade pocket knife you covetedIn a shop window that first evening in FranceAnd I bought then on the spot in thanksgivingFor us just being there: although it’s lostI stand like a glad Macbeth faced with its ghostHandle towards my hand, saying, ‘Thank, thank God’.The guitar you got the day you started schoolAnd were photographed with, up on the picnic table,Play it again to-day, fierce AndalucianSerenades and country wedding songs,Then hang it on the wall, your true love’s token,Last thing before she sleeps, first when you waken.Chair, Pocket Knife, Guitar is an unpublished poem by Seamus Heaney extracted from The Poems of Seamus Heaney, edited by Rosie Lavan and Bernard O’Donoghue with Matthew Hollis, to be published by Faber & Faber on 9 October 2025 (£40).

His son Azazel Jacobs, also a film-maker,told the New York Timesthat he died of kidney failure in hospital on Sunday.Described by the New York Times as “the éminence grise of the American avant garde”, Jacobs and his wife Flo, with whom he collaborated on much of his work, straddled the worlds of experimental art and American new wave film-making, along with the likes of Jack Smith, Andy Warhol and Jonas Mekas. He wasa founding member of New York’s Film-Makers’ Co-Operativeand the first director of the Millennium Film Workshop in 1966, both of which offered a space for film-makers working outside the mainstream and which are still operating today.In an interview with the Museum of Modern Art in 2024, Jacobs said that he and Flo worked like “two painters seeing what was possible in showing film in unexpected ways and finding unexpected things happening”. He added: “We weren’t just telling stories, movies with one shot, next shot, each shot hitting off the other one and making it tell a further element of the story. It was really to see things, to see coloured space operating, being vital, moving.”Born inNew Yorkin 1933, Jacobs went to the School of Industrial Art but dropped out; after serving in the Coast Guard he studied with painter Hans Hofmann and made his first film, Orchard Street, in 1955. An impressionistic study of the street in New York’s Lower East Side, Jacobs later said it was about “many stories happening in tiny gestures”.Jacobs alsoregularly attended Cinema 16, another avant garde outpost, which immersed him in the experimental film-making culture of the time, inspired by Maya Deren. Little Stabs at Happiness, a compendium of four short pieces, was filmed between 1959 and 1963, in collaboration with fellow artist-film-maker Jack Smith, who appears in two of the shorts. (Jacobs’ voiceover suggests that he fell out with Smith by the end of the film-making process.)View image in fullscreenKen Jacobs, right, and his wife Flo on the set of Momma’s Man, the 2008 film directed by their son Azazel.Photograph: ThinkFilm/Everett/ShutterstockBlonde Cobra also featured Smith, in footage shot and abandoned in the 1950s by Smith and Bob Fleischner. With its home-made camp aesthetic, and title inspired by Blonde Venus and Cobra Woman, two of Smith’s favourite films, Blonde Cobra became a key entry in 60s experimental film – premiering in 1963 at the Bleecker Street Cinema in a double bill withSmith’s celebrated short Flaming Creatures. In his Village Voice column Movie Journal, Mekas described it as “a work hardly surpassable in perversity, in richness, in beauty, in sadness, in tragedy”.Jacobs reached arguably a high point in film-making influence in 1969, with the 115-minute Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son, a radical reexamination, restructuring and reformatting of a scrap of silent film shot in 1905 by Billy Bitzer in cinema’s early years. Endlessly replaying it, slowing sections down, cropping in and letting the film jump through the projector gate; the film becomes a mesmeric experience at extreme length. It was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2007.In 1969 Jacobs also began teaching film at Binghamton University, part of the State University of New York. His output slowed for several years, but revived again in the 1990s and in 2004 he released Star Spangled to Death, a six-hour magnum opus of footage he had been compiling since the 1950s, again featuring Smith and also incorporating segments of documentary, TV shows and cartoons,described by Chicago Reader film critic Jonathan Rosenbaumas “a history lesson of sorts and a satire on white American entitlement”.One of Jacobs’ long-term interests was attemptingto overcome film’s two-dimensional surface; in the mid-1970s he and Flo deployed a double-projector installation called a Nervous Magic Lantern and in 2006 he patenteda stroboscopic-style editing system known as “eternalism”, designed to add depth to onscreen images.In 2008 Jacobs appeared alongside Flo in Azazel Jacobs’ feature Momma’s Man as the parents of the central character.Flo Jacobs died in June, and ina statement to VarietyAzazel said: “While the official cause of death was from kidney failure, life without his collaborator and partner since 1960 was unimaginable for so many, especially him.” Jacobs is survived by children Azazel and Nisi, an artist.Explore more on these topicsFilmShort filmsNew YorkArtnewsShareReuse this content"

(If you haven’t spent any time with Healing Pt 1 on a loop recently, I recommend rectifying that now.)Long resident in Hawaii, Rundgren will be crossing the globe later this month to perform some of his greatest hits on a UK tour – and sitting for the Guardian reader interview ahead of those appearances. Perhaps you might like to ask him about why he wanted to produce Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell in order to make fun of Bruce Springsteen; his love of Laura Nyro; what his 1973 album A Wizard, a True Star ordained for bedroom poppers; collaborating with the likes of Robyn and Sparks; what he thinks, as a famed adopter of technological advancements in music, of the rise of AI; turning down the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame and why he’s encouraging his fellow Americans to avoid fighting hate with hate.Ask Rundgren about that, or indeed anything else, by posting your questions in the comments bynoon BST on Friday 10 Octoberand the best questions will appear in a future issue of Film & Music.Explore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewTodd RundgrenPop and rockShareReuse this content"

It’s the best kind of therapy,” Vic says.When he’s not relocating lost heirlooms for their owners, Vic is still out on the hunt – often approached by curious children who want to know if he’s a treasure-hunting pirate.He always tells them the same thing when they come across a tin can instead of a treasure chest: “Do we leave the rubbish there? No! We put it in the bin.”Handle with care: the international community sending parcels of pure joy through the mailRead more“When you find a target, even if it’s only a dollar coin or $2 or 20, you’re going, ‘Yes, yes, yes.’ I love it.”A highlight for Vic, among the bottle caps and beer cans, was finding two gold 1873 sovereign coins “under 2ft of sand”.“You get such a buzz. The endorphins go absolutely crazy,” he says.Tanya’s ring, which will be resized and cleaned, now carries a new chapter.Warwick says the experience has given the intergenerational ring “even more aura” – a testament to its history and the commitment of the volunteers who battle the elements to ensure the past is not erased by the tide.Share your experienceYou can share your lost and found stories using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But every time the excitement of a new relationship subsides, I want to strayPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 7 Oct 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 10.30 EDTShareI’m a gay man in my late 40s.Since the age of 19, I’vespent many, mostly enjoyable, years engaging in casual sex with other men. In my 30s I had a serious relationshipthat lastedfour years, butit never fully satisfied me, in that I felt neither lovednor sexually nourished. The fact is that Ihave always craved casual sex. WheneverIstartto dateany man,when the initial excitementdwindles, Ialways get the urge to have sex with other men again.Iam now wondering if I’ll ever be able to sustain a monogamous relationship.I understand that many gay men have open relationships, but when I’ve witnessed them, they have seemed like hard work, often causing lots of pain and jealousy for everyone involved. In many ways, I want another man to love me while letting me remain sexually free, but I dread to imagine the emotional drainthis would cause. Should I justcontinue to have casual sex and accept that a long-term relationship is not possible?I’m feeling a bit lost.Every person’s sexual journey fluctuates. Try not to think of your relationship needs or your ability to tolerate different types of sexual unions in a finite way. Your needs as you are experiencing them now may well change in the future; at a certain time you might become less ambivalent and find some clarity and a comfortable path … or not. At some point you might meet someone who provides a transformative opportunity for you by reflecting your desires in a holistic fashion … and at another point you might decide that casual connections are best for you. Worrying about the future and playing the “What if?” game is simply anxiety-based and a waste of your energy. Try to be in the moment in your relationships, and see the value of each person with whom you might have a sexual connection.

The market is flooded with conditioning masks claiming to cater to every possible hair problem, whether it’s limp and lifeless or dry, damaged and fragile. But which masks will gloriously hydrate your hair from the first use – and which will leave a greasy film that’s impossible to wash out?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.To find out, I’ve spent the past few months testing 18 of the best hair masks available, and I spoke with hair stylists Melissa Timperley and Valerie Benavides for advice on formulation type, correct usage and the ingredients to look out for. From sub-£10 bargains to high-end luxuries, one of my eight favourites is sure to suit your budget and needs.At a glanceBest hair mask overall:Gisou Honey Gloss Ceramide Therapy£39 at Cult BeautyBest budget hair mask:Garnier Ultimate Blends Repairing Papaya Hair Food£4.49 at BootsBest hair mask for long, thick hair:JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Mask£29 at Space NKBest mask for damaged hair:No98 Hydra Bond£35 at No98 BeautyWhy you should trust meFor the past four years I’ve been testing beauty products, includinghair dryers,body moisturisersandLED masks. In that time I’ve tested dozens of hair masks, witnessing the good, bad and downright ugly.To support my work, I also have a certification in cosmetic science. That taught more about the cellular structure of hair itself, how it is damaged, and the haircare product formulations that can help prevent this. My recommendations here are the result of months of testing, analysis and research.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made notes on the texture, smell and efficacy of each mask.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianFor this roundup, I tested 18 hair masks. Since some are designed to treat specific hair concerns, I also enlisted friends with different hair types to try them out. My hair is thick, long and prone to dryness, so any hair mask that hydrates and protects the hair strands is perfect for me. In cases where a hair mask was volumising, my finer-haired friends were called in to test it out.After testing, I made notes on the texture, smell and efficacy of each mask. These metrics included how easy it was to rinse out, how long the treatment took, the resulting moisture, how soft the hair felt and how good it smelled.Finally, I worked out the price per millilitre and weighed this cost against its effectiveness to determine value for money. As you’ll see, this roundup features a huge range of options to suit every budget, from 1p to 24p a millilitre.Our favourite hair masks in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest hair mask overall:Gisou Honey Gloss Ceramide TherapyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£39 at Cult Beauty£39 at SephoraSince hair masks are tailored to treat specific hair concerns, picking an overall winner was tricky. The Gisou Honey Gloss Ceramide Therapy hair mask stood out thanks to its combination of smoothing, frizz-fighting and hair-strengthening abilities.Why we love itIt’s suitable for all hair types, with antioxidants to protect against environmental factors, honey and hyaluronic acid to hydrate strands, and ceramides to help repair signs of damage and strengthen hair. Ceramides are found naturally in the hair cuticle, so they make a brilliant, natural-feeling protective barrier for the hair strand. That’s a lot to ask from a single mask, but this one is a powerhouse.I tested it before a muggy, rainy day of running errands and came home with hair that felt just as soft, smooth and shiny as when I left the house. Very few products can keep my frizz at bay for that long, and certainly not without making my hair feel heavy.As its name suggests, this hair mask has a delicious, sweet honey scent and comes in a cute honeypot-shaped tub. This was surprisingly easy to grip in the shower, and I didn’t struggle to open it with slippery, wet hands. I found the mask easy to apply and rinse, and liked that there was no need to use conditioner afterwards – surprisingly, a lot of hair masks suggest you do. It only had to sit in my hair for five to seven minutes, though the mask can be left in overnight if you need a more intense hydration hit.It’s a shame that …it’s fairly expensive, though not the most expensive on this list. Before you invest, consider your hair type and goals. If you just need hydration without frizz reduction, other masks offer the same for less money.Size:230mlPrice/ml:17pTreatment time:5-7minsFragranced?YesVegan and certified cruelty free?noBest budget hair mask:Garnier Ultimate Blends Repairing Papaya Hair FoodView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£4.49 at Boots£6.74 at LookfantasticIf you’re on a budget, this massive, multi-use Garnier hair mask is an easy recommendation. You get a lot of hair mask for the money, it smells amazing and is beautifully formulated to smooth, hydrate and temporarily improve the feel of damaged hair. It’s also free from silicones, an ingredient that can cause buildup and weigh down hair if the product containing them is used too much or not rinsed out properly.Why we love itIt’s a silky smooth mask that’s easy to wash out and leaves hair feeling soft and shiny after use. The ingredients include shine-boosting vitamin C and moisturising vitamin E alongside shea butter and fatty acids to smooth and seal the hair cuticle. Papaya, its star ingredient, is rich in vitamin A, which aids the scalp in producing hair-strengthening sebum.The mask can be used in three ways, making it a versatile “one-stop shop” for conditioning. Use like a standard conditioner if you’re under time pressure, or a 10-minute hair mask if you have longer – or it can also, if used sparingly, be a leave-in conditioner. I say sparingly – when I used a little too much as a leave-in conditioner, it left my hair feeling stickier than I’d like, but with the right amount, my hair looked sleek, and the fresh, fruity scent lingered for a full day without fading.It’s a shame that …the name is a little misleading – no bargain hair mask can penetrate the hair strand and repair hair from the inside. This mask just seals the cuticle, making your hair look and feel repaired after use. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but just don’t be fooled into thinking this is a long-term problem-solver. If it were that easy, we’d all be using it.Size:400mlPrice/ml:1pTreatment time:10minsFragranced?YesVegan and certified cruelty free?YesBest mask for long, thick hair:JVN Nurture Intense Hydration MaskView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£29 at Space NK£29 at Cult BeautyA common problem with long hair is that the ends can feel dry and dull; if the hair is also thick, it can make masks difficult to wash out. This mask from JVN Hair is super hydrating and nourishing, quick to use and washes out easily, making it perfect for long and thick hair.Why we love itHaving recently tested a wide range ofhair dryers– applying lots of heat to my hair – my locks were feeling incredibly dry. The JVN Nurture Intense Hydration Mask made my crusty ends feel properly hydrated, healthy and full. The lengths of my hair were left feeling soft and conditioned, even after air drying, without the heavy feeling that often comes from having over-hydrated, thick strands.This is almost certainly down to the mask’s formulation, which uses protective antioxidants and ingredients found naturally in hair to boost its health. Keratris (a vegan keratin alternative) helps boost hair health from inside the cuticle,and hemisqualane seals the cuticle and enhances hair strength. Unlike heavy silicones, hemisqualane smooths the hair without causing productbuildup on the hair strands over time.The mask is vegan, colour safe and sulphate free. It also has an incredible scent that lasts – a big win in my book. This mask could be a great help if your hair is dehydrated.It’s a shame that …I really have to scrape the barrel for criticism here, so I’ll point out that the formula isn’t 100% natural or fragrance free, if that matters to you. Fragrance will only be a problem for those with incredibly sensitive scalps, and it’s pretty rare to find hair masks without any artificial fragrance.Size:236mlPrice/ml:12pTreatment time:3-5minsFragranced?YesVegan and certified cruelty free?YesBest mask for damaged hair:No98 Hydra BondView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£35 at No98 BeautyThis little-known hair mask was recently launched by influencer Lorna Andrews after her experience with alopecia. It’s designed to boost the health and resilience of your hair, helping to restore dull, damaged locks with regular use.Why we love itThis mask has a thick, buttery formula with loads of slip. It’s designed to be used as a pre-wash treatment on damp hair, which means you’ll need to wet the hair and apply the mask 20 minutes before a shower. The thick formula melted on to my strands, so I found it quick to apply – and a little went a long way.The mask itself has a “hydra bond complex” that helps restore hair elasticity and protects against UV damage. This means it should be less prone to breakage, so it’s a good choice if you want to grow your hair or just prioritise its health.Some people may find the pre-shower application faffy, but I liked it, since it meant I wasn’t hanging around my bathroom afterwards dripping wet, waiting for the product to work. It also has a gorgeous spiced woody scent, which felt sophisticated, clean and fresh. If sweet, fruity scents aren’t for you, this is a more grownup alternative.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and, at the time of writing, you can only buy it directly from No98Beauty.Size:175mlPrice/ml:20pTreatment time:20minsFragranced?YesVegan and certified cruelty free?Noskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It has UVA and UVB filters to prevent sun damage and prevent colour fading prematurely. In my test, I found its gel-like texture easy to spread evenly over my hair, and I loved the subtle scent.After three minutes, the mask washed out of my hair quickly without leaving a film. My hair felt soft, moisturised and smooth – brilliant for the price.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s packed with silicones, which smooth the hair cuticle but can cause buildup when not properly washed out.

That makes this mask especially good for curly hair, as it washes out easily without weighing down curls while adding definition and reducing frizz.

As someone with a very sensitive scalp, I liked that this mask could hydrate without upsetting my skin.It didn’t make the final cut because …its results aren’t as nourishing as other masks, but for scalp health, it’s fantastic.

Whether you’re looking to hydrate, repair, strengthen or even volumise, there’s a mask for every hair concern. You just need to find the right one for you.”That said, hair masks aren’t flawless: “Used incorrectly, they can backfire,” says hairstylist Melissa Timperley. “Heavy formulas can weigh down fine hair or leave residue if not rinsed thoroughly. Overuse (more than one to two times a week) may lead to buildup, making hair feel greasy or limp.”Beauty products: 16 skin, hair and wellness essentials the experts can’t live withoutRead moreHow much should I spend on a hair mask?Cost is always a factor for hair products. Benavides advises choosing a product that feels comfortably within your budget. “Think of it like your produce: buy the best you can afford,” she says. “It’s also down to your hair and scalp health. More expensive doesn’t always mean better for your individual needs. Look for clinically proven results and great reviews rather than price to guide you.”When and how should I use a hair mask?Each hair mask will come with its own set of instructions, including recommended usage times. However, most hair masks should be used weekly and applied to wet hair after shampooing, instead of a usual conditioner. According to Timperley, this is because “shampoo opens the hair cuticle, allowing the mask’s nutrients to penetrate deeply”.What are the best ingredients to look out for?Think first about what you want and use that to work out if the ingredients are right for you. “Are you after more volume while strengthening hair?” says Benavides. “Your mask should include an ingredient that will boost volume and [use] lightweight oils to not leave hair heavy.” Once you’ve checked a mask’s claims, always cross-reference the ingredients list to back up the product’s marketing statements.If you’re looking for specifics, Timperley advises that most good hair masks will include “hydrators such as shea butter, glycerine, aloe vera and honey; repairing proteins such as keratin, silk protein and hydrolysed wheat protein; nourishing oils, including argan, coconut and jojoba; and vitamins such as B5 (panthenol), E and biotin”. She also advises against using masks that include alcohol, since it can strip moisture from the hair.Can a hair mask fix split ends?Modern formulations have come a long way to temporarily fix split ends, but there’s still no permanent solution. “No product can mend split ends – they need to be trimmed,” says Timperley. “However, a good hair mask can temporarily seal splits, reduce their appearance and prevent future damage by strengthening hair and maintaining moisture.” If you want a mask that has repairing qualities, look for a mask that has a combination of proteins, peptides, natural oils and humectants.Split ends are inevitable, particularly if you have long hair that you brush, wash or style. My advice would be to take a trip to the salon to remove the damaged ends and then introduce a hair mask to maintain fresh, healthy ends for longer.Which is better, a hair mask or a hair serum?That depends on what you’re after. “Hair masks are best for hydration and nourishment,” says Timperley. “Hair serums are better for surface-level results like taming frizz, adding shine and smoothing ends. For optimal hair health, use both: masks weekly and serum as needed on damp or dry hair.”How often you should use a hair serum depends on your hair type. Those with finer, thinner hair types should use hair serum weekly, while those with thick, coarse, curly or coily hair could apply it daily. If you’re unsure, always start with less frequent treatments and build up to more until you’re happy with the effect.Sarah Matthews is ahealth and beauty consumer journalistwho’s tested everything from hi-tech skincare gadgets to hair styling tools.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Choosing a cordless vacuum isn’t a decision that should be taken lightly. You’re likely to keep a vacuum cleaner for years, relying heavily on its ability to suck up dust, crumbs, mud, pet hair and any other dry spillages or sheddings that end up on your floor. Choosing the right model can be the difference between an effective cleaner that’s a delight to pull out of the cupboard and a dud that you dread having to unblock, detangle and clean after every use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In this review, I took 10 of the leading cordless vacuum cleaners from a range of manufacturers and at various prices and inflicted the same cleaning tests on each one. That takes all the guesswork out of picking your next cleaner: I can tell you exactly which ones picked up the most mess.At a glanceBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251£547.53 at AmazonBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£236.88 at AmazonBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£549 at John LewisBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick Pro£398 at AmazonBest handheld cordless vacuum cleanerDyson Car+Boat£238.38 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home products for more than 30 years. In the past few years, I’ve specialised in testing vacuum cleaners. During that time, I’ve tested more vacuum cleaners of various shapes, sizes and types than I’d care to count, from handheld helpers to heavy-duty dirt-shifters.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum was put to the test against flour, cat litter pellets and pet hair.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianMost cordless vacuum cleaners are designed to work on carpet and hard floors, so I tested them all on both. To do this, I weighed out spillages of flour, recycled wood cat litter pellets and pet hair. Flour and cat litter are easy enough to come by, but my dog doesn’t shed enough hair to test this many vacuums. So I’m also the proud owner of a box of sweepings from a friendly (but slightly bemused) local dog groomer.I gave each vacuum cleaner a chance to pick up as much of the spillages as possible, with a single push-forward and pull-backwards motion, and weighed the collection bins before and after.Most vacuums will collect more if given more chances to go over a mess, particularly from a different angle, but I wanted relatively tough tests that would truly differentiate one vacuum from another, so I allowed only a single sweep.I also tested the batteries by seeing how long it took them to run down from a full charge – at full suction and in each one’s most economical setting. I performed these tests with the floor head attached, where possible.Lastly, I tested the suction using a pressure gauge. While strong suction is useful, the cleaning tests were more important because other factors play a big part in the overall cleaning prowess. For example, a well-designed floor head can make a moderate sucker as good a cleaner as a more powerful model with an inferior brush or roller.All the machines I tested are being sent back to their manufacturers or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best cordless vacuum cleaners in 2025View image in fullscreenThe lineup of test subjects.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBestcordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£549.99 at Shark£547.53 at AmazonIf there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying: taking it to the bin and jettisoning the debris after vacuuming. And, if your family is anything like mine, you may have to do it before you clean too because someone else didn’t bother to empty it. That won’t be the case with this Shark vacuum, though: it empties itself. It’s also very good at cleaning.Why we love itThe Shark IP3251 comes with a base station that operates as a stand and charging dock. When you rest the cordless vacuum cleaner on it, it springs into life, opening the base of the vacuum’s collection bin and sucking its contents into a larger container, leaving the cordless stick empty and ready for next time. The secondary bin has a volume of two litres, so it can take a few empties of the 0.7-litre stick.That would all be pointless if the device itself wasn’t up to snuff, but it’s an excellent cleaner. Its floor head has a fluffy roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpet, and it works well on both surfaces, performing a literal clean sweep in my tests.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty got to work on the flour, pet hair and cat litter.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …I found it worked better if I held it lower while vacuuming on some carpets, with fins on the base otherwise catching when I pulled it back. That may make it better for shorter than taller people.Weight:3.71kgMax suction power (measured):28kPaBattery life (measured):43minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?NoBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-DesignView image in fullscreen£320 at Argos£236.88 at AmazonThe Vax HomePro Pet-Design is good value for money, sitting at the lower end of the price spectrum but still coming with a good selection of tools for handheld use. It also performed well in all the tests.Why we love itIt’s comfortable to hold and use, and simple to operate, with just two large buttons – one to switch it on and the other to boost the power. Battery life is displayed by a light-up ring and lasted a decent 34 minutes in our rundown test.Emptying it is straightforward, too, with a button to open the collection bin, while a pump action lifts dirt off the filter, so you don’t have to poke your hands in. It’s one of the few cordless stick vacuums that can support itself when standing up, so there’s no need to find somewhere to lie it down between cleaning jobs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Vax HomePro Pet-Design took to the floor to suck up the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the floor head is a basic single-brush bar, which is unsophisticated when compared with the alternatives you get on Shark and Dyson models.

It’s also the best, making short work of all my tests. If it’s any recommendation, it’s the vacuum cleaner I used to clean up any residual mess when I’d finished testing the other models.Why we love itAs with Shark, Dyson provides a soft roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpets. However, it does this with two separate detachable floor heads, rather than rolling both into one. That means you have to switch heads each time you change surface, but it also means that they’re adept at their assigned roles.The hard-floor head has a green light that illuminates the dust on the floor as you clean. Not only can you see where you need to clean but also you can witness what a super job the roller does of vacuuming everything up. The carpet-floor head has an anti-tangle mechanism that combs it free of long hair as it rotates.A dusting brush and crevice tool are inside the extension wand, so you don’t have to seek them out when converting to handheld mode. It also comes with a mini motorised tool that’s perfect for lifting pet hair from upholstery or just cleaning the stairs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Gen5detect tackled the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …its screen is useful to indicate battery life, but it also insists on counting how many particles of various sizes it’s collected – a feature no one asked for.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):31kPaBattery life (measured):56minsDust capacity:0.77lAdditional filters supplied?NoBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick ProView image in fullscreen£399.99 at Currys£398 at AmazonMost cordless sticks create a dust cloud when you deposit the contents of their collection bins into your dustbin. The Henry Quick Pro is the only cordless vacuum we’ve reviewed here that doesn’t do that because of its disposable dirt-capturing bags.Why we love itWe can’t emphasise this enough – it’s frustrating to vacuum the floor only to have the dust billowing out of your bin and back into the air when you empty it. With the Henry Quick Pro, you push a lever on the top and the base opens, jettisoning the bag of collected rubbish out of the bottom. It leaves no mess and has the added benefit of no filters to clean.In my tests, the Quick Pro performed decently enough, other than on hard floors with the cat litter, which it pushed ahead instead of sucking up. That job would be better tackled by removing the extension wand and using the device with a handheld attachment. It comes with a comprehensive selection of accessories, including a motorised mini head for stairs and upholstery, a flexible hose and a useful handle extension for taller users.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Henry Quick Pro tackled the flour and pet hair but left some of the cat litter behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the bags have a plastic top that holds them in place inside the collection bin. Henry manufacturer Numatic claims to offset the carbon cost, but it would be better environmentally if it didn’t use any plastic at all. They also cost £1.30 per 1-litre bag.Weight:3.2kgMax suction power (measured):10.75kPaBattery life (measured):1hr 11minsDust capacity:1lAdditionalbags supplied?Yes, six pods (bags)Best handheld cordless vacuum cleaner:Dyson Car+BoatView image in fullscreen£238.38 at John Lewis£249 at AODyson doesn’t manufacture a vacuum purely for handheld use, instead opting to repackage an existing cordless stick without the extension wand. The result is a handheld device so powerful that you may wish you could also use it on the floor.Why we love itThe Dyson Car+Boat is a cunning repackage of theDyson V8. That model is now the bottom of the range of Dyson’s regular cordless stick cleaners, but it makes for a handheld unit that performs above and beyond expectations.It comes with three key attachments: a mini motorised tool for upholstery and stairs; a crevice tool for gaps; and a combination dusting brush and funnel. It’s a powerful combo that cleaned up my test messes with aplomb. I had to use the funnel rather than the motorised tool to collect cat litter, though, because there’s no way this smaller device wouldn’t just push them ahead.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Car+Boat devoured the detritus on the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …you can stillbuy the V8, with the extension tube and attachments, for a similar price. It also comes with Dyson’s old mini-motorised tool. Newer models come with a better-designed tool, which has a tapering roller that doesn’t trap longer hairs.

The AirFox is light and well-balanced enough to stand on its own, so you can leave it in the middle of the room while you do some dusting, and it won’t fall to the floor.The trigger needs to be held down to keep the vacuum running, and while there is a trigger lock to keep it in place, it’s fiddly to use. It cleaned well in my tests, though, only really struggling with the cat litter, which seemed to get stuck in the floor head.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Gtech AirFox Platinum took to the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …I found it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods because the back extends out over the handle, getting in the way of my wrist.Weight:2.9kg;max suction power (measured):31kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 10mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?NoMiele Duoflex HX1 Total CareView image in fullscreen£399 at John Lewis£399 at MieleBest for:simple operationDespite being a high-end brand in most categories of domestic appliances, the Miele Duoflex HX1 sits in the middle of this gathering in terms of price. That’s largely thanks to the lack of additional features you get when compared with the likes of Shark and Dyson. It performed well in my cleaning tests but generally proved better on carpets than on hard floors.It operates in either floor or handheld mode. The floor head is basic, with a simple brush bar and no anti-tangle features. It comes with three handheld attachments – a crevice tool, a basic upholstery nozzle and a dusting brush.View image in fullscreenHow it started v how it’s going with the Miele Duoflex HX1 Total Care.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …emptying relies on gravity alone, so you end up having to poke your fingers into the collection bin to clear it out. Most disappointing was the battery, which didn’t last long with the floor head attached, even on the weakest suction setting.Weight:3.1kg;max suction power (measured):12.5kPa;battery life (measured):13mins;dust capacity:0.3l;additional filters supplied?NoBosch Unlimited 10 BCS1051GBView image in fullscreen£499 at John Lewis£500 at ArgosBest for:super-long battery lifeWith the Unlimited 10, Bosch has gone all in on the bling. It has a very flashy screen, which informs you visually when you’re changing floor surfaces, and lights up in a different colour depending on what power setting you’ve got the suction on. It’s useful, but possibly not useful enough to justify its higher-than-average cost.The overall build quality is excellent, though. I loved the spring-loaded filter-clearing lever on the back, which means you can empty the collection bin in a smooth single-push motion rather than the banging and poking you have to do with most other vacuums. This lever can also compact the rubbish as you clean to reduce how often it needs emptying. The Unlimited 10 also had the best battery, which made the unit heavy but lasted an astonishing hour and a half in its Eco setting.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) with the hair, litter and flour and how the Bosch Unlimited 10 vacuumed them up on the right.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit expensive without there being enough of a cleaning benefit to justify it.Weight:3.8kg;max suction power (measured):13kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 34mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?NoBeldray Airgility Pet Plus+View image in fullscreen£85.99 at Currys£84.99 at AmazonBest for:lowest priceIf most of the other reviews left you thinking that you were going to have to take out a second mortgage to get a new cordless vacuum cleaner, the sub-£100 price tag of the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ should be a breath of fresh air. It’s light and petite but has small attachments, too, which aren’t large enough to pick up larger particles. It doesn’t collect dirt as well as the best vacuum cleaners here, but for a fraction of the price, it does a reasonable job.The biggest problem was cat litter, which was sucking OK from the floor but caused a blockage after only a tiny amount had entered the collection bin. It was surprisingly proficient at flour on hard floors but failed to agitate my test carpet enough to replicate that success. It also left a bit of pet hair behind during testing, either on the floor or stuck to the rollers.View image in fullscreenBefore the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ got to work (left) and how well it picked up the mess (right).Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t perform as well as more expensive rivals, though it does still impress for the price.Weight:2.2kg;max suction power (measured):9.25kPa;battery life (measured):41mins;dust capacity:1.2l;additional filters supplied?Yes, oneWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Dyson Car+Boat makes short work of mess.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianWhy choose a cordless vacuum cleanerCordless vacuum cleaners are vastly more convenient than corded models. There’s no cable to unwind and no need to find a power socket – you just take the vacuum to the mess and get started.The downside is that they run on battery power. The batteries can last anywhere between an hour or so on light settings and down to a few minutes on full blast. They should last long enough to get around an average-size housein one go, but larger spaces might need a mid-clean charge, which can take a few hours (or an expensive extra battery).What should you look for in a cordless vacuum cleaner?All cordless vacuum cleaners will have a good go at your carpeted areas, but they work on hard floors, too. The best hard-floor models tend to come with a fluffy roller, which will be better at picking up dust from smooth surfaces, as well as a standard brush bar.One particularly good thing about cordless vacuums is that they tend to break down into handheld devices if you remove the extension wand. Check that the one you want comes with the attachments you need. If you have stairs you may like to look for a mini motorised tool, which is a bit like a miniature version of a regular floor head, ideal for vacuuming smaller areas, such as stairs and upholstery.Do cordless vacuums have good filtration systems?Yes, cordless vacuums quote high levels of filtration, with some claiming to trap even the tiniest of particles, such as pollen. However, emptying cordless vacuums that don’t use bags can create a messy dust cloud, so these may not be the models for you if you’re allergic to dirt particles. Filters also need regular cleaning, which is something you won’t be used to if you’re moving away from a vacuuming system that uses disposable bags.How to clean your cordless vacuum cleanerMaintaining your vacuum cleaner doesn’t stop at emptying the collection bin. There are a few other areas that deserve your attention if you want top performance and a long life from your vacuum.The first is keeping the filter clean. This doesn’t need doing after every use, but it’s worth keeping an eye on how dirty it’s getting and cleaning it before it gets too clogged up. Dyson recommends doing this once a month. With Dyson vacuums, you remove the filter by twisting it and lifting it out of the body of the cleaner, then rinsing it in cold water to remove the dirt. Let it air dry for at least 24 hours and check it’s completely dry before refitting.The filters on most other brands can be cleaned in a similar way, but some don’t like getting wet, so check your vacuum’s instruction manual if you’re not sure.The other problem area is the brush bar. Anti-tangle floor heads have improved things in recent years, but even these can be clogged up with hair, fluff and dirt over time. The brush bar can usually be removed from the floor head, and you can attack entangled hair with a pair of scissors. If the bristles are loaded with fluff, you can tease it out with your fingers or use an old comb.For a really deep clean, you can dismantle most vacuum cleaners and wash any non-electrical parts with a damp cloth. Make sure it’s all properly dry before putting it back together.What to do with your old vacuum cleanerWhile you might have decided to move on from your old vacuum cleaner, a working model could still hold value for others. It’s worth seeing if you can sell it locally or donate it to someone who can still get some use out of it.Alternatively, when you buy your new vacuum, ask the retailer about its WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) recycling scheme. The UK’sWEEE Regulationsstate that companies selling such items must accept the device you’re replacing and responsibly recycle it.Lastly, you can always recycle it yourself. Your local recycling centre should have a section for electricals, and you can find your nearest atRecycle Your Electricals. Alternatively, check your local council’s website to find out about its recycling services and opening hours.The best window vacs for clearing condensation: seven expert picks for streak-free shineRead moreAndy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

That’s good dolloped on the side of sausages, and it keeps and freezes well, too.Mark Diacono, author ofAbundance, says Emily should consider going down two main savoury routes: “One is to use apples almost like a mild spice – something that you wouldn’t necessarily pick up is there, but you’d miss it if it wasn’t.” Take celeriac and apple soup as an example: “I love celeriac a great deal, but if you’re not careful, it can make a soup that would hold wallpaper to the vertical.” Introduce some apple to the mix, however, and the fruit will change the texture of the celeriac, and also soften its bitterness: “It just lets a bit of air out of its tyres. You wouldn’t perhaps say, ‘That’s celeriac and apple soup’, but you would say, ‘That’s an amazing soup’. And that would be down to the apple doing its thing.”The fruit’s other “thing”, Diacono says, is contrast, both in terms of flavour and texture, which is perhaps best shown in a tumble salad: “One of those where you’ve got bitter leaves, the sweetness of, say, roast beetroot [though you could use pickled, too], some root veg [maybe parsnip, maybe carrot], walnuts or hazelnuts, soft cheese, salt, and the apple, either raw and cut into wedges, or even lightly fried in a bit of bacon fat, which I really like.”There are, of course, a huge number of apple varieties grown in the UK, so which work best? Diacono would come at it from the other direction and instead build the salad to suit the particular apple that needs using up: “I’d be happy with a sharper apple, some salty cheese and a bitter leaf, but if I had something more aromatic – less granny smith and more braeburn, or russet, if I was lucky enough to get my hands on one – I’d go for the likes of burrata or mozzarella.”Finally, for any apple peelings or cores that aren’t destined for the compost, Labron-Johnson suggests turning them into vinegar. “There are two ways to do this: either steep your apple scraps in an existing vinegar – something like a nice white-wine or cider vinegar, say – or make your own by steeping them in water with a bit of sugar and leaving to oxidise.” That’d work a treat in sauces, or simply reduce with some honey to make a sharp syrup and use that to glaze meat (think pork belly or duck) or onions. It’s sure to keep the doctor away, too.Got a culinary dilemma?

In the Middle East there arekofta, in Italypolpette, in Franceboulettes, in Germanyfrikadellenand in Spain we call themalbóndigas(oralmóndigasas it’s pronounced in my village in Extremadura). The Moors brought them to Spain centuries ago, and they quickly became an integral part of our cooking culture, a dish to share with family and friends. In fact, they don’t even need to include any actual meat: in today’s dish, I make them with a hearty, earthy and slightly sweet combination of chickpeas, parsnip and apple, and serve them in a rich, golden and full-flavoured saffron and tomato broth.Parsnip, apple and chickpea albóndigas in saffron-tomato brothPrep15 minCook45 minServes4-61 tbsp olive oil1 small onion, peeled and chopped2 celery sticks, trimmed and chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed6 large ripe vine tomatoes, chopped1.2 litres good vegetable stockSalt and black pepper1 good pinch saffron threadsExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishFor the albóndigas570g jar chickpeas, drained1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 large parsnip(200g), peeled and coarsely grated1 small apple, peeled, cored and grated1 tsp ground cumin1 good pinch chilli flakes50g fresh white breadcrumbs1 largeegg1 handful finely chopped flat-leaf parsleyOlive oil, for fryingFirst, make the broth. Put the oil in a saucepan on a medium-low heat, add the onion, celery and garlic, and cook gently, stirring often, for five minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and stock, season and bring to a simmer. Leave to cook for 10-15 minutes, then crumble in the saffron and cook for 10 minutes more. Fine strain, pressing down on the solids to extract every last drop of liquid, then return the broth to the pan;discardthe solids.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mash the chickpeas with a fork – you want them fairly well combined, but with a few whole and big bits of chickpea still in there. Mix in the crushed garlic, grated parsnip and apple, spices, breadcrumbs and egg, then add the parsley and plenty of seasoning, and mix until it’s all well combined. Meanwhile, heat a thin layer of oil in a nonstick frying pan.Scoop spoonfuls of the chickpea mixture into your hand and shape them into good-sized balls – you want them to be a bit bigger than a walnut – then fry in batches, turning regularly, for three or four minutes, until they’re golden all over – take care when you turn them, because the balls are delicate and you don’t want them to break up.Divide the fried albóndigas between warmed shallow bowls. Heat the broth to a simmer, then ladle some over each portion of albondigas. Drizzle over some good oil, and serve with a final twist of black pepper.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkMain courseFoodVegetarian food and drinkVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Today, anyone with a smartphone can access gruesome videos and images – as well as troves of misinformation. Though some experts have been sounding the alarm about the potential harmof smartphones on children and teen’s mental health, the fact is most young people still have access to phones – and the often disturbing content that flows out of them.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Guardian spoke with seven experts on how best to speak with kids about upsetting content and news, at what age to start those conversations – and what to avoid.Panel of experts:Anya Kamenetz, journalist and publisher ofThe Golden HournewsletterEugene Beresin, MD, psychiatrist and executive director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts general hospitalTara Conley, assistant professor of media and journalism at Kent State UniversityTori Cordiano, PhD, Ohio-based licensed clinical psychologistJill Murphy, chief content officer of Common Sense MediaAshley Rogers Berner,professor at Johns Hopkins UniversityHolly Korbey, author ofBuilding Better CitizensWhat’s the best way to talk to kids about bad news – whether it’s a public assassination, a school shootingor a climate-related disaster?Anya Kamenetz:First, find out what they already know or have heard. Kids are overhearing things at school and seeing snippets on social media, so it’s important that you know what they have heard. You can dispel any misconceptions with some clear facts. Look online together, to model balanced consumption of information. Once you’ve filled in some basics, ask if they have any questions. Then, ask how they are feeling about it.Eugene Beresin:Kids of all ages have three concerns. Am I safe? Are you taking care of me? How will this affect my life? So you want to ask what they’re worried about, listen, validate their feelings and be available for questions.Tara Conley:There are practical ways to create communication channels to talk to kids when the news is upsetting. For example, consider establishing a family group chat. Create online and offline spaces where a young person can feel part of a tight- knit group.What are the best ways to talk to kids about graphic content, like the shooting of Charlie Kirk?Tori Cordiano:I personally know a lot of teenagers who, without even realizing what they were looking at, stumbled into the [video of Kirk’s shooting] and were really shocked. Especially with younger kids, there may be some sense of: ‘I can’t even tell my parents because I wasn’t supposed to see in the first place.’It’s important that they’re able to talk about it with a trusted adult. You might say: ‘You may not have known what you really were looking at, or you maybe did seek it out, and that’s understandable because you wanted to know what was going on. What we know is we don’t want to continue to seek out those sorts of videos and images, because they do have a lasting impact on our brain.’Ashley Rogers Berner:When children hear about an assassination or other acts of political violence, it’s important to be truthful with them. Parents can reinforce the rules of democracy, such as that we deal with disagreements peacefully and without violence. They can reassure their children that the government’s job is to find and hold accountable any perpetrators of violent behavior, and that such violence is rare.How do you help kids navigate misinformation?Holly Korbey:Parents need to understand that when kids have phones, they have unending exposure to the worst things happening in the world, and almost immediately on TikTok and Instagram, the facts of what happened get twisted instantly. What’s more, political leaders are saying, ‘Don’t trust the news,’ so people are just so confused.A parent’s job can be to say: ‘Let’s just go over what the facts are. If you’ve heard something really scary, go to a journalistic outlet and see if that’s even right.’Cordiano:Kids are drawn to phones because it’s an important way that they communicate with their peers and learn about their world. I don’t think we’re smart to just put that to the side. Instead we should think about the habits we want them to start developing at a young age around technology use: where they’re using their devices, when they’re using their devices, for how long they’re using their devices and what they’re accessing.I don’t think of this as a one-size-fits-all approach, but generally starting with more restrictions (fewer apps, including social media, and tighter time limits) can be helpful when kids first have access to a phone or tablet. For all kids, avoiding keeping devices in their bedroom overnight, or for younger kids, avoiding using their devices behind closed doors, is helpful. I often recommendCommon Sense Mediato families looking for resources on this topic.Conley:Instilling critical media literacy skills in children and young people early on – by helping them understand how media and technologies influence social behaviors and social life – goes a long way, said Conley. I offer parents/caregivers some tips here:Tips for Adults Supporting Kids Consuming Scary News. The American Academy of Pediatrics also provides information onHow to Make a Family Media Plan.There’s so much vitriol and polarization in our politics. How do you handle those conversations?Korbey:I tell my kids that [no topic] is off limits. Students who are exposed to controversial topics and allowed to talk about them end up becoming more politically active later. We have arguments at the dinner table. I think that’s good.Jill Murphy:Kids and teens will have plenty of questions, and it may also be a launchpad for a deeper conversation about a political or cultural issue. Parents should remind kids of their values and points of view, while hearing what their kids are gravitating towards and wondering about.What should parents and caregivers avoid when talking to kids about the news?Kamentz:Avoid having TV news on in the background. I hate to say this because I used to work for NPR and grew up listening to it from the backseat, but depending on the story unfolding, you might want to limit that exposure as well. Depending on your kids’ age, you don’t necessarily have to volunteer lots of information when they have not asked. Kids take in information at their own pace and have widely varying developmental needs.Conley:It’s probably best to avoid pretending we know everything and can explain away upsetting news. Kids can tell. We owe them our humility, not hubris.How do you reassure kids when they’re concerned about very real risks to their own safety, such as climate change, school shootings, immigration raidsand police violence?Conley:I was in college, a lot was going on in the world from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, to the BP oil spill, to the Great Recession. During that time, and before he passed away, my dad wrote me letters. Sometimes he’d offer guidance, sometimes he’d just offer thoughts of encouragement. I still have his letters. I pull them out whenever I need a reminder of our shared humanity.So, when talking with parents and educators, I offer a practicalletter writing activity. Simply writing a letter to a young person in your life can go a long way.Cordiano:When a school shooting happens, it’s not our job to make themmoreupset about it. What we do want to make sure of is that they take safety drills at school seriously, and that they’re paying attention to the guidance that we get from the school.How do you reassure kids when you, as a parent, are afraid or upset by the news?Kamentz:Put on your own oxygen mask first, and make sure you have supportive adults to share your concerns with. Model healthy news consumption [by] avoiding doomscrolling before bed and maintaining family routines as a news-free zone.Conley:I encourage young people and adults to not only find the helpers (shoutout to Mr Fred Rogers) but alsobe a helper.Recent studiessuggest giving support, for example through volunteering, helps us all cope and better deal with constant stressors. We feel better when we help others.When is the best age to start those conversations?Murphy:Kids and teens are exposed to news at a rapid rate, often hearing about events from influencers. Because of this, it’s best for parents to begin discussions with kids early, sharing age-appropriate information.Kamentz:The reality is we don’t always choose. I didn’t want to have to explain to my three-year-old that school was closed because of a global pandemic, and that she had to wear a mask and couldn’t go inside the supermarket, but that’s what happened, and I have a happy, healthy eight-year-old today.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyCharlie Kirk shootingClimate crisisUS crimeMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eventually, we moved her back to her native country where she has a house and employed a care worker.This arrangement broke down when my mother invited a stranger to move in with her and refused to let thecare worker or anyone else in the house. The man financially exploited her then disappeared.Barclays closed my account but where’s the cash?Read moreShesuffereda mental collapse and, after repeatedly trying to set fire to the house, she had to be sectioned.She’s now in a care home in her home country. I was appointed her legal guardian by a court where she now lives.I needed to close theBarclaysaccountthat she opened when she moved here as she is no longer resident in the UK and therefore no longer eligible for the banking service.However, since April I have been struggling to get sense out of bank staff about what documents they require to prove my legal guardianship. I have been variously advised that they merely need the original court order, that they need a translation of the court order by a recommended service which cost me £650, that they needed a certified translation and an apostille (an official verification of a foreign language document) of the court order.I paid £150 to the translating service to have the translation certified and flew back to my homeland to get an apostille of the original document from a notary, only to be told that it was actually the translation that needed an apostille.No notary would verify a foreign-language translation. Things were getting murkier and murkier and I ended up crying in the branch.After weeks of pleading, I was eventually given a list of documents Barclays “might” accept, but it’s ambiguous and I am petrified of getting the wrong documents again. Please help.Name withheldI decided to publish the account of your mother’s harrowing decline in detail to emphasise how vital this account closure is and how agonising the blithe cluelessness of Barclays staff has been for you. However, I have withheld the name of your native country to minimise the chance of your mother being identified.Legal guardianship orders issued by foreign courts cannot be uncommon and it defies belief that Barclays does not appear to have a process for dealing with them. Not only did Barclays staff appear to make it up as they went along, they fell silent for days on end after you’d obeyed their latest whim, requiring you to chase for progress. Of which there was none.It took the prospect of a headline to prompt a clear set of instructions from Barclays plus a £150 goodwill payment for the distress. It says it now has the documents it needs to close the account. A spokesperson said: “We are very sorry for the service [the customer’s daughter] experienced. We should have clearly explained the additional steps required.”Account issues in the UK, tooClosing the account of someone who has lost mental capacity can also prove a wild goose chase for UK nationals, asLCfrom Oxfordshire found.LC’s husband has Alzheimer’s disease and lives in a care home. LC has registered lasting power of attorney, allowing her to manage his affairs, and in April she wrote to their bank, Halifax, to ask if she could merge the personal account she has with another bank with the couple’s joint Halifax account.“I need to reduce the number of banks and accounts I’m responsible for,” she writes.Halifax insisted that the joint account would have to be in her sole name before the merger could happen and that her husband would have to sign a form to authorise the removal of his name. “He can no longer sign his name and even if he could, he would not understand what he was signing,” she writes.LC phoned to explain and was told to visit a branch. Branch staff were unable to help, a letter proved fruitless, so did a second and third.When I questioned its conduct, Halifax admitted that it had given LC incorrect advice about the requirements for the switch. It has now allowed her to make the merge and paid £350 in compensation.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Cover your ears. Talk about a big bang: under a galactic stage set, the designer Matthieu Blazy just blasted the world’s most famous fashion brand through the sound barrier and into the 21st century.Backstage after his debut, Blazy quoted what CocoChanelonce said when asked why she wore the same tweed jacket day after day. “She said, if I translate into English: ‘I don’t give a fuck. I like them worn.’” This is Blazy’s take on the house Coco founded: Chanel, with no fucks given.Under a helium solar system, a giant sun blazing and Saturn spinning within its rings, Blazy was thinking big and thinking new.

The 2.55 quilted bags came scrunched and open, “lived and cherished, as if it was your great-grandmother’s bag, and you took it to a party on the Lower East Side or inParisat Pigalle.” There were suits in clownfish Nemo stripes, exquisite oversize Charvet cotton shirts for evening, and a standing ovation finale as the model Awar Odhiang danced on the runway in a silk T-shirt and rainbow-feathered skirt.View image in fullscreenMatthieu Blazy, the new Chanel creative director.Photograph: Laurent VU/SIPA/ShutterstockCoco Chanel was born in 1883; Blazy in 1984. This was the bold spirit of a Coco born a century later. On the first day in his new job, Blazy took off the jacket he was wearing, scissored it to the hipbone length of a Chanel jacket, snipped off the collar, changed the button, and threaded a gold chain through the hem – an old Chanel trick, to make a jacket swing right. That was the template for the first two Chanel suits on to his runway, cropped bellhop jackets worn not with pert skirts but with trousers, cut the way Coco liked them, loose enough to ride a horse. “This is the paradox of Chanel. She wore men’s clothes because she wanted to be equal to men. But she also wanted to seduce them,” Blazy told reporters backstage.The genius of Chanel is that it sells what money cannot buy. Whether it is printed on a £25 bottle of nail polish or stitched into a £200,000 haute couture dress, the Chanel name stands for class, taste and the power of great style. The responsibility for keeping the flame of that name alive now rests with Blazy.Speaking backstage before the show, Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion, described Blazy’s take as “a certain insolence”. Karl Lagerfeld, with his theatrical show sets and outrageous public pronouncements, had that, as did Coco herself. Chanel’s sales have been resilient in the 16 months without a creative director, said Pavlovsky, “but we have surfed. We need a new spark.” He said that he had told his new hire that “if Chanel looks the same as before, I will be super upset” – but also reminded him that Chanel is a £20bn business. “I said: ‘You have only one responsibility, and that is that I don’t want a decrease.’”View image in fullscreenModels walked amid a space-themed set design.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockLuckily, Blazy is “a product guy”, as Pavlovsky put it. Coco was the first designer “to make a handbag part of a look”, in Blazy’s words. Perhaps by accident, she laid the groundwork for a luxury industry where clothes are the figurehead, leather goods the engine. Audacious new Chanel bags – Pedro Pascal, in the front row, sported a new unisex version – were part of almost every look. Camellias, a house motif, were supersized and scissored into sea urchin strands. A black-trimmed white suit nodded to the iconic No 5 perfume bottle.Clues as to the direction of Blazy’s Chanel were drip-fed in the days before the show. There were a few black-and-white teaser images – the back of a woman’s head, with a tousled bob and white-feathered earrings; a Chanel-branded white shirt in a garment cover, a masculine outfit of striped shirt, trousers and polished brogues laid over an armchair – shot by David Bailey, a choice that hinted at the grand sweep of fashion history. The invitation to the show was a necklace: a silver pendant of a tiny house, rendered in storybook simplicity. The Kremlinologists ofParis fashion weekparsed these clues, only to be blindsided by the boldness of Blazy’s approach. This was a more surprising debut than Jonathan Anderson’s Dior, because while reinvention is in the bones of Dior, Chanel has steered a steadier course. It takes guts to modernise a house where clients will still happily pay for a suit that was invented a century ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Putting a black woman at the centre of his vision of Chanel is a marker of Blazy’s forward momentum. Pavlovsky said the new roster of “creative affinities” was “about adding depth and diversity to the panel of women who represent the brand”.This is Chanel’s big post-Lagerfeld moment. Virginie Viard directed design for five years after his death, but Lagerfeld’s publicity-shy deputy never entirely broke out of the shadow of her former boss. Pavlovsky paid credit to Viard, who did “an extraordinary job of handling the transition” but said Chanel needed “a new creative eye” to bring momentum. Blazy has chosen New York as the location for Chanel’s next show on 2 December.“Chanel is universal, like Coca Cola,” Blazy said. He has given the bottle a good shake.Explore more on these topicsChanelFashion weeksParisEuropeFranceParis fashion weeknewsShareReuse this content"

I’d dropped out of my university literature course – with the arrogance of youth, I thought I could read books anywhere. After a chance meeting in a Putney pub, I got a job as assistant cook in theBird Observatory in Fair Isle. At that point, I didn’t even know where Fair Isle was. I came from Devon and hadn’t made it farther north than Durham. Scotland was unknown territory.Of course, Fair Isle is part of the Shetland group and lies halfway between Shetland mainland and Orkney. That summer, I fell in love with the Northern Isles, with the romance of the isolation, the bleak beauty and the stories. Over the summer, I worked in the observatory with Alison, an Orcadian lass, who was there for her college holidays. “When you’ve finished your contract,” she said with the easy hospitality of islanders everywhere, “why don’t you come and stay? It’s kind of on your way home.”A map showing the islands of OrkneyIt kind of was, and so I did. Alison lived with her parents in a solid house on the outskirts of Kirkwall. After my nine-month stay on Fair Isle – three miles long and a mile and a half wide, a scattering of crofts, 50 people and a lot of sheep and seabirds – Kirkwall felt like civilisation. There was a beautiful cathedral, a street of shops and bars, schools and a hospital. What struck me most, though, were the views. Much of Orkney mainland is low and green, and there are lochs so big that a stranger might think they were looking at the sea. So, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge sky.At that time, Alison was more into partying than history, so I didn’t do a lot of sightseeing. We went to a dance at the Harray community hall, and I drank too much. There was little communication with the locals there. I’d become used to a Shetland voice, but an Orkney accent is quite different, lilting, musical, almost Welsh. I missed much of what was said to me.Later, I got the plane to London, on my way home. If Kirkwall had seemed big, London with its towering buildings was overwhelming, and I scuttled west on the train to be on the coast again.View image in fullscreenThe Stones of Stenness.Photograph: Peter Burnett/Getty ImagesOver the years, I’ve come to know Orkney better. My husband and I went to Alison’s wedding in the cathedral. She was magnificent in a grand white dress, and she sailed up the aisle to Chariots of Fire. That evening there was another party, only a little more sedate than the Harray dance. Drink was passed round in the traditional Orkney way, in a wooden bowl, known as thecog, created for the purpose. I’m not sure what was in it, but it was warm, and it packed a punch.At other times, we stayed with friends who lived in a converted chapel, looking down to theStones of Stenness. Just as there’s always a view of water in Orkney, there’s always a reminder of its neolithic past, and I would come to explore the islands’ history more deeply when I was researching my latest novel, The Killing Stones.On Orkney, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge skyOver time, we explored some of the smaller islands: Hoy with its dramatic cliffs, the tiny island of Papa Westray, home to theKnap of Howar, the oldest domestic stone dwelling in Northern Europe, and North Ronaldsay, where we stayed in theBird Observatory’s accommodation, a reminder of the work that first took me north. North Ronaldsay is surrounded by astone dyke, not to keep animals in, but to keep them out on the shore. The island sheep have adapted to living on seaweed, and perhaps because of that the meat is delicious.For years though, Shetland was the focus of my trips north. One of my best friends lives there, and I was still writing the Jimmy Perez books, adapted for television as Shetland. In 2018, I decided to finish the series with the novel Wild Fire. I didn’t think I could find anything fresh to say about a community of only 23,000 people. I’d already killed too many of them.The book ends with Perez and his partner moving south to Orkney. Perhaps I was influenced by a real police inspector, who covered both sets of islands and made the move. Certainly, I had no intention of writing about Perez again.View image in fullscreenThe Old Man of Hoy.Photograph: North Light Images/Getty ImagesMore recently, I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summers. For the dramatic contrast between long, clear horizons and secrets hidden in small communities. I remembered that first image of Orkney, the stretches of land and water, and I realised it was time to go back. After all, to explore Perez’s new life, I’d have to stay there. It’s small details that bring a book to life, and Google research can’t help with that.I stayed with my friend Stewart in his rather grand house on Orkney mainland. He became my driver, fixer and human research. I’d met him first when he worked for Orkney libraries. We’d had book-related adventures together – flying into North Ronaldsay in the eight-seater plane to celebrate the anniversary of a scheme that brought book boxes to islanders, and a crazy attempt to set a record by doing 24 events on 24 of the Northern Isles in 24 hours. We met the challenge, but only with the support of library staff in Orkney and Shetland, and the help of other writers.I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summersMy research visit took place in December 2023. It was clear, still and very cold. The frost didn’t melt all day. Stewart took me to the island of Westray, where he grew up and his family still farms. We stayed in thePierowall Hotel, which features in the novel, and explored the site of the abandonedNoltland dignear Grobust Bay. I talked to his parents and to volunteers in the Heritage Centre. The book wouldn’t have been written without their help.Back on Orkney mainland, we explored Kirkwall and Stromness and drove south across theChurchill Barriers, the causeways built between islands after a German U-boat entered Scapa Flow in 1939 and sank HMS Royal Oak. I was met everywhere with kindness and the most useful information. The pattern of the book was starting to take shape.View image in fullscreenStromness on Orkney mainland.Photograph: Nicola Colombo/Getty ImagesI ended my stay with an almost mystical experience.Maeshoweis a neolithic burial chamber. Entry is through a low, narrow tunnel positioned so that at the winter solstice, as the sun sets behind the hills of Hoy, the light floods in. There aren’t many entirely cloudless winter dusks in Orkney, but we were lucky enough to experience the magic. In the chamber, first a trickle of apparently liquid gold ran across the floor, then it grew wider and wider until it flooded the entire space with light. As the sun set, all was dark again.I believe that setting is more than a pretty backdrop to the action. It informs character and moves the action of the plot. The Killing Stones couldn’t have been set anywhere other than Orkney, and I couldn’t have written it without spending time there with Orcadians.The Killing Stones by Ann Cleevesis published by Pan Macmillanat £22.

The UK is not part of the Schengen area.Instead of using stamps, countries in the zone will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates.“The EES will gradually replace passport stamps with a digital system that records when travellers enter and exit, making border checks faster and helping staff to work more efficiently,” the EU’s official website says.This is also aimed at preventing irregular migration and giving border enforcement more access to travellers’ information, which the countries say will decrease security risks.When will it happen?While the rollout begins this weekend,the changes will be gradual, with the EES expected to be fully operational by 10 April 2026.‘Like it had been put on Earth specially for me’: readers’ favourite European city breaksRead moreWho will be affected?Anyone without a EU passport travelling to the Schengen area countries for a short period will use the EES, which is free.A short stay means up to 90 days within any 180-day period, according to Travel Europe. This period is calculated as a single period for all the European countries using the EES.If travellers use the self-serve system available at their destination, or a mobile app if the country they are travelling to offers one, crossing the border will be quicker.What do travellers need to do?Once travellers have arrived, they will have to answer the Schengen border code questions, which will create a record of their details. This record is held for three years so only fingerprints or photographs will be used for re-entry in that timeframe.The Australian government’sSmartraveller site is warningthat the rollout may create delays at first: “The registration process should only take a few minutes, but when the system starts, you may experience longer border queues.”Staying longer than 180 days?Australia has visa waiver agreements with several countries in the Schengen area, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.Each of these countries offers visa waivers in its own way, and travellers planning longer stays will need to make sure they know what the agreement is.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Union holidaysEuropeEuropean UnionBiometricsEurope holidaysexplainersShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple’s extremely popular AirPods Pro Bluetooth earbuds are back for their third generation with a better fit, longer battery life, built-in heart rate sensors and more effective noise cancelling, and look set to be just as ubiquitous as their predecessors.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It has been three years since thelast model, but the earbuds still come only in white and you really have to squint at the details to spot the difference from the previous two generations.The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/$249/A$429), making them £30 cheaper in the UK than when their predecessors launched, and sit above theAirPods 4, which cost £169 with noise cancelling for those who don’t like silicone earbud tips.The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked, changing slightly the way you put them in and making them more comfortable than their predecessors for extended listening sessions of three hours or more. Five sizes of tips are included in the box, but if you didn’t get on with silicone earbuds before these won’t make a difference.View image in fullscreenThe stalks are thesame length as before, but the shape of the earbud has been changed to better align the tip with your ear canal.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMost of the features are fairly standard for modern earbuds. Squeeze the stalks for playback controls, swipe for volume or take them out to pause the music. They support the same new features rolled out to Apple’s older earbuds, including the ability to use them as ashutter remotefor the camera app andfor live translation with the Translate appon the iPhone. The latter is limited to English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish for now and isn’t available in the EU, but it works surprisingly well for casual conversations.The biggest problem is that the other person will have to rely on reading or hearing your translated speech from your iPhone. I can see it being most useful with announcements or audio guides – the kind you get on transport or in museums where you need only to translate language one way.The most interesting added hardware feature is heart rate monitoring via sensors on the side of the earbuds, similar toApple’s Powerbeats Pro 2 fitness buds. They can be used with more than 50 workouts startedin the Fitness appor a handful of third-party apps on the iPhone and proved to be roughly in line with readings from aGarmin Forerunner 970or an Apple Watch during walks and runs. The earbuds are water-resistant to IP57 standards, which makes them much more robust against rain and sweat than before.The battery life has been increased by a third to at least eight hours of playback with noise cancelling for each charge, which is very competitive with some of the best rivals and long enough for most listening sessions.View image in fullscreenThe compact flip-top case provides two full charges for a total playback time of 24 hours – six hours short of the previous generation, but five minutes in the case is enough for an hour of listening time.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, UWBBattery life:eight hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)Water resistance:IP57 (buds and case)Earbud dimensions:30.9 x 19.2 x 27.0mmEarbud weight:5.6g eachCharging case dimensions:47.2 x 62.2 x 21.8mmCharging case weight:44gCase charging:USB-C, Qi wireless/MagSafe, Apple WatchBigger sound and impressive noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe silicone earbuds are infused with foam in the tips that expands slightly for a better seal for music and noise cancelling.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe sound of the third-generation AirPods Pro takes a great listen and makes it bigger. They have a wider soundscape that makes big tracks sound more expansive, while still maintaining strong but nicely controlled bass. They are detailed, well-balanced and do justice to different genres of music, with plenty of power and punch where needed. As with Apple’s other headphones, they sometimes sound a little too clinical, lacking a bit of warmth or rawness in some tracks, and they can’t quite hit the very deepest of notes for skull-rattling bass. However, few earbuds sound better at this price and size.Apple’s implementation of spatial audio for surround sound for movies remains best in class, adding to the immersion with compatible devices and services, even if spatial audio music remains a mixed bag.View image in fullscreenThe AirPods Pro are the best combination of earbuds and compact case that you can easily fit in a pocket.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe improved noise cancelling is the best upgrade. Apple says it is twice as effective as the already good AirPods Pro 2, which sounds about right. In side-by-side comparisons, the AirPods Pro 3 handle street noise, including cars, horns and engines, almost as well as theclass-leading Sony WH-1000XM6, which is thoroughly impressive given they are large over-ear headphones, not little earbuds.They also do a great job of dampening the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard clicks and speech, making the commute and office work more bearable.Apple’s class-leading transparency mode is just as good on the new earbuds, sounding natural as if you weren’t actually wearing the earbuds. It makes using them as hearing aids or out on the street with some dampening of sudden loud sounds very good indeed.Call quality is first-rate, and my voice sounded clear and natural in quiet or noisy environments with only a hint of road noise from some loud streets audible on the call.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe case charges via USB-C, MagSafe, Qi or Apple Watch charger, and has a new featureto limit chargingof the earbuds to prolong their battery health.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable, but Apple offers a battery service for £49 per earbud or case andoffers replacements for those lost or damaged costing from £79an item. The repair specialists iFixit rated the earbudszero out of 10 for repairability.The AirPods and case contain 40% recycled material by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes and breaks down the environmental impact of theearbuds in its report.PriceThe AirPods Pro 3 cost£219(€249/$249/A$429).For comparison, theAirPods 4start at£119, theBeats Powerbeats Pro 2cost£250, theSennheiser Momentum TW4cost£199, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£219, theSony WF-1000XM5cost£219and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds cost£300.VerdictThe AirPods Pro 3 take what was great about the ubiquitous second-generation models and improves almost everything.Longer battery life and a better, more comfortable fit for extended listening sessions are very welcome, as is the bigger, wider sound. Proper water resistance and built-in heart rate monitoring makes them useful for workouts, particularly those such as powerlifting that make wearing a watch difficult. The live translation feature worked better than expected, but has limitations that make it less useful for real-life conversations.The best bit is very effective noise cancelling that rivals some of the greatest over-ear headphones, but in a tiny set of earbuds that are much easier to carry around.Audiophiles will find they sound a little too clinical. While they work with any Bluetooth device, including Android phones, PCs and games consoles, they require an iPhone, iPad or Mac for full functionality. But the biggest letdownremains repairability, which remains a problem for most true wireless earbuds andloses them a star.Pros:very effective noise cancelling, great sound, best-in-class transparency, water resistance, built-in HR monitoring, great controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, very comfortable, excellent case, top class call quality.Cons:extremely difficult to repair, expensive, no hi-res audio support, lack features when connected to Android/Windows, look the same as predecessors, only available in white.View image in fullscreenThe AirPods Pro 3 are some of the very best earbuds you can buy, particularly if you use an iPhone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleHeadphonesWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Switching to rainwater or filtered water, and feeding only in spring and summer, will helpGynelle LeonTue 7 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTShareWhat’s the problem?There is a chalky white crust on the top of my spider plant’s potting mix, and the leaf tips are turning brown. Why is this happening and how do I fix it?DiagnosisThis is a buildup of mineral salts from hard tap water or fertiliser. As water evaporates, salts are left behind and come to the surface. Over time, they concentrate around the roots, drawing out moisture and scorching sensitive tissues, which shows up as brown, papery leaf tips and edges. It can also throw off the soil pH, so plants struggle to absorb nutrients.PrescriptionRun tepid tap water through the mix for a few minutes until plenty of water drains out. Repeat a week later. If the crust is heavy or the mix is compacted, repot in fresh, free-draining, peat-free compost and clean the pot before reusing it. Trim crisped tips with clean scissors, mirroring the natural shape of the leaf. Switch to rainwater, filtered water or boiled and cooled tap water. Feed only in spring and summer.PreventionFlush containers monthly to prevent salt buildup. Water deeply but less often, and always empty saucers of residue. Match your fertiliser use to growth periods and if your water is very hard, use rainwater.Got a plant dilemma?

The company said facial images and ID images “are deleted directly after” ages are confirmed, but Discord’s website noted that if verification fails, users can contact the trust and safety team for a manual review.Under the under 16s social media ban to come into effect on 10 December, the Australian government has outlined that it expects platforms such as Discord – which is one of the platformsthat has been asked to assess if it is required to comply– should have multiple options for assessing a user’s age, and a way for them to quicklyappeal an adverse decision.Platforms can ask for ID documents as part of the age assurance scheme, but it cannot be the sole method of age assurance offered by the platforms under the policy.The Australian privacy commissioner confirmed it had been notified about the breach by Discord.Discord was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGamesPrivacyCybercrimeHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

This Saturday is Harbour Fest, a day of music, performance and activities. An array of colourful street food vendors are already setting up.It’s unusual to see such excitement on the seafront, says 18-year-old Lacey Ritson. Growing up, Lacey and her friends would gravitate to picturesque Saint Bees along the coast or the nearby Lake District if they wanted to spend time by the water. And sometimes, she says, “we’d sit by the river and look at people, guessing who worked at Sellafield – like, ‘they’ve got a nice car – they’re from Sellafield’”.View image in fullscreenHarbourfest brings people to the seafront for a day of music and performance in WhitehavenSellafield, Europe’s largest nuclear site, looms large in Whitehaven at the centre of Britain’s “nuclear coast”. While it has not generated energy since 2003, decommissioning is expected to take until at least 2125. Between Sellafield Ltd and its wider supply chain,the site employs about 60,000 workers, more than 80% from Cumbria.The result is that everybody “either works at Sellafield or knows people who do”, says Lacey, whose mum, aunt and cousins all work on the site. Whitehaven’s young people have their own group speak: “Sellafield traffic” for the tailbacks on surrounding roads at home time each weekday; “Sellafield payday” as shorthand in hospitality for a busy weekend. Teenagers talk casually about “going into nuclear”.The nuclear sector’s influence is also felt economically: each year, Sellafield Ltd, its supply chain and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which owns the site, provide millions of pounds worth of funding for local projects, from theredevelopment of Whitehaven’s former bus stationto the creation of anew digital and gaming hub, and thecleanup of local rivers. This summer, the main stage atPridewas sponsored by engineering firm Mott MacDonald.View image in fullscreenLacey, 18, says goodbye to her horse Lloyd, before she leaves Whitehaven to go to university“I’d say round here you are helped a lot more than other coastal towns just because of Sellafield and the companies that supply them,” Lacey says.Just overhalf of the population of Whitehaven(and neighbouring town Workington) are in work, a figure slightly below the England average, but there are notably more in apprenticeships than the country average.For those who want to work at the nuclear plant, the career path can be lucrative, with apprentices earningup to about £30,000at Sellafield Ltd. But those who want something different can find themselves feeling cut off.View image in fullscreenThe Sellafield nuclear plant, which is in the process of being decommissioned, provides an attractive career path for many in the townAt Soundwave, a music charity in Whitehaven town centre, 15-year-old Cole McAvoy is one of those forging a different path. He also attends art sessions at the LGBTQ+ cafe Colours, run byProud and Diverse Cumbriawhose sponsors include Morgan Sindall and engineering consultancy firm Arup. But he feels there is little else in Whitehaven for creative young people.“We had a career day at school with people from different workplaces and 99% of them were from Sellafield. It kind of makes you feel like there’s just Sellafield or nothing,” he says.Q&AWhat is the Against the tide series?ShowOver the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.View image in fullscreenCole McAvoy, 15“As soon as you get into GCSEs it feels as if they’re pushing you to do triple science and engineering. Those subjects go on trips, they’ve got all this equipment, but if you study art you’re just in a tiny classroom and the teachers and students are bringing in the equipment themselves.”There is also a high turnover in school staff, Cole says, with many teachers leaving for higher-paying careers in the nuclear sector.In the town centre, at the Whitehaven Foyer, which provides temporary accommodation for young people, Sellafield is far from residents’ minds, despite Arup renting office space here. Many of those living here are care-experienced or have experienced poor mental health; thenumber of young people in careand thenumber of mental health hospital admissionsin the area are higher here than nationally.This town would fall apart without Sellafield … other communities mirror ours but they just don’t have this level of investmentEmma Williamson, Cumberland councilJames, 19, has a Jobcentre appointment this afternoon but isn’t optimistic; he has been trying unsuccessfully to get construction work for months in order to support his partner and two-year-old son. Mason, 17, is due to begin a college course next week but hasn’t been able to get the art supplies he needs, because he can’t afford the train fare to Carlisle. “Nuclear isn’t really a thing for us,” he says. “We’re just thinking about how we’re going to get money for what we need.”Emma Williamson, deputy leader of Cumberland council, and portfolio holder for children’s services, says that, for her, the nuclear sector’s impact is clear. “This town would fall apart without Sellafield,” she says. “I go to other communities that mirror ours but they just don’t have this level of investment.”View image in fullscreenEmma Williamson, deputy leader of Cumberland council, with Rayna and Libby, both 18But, she says, that doesn’t make it a solution for everybody. “We know that for those that are going to achieve, the opportunities are there,” she says. “But we need to be picking up all our young people and making sure there is a place for all kinds of jobs and opportunities.”Last month, the government announced that parts of South Whitehavenwould receive £20m of investment over the next decadefrom its Pride in Place programme for “overlooked” communities. A residents’ survey about how the money should be spent has already highlighted the need for better youth facilities and opportunities for young people, says Williamson.View image in fullscreenMcDonald’s, one of the only places where young people can hang out in the evenings.Photograph: The GuardianSuzanne Wilson, a research fellow at the University of Lancashire who works with communities in Whitehaven, says that despite the town’s connection to a leading employer, many of its young people face a lot of the same issues as they do in more deprived coastal places. “We are quite remote and public transport is unreliable,” she says. “And that affects what opportunities feel accessible to them.”She previously worked alongside the council on the university’s Connected Communities project, in which a group of girls from Whitehaven carried out their own community research and projects, including setting up a dementia cafe when they found that older people were more likely to experience loneliness. “It showed the passion and empathy young people have for their local community, and how important it is to recognise their insight, skill and compassion and work with them to create opportunities.”View image in fullscreenSuzanne Wilson, at the University of Lancashire, says unreliable public transport restricts opportunitiesDespite its sizable impact on their lives, Sellafield remains mysterious and inaccessible to many of Whitehaven’s young people, most of whom have never visited. One told of her excitement about an upcoming apprenticeship on site, but withdrew her contribution when she began work and was told she could not be quoted for confidentiality reasons. (The press office of the company – a contractor working on the Sellafield site – told the Guardian that they ask colleagues to inform them before any media engagement and prefer to review quotes before publication.)‘I say where I’m from and they tell me they’re sorry’: growing up in the most deprived place in EnglandRead moreJamie Reed, director of socio-economics at the NDA, was unable to meet the Guardian and local young people. In response to questions about whether all of Whitehaven’s young people were benefiting equally from Sellafield’s impact, Reed wrote in a statement: “One of our areas of focus is investing in developing Stem skills in young people so we have a pipeline of talent, but it’s important to us that we fund a diverse range of projects.“Across WestCumbriaand the UK these include projects which provide mental health support, tackle issues around poverty and social inclusion, support innovation in the supply chain, and improve and protect the environment.”For Lacey, who attended Energy Coast University Technical College, which is funded in part by the NDA and heavily invested in by the construction firm Morgan Sindall, a career in nuclear was always a consideration. And yet, she says, “I didn’t want to go and work there just because it’s what so many other people do.” Instead, she will soon begin an architecture degree at Newcastle University, one of only two peers going into higher education, most of the rest applying for nuclear apprenticeships.View image in fullscreenLacey, 18, is one of only two of her peers leaving for universityAt home, as she packs her belongings ready to leave, Lacey is contemplative. “I’ve never really thought much before about how Sellafield affects people, because it’s just something that has always been there,” she says, shrugging. “It’s just part of growing up in Whitehaven.”Share your experienceShare your experiencesYou can share your experiences of living in a coastal town using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Most escaped.The bodies of 67 people in the building have been found, as well as eight body parts that police are trying to identify, the disaster mitigation agency said in a statement, halting the search effort in a disaster it had called the year’s deadliest.“Operations due to the collapsed structure of the Al Khoziny school … are officially closed,” said Mohammad Syafii, chief of the search and rescue agency, after authorities cleared away the debris.No apology and no answers: parents in agony amid search for children trapped in Indonesia school collapseRead moreThe agency’s operations director, Yudhi Bramantyo, said rescuers on Tuesday cleared all the rubble at the collapse site, scoured the area, and concluded it was very unlikely they would find more bodies.“The total number of victims evacuated is 171, with 67 people dead, including eight body parts, and 104 people survived,” Yudhi told a press conference.Rescuers had used excavators and cranes to lift large chunks of concrete. Digging through tunnels, they shouted out the names of victims presumed to be still alive.Al Khoziny is one of more than 42,000 such schools nationwide, known as pesantren, just 50 of which have a building permit, the public works ministry has said.Police allege two levels were being added to the two-story building without a permit, leading to structural failure. This hastriggered widespread angerover illegal construction in Indonesia.Indonesia’s 2002 building construction code states that permits have to be issued by the relevant authorities prior to any construction, or else owners face fines and imprisonment. If a violation causes death, this can lead to up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to 8bn rupiah (nearly $500,000).The school’s caretaker, Abdus Salam Mujib, a respected Islamic cleric in East Java, offered a public apology in a rare appearance a day after the incident.“This is indeed God’s will so we must all be patient, and may God replace it with goodness, with something much better,” he said. “We must be confident that God will reward those affected by this incident with great rewards.”Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He also left a sign on the front door. I wasn’t home. But my partner and guest were. This is truly gutless,” Peters said. Peters told media on Tuesday the note said “welcome to the real world”.Pacific must not become a ‘military zone’ amid rise of China, New Zealand’s deputy PM warnsRead moreSupt Sunny Patel said a man believed to be responsible for the damage on Monday evening had handed himself into police, and will appear in Auckland district court on Friday, charged with burglary.“Police have charged a person following an incident where a window was smashed during a protest last night,” Patel said.Police recognise the right to lawful protest, but did not condone protest action where property is damaged, he said. The police did not specify the nature of the protest.New Zealand enjoys relatively open access to its politicians and violence directed towards lawmakers is fairly rare, however some politicians – particularlywomen– have faced increasing threats and harassment in recent years. During the 2023 election campaign multiple candidates reported experiencingattacks, break-ins and abuse.Peters said “New Zealanders need to be deeply concerned about where our country is going and see who are the perpetrators of this divisive and violent behaviour.”Opposition politicians, Labour’s Chris Hipkins, and Green party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick condemned the vandalism.“Winston Peters’ home should not have been the target for the protest and political violence is never okay,” Hipkins told broadcaster RNZ.Speaking to the NZ Herald, Swarbrick said the party had always explicitly condemned attacks on people’s homes.“This crosses a threshold and goes well beyond people’s right to protest,” she said.Peters has faced pressure from protest groups in recent weeks, after he announced New Zealand would not recognise Palestinian statehood – a stance that opposition parties, academics and members of the public havecriticised as being out of step with the countries’ traditional allies, Australia, the UK and Canada.Last week, dozens of Pro-Palestine protesters set up outside Peters’ home.On Monday, the Green party and thefamilies of three New Zealand activistsdetained in Israel after they were removed from vessels carrying aid to Gaza, called on Peters and the government to secure their safe return and to take a stronger stance against Israel.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandWinston PetersNew Zealand politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They infer the potential costs [of action] while ignoring the benefits, and that’s what happened with the BCA modelling.“Trade associations have played a role for many years, allowing companies to hide in the crowd. These associations can do the dirty work for corporations and run their political campaigns that might otherwise do brand damage.”Downie appeared last week at aSenate inquiry, called by the Greens, into climate and energy misinformation and disinformation.That inquiry hasreceived almost 200 submissionswith several groups, including the Climate Council, WWF-Australia and Climate Action Against Disinformation, pointing to a long list of claims promoted recently by conservative politicians, thinktanks and conservative media.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s a lot of reasons, but intentional efforts from coal and gas and their enablers is why we have this history in Australia of climate policy inaction.”A BCA spokesperson said the council was committed to “affordably and reliably achieving net zero by 2050 and supports the setting of ambitious but – importantly – achievable 2035 targets”.The statement said the modelling was developed “with a bottom-up analysis and takes an investment approach based on current costs and technologies. It’s focused on the policy changes and investment required to decarbonise our economy.”They said the conclusions reached were consistent with modelling carried out by the CSIRO and the Treasury.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsClimate science scepticism and denialClimate crisisAustralian politicsAustralian mediaClimate sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

Until now, there hasn’t been much consistent research to explain why depression affects females and males differently, including the possible role of genetics.”The study acknowledged explanations have been put forward spanning behavioural, environmental and biological domains, includingmen being less likely to seek helpleading to under-diagnosis, and environmental exposures such aswomen being more frequently exposed to sexual abuseand interpersonal violence.The study stated that together these factors highlight the need for a “multifaceted approach” to understanding the underlying mechanisms of depression but proposed that a “key component of the biological mechanisms underlying these disparities could be differences in genetics”.The researchers analysed the DNA from five international cohorts – Australia, the Netherlands, United States and two from the United Kingdom – with a final sample size of 130,471 women and 64,805 men with major depression, and 159,521 women and 132,185 men without the diagnosis.They also found stronger genetic correlations in women between depression and metabolic traits (such body mass index and metabolic syndrome) than in men with the same traits.Dr Jodi Thomas, the lead researcher, said these genetic differences “may help explain why females with depression more often experience metabolic symptoms, such as weight changes or altered energy levels”.The authors acknowledged the study included roughly twice as many women with depression as men, and performed additional analyses to ensure their findings were not due to the difference in sample sizes.They also acknowledged limitations that their analyses were restricted to Europeans only, limiting the applicability of the findings to other populations.Nobel prize in physics awarded to three scientists for work on quantum mechanicsRead moreProf Philip Mitchell, from the School of Clinical Medicine at the University of New South Wales, said “there has been longstanding debate about the reasons for the consistent finding around the world that depression is more common in females than males, with most studies reporting that women have two to three times the risk of depression compared to men”.“The most dominant theories have been related to social and psychological factors, for example the impact of the female role in caring for families compared to the income earning role of males, or personality vulnerabilities in women,” said Mitchell, who was not involved in the study.“This very interesting novel genetic study in a very large global study provides strong evidence that these differences in rates of depression may in fact be due to genetic factors, with the statistically significant finding of more depression risk regions in the genome in females compared to males, and little overlap in these regions between males and females.“As well as strengthening the evidence that the differences in depression rates between men and women may be largely due to biological factors, it also points to the future possibility of different pharmacological treatments for depression in women and men, as the biological systems coded for by these genetic regions become better understood.”Explore more on these topicsScienceDepressionnewsShareReuse this content"

Dogan is being tried on appeal in Nîmes in southern France.Pelicot said he met Dogan, an unemployed builder, on a chatroom called “against her knowledge” and told him clearly that he drugged his then wife and was seeking men to come to rape her.“He had that information from the start,” Pelicot said, adding that he told Dogan by phone: “I’m looking for someone to abuse my wife after I’ve put her to sleep without her knowledge.” Pelicot saidhe had admitted drugging his wife, raping her himself and inviting men to rape her. “They all knew, they all came with the same intention,” he said. “I always said she was sedated.”Pelicot, a 73-year-old former electrician and estate agent, is one of theworst sex offenders in modern French history. He is serving a 20-year prison sentence after crushing sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into his then wife’s food and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious in their bedroom in the Provence village of Mazan between 2011 and 2020.For Tuesday’s hearing he was transported from his high-security prison in southernFrance, where he is in solitary confinement, to the Nîmes appeals court to give evidence as a witness in a secure witness box, flanked by four police officers.Gisèle Pelicot, 72, who became an international feminist hero after she waived her right to anonymity in the trial last year, sat calmly in court with her youngest son, Florian.Who are the men convicted over rape and assault of Gisèle Pelicot?Read moreDogan, 44, was one of 51 men convicted. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for raping Gisèle Pelicot. He is the only man to contest his conviction, telling the appeal trial: “I never intended to rape that lady.”Dominique Pelicot told the court he had given Dogan specific instructions because Gisèle Pelicot was drugged and was not to be woken. “I said precisely on the phone there was to be no tobacco, no scent, he was to wash his hands, no violence, it would be filmed. All these things left him in no doubt of her state. He had to get undressed at the entrance to the kitchen on the patio because if there was a problem, I didn’t want him to stay,” he said.He said Dogan, who had driven about an hour from another village after telling his wife he was going out, arrived around midnight. Pelicot said he at first got lost and he went out on foot to guide him to the house.Asked if Dogan was upset to see Gisèle Pelicot lying unconscious on her bed, Dominique Pelicot replied: “No, it suited him.”He said there was a camera on a tripod in the room, so there would have been no doubt the rape would be filmed. He said Dogan stayed for about two hours. He said Dogan even asked for his help in the rapes that night. “He asked me to lift my wife’s leg and wanted to put her head in a certain position because she couldn’t do it,” Pelicot said.He said Dogan “took pleasure” in the situation.Asked about Dogan’s assertion that Pelicot told him it was a game, he replied: “No, I never said that.”Pelicot said of Dogan’s appeal: “I think it is indecent.”The trial continues until Thursday.Explore more on these topicsGisèle PelicotGisèle Pelicot rape trialFranceRape and sexual assaultEuropeViolence against women and girlsnewsShareReuse this content"

She said there would be an option for parents to give permission to their children to use social media from the age of 13.It is hoped the ban could come into effect as early as next year.It follows the lead of Australia, which isintroducing a ban on social media platformsincluding Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube for under-16s, and Norway where the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, has also said he would enforce astrict minimum age limitof 15 on social media, raising it from 13.Støre said last year that it would be “an uphill battle” but that politicians must intervene to protect children from the “power of the algorithms”.Denmark’s minister of digitalisation, Caroline Stage, said her government’s announcement was a “breakthrough”. She said: “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: we’ve been too naive. We’ve left children’s digital lives to platforms that never had their wellbeing in mind. We must move from digital captivity to community.”In her speech, the prime minister cited figures showing that 60% of 11- to 19-year-old boys did not see a single friend in their free time, while 94% of Danish children in seventh grade had a profile on social media before they were 13.“Mobile phones and social media are stealing our children’s childhood,” she said.The announcement comes after Denmarksaid in Februarythat mobile phones would be banned in all schools and after-school clubs. The decision was made on the recommendation of a government wellbeing commission, set up to investigate growing dissatisfaction among children and young people, that found children under 13 should not have their own smartphone or tablet.The findings of research into the impact of social media on children and young people is forcing governments around the world to reconsider access to social media. In June, Greece proposed the EU set an “age of digital adulthood” that would prevent children from accessing social media without their parents’ consent.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkSocial mediaInternet safetySmartphonesChildrenMobile phonesInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

So I’ll be able to tell you more in due course, but we are in discussions as you’d expect.”The prime minister declined to go into further details about what ministers were asking from Brussels. “I’m not going to go into the details, but I’m going to tell you in clear terms as you would expect we are discussing this with the EU and with the US.”Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said it was “vital” to “protect trade flows between the UK and EU” and that he would meet industry leaders on Thursday. He added he was “pushing the European Commission for urgent clarification of the impact of this move on the UK”.In its plan presented to the European parliament on Tuesday, the European Commission also proposed slashing the existing quota for duty-free imports and obliging foreign suppliers to declare where the steel was melted and poured to prevent China sneaking products in through other countries.Senior officials said rules would be an “important stepping stone” to progress negotiations with the US and prove to Trump that the EU had a common foe in Beijing.“The European steel industry was on the verge of collapse – we are protecting it so that it can invest, decarbonise, and become competitive again,” the bloc’s commissioner for industry, Stéphane Séjourné, told an event in Strasbourg.The proposals are designed to replace a quota system that has been in operation for the last seven years and which is due to expire in 2026, and is now seen as not fit for purpose. To do nothing could have been “fatal” for the industry, one EU official said.The source said the new proposals were intended to act as “an important stepping stone” in negotiations with the US over the scrapping of the current 50% tariff on EU steel imports by signalling joint opposition to Chinese steel dumping.However, Gareth Stace, the head of the industry body UK Steel, said Brussels doubling its tariffs would pose “the biggest crisis the UK steel industry has ever faced”.He called on the government to “recognise the urgent need to put in place its own measures to defend” the UK steel industry – which is still reeling from a 25% tariff imposed by the US president earlier this year – from the threat of millions of tonnes of world steel diverted away from US and European markets. This flood of imports could be “terminal for many of our remaining steel companies”, Stace said.Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary at steelworkers’ union Community, said the new measures posed “an existential threat” to UK steel.Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer with the GMB trade union, called the tariffs a “hammer blow” that “could be the end of steelmaking in the UK if proper safeguards aren’t secured”.The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, denied the move was hostile to the UK, noting that once it had submitted the proposals to the World Trade Organization the commission would discuss an “allocation of the steel quota for UK”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will impose a 50% tariff on imports beyond the quota and oblige countries exporting into the bloc to state where the steel was melted and poured to prevent circumvention of the sanctions.Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein will not be subject to tariff quotas or duties owing to their close trading relationship in the European Economic Area, the EU has said.Alongside the proposal, the EU is seeking a “metals alliance” with the US to ringfence their respective economies from overcapacity.“TheEuropean Unionneeds to act now, and decisively, before all lights go out in large parts of the EU steel industry and its value chains,” said the president of industry group Eurofer, Henrik Adam.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsEuropean UnionTariffsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Macron was re-elected in April 2022 for a five-year term, but since snap legislative elections in 2024 his appointees as prime minister have been unable to summon a parliamentary majority to pass a budget.“Time is of the essence,” Philippe said. “We are not going to prolong what we have been experiencing for the past six months. Another 18 months is far too long and it is damaging France. The political game we are playing today is distressing.”Philippe, who polls suggest is the best-placed candidate to lead the political centre in the next presidential elections, was not alone among Macron’s former prime ministers in distancing himself from the beleaguered head of state.Gabriel Attal – whose brief tenure as France’s youngest-ever prime minister ended last year when Macron called the snap vote that produced France’s present hung parliament – said he no longer understood the president’s decisions.Attal, who now leads the main pro-Macron party, told French media that after burning through five prime ministers in under two years it was “time to try something else”, criticising what he called Macron’s “determination to keep control”.The calls came after the outgoing prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was appointed only 28 days ago, resigned with his 14-hour-old cabinet on Monday but was asked by Macron to hold last-ditch talks with party leaders to try to rally support.Macron gave Lecornu until Wednesday evening to try to “define a platform for action and stability”. However, in a sign of the difficulties he faces, the far-right National Rally (RN), the largest single party in parliament, refused to attend.“These umpteenth negotiations no longer aim to protect the interests of the French people, but those of the president himself,” said the party, which polls suggest would finish first in an eventual parliamentary election but is unlikely to secure a majority.In a scathing editorial, Le Monde said the crisis was a “tragic farce” and “yet another demonstration of the unravelling” of Macron’s second mandate since his re-election in 2022. “The president finds himself in a major crisis,” it said.The newspaper castigated France’s “entire political class”, which it said was “incapable of rising to the challenge”, preferring to posture in the run-up to the presidential ballot due in 2027 rather than “build a compromise essential for the months to come”.France has been in political crisis for more than a year since the 2024 election – called in response to far-right successes in the European parliamentary elections that year – produced a parliament divided between three more or less equal blocs: the left, far right and Macron’s own centre-right alliance, with no majority.Among other options, Macron could reappoint Lecornu, select another new prime minister – possibly a non-party-political technocrat – who would become his eighth, or dissolve parliament again and hold new legislative elections.He has long said he is reluctant hold fresh legislative elections, which polls suggest would probably return another divided parliament, but on Monday hinted he may be prepared to do so if Lecornu fails in his last-chance mission.Macron has also repeatedly insisted he will not resign before the end of his mandate in 2027.1:47French PM Sébastien Lecornu resigns after less than a month in office – videoThe calls from Macron’s allies echoed similar demands from the president’s opponents on both the left and far right, including the far-right RN president, Jordan Bardella, who on Tuesday said he, too, backed fresh parliamentary elections or an early presidential ballot.“I call on the president of the republic to hear the suffering in the country, to come out of his isolation, and to dissolve the national assembly,” Bardella said. “We must go back to the French people so they can choose a majority for themselves.”What happened on a chaotic day in French politics – and what next?Read moreLecornu met on Tuesday with the leaders of Macron’s centrist alliance and the conservative Les Républicains (LR), with the parties reportedly agreeing that finding a deal to urgently pass next year’s planned austerity budget must be the top priority.The political crisis is being played out against the backdrop of France’s deepening financial woes: its debt-to-GDP ratio is the EU’s third-highest and almost twice the ceiling permitted under EU rules, as is its projected budget deficit of nearly 6%.Lecornu will need the support of others, however, including the centre-left Socialist party (PS), to have any hope of a majority in parliament to approve the legislation. The PS has called for “a change of course” under a new “leftwing government”.Lecornu became the shortest-lived prime minister in modern French history when he resigned, the country’s fifth prime minister since Macron’s re-election in 2022 and the third since the parliamentary dissolution of last year.Explore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both sides expressed multiple reservations and are seeking substantial changes to many of its currently ill-defined provisions, however.Trump on Tuesday said there was a “real chance” of a deal as he met the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in the White House.Badr Abdelatty, the Egyptian foreign minister, said the main current focus of the talks was establishing a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages and a number of Palestinian prisoners.He said the parties were also discussing maps showing areas from where Israeli forces would withdraw in the first phase, which also includes “full and unconditional” delivery of humanitarian aid toGazathrough the UN.In his message marking the anniversary,Benjamin Netanyahuvowed to achieve all the goals of the war, including crushing Hamas.“We are in fateful, decisive days,” the Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday evening. “We will continue to act to achieve all the war’s objectives: the return of all abductees, the elimination of Hamas’s rule and ensuring that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel.”Ahead of the resumption of talks on Tuesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an end to the hostilities, which have created “a humanitarian catastrophe on a scale that defied comprehension”.During the attack on 7 October 2023, Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, of whom 47 remain captive in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.The Israeli offensive that followed has killed more than 67,000 people, mostly civilians, injured more than 170,000 andreduced much of Gaza to rubble.Trump’s plan has receivedwidespread international backing, including in the Arab and Islamic worlds.In Washington, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, would talk part in the talks and keep the president apprised. It is important “that we get this done quickly”, she said.Weary Israelis greet Trump as saviour as hostages deal inches closerRead moreNetanyahu said talks would be “confined to a few days maximum” and Trump has said that Hamas must move quickly, “or else all bets will be off”.Many uncertainties remain, however, including over the demand that Hamas disarm, the extent of the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the future governance of Gaza.On Tuesday, Fawzi Barhoum, a senior Hamas official, said in a televised speech that the group’s delegation was seeking to “surmount all obstacles” to reaching a settlement, adding also that its 2023 attack on Israel was a “historic response” to “attempts to eradicate the Palestinian cause”.Netanyahu has long said Hamas must surrender and disarm, but this has become one of the most contentious parts of Trump’s plan, which calls for the eradication of Hamas’s “military infrastructure”.However, it is unclear if this will be defined as including light weapons, which Hamas fighters will be extremely unwilling to give up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The territory would then be placed under a technocratic committee and international governance, with Trump and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, in oversight roles. Hamas, which seized power in Gaza in 2007, has said it wants to hand over to a politically independent Palestinian body.Osama Hamdan, a second Hamas official, told Al Araby television network that Hamas would refuse foreign administration of Gaza and that the entry of foreign forces would be “unacceptable”.Under the plan, Israel would also free 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in its prisons and 1,700 people detained from Gaza since the war began, including all women and children. There are likely to be fierce disagreements over who exactly is released.Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already, in line with the plan, and was cautious on the prospects of the talks, which come after multiple failed efforts to bring the war to a close.Ceasefires arranged in November 2023 and January 2025 both collapsed, the first after two weeks, the second after two months.“I have no doubt that this round of negotiations is a process in which all parties are strongly committed to reaching a consensus, but there are many details to consider,” he said, adding that the plan’s clauses “require practical interpretation on the ground”.Trump has called on Israel to suspend all hostilities in Gaza, posting last week on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!”In Gaza City, residents said Israeli attacks continued until the early hours of the morning on Tuesday, though there were no immediate reports of casualties. A rocket was reportedly launched from northern Gaza into Israel but caused no damage or injuries.Part of the plan is to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians are facing hunger and, in some areas, famine.UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the organisation was ready to act.“The machinery is cranked up and ready to go as soon as we get the green light. There are many thousands of metric tonnes in the pipeline of goods ready to enter from Jordan, the Israeli port of Ashdod and elsewhere,” Dujarric said.Explore more on these topicsGazaTrump administrationIsraelEgyptQatarPalestineDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

InGaza, tragically, there have been 730 days of failure and none of success. Indeed, the destruction, the death toll and the spillover of the conflict into other countries is a monument to shame diplomacy and what remains of international law. Arguably, it is the profession’s lowest point since 1939.Some will claim failure is inevitable since this conflict is now so embedded and impervious to compromise that it can only be settled at the barrel of the gun, in essence through the repression or erasure of one side.Yet, however entrenched the mutual hatreds, a consensus is building across the west that this conflict was desperately mishandled, including by European leaders who initially ceded responsibility to a US Democratic administration that romanticised modernIsrael, misread how its government might react to the horror of 7 October – and how that would polarise the west.Indeed, the mea culpas and self-justifications have been streaming out of Joe Biden’s former team. In her book on her doomed bid to become president, Kamala Harris writes: “I had pleaded with Joe, when he spoke publicly on this issue, to extend the same empathy he showed to the suffering of Ukrainians to the suffering of innocent Gazan civilians. But he couldn’t do it: while he could passionately state ‘I am a Zionist’, his remarks about innocent Palestinians came off as inadequate and forced.”She adds that Benjamin Netanyahu never repaid the loyalty that Biden had shown because he wanted Donald Trump in the seat opposite him.View image in fullscreenJoe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in July 2024.Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesAt its most generous, the Democrats misread the power dynamics. “We did not act like a superpower,” Andrew Miller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli-Palestinian affairs, said recently. “Instead of beginning from the proposition that these were problems we could solve, we persuaded ourselves that there was little we could do to move our regional ally Israel.”Trump did not have that inferiority complex. He used his unpredictability as his greatest diplomatic weapon but, like Biden, his special envoy Steve Witkoff became bogged down in trying to find a formula that guaranteed the release of all the hostages without Israelresuming the fighting, as it did in March this year.As successive variations of the Witkoff proposals emerged, France and Saudi Arabia took matters into their own hands, deciding to use a UN conference on a two-state solution as a vehicle for gripping the diplomacy in a different way. The US monopoly on the peace process was broken and the neglected issue of Palestinian self-rule was finally addressed.The ‘day-after’ planBefore the conference, initially due to be held in June but delayed by a month by Israel’s attack on Iran, Emmanuel Macron extracted a letter from the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, that endorsed a plan for the day after a ceasefire under which Hamas would be disarmed and debarred from holding office and a transitional body of experts would be formed to governPalestine“under the umbrella” of a reformed Palestinian Authority. The notion of reform of the PA, often an empty diplomatic vessel, was this time given specifics, including a commitment by Abbas to much-delayed elections and internal change. An international force would be introduced.Many versions of the “day after” plan for Gaza had been circulating since 2024 – one by American and Israeli experts published by the Wilson Center, another drafted by the Rand Corporation, a set of principles issued by the United Arab Emirates and a plan from Egypt. The Saudi-French plan incorporated many of these ideas into what became the New York declaration, passed by the UN conference in July andendorsed by the UN general assemblyin September, with Israel and the US voting against.View image in fullscreen‘We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards,’ said a European diplomat.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne European diplomat said: “Although there was a lot of media heat about the issue ofrecognising Palestinian statehood, that was not where the serious diplomatic breakthrough was. We managed to convince the Americans to link the commitments to the ceasefire to a plan for what happens afterwards – and to realise that focusing on a ceasefire on its own would not work.”In reference to the US’s over-reliance on Israeli firepower to impose its will, the diplomat said: “We also convinced them they could not go on rolling the dice and thinking it will come up double six.”Critical to the process was a meeting in the White House in late August where Jared Kushner, Tony Blair and Witkoff convinced Trump thatmass expulsions of Palestiniansfrom Gaza was neither necessary nor wise.View image in fullscreenJared Kushner (left) and Steve Witkoff before a press conference with Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on 29 September.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOne of those present said: “Trump had no illusions about Netanyahu’s reliability and had invested in the Middle East states. He was persuaded that for states such as Jordan and Egypt the spectre of waves of Palestinian refugees spilling over their borders was a red line. Trump agreed to take mass enforced displacement off the agenda.”The other big message out of the meeting was that for the first time it became feasible to try to merge White House and French thinking. Speaking at Harvard University last month, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said: “President Trump asked some of his close advisers to go to the Arab countries, to go to France, to go to the UK, to gather all the ideas that all of us have been putting together for months and years for what a day after plan would look like.”The aim of the two-state solution conference and the general assembly vote, Barrot said, was to remove the obstacles to the two-state solution, including by Arab states condemning the 7 October attacks and endorsing the declaration’s exclusion ofHamasfrom Gaza.View image in fullscreenThe French foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot (centre) arrives for a UN summit on Palestinians in New York last month.Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images“Until that vote, there was no international condemnation of Hamas, no international call for its disarmament, no international goal for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza and Palestine,” Barrot said. “This is done. We have changed the mindset. Everyone now sees Hamas for what they are: a terrorist organisation.”The second obstacle, he explained, was to overcome Arab governments’ reluctance to state publicly that they had a goal of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.Barrot said the new UN text went further than ever before. “We got them … to say that they aspire not only to have a normal relationship with Israel, but to enter into a common regional architecture in the model of Asean in Asia or OSCE in Europe,” he said. “We got them to say things they never said.”So, contrary to appearance, the weeks and days leading up to the general assembly was about the Arab states reaching out to Israel. Far from being rewarded, Hamas, an opponent of a two-state solution, was being ostracised from political power in Palestine, a fate its battered leadership has reluctantly accepted.The Trump planBut for Israel the New York declaration, with its clear references to a Palestinian state and a role for a reformed Palestinian Authority, remained unacceptable. So when Trump revealed his plan to the Arab and Muslim states on the sidelines of the general assembly, the declaration had become the benchmark against which it was to be judged by the Arab and Muslim states.The Trump plan, largely prepared by Blair and Kushner, was necessarilythin, ambiguousand stripped of a timetable. The Arab states had misgivings, but advocates such as Blair argued that if the plan was more specific it would lose the required broad support and critical momentum. The lack of immediate leaks delighted western diplomats since it suggested the Arab states thought they could work with the plan.But while the Arab states left New York, Netanyahu stayed in New York, holding two lengthy weekend meetings with Witkoff. After Israel’sattack on Hamas negotiatorsin Qatar on 9 September – a personal betrayal of Witkoff and Qatar – Netanyahu was persona non grata in the White House. Yet the Israeli prime minister extracted further concessions.The amnesty to Hamas members was only available to those who handed over weapons in front of international observers and committed to peaceful coexistence. More detail was added about the destruction of Hamas infrastructure. Moreover, the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces was blurred, and by the end the IDF would have to withdraw only to a security buffer zone encompassing more than 17% of Gaza until the strip “is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.View image in fullscreenIsraeli army tanks in front of war-destroyed buildings in Gaza City.Photograph: Jack Guez/EPAThe process for this withdrawal “will be carried out according to criteria, and with a timeframe, to be agreed upon between the IDF, the international stabilisation force, the guarantors and the United States”.After the plan’s publication, Netanyahu in a video message assured his domestic audience that Israel’s red lines were protected: Gaza separated from the West Bank, no return by the PA to Gaza, no path toward a “two-state solution” and no removal of Israel security forces from the majority of the Gaza Strip.In trying to assuage the extremists in his coalition, Netanyahu was also doing all he could to persuade Hamas to reject the plan, so he could pursue the military offensive into Gaza City.An answer from HamasEven though the plan did not have a timeline for when the board of technocrats would hand power to an elected Palestinian government, Qatar, Turkey and Egypt urged Hamas to accept many of the unsatisfactory ambiguities that could be addressed later. The war would end.Diplomats said this message was received best not by the Hamas political wing in Doha but by the Hamas fighters inside Gaza, a new younger cadre steeped in the sacrifices made. With wording crafted by Qatar, the Hamas answer was in effect a “yes, but” that was open to many interpretations. Trump, to Netanyahu’s utter dismay, chose to take the Hamas response as an unqualified “yes”. The key was that Hamas was willing to relinquish its greatest bargaining chip: the remaining hostages.Tahani Mustafa, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that since the 7 October attack Palestinian politics has shifted to a more transactional outlook. “Palestinians are looking to someone that can make life bearable, keep them on their land and improve their living conditions. The very bare minimum is what people are asking for. Most Palestinians on the ground have resigned themselves to their fate.”View image in fullscreenTony Blair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APOn this basis, the technocratic body to be chaired by Trump, but likely to be dominated by Blair with some figures from the Palestinian diaspora, could derive its legitimacy through its effectiveness.Blair will be working against the destabilising backdrop of imminent elections in both Israel and Palestine. One of the body’s first tasks will be to build a relationship with Palestinian politics. Blair has close relations with the elites of the Middle East but none with the street, and he may leave to others such as Egypt the task of mediating an intra-Palestinian dialogue on Palestinian unity, a dialogue led by China, that the ageing and authoritarian PA president has sought to sabotage.If elections do occur as promised, it could produce a change. The last time elections were attempted, in 2021 in the West Bank, the democratic appetite was there with 36 lists formed outside the established factions. The key question is what will happen if the elections produce a result that Blair’s technocratic board do not like.As the Gaza war has continued with ever worsening devastation, Israel’s reputation has been shattered. In the Arab world, Israel is now seen as a greater threat to security than Iran. In the global south it is likened to apartheid South Africa, and across Europe the demonstrations and accusations of genocide continue. Growing majorities of American Jews and Democrats disapprove of Israel’s actions.Robert Malley, a US negotiator at the time of the Oslo accords, has just co-authored a book on the impossibility of rational diplomatic answers to the conflict. He said external would-be peacemakers had been “so focused on whether we can get them to agree on what it would mean if there was a Palestinian state, just words on a piece of paper, without coming to terms with the nature of this conflict, the nature of this beast – which was a historical clash of narratives.“From the Israeli perspective, they won in 1948. They won in 1967. And the Palestinians believe that they were victims of a historic injustice in 1948, 700,000 Palestinians expelled, loss of their land.“And so for us Americans to come in and say, ‘well, let’s just paper over these differences, forget about the right of return, forget about Israeli historic grievances and Palestinian historic grievances, put a bow around it and call this peace’ – that was never going to fly with the parties.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsrael-Gaza: two years onIsraelGazaPalestineHamasUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite Trump’s demandsthat Israel stop bombing Gazain anticipation of a hostage release, strikes on the striphave continued. Gaza’s ministry of health said at least 19 people were killed by Israel over the past 24 hours, including two people seeking aid.More than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed and about 170,000 have been wounded by Israel in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry. At least 460 people have diedfrom starvationin Gaza, and the world’s leading authority on food crises has said afamine is unfoldingin parts of the strip – a product of what most aid agencies say is an Israeli blockade on Gaza. Israel has denied the claim.AUN commission of inquiry, several human rights groups and the world’s premier association ofgenocide scholarshave said Israel has committed genocide in Gaza over the past two years. Israel has denied the accusation and said its actions constituted self-defence.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It found that many employers are out of step with the generational change in attitude towards drinking because they still hold work social events in bars or pubs or make alcohol a central feature of the occasion.The report highlights how in contrast the restaurant chain Wagamama has replaced alcohol-centred staff socials with explicitly non-alcoholic events such as pottery workshops, yoga classes, running clubs and boxing sessions, which have improved morale and cohesion.The IPPR’s findings are partly based on a representative survey of 2,083 working-age UK adults by the pollsters Public First. “Even as drinking habits shift, cultural pressures in the workplace continue to drive harm,” the thinktank said.The survey found:32% of workers had called in sick the next day after drinking at a work event or with workmates in the last year.41% of 18- to 24-year-olds had been too hungover to work, and 47% of 25- to 34-year-olds.22% of staff in education and 24% in health and social care had cried off work the next day after drinking at or after work in the past six months, and a fifth in both sectors had turned up late the next day.28% think drinking at work events excludes non-drinkers or creates cliques.The IPPR, which is influential with the Labour government, said workplace drinking “is not just a hangover, it’s a productivity crisis”, with alcohol harm now “a national economic problem”.Sebastian Rees, the thinktank’s head of health, said: “On one hand, gen Z are drinking less than previous generations, and some employers are taking welcome steps to move away from alcohol-centred work events. Yet the UK’s professional culture remains deeply rooted in drinking. A pint after work, a glass of wine at a networking event or a social at the pub still sit at the heart of many careers.”The IPPR urged ministers to bring in minimum unit pricing for alcohol in England, which evidence suggests is reducing alcohol-linked deaths in Scotland, and to tell employers to do more on workplace drinking.Dr Richard Piper, the chief executive ofAlcoholChange UK, which funded the report, said it countered “endless alcohol industry overclaim about the economic benefits it delivers”.Alcohol “hampers the daily functioning and performance of our workplaces and overall strength of our economy”, he said. “When alcohol dominates workplace cultures, productivity and wellbeing both take a hit while making life much harder for those of us who don’t drink alcohol or want to drink less.”The Confederation of British Industry said employers must ensure staff do not feel under pressure to drink at work events. “Having clear policies is an important starting point [to making events inclusive] and a growing number of employers have policies specifically about alcohol,” said Matthew Percival, the CBI’s future of work and skills director. “There are many reasons why individuals may not wish to consume alcohol at work events, and nobody should ever feel pressured to do so.”The government declined to respond directly to the IPPR’s report. A spokesperson said: “As part of our 10-year health plan, we are supporting people to make healthier choices through our shift from sickness to prevention as we build an NHS fit for the future. This includes committing to introducing a mandatory requirement for alcoholic drinks to display consistent nutritional information and health warning messages.“The government has also provided an additional £310m to improve drug and alcohol treatment services and wider recovery support.”It continues to review moves to reduce alcohol-related harm, such as changes to alcohol duty and the possible introduction of minimum unit pricing.Explore more on these topicsAlcoholWork & careersHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

By 2020-22 that gap had widened, so that it would take 52 years of earnings.Molly Broome, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation and the lead author of the report, said: “Wealth gaps in Britain are now so large that a typical full-time employee saving all their earnings across their entire working life would still not be able to reach the top of the wealth ladder.”The gap between the wealth of the average person and someone in the top 10% was £1m in 2006-08, but had widened to £1.3m in real terms by 2020-22, the foundation finds..Broome added: “These gaps are doubly concerning as wealth mobility in Britain is low – people that start life wealthy tend to stay wealthy, and vice versa.”Despite the wealth gap widening in absolute terms, however, the share of total wealth in the UK held by the richest households – known as “relative wealth inequality” – has been “broadly stable since the 1980s”, the thinktank points out. Over that time, total wealth in the UK surged from three times the annual GDP, to almost 7.5 times.So-called “passive” gains, through rising house prices and changes in pension valuations, were the main drivers of the widening wealth gap since 2010, according to the report.These tended to accrue to older, property-owning households, the research shows – worsening the intergenerational wealth divide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In contrast, the typical family in the highest income quintile saw their liquid savings increase by £4,200”, the report finds.Explore more on these topicsInequalityEconomicsResolution FoundationOffice for National StatisticsHouse pricesThinktanksSavingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer’s Labour government has declared theprotection and enhancementof national parks to be vital to its mission to restore nature and boost the nation’s health through access to green spaces. Ministers celebrated the parks last year on the 75th anniversary of their creation.But a suggested change being promoted by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to the planning bill would remove a key duty on councils and other public bodies to protect and enhance the nature and wildlife within national parks, seriously weakening the protections for these much-loved areas, charities say.It is understood discussions on the changes are ongoing within governmentand that ministers have until Monday to come forward with amendments to the planning bill. However, a government spokesperson told the Guardian that it was untrue that these changes were being discussed.Rose O’Neill, the chief executive of the Campaign for National Parks, said there was no evidence that the duty to enhance the parks was stopping growth. She said the last-minute proposal was a kneejerk reaction backed by no evidence.“Keir Starmer has talked so much about his love of national parks,and the Lake District, so we are appealing to him to stop this,” she said. “We don’t think removing this duty will do anything to boost growth; in fact, it will slow down development. There has been no public consultation on what amounts to a serious weakening of protections for national parks and landscapes. It was only in December last year that this government was celebrating them on their 75th anniversary as part of Labour’s postwar legacy.”Currently, public bodies have to “seek to further” the statutory aims of national parks, which are to conserve and enhance their natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage, early in any planning process and to mitigate any damage. The duty, contained within the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, was supported by Labour in opposition.Any weakening of protections is likely to make it easier to build roads and other major infrastructure within national parks, including Dartmoor, the New Forest and the Lake District, the organisations say.The Guardian recently revealed that the UK ranked asone of the worst countries in Europein terms of sacrificing green space to development. Thousands ofEnglish nature sitesare at risk under Labour’s planning proposals.In a letter to Starmer on Tuesday, the 170-plus groups – including the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, the Rivers Trust and the National Trust – said national parks and landscapes were enjoyed by 245 million visitors a year, generating £36bn for the economy. They appealed to Starmer to step in and ensure there is no rollback of protections, citing his declared love for the Lake District.The letter said: “[National parks] were established after the second world war as part of national renewal, driven by a Labour government who understood the value of such places for the nation and that the simple joy of beautiful landscapes was part of what makes a good life, which should be the right of every citizen whether they live in a town, city or the countryside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She is set to announce her support for changes to the bill in the hope that it will pass the Lords and receive royal assent before her budget next month. She hopes that the building of 1.5m homes and key infrastructure projects will fill £3bn of an estimated £30bn hole in the finances.But in the letter delivered on Tuesday, the nature organisations said the health of the environment underpinned the health of the economy.“Skewing this balance will have devastating consequences – and future generations will inherit the mess,” it said. “Clement Attlee’s postwar government understood this: it is why they created national parks and national landscapes … protecting landscapes alongside rapid housebuilding.”A government spokesperson told the Guardian: “These claims are untrue.

We urgently need a plan to end overfishing, one that follows the science and puts our seas on a long-term path to recovery – ensuring a new generation of coastal prosperity. But this requires leadership. Ministers must act now to redefine the future of fishing, so that those that fish in harmony with nature are prioritised over those that devastate our seabed and empty our seas.”Britain’s fish populations are in a ‘deeply troubling state’ – reportRead moreNorth Sea cod is at critically low levels, yet continues to be overfished. The same is true for Celtic sea cod, Irish sea whiting, Irish sea herring and North Sea and east English Channel horse mackerel.About a quarter of the UK's 105 fish stocks are overexploitedCallum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the University of Exeter, said: “These results highlight the gross mismanagement of the UK’s greatest natural asset – its seas. The government has the best fisheries science at its fingertips, and even when data are scarce, the course to restoration is clear. Our seas are already at risk from oil, sewage and agri-chemical pollution; habitat destruction; and the climate crisis. We need to move away from brute extraction, regardless of collateral damage and set a new course to make fishing fair, evidence-based and above all sustainable, so that it works within nature’s limits.”The evidence shows that sensible management can increase fish stocks to healthy levels, sustaining the fishing industry and allowing the wildlife to recover. The UK’s best-performing stocks, including West of Scotland haddock, western Channel sole and North Sea plaice, have remained healthy and sustainably fished since 2020, in large part thanks to catch limits set in line with scientific advice.But there are regional disparities: the Irish Sea is the worst affected, with overfished stocks rising from 27% in 2020 to 41% today, and in the Celtic Sea a third of stocks are overfished to critically low population sizes, and many more overexploited. Western Scotland is the healthiest region, with 62% of stocks assessed as healthy and only 12% overfished.Oceana UK is calling for ministers to deliver a strategy to end overfishing by the end of next year, put in a legal deadline to rebuild fish stocks, and publish an annual parliament-scrutinised audit of fish stocks.Clive Mills, a Sussex fisher, said: “We don’t have another 10 years, I promise you that now. I have seen it since I was a young lad out on the boats, I’m now 66, and I can tell you we are on the edge of a precipice. We’re taking too much, too fast. If fishermen are going to be true to themselves, we’ve got to stop. Fifty years ago, when they brought in fish quotas, we asked ‘what are those for?’ To protect the future of fishing, we were told. And we all thought, that would be good, we need a future for fishing. But we haven’t stayed that course, and now here we are. It’s got to stop.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Defra are working with the fishing industry to promote British seafood and manage stocks sustainably – and have announced a brand new £360m fisheries and coastal growth fund to drive growth in the sector.“We are committed to restoring our stocks to sustainable levels and have made significant progress over the past five years, while continuing to support the long-term viability of our domestic fishing industry.”Explore more on these topicsFishingFishOceansBrexitMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

At the Conservative party’s annual conference in Manchester, shadow ministers have lined up to announce detailed, far-reaching and often radical new policies.Yet with the party languishing at 17% in the polls, many of these announcements have struggled to gain traction. So here is a roundup of some of the most significant.1.Leaving the ECHR and establishing a British IceOne of Kemi Badenoch’s first announcements of the conference was that the Conservatives would take Britainout of the European convention on human rightsif elected to lead the next government.The announcement was part of the party’s “borders” plan – a somewhat tortured acrostic that also included banning irregular migrants from ever claiming asylum. As part of the plan, the Tories would also repeal the Human Rights Act and leave the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking. They would also end immigration trials and the right of people to claim legal aid to fight their immigration cases.The policy would also involve establishing a British version of Ice, the American immigration force that has beenraiding communities and businessesacross the US in search of illegal immigrants.2.Nearly £50bn in spending cutsMel Stride, the shadow chancellor, announced plans for £47bn in annual spending cuts by 2029. The biggest chunk of those savings – £23bn – would come from welfare, which would be cut entirely for anyone who is not a British or EU citizen or who claims a pension.The shadow chancellor also promised to cut one in four civil servant jobs in the UK, a cull that he said would save £8bn. An additional £3.9bn would come from banning foreigners from accessing social housing, and £3.5bn from closing asylum hotels.The rest would be due to come from ending the government’s commitment to net zero.3.Abolishing the Sentencing Council and sacking ‘activist judges’Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, stepped up his attacks on judges on Tuesday, promising tocurb the autonomy of the judiciaryand give more power to elected politicians.The first step would be to abolish the Sentencing Council, the independent, judge-led body responsible for giving sentencing guidelines to judges and magistrates in England and Wales. The second would be to give the Judicial Conduct Investigation Office the power to sack any judge who tweets support for what the Tories called “open borders”.Jenricktold the Telegraphhe had identified 35 judges who had previously advised or helped groups including Bail for Immigration Detainees and the Asylum Support Appeals Project, which give legal advice to asylum seekers.4.Tripling stop and searchChris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said his party would hire an extra 10,000 police officers and vastly expand the use of stop and search. Under Philp’s plan, police would be able to stop people and search them for things as minor as smelling of cannabis.In certain pre-identified crime “hotspots”, officers would be allowed to carry out stop and searches without any suspicion at all. The new powers would go even further than the “sus law” that was blamed for stirring up community unrest before the race riots in 1980 and 1981.5.Repealing the Climate Change ActBadenoch had already announced that her party would ditch its commitment for Britain to reach net zero by 2050. This weekshe saidit would repeal the Climate Change Act, which was passed under the last Labour government in 2008.Repealing the Climate Change Act would remove the need to meet five-year carbon budgets that govern how much greenhouse gas can be emitted. A Conservative government would also disband theClimate Change Committee, the watchdog that advises on how policies affect the UK’s carbon footprint.The party also says it would make electricity cheaper by ending the requirement of certain sectors to pay for the carbon they emit, and by ending the renewables obligation, which electricity users pay to fund renewables subsidies.Kemi Badenoch will announce on Wednesday that she wants to put caps on the number of courses offered by universities that lead to “consistently poor student outcomes”. The Conservatives would limit how many people can do degrees that are not likely to boost their pay enough to clear their student loan.Each year the taxpayer has to cover outstanding sums from loans that have not been fully repaid. Though the actual cost to taxpayers is disputed and depends on expectations of interest rates, the Tories say they can save £3bn a year from cutting unpaid loans, which they would put instead into apprenticeships.6.Debt trap degreesKemi Badenoch will announce on Wednesday that she wants to put caps on the number of courses offered by universities that lead to “consistently poor student outcomes”.

Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from the distributor American Public Television.The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs including The Best of Joy of Painting, based on Ross’s show, America’s Test Kitchen, Julia Child’s French Chef Classics and This Old House.As desired byDonald Trump, Congress has eliminated$1.1bnallocated to public broadcasting, leaving about330 PBS and 246 NPR stationsto find alternative funding sources. Many launched emergency fund drives. Some have been forced to lay off staff and make programming cuts.The beloved Ross died in 1995 of complications from cancer after 11 years in production with The Joy of Painting. His how-to program was shown on stations across the US and around the world. The former air force drill sergeant known for his calm demeanor and encouraging words enjoyed a resurgence in popularity during the lockdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic.Ross spoke often as he worked on air about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only “happy accidents”.The 30 paintings to be auctioned span Ross’s career and include landscapes depicting serene mountain vistas and lake scenes, his signature aesthetic. He created most of the 30 on-air, each in under 30 minutes, which was the span of a single episode.Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value ranging from $850,000 to $1.4m, Bonhams said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsPBSNPRUS CongressPublic service broadcastingTrump administrationTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A study published in May of this year found that nearly 40% of glaciers aredoomed to meltbecause of global heating. If such heating increases by 2.7C, which the world is currently on track for, as many as 75% will disappear, causing sea level rise and mass displacement.Across the American west, glaciers have shrunk significantly since they were first documented in the late 19th century, according to the article.The new research focuses on four Sierra Nevada glaciers – the Conness, Maclure, Lyell and Palisade glaciers – that are among the largest and likely oldest in the range. Their longevity amid climate warming makes them “bellwethers” for examining glacier disappearance in the west, the article states.This Patagonian village has glacier-fed rivers and majestic scenery. The only problem? SewageRead moreResearchers looked at recently exposed bedrock around the glaciers and took samples to determine how long the area was covered by ice. They found that the glaciers have covered swaths of the range for much longer than previously known – since before humans occupied North America.California’s glaciers reached their maximum positions as early as 30,000 years ago, the article’s authors wrote, and one of the glaciers researchers looked at is thought to have expanded 7,000 years ago, earlier than previously believed. The disappearance of glaciers, for the first time in human history, shows the dramatic effects of the climate crisis, one author of the study said.“We’ll be the first to see the ice-free peaks,” said Andrew Jones, the study’s lead author and a doctoral student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told theSan Francisco Chronicle. “This has ecological implications for plants and animals. And it’s a symbolic loss. Climate change is very abstract, but these glaciers are tangible. They’re iconic features of the American West.”Explore more on these topicsGlaciersCaliforniaClimate crisisMountainsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Yes. Is our airspace unsafe? No,” he said.Some facilities have seen their staffing reduced, and Duffy stressed that if the department believed there were issues in the airspace, “we will shut down, we will close it down, we will delay”.In astatement, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, which represents 20,000 air traffic controllers, said that the controllers could work “10 hours a day, 6 days a week to make sure [flights] and their precious passengers and cargo arrives safely”.“A government shutdown adds unnecessary distraction to their work, adding strain on a workforce that is already stretched thin working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, operating the most complex airspace in the world,” the statement said, noting that during the last government shutdown in 2019, many controllers had to “take second jobs to feed their families and pay their bills – leading to stress and fatigue”.In addition to shortages among air traffic controllers, the government shutdown also affects the Essential Air Service program, which helps commercial airlines maintain services to smaller airports. Duffy said there was a potential that funding under the shutdown could start to dry up.“There’s many small communities across the country that will now no longer have the resources to make sure they have air service in their communities,” he said. “Every state across the country will be impacted if the program runs out of money.”The government shutdown began last Monday after Republicans and Democrats in the Senate hit an impasse over funding.Though Republicans have a slight majority in the Senate, they need 60 out of 100 votes to pass a funding bill. Democratssaidthey would not pass a bill that does not include concessions around healthcare. Republican leaders said they will not negotiate until funding is restored.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US federal government shutdownsNew YorkLos AngelesDenvernewsShareReuse this content"

Somebody who has zero experience in television news or even hard news for that matter... but with a clearly defined political agenda,” said another staffer. “It’s hard to see this as anything more than an attempt to bend the knee completely.”Bari Weiss named editor-in-chief of CBS News as Paramount buys Free Press startupRead moreThey added: “It’s early days and we don’t know exactly how it’s going to pan out … or what she will do with her role, but she is the last person who should be brought in to CBS.”“It’s been 18 months of lurching through reported mergers, legal threat, lawsuits, settlements, firings, yet another round of new leaders,” said a third CBS News employee. “Here we go again – having to introduce and prove ourselves to new leaders with more perceptions and less actual understanding of the ebbs and flows of this organization.”Weiss did not participate in the network’s daily 9am editorial call on Monday, though CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, who will stay on and work with Weiss, said she would attend future meetings.“The room looked pretty stone-faced,” an employee who participated said. Cibrowski, an ABC News veteran who only recently took over as president, told employees that they could contact him directly with questions.Weiss, who carved out a reputation as a provocative opinion writer and burgeoning media operator, has no experience working in broadcast television. David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount and son of billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison, said her appointment was designed to help make CBS News “the most trusted name in news”.Weiss “brings a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum”, David Ellison assured CBS News employees on Monday, hailing her “restless desire to build, believe, and innovate”.“I’m in mostly in wait and see mode,” a fifth staffer told the Guardian. “Pessimistic and skeptical, but willing to see what she does.”“That being said”, they added, “the price tag is pretty indefensible” as the newsroom braces for a fresh round of cuts.The news network’s rank-and-file has been grappling with sustained uncertainty at the top for more than a year. Newsroom leaders have come and gone, and network parent company Paramount recentlyfaced criticismforpaying$16m to settle a lawsuit filed byDonald Trump, who had claimed a pre-election interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, was falsely edited. Many legal experts had widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment.The unusual structure built around Weiss’s new position has also raised eyebrows. She will report directly to Ellison, rather than Cibrowski or George Cheeks, who leads Paramount’s TV business.Bari Weiss’s ascension to top of CBS News highlights the political winds driving US media rightwardRead more“It is still unclear to me how she is going to actually work,” a former CBS News insider said. “I am not sure there is any other network that has this structure. It is unclear to me … exactly how she is going to wield this power.”A sixth current CBS News employee said they are curious to see whether Weiss makes any critical editorial appointments. “Ruling by edict from the top won’t be enough to change things,” the person said. “She’ll need lieutenants in the trenches cracking whips over our heads.”Weiss, in her own memo to CBS News staffers, said she plans to spend the next few days and weeks getting to know them. “I want to hear from you about what’s working, what isn’t, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world.”Ending on a magnanimous note, Weiss wrote: “I’m profoundly honored to join you – and I can’t wait to get started.”Explore more on these topicsCBSUS television industryTelevision industryParamount+Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

While many understood the law to automatically guarantee pay for federal workers, the White House’s OMB is arguing against that interpretation, suggesting that the law only created the conditions for back pay.Trump and otherRepublicans have not confirmed if workers would be paid when the government reopens. When asked about the White House’s stance on back payment for federal workers, Trump said “it depends who we’re talking about” during comments in the Oval Office on TuesdayTrump also added that he planned to announce additional government programs that will be permanently eliminated as the shutdown continues as well as possible layoffs, CNNreported.House speakerMike Johnsonsaid that federal workers affected by the shutdown should receive back pay, but noted that “some legal analysts [are] saying that [back payments] may not be appropriate or necessary, in terms of the law requiring that back pay be provided,” the Hillreported.Several Republicans have said that questions on back pay should put pressure on congressionalDemocratsto support a continuing resolution to reopen the government.Meanwhile,Democratshave slammed the reinterpretation of GEFTA as unlawful. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, which is home to thousands of federal workers, said any suggestion of withheld back pay is “more fear mongering from a president who wants a blank check for lawlessness”.Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee,calledthe latest reinterpretation “lawless”. “They’re plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of backpay at the end of this shutdown,” said Murray during Senate floor remarks. “This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.”An estimated 750,000 federal workers have been furloughed during the federal government shutdown, now in its seventh day, the Post reported citing congressional bookkeepers.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Trump administrationDonald TrumpUS federal government shutdownsUS politicsDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Jones claimed he was actually trying to give Cowboys fans in the stadium the thumbs up as his team rolled towards victory late in the fourth quarter.From dynasty to soap opera: how Jerry Jones traded Dallas Cowboys glory for ‘365 days of sizzle’Read more“That was unfortunate. That was kind of an exchange with our fans out in front of us,” Jones said on Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. “There was a swarm of Cowboys fans out in front – not Jets fans, Cowboys fans. The entire stadium was brimming with enthusiasm of Cowboys, and certainly late in the game.“[The gesture] was inadvertent on my part because that was right after we made our last touchdown, and we were all excited about it. There wasn’t any antagonistic issue or anything like that. I just put up the wrong show on the hand. That was inadvertently done. I’m not kidding. If you want to call it accidental, you can call it accidental. But it got straightened around pretty quick. I had a chance to look at it. It got straightened out pretty quick, but the intention was ‘thumbs up,’ and basically pointing at our fans because everybody was jumping up and down excited.”Jones should have no problems settling the fine – he has an estimated net worth of around $16bn. His fellow billionaire owners have also been fined large amounts by the NFL in recent years. The league fined Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper $300,000for tossing a drink at fansduring a January 2024 game, while then Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams was fined $250,000 in 2009 for making an obscene gesture at Bills fans after his team defeated Buffalo.Jones, who has a flair for publicity, had a busy offseason as he was criticized by large parts of the Cowboys’ fanbase when the teamtraded their best player, pass rusher Micah Parsons, to the Green Bay Packers.

They are seeking damages and legal fees. The lawsuit says the incident, which happened in the early hours of Saturday morning inIndianapolis, caused Tole “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and emotional distress. Police say the 69-year-old suffered lacerations to his cheek during the confrontation.Former NFL star Mark Sanchez could face six years in jail after being stabbed by 69-year-oldRead moreFox Sports has declined to comment on the lawsuit. Lawyers representing Sanchez in a criminal case against him have not responded to the lawsuit.Sanchez could also face jail time in the criminal case. So far Indiana police have charged him with felony battery, battery with injury, public intoxication and unlawful entry of a vehicle. The felony battery charge could result in a jail sentence of up to six years, if Sanchez is found guilty.Police say the case revolves around a dispute over a parking space. Tole says he went to pick up used cooking oil at an Indianapolis hotel shortly after midnight on Saturday. He says he was then confronted by Sanchez, who tried to enter his truck. Tole says he though Sanchez was “trying to kill me” and used pepper spray to protect himself. When the spray did not stop Sanchez advancing on him, Tole said he stabbed the former quarterback “two or three times”. Sanchez then allegedly threw Tole against a dumpster before “a look of shock” came across the former quarterback’s face and he “took off”. Detectives have reviewed video footage of the incident.“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion county prosecutor Ryan Mears said on Monday.Photos circulating on social media show Tole with a deep cut to his cheek. Sanchez was treated in hospital for stab wounds to his torso.Sanchez told police “all he could remember was grabbing for a window.” The 38-year-old was in Indianapolis to cover the Colts’ game against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. He was replaced in the Fox Sports booth by another former quarterback, Brady Quinn.“This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we’ve received over the past few days,” Sanchez’s brother, Nick, said in a statement on Monday. “Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.”The New York Jets picked Sanchez with the fifth overall selection in the 2009NFLdraft after he enjoyed a successful college career in his native California. He led the Jets to two AFC Championship games before spells with several teams, including the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys. He announced his retirement from the NFL in 2019 and soon after began working with ESPN’s college football coverage before transitioning to Fox.Explore more on these topicsNFLIndianapolisFoxUS sportsUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Gerrard won 114 caps, the first of them coming in 2000, and he appeared at six major tournaments. Yet success eluded him, with one of the major issues being the cliques from Liverpool,Manchester Unitedand Chelsea.Football Daily | Kevin Keegan, a Wembley toilet and why England fans should cherish this eraRead moreGerrard had Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher with him fromLiverpoolwhile the United set featured Ferdinand, Gary Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney. From Chelsea there was Ashley Cole, John Terry and Frank Lampard.Gerrard struggled to dovetail in midfield with Lampard, while Scholes also failed to fit in. There was a problem with the system, Gerrard said, with a central midfield two not working. But the problems ran deeper than that.“I think we were all egotistical losers,” Gerrard said. “Because I watch the telly now and I see Carragher sitting next to Scholes on this fan debate and they look like they’ve been best mates for 20 years. And I see Carragher’s relationship with Neville and they look like they’ve been mates for 20 years.“I’m probably more close and friendly with you [Ferdinand] now than I ever was when I played with you for 15 years. So why didn’t we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?“Why are we all mature enough now and at stages in our life where we’re closer and more connected? Why couldn’t we connect asEnglandteammates back then? I think it was down to the culture within England that we were all never connected. All in our rooms too much. We weren’t friendly or connected. We weren’t a team. We never at any stage became a real good strong team.”Gerrard was asked by Ferdinand whether he enjoyed being in the England squad. “I hated it,” he said. “I hated the rooms. In my early days, I’d have days where I was down, like low down. ‘I’m in this room for seven hours, what am I going to do?’ I used to love the games. I used to love playing for England. Really proud. I used to enjoy the training sessions but it was 90 minutes a day. And then I was just on my own in London or Romania or wherever.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard and Steven Gerrard during England’s defeat by Croatia at Wembley in a Euro 2008 qualifier.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“It was like I didn’t feel part of a team. I didn’t feel connected with my teammates with England. I just wanted the games and the training sessions and then to be away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But also there should have been more emphasis on the staff to go to us: ‘Listen, you need to forget that now. We need to connect from day one – more activities, more out of your rooms, more time together.’ Because I think if we’d have been more of a team, more together and liked each other more, it would have come out in the performances more.”Gerrard also discussed his career as a manager, lamenting how his time at Aston Villa ended in 2022 when he could not “pull it back because you know that the dressing room is maybe not going to help you pull it back … That was tough.” He said he had “unfinished business” as a manager, having left Saudi Arabia’s Al-Ettifaq in January, and that he would jump at the right opportunity. He is under strong consideration for a return to Rangers, where he started out in management, after the sacking of Russell Martin.“There’s a part of me that still feels that there’s a bit of unfinished business in terms of wanting to go in and face another couple of exciting challenges,” Gerrard said. “But I want a certain type of challenge. If, in an ideal world, they come available, I’ll jump at them. If they don’t, I won’t go back in.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandSteven GerrardLiverpoolManchester UnitedChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

But when it came to training and racing I took it really seriously. I did everything I could to reach my very best and always go as deep as possible. I had that determination to perform.”The 39-year-old Welshman pauses as he thinks of his old contemporaries Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins: “Cav was obviously a lot more outspoken. I didn’t tend to tell people what I was hoping to do. And Brad’s spoken recently about how he had troubles in the past while he portrayed the whole rock-star image.Israel-Premier Tech to change its name and move away from ‘current identity’Read more“I was the total opposite to both of them, just a normal bloke from Cardiff who you would go down the pub with and have a pint – who then ended up winning the Tour. That’s the bit people might find weird when they don’t really know me. They don’t see the hard work you do from November to the race in July. They just see the finished product and assume that it’s easy, especially when you’ve had a long career.”Thomas shakes his head. “But to continue at that level needed determination, discipline and commitment, and that was hard. That was one thing I wanted to get across in the book.”Thomas’snew autobiographycovers the gamut of his extraordinary career, from the incredible highs to the harrowing lows. As accessible and appealing as Thomas himself, the book is at its most compelling when it charts the ambition and suffering which means that he is very far from the “normal bloke” in a pub.“Yes, yes,” Thomas says in a soft echo when I ask if that suffering defines professional cycling. He recalls riding most of the2013 Tour de Francewith a fractured pelvis. He finished second last out of 141 riders but still played a part in helping Chris Froome win the race. That matched his final position in 2007 when he was the youngest rider on the Tour and essentially a track racer who had no experience of climbing brutal mountains. “In ’07 and ’13 I was suffering every day and that’s when you find you can go deeper and suffer a lot more than you think. You finish the day and think: ‘I’m completely spent, there’s absolutely no way I can go again.’ But you have dinner, go to sleep and get up – ‘Right, let’s do it.’ There’s no part of you that will quit. That just makes you stronger.”View image in fullscreenGeraint Thomas enjoys his victory in the 2018 Tour de France, when he became the first Welshman to win cycling’s most famous race.Photograph: Stéphane Mantey/APThomas adds: “The training is the hard bit. The racing is easy when there are fans and emotion and adrenaline. That’s the fun bit. It’s all those hard yards you’ve got to do that take such self-discipline. A lot of the time you’re on your own. There’s no one stood there, making sure you go out and do it.”Now that it’s all over, with Thomascompleting his final race last month, will he miss aspects of that suffering? “I will miss the intensity, the routine and having that goal to work towards and that pressure. That’s been my life for 20-odd years. You wake up every morning knowing what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. That’s what I will have to find again otherwise you go a bit crazy. I want to do an Ironman or something to push me mentally and physically.”Thomas’s longevity is, perhaps, the most admirable aspect of his career. “I think so,” he agrees. “I heard the other day that my 18 years from my first Tour to my last Tour was the longest by any rider during that time. It’s something I’m really proud of. All the wins are great but being able to be competitive and stay at the top for that long is special.”He picks out hisTour de France victory in 2018and his Olympic gold medalsin 2008and 2012 as “huge” highlights but he is “just as proud of coming back from all the disappointments and injuries”.Thomas probably should have won one more Grand Tour andlosing the 2023 Giro d’Italia hurts the most. He seemed on course to win the race until, on the penultimate day, he lost the lead surprisingly to Primoz Roglic. “The Giro was definitely tough and the one that got away. But I don’t have any regrets.”Last year Thomas proved his enduring quality when he made his fifth Grand Tour podium by finishing third in the Giro – behind Danny Martínez and theimperious Tadej Pogacar. “I was super-proud of that,” Thomas says. “Obviously a pretty special guy in Pog won the race. So it was almost like a race for second. Danny pipped me but to be on the podium at 38 made me just as proud as winning the Tour.”Assessing the greatest riders he competed against, Thomas discusses Peter Sagan and Froome before making it clear how Pogacar is the most brilliant of them all. “Sagan was super-talented and, while he wasn’t built like a climber, some of the climbs he got over and the races he won were incredible. Froomey as well, especially considering his [Kenyan] background. He just had that engine, that raw talent. But it’s hard to see past Pogacar. He’s definitely the best of the generation and it’s unreal what he’s doing, winning one-day races all the way through to Grand Tours, smashing everyone in the Alps. It’s insane.”View image in fullscreenA youthful Geraint Thomas (far right) alongside Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh after winning Olympic gold in the men’s team pursuit at London 2012.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThomas is convinced that Pogacar’s success is built on pure talent and hard work and he argues that the sport is cleaner than ever. “100%. It’s easy for me to say: ‘Well, if I can win the Tour clean, then anyone can’ – but for me it taints the present that we still have to speak about doping a lot. At the same time, [such scrutiny] really helped clean up the sport. I think there is a hell of a lot more testing in cycling than other sports.”There is a sobering passage in his book where Thomas remembers how, in 2006, he rode briefly as astagiairefor the Spanish team Saunier Duval. He did not extend his internship and two years later Saunier were caught up in a doping scandal and forced to leave the Tour in the middle of the race: “Had I joined Saunier Duval or Phonak/iShares [a team infamous for doping controversies], I might have seen a whole other world. How would I have reacted, as a young man surrounded by the powerful and habitual? I’m fortunate I never had to find out.”Thomas says now: “I was lucky I didn’t go into that team and was never put in that position. Sky came in and the whole British Cycling mentality was my safety net.” He spent 15 years with Team Sky, whose sponsor name changed to Ineos Grenadiers in 2019, but the legacy of Dave Brailsford’s project has been tarnished by numerous controversies which have never been fully answered. Surely there were times when Thomas went to the management to ask what the hell was happening – from theJiffy-gate scandalsurrounding Dr Richard Freeman to therevelations this yearthat David Rozman, a long-term member of the Ineos staff, had left the Tour after the International Testing Agency launched an investigation into alleged messages he exchanged in 2012 with the convicted doping doctor Mark Schmidt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m not saying they’re all dodgy, by any means, but if someone’s been in the sport 15 years, the possibility of them having some sort of link [to a drugs’ cheat] is pretty high. It’s been tough, all these things happening over the years with the team. But, as a rider, all you can do is worry about yourself and the next race.”Rozman was also part of the BritishCyclingsetup at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and so Thomas has known him for a long time. Was he surprised by the news of Rozman’s links to Schmidt? “I wasn’t surprised that he knew some doctor that ended up being a bit suspect. But just because you know someone doesn’t mean you’re guilty. I was surprised at how quickly it blew up and the bad press he was getting.”View image in fullscreenGeraint Thomas (right) on his last ride as a professional cyclist, stage six of this year’s’ Tour of Britain which ended in his home city of Cardiff.Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty ImagesSurely he understands that Ineos and Rozman were being asked legitimate and important questions? “Yes, but I think it could have been looked at without it all coming out. I think if you looked at other teams as intensely, then there will be lots of questions about them. It shows we’re held to a different standard than a lot of other teams.”Ineos have struggled competitively in recent years and it makes sense that they will offer Thomas a new role next year to help improve the team’s engagement with their riders. “It will be looking at their goals and how they’re going to execute them. So it’s a role where I’ll work alongside the coaches and the DS [directeur sportif] and be that go-between between senior management and the riders – with the goal of stepping up myself in years to come. I’ve got lots of knowledge and experience when it comes to racing but there will be a lot of learning for me from Dave as well.”Thomas stresses: “We still need to dot the i’s and cross the t’s so nothing’s definitely done or official yet. But I think I can help them out a lot going forward so that’s exciting.”So many different emotions swirled through himon his final day of racingas the Tour of Britain ended in his home town of Cardiff. “I felt a lump in my throat and was almost choking up on the bike in the last 3km. Some riders were coming up and saying: ‘Oh, G, it’s been amazing to ride with you, it’s been an honour.’ I was trying not to pay too much attention because it was getting me emotional.”He remembers that, “in the final kilometre, me and Swifty [Ben Swift] were riding next to each other. We grew up racing together when we were 12 and so to finish alongside one of my best mates was super-special.”What did he think as he crossed the finish line? “The main thing was just trying not to cry because I realised that chapter was over and it’s not a sad moment. It was joyous and happy. I was like: ‘I can’t start bawling now.’”Thomas smiles, but soon the ambition that defines him returns as he looks to the future. “It’s something that’s always been in me, wanting to push myself and do the best. Even in school, with GCSEs or A-levels, even though I was busy racing my bike, I still wanted to do well. So whatever I end up doing now, I definitely still want to be as good as I can be.”According to G by Geraint Thomas is published by QuercusExplore more on these topicsGeraint ThomasCyclingTour de FranceTeam IneosinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He was 56. Witnesses said the flight appeared normal until Baumgartner’s paraglider started spinning to the ground, crashing near a hotel swimming pool.Prosecutor Raffaele Iannella said the investigation found no technical issues with Baumgartner’s motorized paraglider.“He fell into a spiral, and he could not get out.

He wore a pressurized suit and jumped from a capsule hoisted more than 24 miles above New Mexico by a giant helium balloon.The Austrian topped out at 843.6 mph – the equivalent of 1.25 times the speed of sound – during a nine-minute descent.

When its governing bodies let go at last, handing the reins to the horses. When the last line holding against the sport’s self-immolating avarice collapsed and all were free to just do whatever they want. When crotchety pundits were finally right and the game was fully gone.Or maybe we’ll know precisely when it was: 6 October 2025, when the Uefa executive committeedeclared in an extraordinary releasethat it was opposed to domestic league matches being played abroad – while allowing two of them “on an exceptional basis.” Barcelona and Villarreal will stage an ostensibly domestic La Liga game in Miami in December. Milan and Como are to play a Serie A match in Perth, Australia – a mere 20-hour flight from Italy – in February.Uefa gives ‘reluctant’ approval for domestic games to be played abroad this seasonRead moreIn their statement, Uefa took pains not just to express its opposition to the measure, but also to lay the blame for it at the foot of Fifa, whose rules it said were “not clear and detailed enough” to merit a rejection. Uefa said it wants to work with Fifa to create new rules to curb league games played abroad – presumably in a way that will not run afoul of Relevent Sports, the sports promotion company whose antitrust suit got Fifa to drop its statutes. Releventdropped Fifafrom the suit without prejudice, meaning it can be reopened at any time if things aren’t to the promotion company’s satisfaction.“While it is regrettable to have to let these two games go ahead, this decision is exceptional and shall not be seen as setting a precedent,”Uefapresident Aleksander Čeferin said. It’s hard to see how that can be true. This is not how precedents work.The floodgates are open. The toothpaste has been squeezed from the tube. The foundation upon which professional soccer is built, structured primarily as a series of domestic circuits, is cracked. Any game can now theoretically be played anywhere, wherever the highest bidder happens to be. Once the Spanish league – or any league – is no longer a thing that can only be played on home soil, there is no going back.We have been on a long, unrelenting march to this place for decades. And the forces that carried the sport there were powered at least partially by American money and methods. We have to be frank about that.The La Liga president, Javier Tebas, spent more than seven years working to put a Barça league game in Miami in an effort to keep up with the Premier League – a cash-churning colossus created through the American model of sporting monetization. He and others have done this because all of soccersees the United States as an ATMwith no pin number, luring one competition after another. In this effort, Tebas was abetted by Relevent, an American promoter.Clubs will now be free to chase after revenue anywhere they can find it. People may try to get in their way on account of the sport’s – or the players’ or the fans’ – best interests, but they stand little chance of actually stopping anything with so much money at stake.Villarreal will play 18 home games this season, to every other La Liga team’s 19. Their fans will get one fewer match in their city,although they will be compensatedwith offers of free flights to Miami. Barça and Villarreal players – not to mention those of Milan and Como – will have travelled substantially more for their domestic competition than their rivals have this season. The impact of this in-season barnstorming on title races, relegation and promotion is inevitable.A great many people were clear-eyed about the ramifications downstream. Real Madrid – co-instigators ofthe failed European Super League, authors of the sport’sGalacticosera that kickstarted the financial arms race – sounded like the improbable voice of reason here.“The integrity of the competition requires that all matches be held under the same conditions for all teams,” the Spanish club wrotein a statement.“Unilaterally modifying this regime breaks the equality between contenders, compromises the legitimacy of the results and sets an unacceptable precedent that opens the door to exceptions based on interests other than strictly sporting. If this proposal is carried out, its consequences would be so serious that they would mean a before and after for the world of football.”The Spanish Professional Footballers’ Associationwas opposed as well.As wastheFootball Supporters Europegroup. So has Čeferin been, who before Monday’s announcement saidin an interview: “Football should be played in Europe, and fans should be able to watch it at home. They cannot travel to Australia or the United States to see their teams.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moving competitions abroad isn’t innovation, it’s betrayal”.Ah well, nevertheless. Ultimately, Uefa did not make this decision alone. The leagues made it. Fifa made it by agreeing to change its policies when it wasdismissed from the Relevent lawsuit. Soccer’s professional ranks made it a long time ago, when they started playing domestic super cup competitions far afield, in China and in the Gulf and the United States.Whoever you want to blame, European soccer has now become fully Americanized, opting for unfettered capitalism, bound by no border or tradition.

Lawrence dropped a precision pass to Brian Thomas Jr for a 33-yard gain on the go-ahead drive and then hit Dyami Brown for another big gain. Chamarri Conner was flagged for pass interference against Thomas on the next play, setting up Lawrence’s trip and score.Jets, Ravens … Eagles? Which team is most miserable after five weeks of the NFL season?Read moreJacksonville right guard Patrick Mekari stepped on Lawrence’s right foot as he took the snap, and the quarterback fell several yards in the backfield. But he got up and somehow found the end zone. It helped that several defenders, including Chris Jones, stopped on the play. The touchdown drive had been aided by Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, whose kickoff sailed out of bounds, meaning the Jags started their drive at their 40-yard line.LAWRENCE STUMBLES.LAWRENCE SCORES.@JAGUARSLEAD!KCvsJAX on ESPN/ABCStream on@NFLPlusand ESPN Apppic.twitter.com/1cLzGVmHaJ— NFL (@NFL)October 7, 2025“Panic, just sheer panic,” Lawrence said when asked to describe his touchdown. “We didn’t have any timeouts, I got stepped on [before I fell] … I was just going to throw it out of bounds to stop the clock [but] there was no one really around me so I went and made a play. A lot of guys stepped up. It takes all of us: the defense and special teams had big moments.”Lawrence completed 18 of 25 passes for 221 yards on Monday, which was also his 26th birthday.Patrick Mahomes accounted for two touchdowns, and Kareem Hunt ran for two more scores for Kansas City, who had won 23 straight games when leading by at least 14 points. The Chiefs took an early 14-0 lead, thanks in part to a fumble by Lawrence at the goalline.The Jaguars led 21-14 in the third quarter and 24-21 in the fourth before Mahomes rallied the Chiefs.Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd, the AFC defensive player of the month for September, returned an interception 99 yards for a touchdown in the third.

He stepped in front of Mahomes’ pass intended for JuJu Smith-Schuster at the goalline and took off the other way for his league-leading fifth takeaway. He juked Mahomes and Hunt, then got up to full speed along the Jaguars’ sideline. He picked up a block from Josh Hines-Allen and then held the ball tight as Tyquan Thornton tried to knock it loose at the five-yard line.The Jags felt rightly aggrieved when Lawrence was intercepted early in the fourth quarter when they led 21-14. The officiating crewmissed a clear pass interference callon the Chiefs’ Jaden Hicks.Lawrence made sure that non-call wouldn’t matter.“Just keep doing what we’re doing,” Lawrence said when asked about how his team can build on their victory. “Obviously our process is working [but] there’s still so much we can improve on.”Explore more on these topicsNFLJacksonville JaguarsKansas City ChiefsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Alba’s new deal was set to run through the end of the 2027 season.“I’m happy to renew my contract because I have the desire to continue competing, and because of how I feel at the club, with the affection I receive from fans at every match,” Alba said at the time. “We have that desire to continue competing, to continue winning, and, hopefully, win as many titles as possible.”‘Insatiable’ Spain have tools to emulate Xavi’s generation and win the World CupRead moreThe defender took a strikingly different tone when announcing the end of his professional career just 145 days later.“The time has come to close a truly meaningful chapter of my life,” Alba said in a video posted to his Instagram profile on Wednesday. “I do so with complete conviction, with peace, and with happiness. I feel I’ve walked this path with every ounce of passion I had. And now it’s the right moment to open a new chapter and close the previous one with the best possible feeling.”Standing 5ft 7in, Alba’s effectiveness as an attacking left-back was mostly down to his pace, technical ability on the ball, and seemingly telepathic connection with Messi. Those factors combined to give Alba a better scoring record than most who play his position: 51 goals and 135 assists in 700 professional club games at time of writing.In an interview with the Guardian’s Sid Lowe in 2023, Alba said his departure from Barcelona was his choice, and that he was doing so to help a team which was experiencing financial difficulty.“The club know the ‘efforts’ I’ve made at certain moments or what I am doing by going now,” Alba said. “They gave me the chance to stay another year. It would have been very easy to. It’s my home. But I thought the right thing to do, the just thing, the honest thing, was to step to one side. No one forced me.”Alba’s announcement follows that of Busquets, who in September said that he will also retire at the end of this Miami season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He won MLS championships with three teams: Portland in 2015, Atlanta United in 2018 and Columbus in 2020 and 2023. The three-time MLS All-Star’s trophy haul also includes the 2019 US Open Cup, two Campeones Cups (2019, 2021) and the 2024 Leagues Cup. Competing for the US internationally, he won the Concacaf Gold Cup in 2017.“Thank you, Portland, for giving me the first opportunity to play this game professionally, and I’ll never forget lifting the MLS Cup together,” Nagbe posted. “Thank you, Atlanta, for a short but incredible two years, filled with trophies, an MLS Cup and an opportunity to be part of an amazing atmosphere. Columbus: Thank you for welcoming an Ohio kid home and the opportunity to represent you for the past six seasons!

Because goodness knows, if the move to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia seemed like a bad idea, the reality was even worse.Henderson’s reputation was trashed after he was accused of putting financial gain before hissupport of LGBTQ+ rights. He was booedon England dutyby the Wembley crowd. Even afterjumping back to Ajaxin January 2024, it felt as if the collateral damage continued. Henderson, who is now at Brentford, was overlooked by Gareth Southgate for his Euro 2024 squad, having been involved throughout qualification. It was the beginning of a long international exile.England eye up Uruguay and Japan tests as part of World Cup preparationsRead more“I am not going to lie … over the past couple of years I have had some tough moments,” Henderson says. But according to him, it was not so much what he lived, rather what he left behind that was the struggle.“It felt like a break-up,” Henderson says of the end of his 12‑year association with Liverpool, a period when he captained them to every top honour and embedded himself in the fabric of the club and city. The way he tells it, there was simply an emptiness.“I couldn’t watch a lot of Premier League games and I certainly couldn’t watch Liverpool. I probably picked the right place for that because I was halfway around the world! Because I was at Liverpool for so long and had such an attachment, I found it really difficult when I left.“If you asked a lot of players when they left a club where they had been for so long – not just Liverpool – I think they’d say it was hard. With time, things change. You move on. But I would say that was probably the most difficult time.”Henderson is asked whether, with the benefit of a bit of distance, he regrets going to Saudi. It is the trigger for a long answer, within which he says it was not the reason why he missed out on playing at the European Championship. He does not mention it but the injury he sustained with Ajax in March 2024, which ruled him out for almost two months, was a factor. Yet he does get around to embracing the question. And he does not run from it.View image in fullscreen‘I found it really difficult when I left.’ Jordan Henderson could not watch Liverpool play after captaining them to every top honour, including the Champions League in 2019.Photograph: Jan Kruger/Uefa/Getty Images“In hindsight, maybe I would have made different decisions. You can look back and think: ‘Maybe I could have done this differently or maybe have done that.’ But there were reasons for it and I did not do it off a whim. In the end, it has made me stronger.”This is the bit that Henderson wants to push; his capacity to overcome, to use negativity as fuel. It has been a driving force throughout his career and it has underpinned his latest chapter, theEnglandcomeback story under Thomas Tuchel that nobody saw coming.Henderson had been ignored by the interim manager Lee Carsley for the three camps last autumn, and even Tuchel, who started work in January, admitted he was not in his initial thoughts. That was until the German came to hear players and staff talking constantly about Henderson, his influence on and off the pitch. When Tuchel got in touch in February, he realised pretty quickly that he had to involve him. Henderson has played in four of Tuchel’s six matches and hopes to feature in the Wembley friendly against Wales on Thursday and the World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga next Tuesday.The 35-year-old has been derided in some quarters as a glorified cheerleader – presumably by people who attach no value to leadership within a squad; the ability to maintain standards, to handle the pressure. But he is perfectly entitled to point out that Tuchel would not call on him unless he could bring something to the party on the field.There is a school of thought that says Southgate could have done with Henderson at Euro 2024 as a young team were buffeted by criticism; a steady hand on the tiller, maybe just as a substitute. Experience may not be glamorous but it ought not to be a dirty word. So many tournament-winning nations have relied on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has quickly become one of their main distributors in possession, be it from deeper areas or when probing further forward. One statistic from Opta stands out. Henderson has made seven defensive line-breaking passes in the league. Brentford’s next best player in the category has two.Then there is the Jude Bellingham factor. In other words, Henderson’s friendship with the Real Madrid star, whom Tuchel hascontroversially overlooked for this campbut will surely recall in November. Henderson hit it off with Bellingham after the latter was called into the England squad for the first time five years ago and it is reasonable to wonder whether he sees something of his younger self in him – the passion, the work ethic, the maturity, the obsession with winning.View image in fullscreenJordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham are close friends, a factor which Thomas Tuchel appreciates.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PATuchel likes the fact that Bellingham listens to Henderson, which again has been taken negatively; more evidence that Henderson is there for the vibes and not the football. But how can this be anything other than a string to his bow? “I have shown what I can do for England over the years and I am still playing at a high level,” Henderson says.“Outside, people can think what they want – media or whoever. The most important people are the manager, the coaching staff and the players. Ask them what they think; if I am a cheerleader when I am here. I don’t think one of the best managers in Europe would be choosing me just to do that.“I am here to perform – whether that is in training every day, whether that is when I am on the pitch. My main job is to be performing for the team and helping the team.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandBrentfordWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersFriendliesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The important thing is we manage it really well. Last season shows that when it starts clicking we know how good we are.”The grim reality is that Meadow Park is no longer fit to host Arsenal matches. Despite investment to have the venue meet Uefa’s minimum standards, the facilities are nowhere near good enough for Champions League football. That does not stop it being a powerful cauldron, though, with the Gunners’ hardcore fans rocking the North Bank and leading the thunder of noise through the open ground as they kickstarted their title defence.“We’ve got to act like we’re the champions and people are coming after us to win it off us,” Steph Catley said beforehand.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo scored her third goal of the season to get Arsenal’s title defence under way.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesIf that was the energy in training and in the dressing room it spilled on to the pitch in style. Arsenal were up for this game. Very up for it. Beth Mead and Chloe Kelly slotted either side of their England teammate Russo, in two of five changes from the weekend, and it was Mead who drove the ball into the box for the opening goal, dancing through the middle before clipping the ball to Russo, who fired past Christiane Endler.Arsenal were soon punished, though: the goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar fluffed her pass to Catley, landing it straight at the feet of Dumornay, the midfielder forcing a save before rolling the rebound into the empty net. It was calamitous and five minutes later the visitors had the lead against the team who beat them 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-finals last season.The Lyonnes press mercilessly hustled away possession in the Arsenal third and the ball fell to Dumornay, who fired in from the edge of the box, with Van Domselaar, somewhat inexplicably, rooted to the spot.“The motivation is always there, I always like to adjust the mental preparation,” the manager, Jonatan Giráldez, said when asked about the impact of the semi-final meeting last season. “We can’t forget what happened last season, but we need to use it in the right way.”Slegers said: “Errors happen from time to time but if they happen too often of course there’s something there. It looks silly from the outside but it’s not that all of a sudden they can’t pass that ball, it can be something intangible that you can’t put your finger on sometimes.

The absence of Leah Williamson’s leadership qualities – in addition to her composure and vision on the ball – is being felt more and more as each game comes and goes.The frenetic energy of the first half was carried into the second. There was no heroic comeback, but the battle raged until the end as Arsenal fought to get something from the game and Giráldez’s side sought to kill off those hopes.Defeat is not a total disaster for Arsenal, who endured a bruising 5-2 loss against Bayern Munich in their opening group‑stage game last season before going on to win Europe’s premier competition for the first time in 18 years.That defeat contributed to Jonas Eidevall’s exit and Slegers’s temporary promotion that was made permanent three months later. The task, though, is to figure out the causes of an alarming slide, with their winless run extended to four games and the team needing to do something about it quickly.“What we know about this team is they’ve gone through hard times before and they’ve always come back,” Slegers said.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champion's LeagueArsenal WomenOL LyonnesWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There is believed to be an appetite from the club’s American owner, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment (KSE), to increase that to 70,000, which would significantly boost match-day revenues, and there are more than 100,000 supporters on the waiting list for season tickets.Uefa allowing domestic games abroad is a sad turning point, ending soccer as we’ve known it | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreArsenal set up a working group last year to examine the feasibility of any redevelopment, with sources indicating that discussions are continuing and that no decision has yet been made. A number of options are understood to have been looked at, including changing the gradient of the stands to allow the addition of thousands more seats, or a much smaller upgrade that would mean less disruption.It remains to be seen whether a larger-scale redevelopment would mean Arsenal having to play matches elsewhere – something the club avoided when they left Highbury – after a report in the Telegraph on Tuesday claimed a temporary move to Wembley could be on the cards. Arsenal played their home Champions League fixtures at the national stadium between 1998 and 2000.It is understood that Arsenal did not apply to host matches at Euro 2028, with a potential redevelopment of the Emirates Stadium in mind, while the co-chair Josh Kroenke said in July that an upgrade was being discussed.“It would be premature to talk about any plans in depth, but the internal conversations are starting to occur about it,” he said. “It is not an easy renovation, but we see the possibilities of what’s there.”Arsenal spent more than £250min the summer transfer window and KSE is said to be ready to commit more funds to upgrade the Emirates Stadium, having made significant changes behind the scenes in recent weeks. After the surprise departure of the vice-chair Tim Lewis, Stan and Josh Kroenke will remain as co‑chairs, with the managing director, Richard Garlick, promoted to chief executive and the KSE representatives Kelly Blaha, Otto Maly and the film producer and director Ben Winston – son of Prof Robert Winston – joining the club’s board as nonexecutive directors.Maly is a commercial real estate and development expert who was involved in KSE’s construction of the 100,000-seat SoFi Stadium – home of the Los Angeles Rams American football team – and could play a role in any expansion of the Emirates Stadium.David Raya, meanwhile, has become the latest first-team regular to agree an improved contract, with the Spain goalkeeper understood to have been given a pay rise on the £100,000-a-week deal he signed when he joined from Brentford last summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But will anyone listen?Jacob SteinbergResponse to strained schedule has been more football than ever, and a danger that the best will have nothing left to give at the World CupTue 7 Oct 2025 07.11 EDTShareCole Palmer and Ousmane Dembélé looked great when they were photographed sitting on Top of the Rock on the eve of theClub World Cupfinal but it is not being wise after the event to suggest that both might have been better off spending their summer lying on sunbeds.Top players struggling with fitness issues was foreseeable before the first edition of Fifa’s expanded tournament took place. “The worst idea ever,” was Jürgen Klopp’s take, citing concerns over the long-term impact of squeezing even more football into an ever expanding calendar. “Last year it was the Copa [América] and the European Championship, this year it’s the Club World Cup, next year it’s the World Cup. That means no recovery for the players involved.”Uefa allowing domestic games abroad is a sad turning point, ending soccer as we’ve known it | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreIt was not the wildest of predictions. The schedule was already under strain because of fixture congestion caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 World Cup taking place in winter and the Champions League increasing in size. Fifpro, the global players’ union, has repeatedly warned about rising injuries and player burnout. The response, though, has been more football than ever. The authorities do not take players and managers seriously. The danger is that the best have nothing left in the tank when the World Cup – expanded to 48 teams for the first time, remember – takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US next year.Palmer is the obvious example. The 23-year-old was the inspiration for Chelsea at the Club World Cup,destroying Dembélé’s Paris Saint-Germainin the final, but he has barely been seen this season. The suspicion is that Palmer has played too much. He has been troubled by a groin injury for a year and although there is yet to be any indication that the forward requires surgery it is hard not to feel that he is, as Arsène Wenger used to say of Jack Wilshere, in the red zone.That should be cause for alarm. A Chelsea or England game without Palmer is a diminished experience. He is an outrageous talent but everyone has physical limits. It is absurd that Palmer has gone three consecutive summers without a proper rest. He helped England Under-21s to win the European championship in 2023, was prominent when the senior sidereached the Euro 2024 finaland was still turning out for Chelsea until the middle of July last season.When is it too much? Palmer played 57 games for club and country in the 2023-24 season, his first full year as an established international and Premier League player. He skipped the league phase of the Conference League last season but was involved in the knockouts and was man of the match whenChelsea beat Real Betisin the final at the end of May. The PSG game was Palmer’s 55th of the season. He had also represented England in their World Cup qualifier against Andorra at the start of June.So don’t be surprised that Palmer has missed a host of games this season. His is a longstanding problem but it surely could have been dealt with if he had been allowed a holiday last summer. This is not a controversial point. There was no special treatment for Chelsea, who had a compressed, two-week pre-season. The PSG game was on 13 July and Palmer started when a weary, undercooked Chelsea opened the campaign bydrawing 0-0 with Crystal Palaceon 17 August.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s Trent Alexander-Arnold is out with a torn hamstring after playing in the Club World Cup following a draining season for Liverpool.Photograph: Sergio Pérez/EPAEnzo Maresca was at a loss to predict how the extra workload and lack of preparation time would affect his players. By now, though, it is clear thatChelseaare struggling. Levi Colwill tore an anterior cruciate ligament on the first day of pre-season. Liam Delap ripped a hamstring against Fulham, Dário Essugo has had surgery on a thigh injury. Tosin Adarabioyo and Andrey Santos are injured. Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández and João Pedro are playing through the pain barrier.Fifpro’s annualplayer workload monitoring reportconcluded that players who competed in the Club World Cup after completing a domestic league campaign were among hundreds at the top of the men’s game who did not have adequate pre-seasons, hurting performance levels and increasing the risk of injury. Last week Maresca said in relation to the volume of injuries at Chelsea and PSG: “Probably it’s some consequences from the Club World Cup.”Will anyone listen? Arsenal’s Noni Madueke, who left Chelsea after the Club World Cup semi-final, is out for two months with a knee injury. PSG were without Marquinhos, Kvara Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué and Dembélé when they beat Barcelona last week. João Neves and Fabián Ruiz have also had injury issues. PSG were back in action in the Uefa Super Cup on 13 August. The show goes on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alexander-Arnold came off a draining title-winning season with Liverpool, signed for Madrid, featured in their run to the last four of the Club World Cup and is out with a torn hamstring. Thomas Tuchel was saying in May that Bellingham should have had surgery on a shoulder injury. The procedure was put off, though, with the demands of the schedule leading another young player to grit his teeth and keep going.Why deny it? Some people have noticed that players not involved in the Club World Cup have also had injuries. This is not an adequate defence for the Club World Cup. Players will get injured. Injuries and fatigue have been on the rise. It still feels inadequate when authorities are shoving in more games, in essence jeopardising the product they wish to sell. The football, remember, is not better if the best players are missing or exhausted.And yes, Igor Jesus played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup and has since looked promising for Nottingham Forest. Yet Botafogo had not played a full season before entering the tournament and went out in the last 16. They were done at the end of June. There is an obvious difference with Chelsea. Igor Jesus was not playing in as intense a league. The striker had not just come off a deep run in the Champions League. Chelsea are even at a disadvantage to PSG, who are by far the richest club in France and are not placed under as much pressure in domestic games.There is a reason why Tuchel tipped Arsenal and Liverpool to have an advantage over Chelsea and Manchester City this season. City have not appeared to be suffering, perhaps because they went out of the Club World Cup in the last 16, but Chelsea look mentally and physically drained. They are a warning to others. The question is whether Fifa cares.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Over the past eight years, I had lost nearly 10kg. I had gone from being a referee who was heavy and untrained to being light and well trained. It had taken time, filled with patience, tough decisions and priorities. But it was also the beginning of a change that gradually meant stress, pressure and discomfort around the tests that Uefa’s top management had introduced.You didn’t just need to be a good referee, it was also about prioritising diet, looking like a top-level referee, that the weight and fat percentages were right, otherwise you risked being reprimanded, getting fewer matches and ending up in the cold.When Uefa replaced its refereeing organisation during the summer of 2010, Pierluigi Collina introduced a number of changes. During the first year, there was an extreme focus on physique, measurements of weight and body fat, and mandatory vision tests. Vision tests might sound like a given, but it hadn’t been before. At the courses they not only examined basic things like being able to read small text at a certain distance, but also more specific tests adapted for professional football referees.Some referees were found to be colour blind. Another turned out to be blind in one eye and was forced to quit. At least that’s what the rumours said, but no one knew for sure – because regarding the results of the vision test, nothing was revealed in larger groups. For me, the vision test was a reassurance. It signalled professionalism, thoroughness and a desire to get better.View image in fullscreenJonas Eriksson books Manchester United’s Patrice Evra in the Champions League in 2014.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Uefa/Getty ImagesWhen it came to tests of weight and fat percentage, however, I mostly felt disgust, anger and humiliation. It wasn’t the tests that were the problem, but the way they were conducted.The first time I was forced to endure the humiliating procedure was in the autumn of 2010 at our annual course with Uefa. We were in Ljubljana, Slovenia. On the first morning, the referees were divided into three groups of about 15. When my group had entered the large, cold conference room where we were to gather, the management urged us to undress to our underwear. We looked at each other, but no one reacted or dared to say anything.We slowly took off our clothes. The evening before, we had received clear instructions not to eat or drink in the morning but to be as empty as we could when we were to undergo the test. It was about weighing as little as possible, and having as low a fat percentage as possible. And to look like a referee should according to Uefa’s model.There we stood in a long row, in just our underwear. We were Europe’s best referees, elite athletes, role models, adults, parents, strong personalities with great integrity … but no one said anything. We barely looked at each other, our gazes flickered a bit nervously while we were called forward two by two. There Collina observed us from top to bottom with an ice-cold gaze. Silent and observant. We stepped on to the scale one by one. I sucked in my stomach, straightened my back and held my breath as if it would make any difference. One of the instructors loudly announced: “Eriksson, Sweden, 96.2 kilos.” I felt how Collina paused, looked at me and scanned my nearly naked body. I thought to myself that this is not worthy. I’m an adult and forced to stand here and be examined and judged.View image in fullscreenPierluigi Collina during a Fifa 2022 World Cup briefing.Photograph: John Sibley/ReutersI stepped off the scale and it felt like I was standing in a fog. The same instructor came forward with a kind of pliers, a polygraph-like tool that he began to pinch me with on different parts of the body. The caliper, as the instrument was called, was cold and I flinched a little every time it touched my body.The instructor squeezed, pulled, pressed, measured, measured again, mumbled something inaudible, pressed again and pinched my skin and body fat. After each measurement area, he called out the number of millimetres he could measure.I had no idea what the numbers stood for, if it was good or bad. It took maybe just over a minute. An assistant entered the numbers into a document, and when all four values had been established, the document quickly calculated my total fat percentage. My value was announced, for all to hear: “Eriksson, 18.7%.”View image in fullscreenEriksson says he was measured with a caliper during a Uefa course in 2010.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA/ShutterstockWhy didn’t I, or anyone else, say anything? Why didn’t we stand up and say what everyone thought: that it was degrading. If I had raised my voice I would have simultaneously signed my career’s death sentence. If I had questioned or challenged the methods that Collina had introduced then I wouldn’t have got any matches, I’m convinced of that.Of course, I also wanted to become fitter, weigh less and reach my goal, to become a world-class referee. It was obvious you shouldn’t be overweight, equally obvious you should be fit – and sure, maybe the entire referee corps needed a professionalisation. But it was wrong to try to get there through a humiliating weigh-in and an agenda where the most important thing was to lose weight and minimise your fat percentage.Our two annual courses with Uefa thereafter followed the same pattern. Weigh-in, measurement of fat percentage, running tests, rule tests, reviews of interpretations, group work and then at the end everything would be summarised. On a document, we all got facts about our physical profile – arrows pointing if we were going in the right direction (down) or wrong direction (up).Fat percentages were categorised into five groups. An approved result was if you belonged to excellent or very good. After that, there was a red line that told that the groups below were not acceptable. In Slovenia it was communicated that over 70% of all referees had clearly failed and had to improve. In the autumn of 2010 I was in the poor category.At Uefa’s referee course the following year, Collina took the floor to talk about diet, the importance of preparation and bad examples of referees who did not prepare professionally. Collina fixed his gaze on us, and everyone looked down. Like scared schoolboys in front of an angry and strict principal who had just caught the students doing something stupid.View image in fullscreenEriksson shows Arsenal’s Nacho Monreal a yellow card in the Europa League in 2018.Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/ShutterstockAfter that day, my colleagues and I secretly laughed at Collina’s story about the oyster- and carbonara-eating referee. How crazy it was that our highest chief had people who checked what we put in our mouths.At the same time as it became a standing joke about what one could eat, there was a slightly uneasy feeling of being monitored. And wherever we went in Europe, we thought about what we should order. It definitely wasn’t oysters and definitely no pasta carbonara. Sweets disappeared from the courses. No desserts were served – just fruit. And if at any time, often by mistake, there was any cake or sweet left, hardly any referee dared to approach it.Alcohol during courses and tournaments was phased out. Between certain colleagues, a weight hysteria was created. There were competitions about who had the lowest fat percentage and who had lost most weight since the last measurement. Of course, it was neither beneficial nor healthy. In connection with our courses, positive examples were highlighted of referees who had lost weight and reduced their fat percentage – instead of being praised for their decisions on the pitch or performances in difficult matches.Jonas Eriksson was a Fifa referee from 2002 to 2018 and officiated at the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Europa League final between Liverpool and Sevilla.

The decision, announced in June without revealing any selection criteria, left their opponents understandably upset. Indonesia, Iraq, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) expressed interest in hosting themselves or requested neutral venues and also called for transparency and fairness in the decision-making process but to no avail.In addition both home teams have six days between their games while opponents have to play within 72 hours of their first game.Oman, outsiders in Group A, have never made it to the World Cup and in July hired Carlos Queiroz, a man who definitely has. The 72-year-old has qualified with South Africa, Portugal and Iran twice but doing so with Oman would be his biggest achievement yet. “It would be a miracle in this complicated situation,” Queiroz tells the Guardian and goes on to question the decision to giveQatarhome advantage in the group. “Are there no stadiums in Japan or Kuwait where we could play? Maybe the people who organised this have a different vision of football.”There had been rumours thatSaudi Arabiaand Qatar were going to be chosen even before the AFC made the announcement in June. Talk to officials around Asia and there is general disbelief that the Saudis were not told to play in Qatar and vice versa. The Guardian has approached AFC for comment but they have not responded.“I knew the situation when I took the job,” says a phlegmatic Queiroz. “What can we say? We have to play at the home of one of the teams that is competing. They put the Saudis in Saudi and Qatar in Qatar. If they can’t see that something is wrong with this, then who are the players and coaches to make comments?”View image in fullscreenCarlos Queiroz’s Oman are outsiders to claim one of the two qualifying spots for the 2026 World Cup.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersThe schedule is another point of contention. Oman have to play Qatar on Wednesday and UAE on Saturday whereas the hosts have almost a week to prepare for their second game. The situation, remarkably, is mirrored in Saudi Arabia where the hosts have six days between their two games.“We play Qatar and we play again three days later, Qatar play six days after, and they already know the result and what they need to do,” says Queiroz. “This has never happened before. The people that made the regulations didn’t think about this and did not pay attention.“When there is a World Cup, there is always a host and that we can understand: they pay for it, build the stadiums and all the rest. But to do this in the middle of the competition, it is strange that the people in charge don’t feel uncomfortable with this.”Oman, meanwhile, have another disadvantage with five players based overseas. “We have players in Bangkok who play Sunday but the Fifa days only start Monday so they travel then, arrive on Tuesday and play Wednesday,” Queiroz says. “I have been asking the chefs here how to make an omelette without eggs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indonesia have written to Fifa and the AFC after learning that their game against Saudi Arabia will be officiated by a Kuwaiti. “We want a referee who is truly neutral, possibly from Europe or elsewhere, someone who has no stake in the region,” the national team official Kombes Sumardji told reporters. In addition Indonesia were due to play Kuwait in a friendly on 5 September but that was – say Indonesian officials – cancelled without a reason.Queiroz will come up against another former Real Madrid manager in Julen Lopetegui, who took charge of Qatar in May. The coaches are an eclectic mix with Hervé Renard back in charge of Saudi Arabia, Patrick Kluivert leading Indonesia and Graham Arnold, who started the previous round of qualification in charge of Australia, now with Iraq.Six teams have already qualified from Asia – Japan, Iran, South Korea and Australia as well as the two debutants, Uzbekistan and Jordan.

What a delight it was to learn that Big Website columnist Adrian Chileshas a West Brom-themed urinalin his house. Spare a thought for the Barnsley fan who took the rest room a little too literally, and was rescued from a deserted Oakwell afterfalling asleep on the looat half-time during a 2015 defeat by Fleetwood. “He had no shoes on and had lost his mobile phone and his hat,” elaborated a Barnsley fire station spokesperson. And who can forget when, at the height of his fame at Manchester City, Mario Balotellipopped into a local college to use the facilitiesin 2012. “Balotelli parked his Bentley outside, then came in and was asking where the toilets were, then he went to the teachers’ staff room,” a student told the Manchester Evening News. “After that he was just walking round the campus like he owned the place.”Tuesday marks 25 years to the day that Kevin Keegan resigned as England manager after a brief chat in a toilet cubicle with FA director David Davies in the bowels of Wembley, following that infamous 1-0 defeat by Germany in 2000 – England’s final match at the famous old stadium. As Daviesremembers in his diary, FA Confidential, he had entered the sodden, beleaguered England dressing room immediately after the match, only to find David Beckham in tears and Tony Adams “fired up”, both of them pleading for the suit to bring Keegan to his senses. FollowingDietmar Hamann’s free-kick, Keegan had trudged down the tunnel with a thousand-yard stare, and Davies found him slumped – just as he was at Anfield in 1996 – in the corner of the dressing room, muttering: “I’m off. I’m not for this.” Collaring Keegan, Davies tried desperately to salvage the situation.“Where on earth could we find [for a chat] that was private?” recalled Davies. “The tunnel? Crawling with television reporters. The dressing room? Heaving with emotional players. The bath area? I couldn’t hold a vital conversation with an England manager as players dived into the water. Only one option presented itself. The toilet cubicles. A dramatic moment in England’s long football history occurred in the ancient loos of a stadium facing demolition. The impending destruction could almost be smelled in the air. Dragging Kevin into a cubicle, I shut the door behind us. We stood there, facing each other. ‘You can’t change my mind,’ Kevin said. ‘I’m out of here. I’m not up to it. I’m going out to the press to tell them I’m not up to it. I can’t motivate the players. I can’t get the extra bit out of these players that I need.’”And so,Keegan resigned, later admitting that he had found his stint as England manager “soulless”. The two-time Ballon d’Or winner added: “I found it hard to fill in the time. I found myself going and training the blind team, the deaf team, working with the ladies team. It’s a very difficult job.” English football has come a long way in the quarter of a century since. For better or worse, those Wembley toilets and those two towers are long gone, while a German now sits in the dugout where Keegan once perched.

We were Europe’s best referees, elite athletes, role models, adults, parents, strong personalities with great integrity … but no one said anything. We barely looked at each other, our gazes flickered a bit nervously while we were called forward two by two. There Collina observed us from top to bottom with an ice-cold gaze.

He has made no secret of his ambition to buy in at the top table of global Flat racing, and challenge the old money of John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud operation and the sovereign wealth of Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin, so he was never likely to stop at a single purchase this time around.But there was less of the sense of a trolley dash about Joorabchian’s activity, on the opening day at least, and a willingness too to back out of a bidding duel when his ceiling price had been reached.Daryz dazzles in Arc de Triomphe to catch hot favourite Minnie Hauk in dying stridesRead moreHaving beaten off Coolmore to secure Lot 15, a Frankel full-brother to a filly bought by Amo at this sale last year for 4.4m gns (£4.62m) that has yet to race, Joorabchian shook his head at 3.7m gns (£3.9m) for Lot 90, a colt by the Derby and Arc winner Sea The Stars, when it became clear that Godolphin was determined to have him.“The horse we wanted today was the Frankel,” Joorabchian said. “For us as an operation, that was important. We bought the sister, we wanted to strengthen the family.“The Sea The Stars was a beautiful horse, a very good walker, strong and tall, but he wasn’t a must-have for our operation at this stage, so we just decided to step away.“You’ve got to be disciplined, and at some point you’ve got to step away. We were up against Coolmore in the first one and Godolphin in the second, so it’s not an easy fight. You’re up against the two biggest in the world.”Another Frankel colt, for a relatively modest 440,000 gns (£462,000), was the only other significant Amo buy on day one, as Joorabchian continues to search for a horse to compete with uber-stallions in the biggest bloodstock operations.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsShowGreg Wood's Wednesday tipsNottingham1.28 Hello It’s Me 1.58 Loving Look 2.28 Edaari 2.58 Sea The Power 3.28 Good Heavens 3.58 Urban Sprawl 4.30 Hinchinbrooke 5.00 Shark Two OneLudlow2.05 Percy Shelley 2.35 Sergeant Fury 3.05 Kate O’Riley 3.35 Another Day Out 4.08 Versace Twentyone 4.40 Chestnut Pete 5.15 NoonetellsmenothinSedgefield2.15 Jolie Coeur Allen 2.45 Pescatorius 3.15 Dickens 3.45 Obsessedwithyou 4.15 Captain Cool 4.50 Opale De MaineKempton4.03 Rapid Force 4.35 Seventy 5.07 Siren Suit 5.40 Title Roll 6.10 Art Lover (nap) 6.40 Kosometsuke (nb) 7.10 Bear Island 7.40 Best Rate 8.10 EqualisedWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When you’re talking about trying to create stallions and buying good pedigree broodmares for the future, they are 30 or 40 years ahead of us,” he said of Coolmore and Godolphin.“So we’re playing catchup after they built their stock for many, many years, and you can see what they breed.

O’Connor’s first spell last month was curtailed when he wasswiftly recalled to the Wallabies squadto face New Zealand, but he is now back raring to go before his new club’s derby against Northampton on Saturday.Having arrived in the UK only on Monday, the 35-year-old played a limited part in his first training session but seems poised to feature in the matchday 23 against the Saints. Leicester’s new director of rugby, Geoff Parling, will not confirm his team until Friday but hinted that O’Connor was in line for some action despite his latest long-haul flight. “He’s an experienced operator who gets up to speed quickly, put it that way,” Parling said. “When you’re in business class you can just put your feet up anyway. I don’t think it was too bad for him.”England among eight countries to ban players who sign up to rugby’s rebel R360 leagueRead moreLeicester are clearly hoping O’Connor will help to ignite their attacking game and the player is looking forward to the challenge of replicating the form that led to his Wallaby recall. He said: “I’ve already had good chats about where I can get into the game, especially on starter plays, in phase play and even in counterattack as well where I’ll hopefully get my opportunities to add a little bit of stardust. Hopefully it’s more diamonds than rocks.”O’Connor has had two previous stints in the Premiership, with London Irish and Sale, but clearly feels better prepared this time, having rebuilt his stalled career in Manchester. “At Sale that’s where I started my rebuild and really learning the intricacies of rugby. That’s where my love for it came back. It was a tough period for me with injuries and life away from rugby but I rebuilt my rugby and my life.“Part of the reason for coming back was I wanted to be the best version of myself. When I was 23 at London Irish I was bright eyed. I didn’t really know too much about the game. It was more about beating defenders one on one. I wasn’t a 10 back then but I feel I am now. I feel quite settled in that position. I’m just looking forward to getting the opportunity to pull the strings and hopefully guide the group around the field.”Parling, who has coached O’Connor in Australia in the past, believes it will be a mutually beneficial marriage. “He only arrived yesterday morning,” Parling said. “He didn’t do all of training but he got through a decent chunk. When you’re experienced like he is you’re used to it. You know he’s someone who, off a short run-in, you can get up to speed and someone who will offer ideas around the attacking and strategic side of the game. My experience of him is that he’s really good to work with.”The former England lock, meanwhile, believes more research is needed to investigate any potential connection between elite sport and motor neurone disease after his former teammate Lewis Moody’s diagnosis with MND. “I’d say it’s important for all sports, governments and everybody to research as best they can. Am I qualified to say anything deeper than that? Probably not. But if something’s showing there’s a chance of getting anything like this from intense sport over a period of time then everyone has a responsibility to investigate.”Parling, along with many others, has been in touch with Moody since learning the news. “All you can do at times like this is offer your support and I’m sure the wider community will also get behind him because of the type of person he is. As a player he was like a hungry dog chasing the ball … he never went away. He was a player who maximised everything he had.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England, Ireland, Scotland, France and Italy, along with New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, made clear on Tuesday that players who join the proposed new competition will be ineligible for international selection and have confirmed they will not support the venture.R360’s backers, fronted by the former England international Mike Tindall, had been hoping to launch their multicity franchise tournament next year but have now been told to back off in no uncertain terms. “As a group of national rugby unions, we are urging extreme caution for players and support staff considering joining the proposed R360 competition,” read a statement issued by the world’s leading unions.Returning James O’Connor keen to add ‘stardust’ to Leicester’s attackRead more“We all welcome new investment and innovation in rugby and support ideas that can help the game evolve and reach new audiences but any new competition must strengthen the sport as a whole, not fragment or weaken it.“Among our roles as national unions, we must take a wider view on new propositions and assess their impact on a range of areas, including whether they add to rugby’s global ecosystem, for which we are all responsible, or whether they are a net negative to the game.”A counter-thrust has been likely since R360 confirmed its intention to press ahead with its launch towards the end of next year, amid particular concerns in England that their Women’s World Cup-winning Red Roses squad were being targeted. The lack of detail surrounding R360’s plans has also served to unite the traditional unions.The statement read: “R360 has given us no indication as to how it plans to manage player welfare; how players would fulfil their aspirations of representing their countries, and how the competition would coexist with the international and domestic calendars so painstakingly negotiated in recent years for both our men’s and women’s games.“The R360 model, as outlined publicly, rather appears designed to generate profits and return them to… a very small elite, potentially hollowing out the investment that national unions and existing leagues make in community rugby, player development and participation pathways.“International rugby and our major competitions remain the financial and cultural engine that sustains every level of the game. Undermining that ecosystem could be enormously harmful to the health of our sport. These are all issues that would have been much better discussed collaboratively, but those behind the proposed competition have not engaged with or met all unions to explain and better understand their business and operating model.“Each of the national unions will therefore be advising men’s and women’s players that participation in R360 would make them ineligible for international selection.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its reply read: “The series is designed with bespoke schedules for men’s and women’s teams and R360 will release all players for international matches, as written into their contracts.” R360 added: “Why would the unions stand in their way? We look forward to submitting to the World Rugby council for sanctioning next summer as planned.”The R360 response also struck back on the issue of player welfare. “So many players love what R360 can do for them and the game.

It has turned into quite a disastrous series of tournaments, with Raducanu enduring her worst results since February.This miserable afternoon in Wuhan had been preceded by two excruciating defeats in back-to-back events despite performing at a good level against top opponents. Raducanu held three match points against the two-time grand slam title winner Barbora Krejcikova in the second round at the Korea Open in Seoul before falling away in a one-sided third set, then she endured an identical scenario at the China Open in Beijing last week, losing against Jessica Pegula in the third round after also holding three match points.Her poor form against Li, whomshe had beaten at Eastbournein June in their only previous encounter, seemed initially to be a direct result of those confidence-sapping defeats.Despite opening the match with a break, Raducanu played a dire opening set, her forehand in particular haemorrhaging errors. After losing all three service games, Raducanu ended the set with three winners and 15 unforced errors.While the Briton struggled to put forehands in court with any consistency, Li played well. She struck her own forehand impressively, sweeping up all short balls behind it, she soaked up Raducanu’s first strike well and she offered her opponent very few unforced errors.Although Li’s form began to cool in set two, Raducanu was in no position to mount a comeback. She started to struggle with her second serve, her double faults rapidly piling up, and her movement looked increasingly laboured.After somehow surviving four double faults in the opening game of set two to hold serve for the first time, Raducanu served a double-fault on break point at 1-3 to hand Li a double break in the second set. Down 1-6, 1-4, Raducanu requested the doctor and, after having her blood pressure checked, she quickly retired.These past few weeks have underlined the thin margins at the top of the sport. Having put herself in position for two strong wins in recent weeks, she instead finds herself in the midst of some of her most difficult results of her season. She will not have many more opportunities to turn things around before the end of the year. Raducanu is scheduled to take two weeks off before returning on 27 October for the final week of the regular season at the Hong Kong Open.Raducanu had a new face in her player box in the form of Daniel Pohl, who sat next to her coach, ,Francisco Roig, during the match. Pohl is a prominent German physio and fitness trainer who has worked with numerous top players including Naomi Osaka, Ben Shelton, Matteo Berrettini and Petra Kvitova.Raducanu had been travelling without a fitness trainer since Yutaka Nakamura stopped working with the Briton on-site at tournaments in April for personal reasons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the match wore on, however, it was the harsh humidity that increasingly broke him down. He struggled with cramp and vomited in the second set and, after conceding that in 74 minutes at the end of a long, attritional rally, the 38‑year‑old fell to the ground and lay there for nearly a minute. He was helped to his chair by a doctor, where his vital signs were checked and he received some tablets.Djokovic eventually found enough energy and intensity to hold off his more physically durable challenger and return to the last eight, where he will be the highest-ranked player left in the draw. He will face Zizou Bergs of Belgium for a place in the semi-finals.Elsewhere, Jack Draper has hired Jamie Delgado, Andy Murray’s former coach, as his new primary coach as he continues his recovery from a left forearm injury that forced him to end his season prematurely, after the US Open.Draper will continue to work closely with James Trotman, his coach since 2021, but Delgado, whose longtime partnership with Grigor Dimitrov ended last month, will handle the majority of Draper’s tournament weeks. Draper’s decision to expand his team was made partially due to Trotman intending to spend less time on the road.Although he will not officially return to action until the 2026 season begins in January, Draper will make his first appearance since the US Open at the UltimateTennisShowdown finals exhibition event, which takes place in London between 5 and 7 December.Explore more on these topicsTennisEmma RaducanuNovak DjokovicnewsShareReuse this content"

The sanction was backdated to start on 20 September 2024 and runs through to 20 March 2026.CSAD noted McGregor was recovering from an injury and not in fight preparation during the missed collections, and that he fully cooperated with the inquiry, accepted responsibility and supplied information that explained the circumstances.Citing those factors, CSAD reduced the standard 24-month penalty for three whereabouts failures by six months. “Despite these mitigating factors, CSAD emphasises that accurate whereabouts filings and the ability to conduct unannounced testing are essential to the success of the UFC ADP.”McGregor, 37, has since re-entered the UFC testing pool and has provided four samples in 2025. The former two-division champion hasnot competed since July 2021.

If you’re just trying to troll me, I’ve seen way worse, I’ll restrict and move on. But please, if you’ve got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop.

In 2023, in an Instagram post supportingthe Screen Actors Guild’s campaign against AI, she wrote, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.“I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want and while I find it personally disturbing, the ramifications go far beyond my own feelings.“These recreations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”Williams’ latest post comes as celebrity deepfakes continue to proliferate across social media, in everything frompornographicand political content toscamsand advertising.In January, actorScarlett Johansson warned of the “imminent dangers of AI”after a deepfake video of her and other prominent Jewish celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld, Drake and Adam Sandler, speaking out against antisemitic comments made by Kanye West, went viral.In August, a scam ad featuring a deepfake ofCrowded Housefrontman Neil Finn falsely talking about erectile dysfunction went viral, prompting the band to issue a disclaimer.The Robin Williams deepfakes are part of a broader trend ofAI slop– low-quality content generated forentertainment– fuelled by the rapid growth of free-to-use generative AI apps.Several recent videos of Robin Williams on TikTok appear to have been created using OpenAI’s new video generator app, Sora 2, including a fake ad for Apple and an awards ceremony interaction between the comedian and the late Betty White.Within a few days of launching,Sora’s feed was floodedwith videos featuring copyrighted characters from shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, Pokémon and Rick and Morty.OpenAI told the Guardianthat content owners can flag copyright infringement using a “copyright disputes form” but that individual artists or studios cannot have a blanket opt-out. Varun Shetty, OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, said: “We’ll work with rights holders to block characters from Sora at their request and respond to takedown requests.”Explore more on these topicsRobin WilliamsArtificial intelligence (AI)CelebritySocial mediaComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Apple’s extremely popular AirPods Pro Bluetooth earbuds are back for their third generation with a better fit, longer battery life, built-in heart rate sensors and more effective noise cancelling, and look set to be just as ubiquitous as their predecessors.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It has been three years since thelast model, but the earbuds still come only in white and you really have to squint at the details to spot the difference from the previous two generations.The AirPods Pro 3 cost £219 (€249/$249/A$429), making them £30 cheaper in the UK than when their predecessors launched, and sit above theAirPods 4, which cost £169 with noise cancelling for those who don’t like silicone earbud tips.The shape of the earbuds has been tweaked, changing slightly the way you put them in and making them more comfortable than their predecessors for extended listening sessions of three hours or more. Five sizes of tips are included in the box, but if you didn’t get on with silicone earbuds before these won’t make a difference.View image in fullscreenThe stalks are thesame length as before, but the shape of the earbud has been changed to better align the tip with your ear canal.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianMost of the features are fairly standard for modern earbuds. Squeeze the stalks for playback controls, swipe for volume or take them out to pause the music. They support the same new features rolled out to Apple’s older earbuds, including the ability to use them as ashutter remotefor the camera app andfor live translation with the Translate appon the iPhone. The latter is limited to English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish for now and isn’t available in the EU, but it works surprisingly well for casual conversations.The biggest problem is that the other person will have to rely on reading or hearing your translated speech from your iPhone. I can see it being most useful with announcements or audio guides – the kind you get on transport or in museums where you need only to translate language one way.The most interesting added hardware feature is heart rate monitoring via sensors on the side of the earbuds, similar toApple’s Powerbeats Pro 2 fitness buds. They can be used with more than 50 workouts startedin the Fitness appor a handful of third-party apps on the iPhone and proved to be roughly in line with readings from aGarmin Forerunner 970or an Apple Watch during walks and runs. The earbuds are water-resistant to IP57 standards, which makes them much more robust against rain and sweat than before.The battery life has been increased by a third to at least eight hours of playback with noise cancelling for each charge, which is very competitive with some of the best rivals and long enough for most listening sessions.View image in fullscreenThe compact flip-top case provides two full charges for a total playback time of 24 hours – six hours short of the previous generation, but five minutes in the case is enough for an hour of listening time.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, H2 chip, UWBBattery life:eight hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)Water resistance:IP57 (buds and case)Earbud dimensions:30.9 x 19.2 x 27.0mmEarbud weight:5.6g eachCharging case dimensions:47.2 x 62.2 x 21.8mmCharging case weight:44gCase charging:USB-C, Qi wireless/MagSafe, Apple WatchBigger sound and impressive noise cancellingView image in fullscreenThe silicone earbuds are infused with foam in the tips that expands slightly for a better seal for music and noise cancelling.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe sound of the third-generation AirPods Pro takes a great listen and makes it bigger. They have a wider soundscape that makes big tracks sound more expansive, while still maintaining strong but nicely controlled bass. They are detailed, well-balanced and do justice to different genres of music, with plenty of power and punch where needed. As with Apple’s other headphones, they sometimes sound a little too clinical, lacking a bit of warmth or rawness in some tracks, and they can’t quite hit the very deepest of notes for skull-rattling bass. However, few earbuds sound better at this price and size.Apple’s implementation of spatial audio for surround sound for movies remains best in class, adding to the immersion with compatible devices and services, even if spatial audio music remains a mixed bag.View image in fullscreenThe AirPods Pro are the best combination of earbuds and compact case that you can easily fit in a pocket.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe improved noise cancelling is the best upgrade. Apple says it is twice as effective as the already good AirPods Pro 2, which sounds about right. In side-by-side comparisons, the AirPods Pro 3 handle street noise, including cars, horns and engines, almost as well as theclass-leading Sony WH-1000XM6, which is thoroughly impressive given they are large over-ear headphones, not little earbuds.They also do a great job of dampening the troublesome higher tones such as keyboard clicks and speech, making the commute and office work more bearable.Apple’s class-leading transparency mode is just as good on the new earbuds, sounding natural as if you weren’t actually wearing the earbuds. It makes using them as hearing aids or out on the street with some dampening of sudden loud sounds very good indeed.Call quality is first-rate, and my voice sounded clear and natural in quiet or noisy environments with only a hint of road noise from some loud streets audible on the call.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe case charges via USB-C, MagSafe, Qi or Apple Watch charger, and has a new featureto limit chargingof the earbuds to prolong their battery health.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The earbuds are not repairable, but Apple offers a battery service for £49 per earbud or case andoffers replacements for those lost or damaged costing from £79an item. The repair specialists iFixit rated the earbudszero out of 10 for repairability.The AirPods and case contain 40% recycled material by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, plastic, rare earth elements and tin. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes and breaks down the environmental impact of theearbuds in its report.PriceThe AirPods Pro 3 cost£219(€249/$249/A$429).For comparison, theAirPods 4start at£119, theBeats Powerbeats Pro 2cost£250, theSennheiser Momentum TW4cost£199, the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost£219, theSony WF-1000XM5cost£219and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds cost£300.VerdictThe AirPods Pro 3 take what was great about the ubiquitous second-generation models and improves almost everything.Longer battery life and a better, more comfortable fit for extended listening sessions are very welcome, as is the bigger, wider sound. Proper water resistance and built-in heart rate monitoring makes them useful for workouts, particularly those such as powerlifting that make wearing a watch difficult. The live translation feature worked better than expected, but has limitations that make it less useful for real-life conversations.The best bit is very effective noise cancelling that rivals some of the greatest over-ear headphones, but in a tiny set of earbuds that are much easier to carry around.Audiophiles will find they sound a little too clinical. While they work with any Bluetooth device, including Android phones, PCs and games consoles, they require an iPhone, iPad or Mac for full functionality. But the biggest letdownremains repairability, which remains a problem for most true wireless earbuds andloses them a star.Pros:very effective noise cancelling, great sound, best-in-class transparency, water resistance, built-in HR monitoring, great controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, very comfortable, excellent case, top class call quality.Cons:extremely difficult to repair, expensive, no hi-res audio support, lack features when connected to Android/Windows, look the same as predecessors, only available in white.View image in fullscreenThe AirPods Pro 3 are some of the very best earbuds you can buy, particularly if you use an iPhone.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsAppleHeadphonesWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The beige rectangular tupperware that contained its wires would, when connected to a TV by the aerial, bring a serviceable Pong copy to the screen.View image in fullscreenArcade fire … East German attractions at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumAt the time, they thought the home-brewed device was a singular example of ingenuity behind the iron curtain. But earlier this year they found anotherSeifendosen-Pong (“soap-box Pong”), along with a copy of a state-produced magazine called FunkAmateurcontaining schematics for a DIY variety of Atari’s 1970s gaming sensation.The discovery rubbed up against received wisdom that the dawn of computer gaming had at best been tolerated and at worst suppressed by socialist EastGermany. Instead, here was evidence that gaming enjoyed a level of official support, including from the regime’s notorious secret service.A new joint exhibit from the Allied Museum and the Computer Games Museum in Berlin brings cold war gaming curios from both sides of the iron curtain to light, including East Germany’s only arcade cabinet, the Poly-Play, which visitors can try out. With honey-coloured wooden panels and a brightly lit typeface, only 2,000 of the machines were made. In the late 80s, adolescents would crowd the cabinets at youth clubs and holiday retreats, to the extent they were available, where they could play a number of games cloned from western originals.But the Poly-Play “was only possible with help from state security,” says Veit Lehmann of the Allied Museum. Lacking programming expertise and manpower, manufacturer VEB Polytechnick turned to the Stasi for help. They were the ones with “the experts and the computing capability” to code the games.Instead of Pac–Man, there was Hase und Wolf–a canine-dodging hare swapped for Namco’s famous cheese-wheel-shaped ghost-evader. There was Hirschjagd(“Deer Hunt”), a repackaged take on the sci-fi shooter Robotron: 2084.There was Schießbude,a copy of a carnival shooting game; a butterfly-collecting title called Schmetterling;a memory puzzler; a skiing game and a racing game among the rest.View image in fullscreenTamed … the Poly-Play Hase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) game.Photograph: VEB Polytechnik Karl-Marx-StadtThe Poly-Play was many East Germans’ first encounter with computers, and it “opened up a completely different world for them”, says Regina Seiwald at the University of Birmingham. “The Poly-Play was seen as a machine for the whole family, who’d enjoy a weekend, go for a walk and then jointly play on one. It was seen as an innocent pastime, but with a bit of technical skills training added in.”But, as arcade-goers in the west commandeered tanks in Battlezone or blasted dragons from jetpack-propelled gunners in Space Harrier, the Poly-Play had all notions of violence removed. The GDR liked to present itself as an idyllic, peace-loving state, and its media law deemed all forms of “calls to violence” unconstitutional. “The GDR’s attitude towards computers was an idea of a harmonic self-image and a fear of the unknown,” Seiwald says.Yet, away from the Poly-Play and its PG approach to gaming, self-described “freaks” gathered at computer clubs to test the tolerance of the police state. The east declared technology an economic priority in the late 1970s but, with the CoCom trade embargo blocking exports to the socialist bloc, western technology was only available through smuggling routes, with ZX Spectrums sewn into car seats or hidden in chocolate boxes for cross-border journeys.View image in fullscreenLong arm of the state … an exhibit at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsState factories did produce their own machines – such as the Bildschirmspiel 01 pong clone and the VEB Robotron series of microcomputers – but only in small numbers. High price tags made them unattainable for most.As early enthusiasts began to establish clubs at universities and youth centres from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig, the state wondered if this youthful interest could help carve a path out of its technical quandary. “They thought if young people spent their time with games and computers, they might develop something better,” says Lehmann. Perhaps, the state thought, this interest could stir new generations into careers in microelectronics, where they might develop much-needed homegrown chips.An oft-repeated phrase among GDR officials, adds Martin Görlich, managing director of the Computer Games Museum, was that “learning from the Soviet Union means learning how to win”. So embracing computing echoed the position of the USSR, which also had arcade games – Frankenstein-like hybrids that blended physical action with screens – and ran its own computer clubs.View image in fullscreenEastern blocks … ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumOf course,the USSR also gave birth to Tetris, the fast-paced puzzler designed by software engineer Alexey Pajitnov to test a new computer. (The game was initially traded between engineers, but led to a dramatic race to secure distribution rights from the Soviet Union between Dutch-born game designer Henk Rogers and Kevin Maxwell, son of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell.)Over in East Germany, citizens often relied on bootlegs to get around restrictions or shortages. Would-be fashionistas stitched their own clothes, musicians cobbled together audio equipment, and enterprising sorts hand-painted banned board games such as Monopoly, with Mayfair swapped for Karl-Marx-Allee and a party conference square taking the place of jail.A DIY approach to computing was thus in keeping with the state’s policy of self-reliance, where civilians were encouraged to knit, build, tinker and repair all they could. Official magazines such as FunkAmateurand Jugend und Technik responded by promoting games – which they called “computer sports” – and publishing programming code. “The GDR was very aware of the constraints it had in technology,” says Seiwald. “People educating themselves in technology, or pushing the boundaries of what was available, was viewed positively.”Tantalisingly for young hobbyists, some of the computer clubs, such as the House of Young Talents in ast Berlin, possessed much-desired Commodore 64 machines, which were far superior to the GDR’s domestic equivalents. Most club attendees were young and male and, unsurprisingly, interested in games above all else.Some learned to code their own games on state computers such as the KC 85 by VEB Mikroelektronik, while others played them, such as René Meyer, who was 16 when he was introduced to a computer club at the University of Leipzig.“The GDR’s home computers were not compatible with other systems, creating a unique ecosystem for computing in the east,” says Meyer, whose favourite game was Bennion Geppy, its hero tasked with traversing dungeon rooms, dodging monsters and collecting keys.Paradoxically, while the state seemed to support these groups – club-goers were sometimes rewarded with fast-tracked routes to engineering colleges – they were also infiltrated by Stasi informants and closely monitored, their computing activities regarded with suspicion. One report from the Stasi archive lists all the games in circulation at the House of Young Talent. Next to acceptable titles such as Superbowl and Samantha Fox Strip Poker, games such as Rambo and Stryker were singled out for their glorification of violence.Later, as internal conflicts within East German society intensified, the Stasi grew more paranoid about war-themed games, computer viruses and anti-socialist messaging in software. Perhaps their fears weren’t unfounded: in neighbouring Czechoslovakia, underground gamers programmed titles such as The Adventures of Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square, a text adventure where the fedora-decked explorer could meet a grisly fate at the hands of bloodthirsty police officers.The east wasn’t alone in its mistrust of technology. In 1984, West Germany banned children from playing arcade games, concerned that they encouraged gambling. Then, it introduced strict age-gating for supposedly violent games, such as the Activision title, River Raid. This suspicion around gaming extends well into the 21st century: publishers have had to alter the content of their titles to get around censor boards. Players of the German version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, for example, were punished with failure if they shot civilians in its notorious‘No Russian’ mission, where terrorists massacred travellers at a Moscow airport.While East Germany promoted decentralised computing, over in the west, the state held a firm monopoly on telecoms, criminalising home networking and especially hacking. In the 1980s, activists in West Germany responded by founding the Chaos Computer Club, which continues to this day, even creating a DIY modem from toilet pipes in protest: the Datenklo (“dataloo”).“The west was very harsh in punishing hackers and crackers,” says Seiwald. “That the GDR was more permissive surprises a lot of people.”Coldwargames: It’s All a Game is at the Alliiertenmuseum, Berlin, until 30 June 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesGermanyCold warPCEuropeBoard gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today, anyone with a smartphone can access gruesome videos and images – as well as troves of misinformation. Though some experts have been sounding the alarm about the potential harmof smartphones on children and teen’s mental health, the fact is most young people still have access to phones – and the often disturbing content that flows out of them.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Guardian spoke with seven experts on how best to speak with kids about upsetting content and news, at what age to start those conversations – and what to avoid.Panel of experts:Anya Kamenetz, journalist and publisher ofThe Golden HournewsletterEugene Beresin, MD, psychiatrist and executive director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts general hospitalTara Conley, assistant professor of media and journalism at Kent State UniversityTori Cordiano, PhD, Ohio-based licensed clinical psychologistJill Murphy, chief content officer of Common Sense MediaAshley Rogers Berner,professor at Johns Hopkins UniversityHolly Korbey, author ofBuilding Better CitizensWhat’s the best way to talk to kids about bad news – whether it’s a public assassination, a school shootingor a climate-related disaster?Anya Kamenetz:First, find out what they already know or have heard. Kids are overhearing things at school and seeing snippets on social media, so it’s important that you know what they have heard. You can dispel any misconceptions with some clear facts. Look online together, to model balanced consumption of information. Once you’ve filled in some basics, ask if they have any questions. Then, ask how they are feeling about it.Eugene Beresin:Kids of all ages have three concerns. Am I safe? Are you taking care of me? How will this affect my life? So you want to ask what they’re worried about, listen, validate their feelings and be available for questions.Tara Conley:There are practical ways to create communication channels to talk to kids when the news is upsetting. For example, consider establishing a family group chat. Create online and offline spaces where a young person can feel part of a tight- knit group.What are the best ways to talk to kids about graphic content, like the shooting of Charlie Kirk?Tori Cordiano:I personally know a lot of teenagers who, without even realizing what they were looking at, stumbled into the [video of Kirk’s shooting] and were really shocked. Especially with younger kids, there may be some sense of: ‘I can’t even tell my parents because I wasn’t supposed to see in the first place.’It’s important that they’re able to talk about it with a trusted adult. You might say: ‘You may not have known what you really were looking at, or you maybe did seek it out, and that’s understandable because you wanted to know what was going on. What we know is we don’t want to continue to seek out those sorts of videos and images, because they do have a lasting impact on our brain.’Ashley Rogers Berner:When children hear about an assassination or other acts of political violence, it’s important to be truthful with them. Parents can reinforce the rules of democracy, such as that we deal with disagreements peacefully and without violence. They can reassure their children that the government’s job is to find and hold accountable any perpetrators of violent behavior, and that such violence is rare.How do you help kids navigate misinformation?Holly Korbey:Parents need to understand that when kids have phones, they have unending exposure to the worst things happening in the world, and almost immediately on TikTok and Instagram, the facts of what happened get twisted instantly. What’s more, political leaders are saying, ‘Don’t trust the news,’ so people are just so confused.A parent’s job can be to say: ‘Let’s just go over what the facts are. If you’ve heard something really scary, go to a journalistic outlet and see if that’s even right.’Cordiano:Kids are drawn to phones because it’s an important way that they communicate with their peers and learn about their world. I don’t think we’re smart to just put that to the side. Instead we should think about the habits we want them to start developing at a young age around technology use: where they’re using their devices, when they’re using their devices, for how long they’re using their devices and what they’re accessing.I don’t think of this as a one-size-fits-all approach, but generally starting with more restrictions (fewer apps, including social media, and tighter time limits) can be helpful when kids first have access to a phone or tablet. For all kids, avoiding keeping devices in their bedroom overnight, or for younger kids, avoiding using their devices behind closed doors, is helpful. I often recommendCommon Sense Mediato families looking for resources on this topic.Conley:Instilling critical media literacy skills in children and young people early on – by helping them understand how media and technologies influence social behaviors and social life – goes a long way, said Conley. I offer parents/caregivers some tips here:Tips for Adults Supporting Kids Consuming Scary News. The American Academy of Pediatrics also provides information onHow to Make a Family Media Plan.There’s so much vitriol and polarization in our politics. How do you handle those conversations?Korbey:I tell my kids that [no topic] is off limits. Students who are exposed to controversial topics and allowed to talk about them end up becoming more politically active later. We have arguments at the dinner table. I think that’s good.Jill Murphy:Kids and teens will have plenty of questions, and it may also be a launchpad for a deeper conversation about a political or cultural issue. Parents should remind kids of their values and points of view, while hearing what their kids are gravitating towards and wondering about.What should parents and caregivers avoid when talking to kids about the news?Kamentz:Avoid having TV news on in the background. I hate to say this because I used to work for NPR and grew up listening to it from the backseat, but depending on the story unfolding, you might want to limit that exposure as well. Depending on your kids’ age, you don’t necessarily have to volunteer lots of information when they have not asked. Kids take in information at their own pace and have widely varying developmental needs.Conley:It’s probably best to avoid pretending we know everything and can explain away upsetting news. Kids can tell. We owe them our humility, not hubris.How do you reassure kids when they’re concerned about very real risks to their own safety, such as climate change, school shootings, immigration raidsand police violence?Conley:I was in college, a lot was going on in the world from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, to the BP oil spill, to the Great Recession. During that time, and before he passed away, my dad wrote me letters. Sometimes he’d offer guidance, sometimes he’d just offer thoughts of encouragement. I still have his letters. I pull them out whenever I need a reminder of our shared humanity.So, when talking with parents and educators, I offer a practicalletter writing activity. Simply writing a letter to a young person in your life can go a long way.Cordiano:When a school shooting happens, it’s not our job to make themmoreupset about it. What we do want to make sure of is that they take safety drills at school seriously, and that they’re paying attention to the guidance that we get from the school.How do you reassure kids when you, as a parent, are afraid or upset by the news?Kamentz:Put on your own oxygen mask first, and make sure you have supportive adults to share your concerns with. Model healthy news consumption [by] avoiding doomscrolling before bed and maintaining family routines as a news-free zone.Conley:I encourage young people and adults to not only find the helpers (shoutout to Mr Fred Rogers) but alsobe a helper.Recent studiessuggest giving support, for example through volunteering, helps us all cope and better deal with constant stressors. We feel better when we help others.When is the best age to start those conversations?Murphy:Kids and teens are exposed to news at a rapid rate, often hearing about events from influencers. Because of this, it’s best for parents to begin discussions with kids early, sharing age-appropriate information.Kamentz:The reality is we don’t always choose. I didn’t want to have to explain to my three-year-old that school was closed because of a global pandemic, and that she had to wear a mask and couldn’t go inside the supermarket, but that’s what happened, and I have a happy, healthy eight-year-old today.Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyCharlie Kirk shootingClimate crisisUS crimeMobile phonesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our expert reveals allThe best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust freeAndy ShawTue 7 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTFirst published on Fri 28 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Choosing a cordless vacuum isn’t a decision that should be taken lightly. You’re likely to keep a vacuum cleaner for years, relying heavily on its ability to suck up dust, crumbs, mud, pet hair and any other dry spillages or sheddings that end up on your floor. Choosing the right model can be the difference between an effective cleaner that’s a delight to pull out of the cupboard and a dud that you dread having to unblock, detangle and clean after every use.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In this review, I took 10 of the leading cordless vacuum cleaners from a range of manufacturers and at various prices and inflicted the same cleaning tests on each one. That takes all the guesswork out of picking your next cleaner: I can tell you exactly which ones picked up the most mess.At a glanceBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251£547.53 at AmazonBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-Design£236.88 at AmazonBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detect£549 at John LewisBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick Pro£398 at AmazonBest handheld cordless vacuum cleanerDyson Car+Boat£238.38 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’ve been reviewing technology and home products for more than 30 years. In the past few years, I’ve specialised in testing vacuum cleaners. During that time, I’ve tested more vacuum cleaners of various shapes, sizes and types than I’d care to count, from handheld helpers to heavy-duty dirt-shifters.How I testedView image in fullscreenEach vacuum was put to the test against flour, cat litter pellets and pet hair.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianMost cordless vacuum cleaners are designed to work on carpet and hard floors, so I tested them all on both. To do this, I weighed out spillages of flour, recycled wood cat litter pellets and pet hair. Flour and cat litter are easy enough to come by, but my dog doesn’t shed enough hair to test this many vacuums. So I’m also the proud owner of a box of sweepings from a friendly (but slightly bemused) local dog groomer.I gave each vacuum cleaner a chance to pick up as much of the spillages as possible, with a single push-forward and pull-backwards motion, and weighed the collection bins before and after.Most vacuums will collect more if given more chances to go over a mess, particularly from a different angle, but I wanted relatively tough tests that would truly differentiate one vacuum from another, so I allowed only a single sweep.I also tested the batteries by seeing how long it took them to run down from a full charge – at full suction and in each one’s most economical setting. I performed these tests with the floor head attached, where possible.Lastly, I tested the suction using a pressure gauge. While strong suction is useful, the cleaning tests were more important because other factors play a big part in the overall cleaning prowess. For example, a well-designed floor head can make a moderate sucker as good a cleaner as a more powerful model with an inferior brush or roller.All the machines I tested are being sent back to their manufacturers or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best cordless vacuum cleaners in 2025View image in fullscreenThe lineup of test subjects.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianBestcordless vacuum cleaner overall:Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Andy Shaw/The Guardian£549.99 at Shark£547.53 at AmazonIf there’s one thing that makes cordless vacuum cleaners a pain, it’s the emptying: taking it to the bin and jettisoning the debris after vacuuming. And, if your family is anything like mine, you may have to do it before you clean too because someone else didn’t bother to empty it. That won’t be the case with this Shark vacuum, though: it empties itself. It’s also very good at cleaning.Why we love itThe Shark IP3251 comes with a base station that operates as a stand and charging dock. When you rest the cordless vacuum cleaner on it, it springs into life, opening the base of the vacuum’s collection bin and sucking its contents into a larger container, leaving the cordless stick empty and ready for next time. The secondary bin has a volume of two litres, so it can take a few empties of the 0.7-litre stick.That would all be pointless if the device itself wasn’t up to snuff, but it’s an excellent cleaner. Its floor head has a fluffy roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpet, and it works well on both surfaces, performing a literal clean sweep in my tests.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty got to work on the flour, pet hair and cat litter.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …I found it worked better if I held it lower while vacuuming on some carpets, with fins on the base otherwise catching when I pulled it back. That may make it better for shorter than taller people.Weight:3.71kgMax suction power (measured):28kPaBattery life (measured):43minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?NoBest budget cordless vacuum cleaner:Vax HomePro Pet-DesignView image in fullscreen£320 at Argos£236.88 at AmazonThe Vax HomePro Pet-Design is good value for money, sitting at the lower end of the price spectrum but still coming with a good selection of tools for handheld use. It also performed well in all the tests.Why we love itIt’s comfortable to hold and use, and simple to operate, with just two large buttons – one to switch it on and the other to boost the power. Battery life is displayed by a light-up ring and lasted a decent 34 minutes in our rundown test.Emptying it is straightforward, too, with a button to open the collection bin, while a pump action lifts dirt off the filter, so you don’t have to poke your hands in. It’s one of the few cordless stick vacuums that can support itself when standing up, so there’s no need to find somewhere to lie it down between cleaning jobs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Vax HomePro Pet-Design took to the floor to suck up the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the floor head is a basic single-brush bar, which is unsophisticated when compared with the alternatives you get on Shark and Dyson models. Still, for the price, it’s ultimately forgivable.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):19kPaBattery life (measured):34minsDust capacity:0.7lAdditional filters supplied?NoBestcordless vacuum for deep cleaning:Dyson Gen5detectView image in fullscreen£549 at John Lewis£599.99 at DysonLet’s not beat about the bush: this top-of-the-range Dyson is the most expensive vacuum cleaner here. It’s also the best, making short work of all my tests. If it’s any recommendation, it’s the vacuum cleaner I used to clean up any residual mess when I’d finished testing the other models.Why we love itAs with Shark, Dyson provides a soft roller for hard floors and a brush bar for carpets. However, it does this with two separate detachable floor heads, rather than rolling both into one. That means you have to switch heads each time you change surface, but it also means that they’re adept at their assigned roles.The hard-floor head has a green light that illuminates the dust on the floor as you clean. Not only can you see where you need to clean but also you can witness what a super job the roller does of vacuuming everything up. The carpet-floor head has an anti-tangle mechanism that combs it free of long hair as it rotates.A dusting brush and crevice tool are inside the extension wand, so you don’t have to seek them out when converting to handheld mode. It also comes with a mini motorised tool that’s perfect for lifting pet hair from upholstery or just cleaning the stairs.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Gen5detect tackled the flour, cat litter and pet hair.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …its screen is useful to indicate battery life, but it also insists on counting how many particles of various sizes it’s collected – a feature no one asked for.Weight:3.5kgMax suction power (measured):31kPaBattery life (measured):56minsDust capacity:0.77lAdditional filters supplied?NoBest cordless vacuum for clean emptying:Henry Quick ProView image in fullscreen£399.99 at Currys£398 at AmazonMost cordless sticks create a dust cloud when you deposit the contents of their collection bins into your dustbin. The Henry Quick Pro is the only cordless vacuum we’ve reviewed here that doesn’t do that because of its disposable dirt-capturing bags.Why we love itWe can’t emphasise this enough – it’s frustrating to vacuum the floor only to have the dust billowing out of your bin and back into the air when you empty it. With the Henry Quick Pro, you push a lever on the top and the base opens, jettisoning the bag of collected rubbish out of the bottom. It leaves no mess and has the added benefit of no filters to clean.In my tests, the Quick Pro performed decently enough, other than on hard floors with the cat litter, which it pushed ahead instead of sucking up. That job would be better tackled by removing the extension wand and using the device with a handheld attachment. It comes with a comprehensive selection of accessories, including a motorised mini head for stairs and upholstery, a flexible hose and a useful handle extension for taller users.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Henry Quick Pro tackled the flour and pet hair but left some of the cat litter behind.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …the bags have a plastic top that holds them in place inside the collection bin. Henry manufacturer Numatic claims to offset the carbon cost, but it would be better environmentally if it didn’t use any plastic at all. They also cost £1.30 per 1-litre bag.Weight:3.2kgMax suction power (measured):10.75kPaBattery life (measured):1hr 11minsDust capacity:1lAdditionalbags supplied?Yes, six pods (bags)Best handheld cordless vacuum cleaner:Dyson Car+BoatView image in fullscreen£238.38 at John Lewis£249 at AODyson doesn’t manufacture a vacuum purely for handheld use, instead opting to repackage an existing cordless stick without the extension wand. The result is a handheld device so powerful that you may wish you could also use it on the floor.Why we love itThe Dyson Car+Boat is a cunning repackage of theDyson V8. That model is now the bottom of the range of Dyson’s regular cordless stick cleaners, but it makes for a handheld unit that performs above and beyond expectations.It comes with three key attachments: a mini motorised tool for upholstery and stairs; a crevice tool for gaps; and a combination dusting brush and funnel. It’s a powerful combo that cleaned up my test messes with aplomb. I had to use the funnel rather than the motorised tool to collect cat litter, though, because there’s no way this smaller device wouldn’t just push them ahead.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Dyson Car+Boat devoured the detritus on the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …you can stillbuy the V8, with the extension tube and attachments, for a similar price. It also comes with Dyson’s old mini-motorised tool. Newer models come with a better-designed tool, which has a tapering roller that doesn’t trap longer hairs. It would have been a nice addition to this repackage.Weight:1.9kgMax suction power (measured):21kPaBattery life (measured):38minsDust capacity:0.54lAdditional filters supplied?Noskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The collection bin is in the base – you lift it out by its classy leather strap and can tip the debris straight into the bin.I particularly liked that it has edge sweepers on its front corners – a concept borrowed from robot vacuums. These flick debris out from the very edges of skirtings and kickboards into the path of the suction. It’s an area in which few other vacuums are particularly effective.View image in fullscreenThe Gtech AirRam 3 goes to battle, and almost wins, with pet hair, cat litter and flour.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …although it was brilliant with cat litter, it didn’t fare well with my pet-hair or flour tests, leaving behind dirt when I lifted the collection bin from the floor head.Weight:3.8kg;max suction power (measured):not measured;battery life (measured):25mins;dust capacity:0.8l;additional filters supplied?NoGtech AirFox PlatinumView image in fullscreen£299.99 at Lakeland£299 at AmazonBest for:light weight and light useA constant source of annoyance with cordless vacuum cleaners is that you have to find somewhere to lean them when you want to put them down. The AirFox is light and well-balanced enough to stand on its own, so you can leave it in the middle of the room while you do some dusting, and it won’t fall to the floor.The trigger needs to be held down to keep the vacuum running, and while there is a trigger lock to keep it in place, it’s fiddly to use. It cleaned well in my tests, though, only really struggling with the cat litter, which seemed to get stuck in the floor head.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) and after (right) the Gtech AirFox Platinum took to the mat.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …I found it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods because the back extends out over the handle, getting in the way of my wrist.Weight:2.9kg;max suction power (measured):31kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 10mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?NoMiele Duoflex HX1 Total CareView image in fullscreen£399 at John Lewis£399 at MieleBest for:simple operationDespite being a high-end brand in most categories of domestic appliances, the Miele Duoflex HX1 sits in the middle of this gathering in terms of price. That’s largely thanks to the lack of additional features you get when compared with the likes of Shark and Dyson. It performed well in my cleaning tests but generally proved better on carpets than on hard floors.It operates in either floor or handheld mode. The floor head is basic, with a simple brush bar and no anti-tangle features. It comes with three handheld attachments – a crevice tool, a basic upholstery nozzle and a dusting brush.View image in fullscreenHow it started v how it’s going with the Miele Duoflex HX1 Total Care.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …emptying relies on gravity alone, so you end up having to poke your fingers into the collection bin to clear it out. Most disappointing was the battery, which didn’t last long with the floor head attached, even on the weakest suction setting.Weight:3.1kg;max suction power (measured):12.5kPa;battery life (measured):13mins;dust capacity:0.3l;additional filters supplied?NoBosch Unlimited 10 BCS1051GBView image in fullscreen£499 at John Lewis£500 at ArgosBest for:super-long battery lifeWith the Unlimited 10, Bosch has gone all in on the bling. It has a very flashy screen, which informs you visually when you’re changing floor surfaces, and lights up in a different colour depending on what power setting you’ve got the suction on. It’s useful, but possibly not useful enough to justify its higher-than-average cost.The overall build quality is excellent, though. I loved the spring-loaded filter-clearing lever on the back, which means you can empty the collection bin in a smooth single-push motion rather than the banging and poking you have to do with most other vacuums. This lever can also compact the rubbish as you clean to reduce how often it needs emptying. The Unlimited 10 also had the best battery, which made the unit heavy but lasted an astonishing hour and a half in its Eco setting.View image in fullscreenBefore (left) with the hair, litter and flour and how the Bosch Unlimited 10 vacuumed them up on the right.Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a bit expensive without there being enough of a cleaning benefit to justify it.Weight:3.8kg;max suction power (measured):13kPa;battery life (measured):1hr 34mins;dust capacity:0.4l;additional filters supplied?NoBeldray Airgility Pet Plus+View image in fullscreen£85.99 at Currys£84.99 at AmazonBest for:lowest priceIf most of the other reviews left you thinking that you were going to have to take out a second mortgage to get a new cordless vacuum cleaner, the sub-£100 price tag of the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ should be a breath of fresh air. It’s light and petite but has small attachments, too, which aren’t large enough to pick up larger particles. It doesn’t collect dirt as well as the best vacuum cleaners here, but for a fraction of the price, it does a reasonable job.The biggest problem was cat litter, which was sucking OK from the floor but caused a blockage after only a tiny amount had entered the collection bin. It was surprisingly proficient at flour on hard floors but failed to agitate my test carpet enough to replicate that success. It also left a bit of pet hair behind during testing, either on the floor or stuck to the rollers.View image in fullscreenBefore the Beldray Airgility Pet Plus+ got to work (left) and how well it picked up the mess (right).Composite: Andy Shaw/The GuardianIt didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t perform as well as more expensive rivals, though it does still impress for the price.Weight:2.2kg;max suction power (measured):9.25kPa;battery life (measured):41mins;dust capacity:1.2l;additional filters supplied?Yes, oneWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe Dyson Car+Boat makes short work of mess.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianWhy choose a cordless vacuum cleanerCordless vacuum cleaners are vastly more convenient than corded models. There’s no cable to unwind and no need to find a power socket – you just take the vacuum to the mess and get started.The downside is that they run on battery power. The batteries can last anywhere between an hour or so on light settings and down to a few minutes on full blast. They should last long enough to get around an average-size housein one go, but larger spaces might need a mid-clean charge, which can take a few hours (or an expensive extra battery).What should you look for in a cordless vacuum cleaner?All cordless vacuum cleaners will have a good go at your carpeted areas, but they work on hard floors, too. The best hard-floor models tend to come with a fluffy roller, which will be better at picking up dust from smooth surfaces, as well as a standard brush bar.One particularly good thing about cordless vacuums is that they tend to break down into handheld devices if you remove the extension wand. Check that the one you want comes with the attachments you need. If you have stairs you may like to look for a mini motorised tool, which is a bit like a miniature version of a regular floor head, ideal for vacuuming smaller areas, such as stairs and upholstery.Do cordless vacuums have good filtration systems?Yes, cordless vacuums quote high levels of filtration, with some claiming to trap even the tiniest of particles, such as pollen. However, emptying cordless vacuums that don’t use bags can create a messy dust cloud, so these may not be the models for you if you’re allergic to dirt particles. Filters also need regular cleaning, which is something you won’t be used to if you’re moving away from a vacuuming system that uses disposable bags.How to clean your cordless vacuum cleanerMaintaining your vacuum cleaner doesn’t stop at emptying the collection bin. There are a few other areas that deserve your attention if you want top performance and a long life from your vacuum.The first is keeping the filter clean. This doesn’t need doing after every use, but it’s worth keeping an eye on how dirty it’s getting and cleaning it before it gets too clogged up. Dyson recommends doing this once a month. With Dyson vacuums, you remove the filter by twisting it and lifting it out of the body of the cleaner, then rinsing it in cold water to remove the dirt. Let it air dry for at least 24 hours and check it’s completely dry before refitting.The filters on most other brands can be cleaned in a similar way, but some don’t like getting wet, so check your vacuum’s instruction manual if you’re not sure.The other problem area is the brush bar. Anti-tangle floor heads have improved things in recent years, but even these can be clogged up with hair, fluff and dirt over time. The brush bar can usually be removed from the floor head, and you can attack entangled hair with a pair of scissors. If the bristles are loaded with fluff, you can tease it out with your fingers or use an old comb.For a really deep clean, you can dismantle most vacuum cleaners and wash any non-electrical parts with a damp cloth. Make sure it’s all properly dry before putting it back together.What to do with your old vacuum cleanerWhile you might have decided to move on from your old vacuum cleaner, a working model could still hold value for others. It’s worth seeing if you can sell it locally or donate it to someone who can still get some use out of it.Alternatively, when you buy your new vacuum, ask the retailer about its WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) recycling scheme. The UK’sWEEE Regulationsstate that companies selling such items must accept the device you’re replacing and responsibly recycle it.Lastly, you can always recycle it yourself. Your local recycling centre should have a section for electricals, and you can find your nearest atRecycle Your Electricals. Alternatively, check your local council’s website to find out about its recycling services and opening hours.The best window vacs for clearing condensation: seven expert picks for streak-free shineRead moreAndy Shaw is aconsumer journalist and technology addict.

The company said facial images and ID images “are deleted directly after” ages are confirmed, but Discord’s website noted that if verification fails, users can contact the trust and safety team for a manual review.Under the under 16s social media ban to come into effect on 10 December, the Australian government has outlined that it expects platforms such as Discord – which is one of the platformsthat has been asked to assess if it is required to comply– should have multiple options for assessing a user’s age, and a way for them to quicklyappeal an adverse decision.Platforms can ask for ID documents as part of the age assurance scheme, but it cannot be the sole method of age assurance offered by the platforms under the policy.The Australian privacy commissioner confirmed it had been notified about the breach by Discord.Discord was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGamesPrivacyCybercrimeHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

Conventional explanations for this come up shortTue 7 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 12.39 EDTShareIn recent years, the United States’total fertility rate– the average number of children a woman will have over her childbearing years – hashovered at historic lows. The ongoing decline has bolstered fears about the nation’s ability to manage its vast economy – and maintain its ever-so fragile position as a global superpower. While America’s fertility dip isn’t unique – after all, abouthalf of countries worldwide have fertility rates well below replacement levels(the minimum fertility amount needed to sustain a population) – its situation is becoming uniquely intricate, maybe even irreversible. To understand why, you need only look at the case of America’s Black population.Historically, Black and other non-white women have had higher fertility rates than white women, but in recent years, to the bewilderment of researchers like me, these gapshave rapidly shrunkdue primarily to Black people foregoing children. In apoll conducted in March by the Institute of Politicsat Harvard Kennedy School, only 37% of Black respondents said that having kids was important, compared with 51% of white people and 46% of Hispanics. Why? One contentious explanation is that Black people may be both consciously and unconsciouslydeciding not to have childrenoverfears about increasing racism in America.These days, Black people, and Black youth in particular, are deeply and intimately attuned to the sheer scale, ubiquity and persistence of racial animus and discrimination in America. Beyond their direct personal experiences, they’re now frequently vicariously exposed to overt and subtle forms of racism through24/7 news cyclesandsocial mediathat didn’t exist before the new millennium. AWashington Post-Ipsos pollfound that 47% of Black people from ages 18 to 29, and 43% of Black people from 30 to 39, felt that racism in America would get worse over the rest of their lives. The consequences of this – for Black people and America – couldn’t be more stark.As an epidemiologist who studies the intricate ways that populations’ health behaviors shift, I’ve seen first-hand how my field’s conventional explanations for societal problems often come up short. Traditionally, researchers have argued that declining fertility in Black populations is due to Black womentypically having a smaller pool of men whom they feel are “marriageable”– namely, men of their own race who are educated and have stable jobs. This hypothesis could indeed explain why Black college-educated women, for example, havelower overall fertility rates than their white and Hispanic counterparts. But with Black college-educated women and now also Black womenwithoutcollege educations increasingly forgoing bearing children, one factor, racism,provides a much clearer explanation. And there’s historic precedent for it.Black fertility is a grim, albeit paradigmatic, sociopolitical issue in the US. It carries complex cultural and economic stakes that date back to chattel slavery. Enslavers ruthlessly maneuvered to increase plantation production byforcing enslaved Black women to reproduce with Black enslaved men(and often the enslavers themselves). Enslaved Black women (and their Black mates) lamented the idea of bringing children into an overtly hostile, racist world where those children, too, would likely be enslaved and exploited.The idea that racism in 2025 could deter parenthood is undoubtedly a thorny one. It’s even thornier when you introduce politics into the equation. And yet, a peek at how fertility patterns often change depending on the political party that’s in office lays bare what is perhaps the most critical part of the nation’s ongoing racial reckoning – while also adding texture to our understanding of America’s deepening fertility crisis.Black fertility ratesdecelerated more than twice as much duringDonald Trump’s first term as compared withObama’s second term, while the decline slowed over the same span among white and Latino Americans; and Black womenexperienced more adverse birth outcomesafter the 2016 election than during Obama’s presidency. Without a doubt, though, these types of outcomes aren’t just associated with Trump’s politics, but with Republican politics more broadly. For instance,one study of infant outcomes from 1965 to 2010found that roughly half of the mortality gap between white and Black infants, approximately 20,000 additional infant deaths, was attributable to the 28 years of Republican presidential administrations in this period.Black Americans’ recognition of Trump’s overt racism during his first term was pronounced. In a 2019 pollconducted by Quinnipiac, 80% of Black voters said that Trump was racist. And73% of Black adults in a Pew Research Center pollfelt Trump had made race relations worse. No similar polls have been carried out in recent years. However, as of last week,82.7% of Black Americans– roughly the exact amount thatvoted for Kamala Harris in 2024– disapprove of Trump, compared with 48.1% of white people.All things considered, racial sentiment in Trump’s second term is poised to worsen. Over the last year, there has been increasing political and social acceptability of overt racism, typified in no small part by Republicans’ constant castigation of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), including for any-and-all public catastrophes, such asthe devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and Potomac River plane collisionthat occurred earlier this year.After his inauguration, Trump wasted no time in spearheadingbroad cuts to DEI-focused research and programsaimed at rectifying racial injustices, which naturally ensnares all kinds of valuable programming on disparities, including initiativesfocused on reproductive health in Black communities. The consequences of these cuts will be resounding.Already, compared with women of other races, Black women havehigher rates of infertility, the biologicalinability to conceiveafter a year or more of regular unprotected intercourse; are significantlymore likely to die during pregnancy; and are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes, including offspring beingborn prematurelyand with agreater likelihood of neurological and developmental issues. And federal and red-state policies thatreduce access to healthcare and reproductive servicessuch as abortion are now effectively being transposed into purple and blue states.To be sure, there are many reasons why people – irrespective of race – choose not to have kids. There are technical reasons, like simply not having the biological ability to bear a child. Approximately 11% of women and 9% of men in the UShave fertility challenges. Then there are practical reasons – such as concerns about not having the financial means or support needed to successfully raise the child. And some people simply don’t believe having a child is all that pleasurable or noble, like many do. And then there is the third domain: the philosophical. This is where racism comes in. The philosophical relates to concerns prospective parents have about the kind of world that they’ll be bringing kids into. Consider the“BirthStrikers” movement, a viral campaign launched in the United Kingdom in 2018 that was led by people opting out of childbearing over climate change concerns.On discussion forums and subreddits for “childfree” people, Black posters, both men and women, routinely discuss the growing allure of eschewing parenthood, connecting their anxieties about the economy, housing and the like with their existential fear of accelerating racism. According to a 2024 poll from Gallup,59% of Black parentsindicated that they talk with their kids about the challenges they may face because of their race. Parents rightfully lament “the talk”, especially the part about the high-profile murders of Black people – like Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown – and the need to tread lightly in white spaces. In a 2020 interview, actor and comedianTiffany Haddishmemorablymade the following statement: “I would hate to give birth to someone that looks like me knowing that they’re gonna be hunted or killed,” adding: “Why would I put someone through that?”But there are many consequences to Black populations foregoing parenthood. There’s the issue of weakened political capital and clout for Black Americans, each already punctured by GOP-ledgerrymandering practicesandrollback of state-level voting rights. There’s also the matter of ensuring there are sufficient family caretakers available for the rapidly growing elderly Black population, withlowered fertility poised to widen the support gap.Black Americans are a vital part of America’s future and can play a big role in addressing the nation’s fertility crisis. Trump and congressional Republicans havearguably experienced deeper concerns about the fertility problem than Democrats have, yet their embrace of anti-Black rhetoric and policy is precisely the kind of adversarial grandstanding that imperils the broader effort to undo the crisis. The solutions to addressing our current and forthcoming fertility challenges have to start with addressing racism and the factors that drive it. To begin that process, we’ll have to do two things the country hasn’t shown the moral clarity or political will to do: depoliticize racial equity and treat fertility like a social good rather than an economic commodity to be bought and sold.Jerel Ezell is an epidemiologist and visiting professor at the University of Chicago Medical Center.

Here’s why I have cautious hopeJeremy Ben-AmiTrump’s personal desire to play the part of peacemaker should not be dismissed – it should be encouragedTue 7 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 08.03 EDTShareTwo years after the horrors of 7 October, few names evoke the tragedy more thanKfar Aza, a small, bucolic kibbutz less than two miles from Gaza that came under brutal attack that day.For years, I visited Kfar Aza with groups of policymakers and American guests on trips designed to help them understand what life on the border meant and what a path toward conflict resolution might entail.One of our occasional hosts in the town wasOfir Libstein, the head of the regional council – basically the mayor of the area. Ofir firmly believed that Israel’s long-term security depended on a future for his Palestinian neighbors in Gaza as well. He was an activist and a public voice for the idea that stability for his region and constituents depended on achieving peace.On 7 October 2023, he fought to defend his community and was among the first to die. In all, 62 residents of Kfar Aza were killed that day; 19 were taken hostage, including twin brothersGali and Ziv Berman, who remain in Gaza to this day.When I last visited the kibbutz this summer, I met one of Ofir’s close friends, a man my age who survived by clinging to his safe-room door handle for hours while his neighbors were massacred. Despite everything, he told me peace must still be the path forward – that Palestinians inGazamust be given something to live for. His words, and his refusal to surrender hope, moved me to tears.Twenty-five years ago, while living inIsraeland studying Hebrew, I befriended a classmate named Abed, an optometrist from Gaza City. He invited me to his family’s home for dinner one weekend. Conversation was halting, limited by language, but the message conveyed by all I met was a desire for nothing more than to live normal lives, to raise families, work and coexist.Over the years, friends, colleagues and I have heard similar stories from Palestinians in Gaza – teachers, doctors and entrepreneurs who remembered the days when there was interconnection between Gaza and Israeli border communities, when small but real human connections were possible.In Kfar Aza, our hosts used to recall the time when Palestinians in Gaza worked in the kibbutz fields, and Israelis shopped in Gaza on weekends. Those ties are long severed.The devastation of Kfar Aza – the kibbutz itself and the community – is almost impossible to comprehend. Yet what’s even harder to grasp is that two years later, the war grinds on – hostages still in captivity, Gaza in ruins, Israelis traumatized and extremists on both sides still ascendant.This moment calls for more than vengeance and endless war. It calls for vision – and courage.That’s why the proposal put forward last week by Donald Trump – initially embraced by regional partners and conditionally accepted by bothBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Hamas representatives – deserves close scrutiny and cautious hope. The broad outlines – a phased ceasefire, international administration of Gaza, Arab recognition of Israel tied to progress toward Palestinian self-governance and ultimately statehood – echo principles that those of us who are serious about conflict resolution have long understood must be part of any viable peace plan.Skeptics are right to note that the devil is in the details and that implementation will be difficult. The many potential sticking points will include precisely how far Israeli troops will pull back, the mechanics of disarmament and the process of choosing acceptable Palestinian leadership in Gaza – just to name a few.Both Hamas and the Israeli far right will do everything they can to torpedo the proposal. But the fact that a plan has emerged at all – that leaders are again speaking the language of diplomacy, coexistence and regional cooperation – gives reason for hope. Trump’s personal desire to play the part of peacemaker should not be dismissed; it should be encouraged.On this day when we remember one of the greatest tragedies in Israel’s history – and mark the beginning of Gaza’s devastation – it’s vital that we recommit to the pursuit of peace.Peace is not a naive and abstract ideal. It’s pragmatic. It’s the only durable path to security for Israelis and Palestinians alike. The alternative is endless war – one that will claim the next generation’s future as surely as it claimed Ofir Libstein’s and Abed’s dreams.Kfar Aza will forever be a place of unbearable loss. But for me it remains a reminder of what’s worth fighting for: the belief that peace is not just possible, it’s necessary; the understanding that the lives of Israelis and Palestinians are intertwined; and the memory that even amid the ruins, there are people on both sides who refuse to give up.Two years on, the question is whether their leaders are finally ready to listen.Jeremy Ben-Ami is president of J Street, the pro-Israel, pro-peace, pro-democracy advocacy organization.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsrael-Gaza: two years onGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

I think I have not only aged out of going to some nonstop rager hosted by you, specifically for your benefit, but I also can’t keep track of when your unnecessary gatherings even occur. You might think I sound incredibly unfun, but actually, I am the life of the party. It’s just that at my age, all the life has been sucked out. “Tom’s 32nd BDay Bash!!!” at Squirrel Lodge is on 2 November, but then “Shelly’s Pre-Turkey Day Shindig?” is two days later. You actually think I’m going tobothof those?Besides, I can’t recall what I ate for breakfast, let alone what day your party is. Unfortunately, technology has a solution to my memory problem.This year was the year of Partiful, a purple Y2K-looking mess of an app that is designed to not only centralize your social activities into one place, but also give you the option of annoying strangers who had the misfortune of attending the same party you did. One day, every young or young-ish person started using Partiful, blasting out invites and hoping you would cave and download this weird app you’d never heard of. Well, of course, I downloaded it. I guess I could have pretended to be a luddite and told all my friends I refused to put Partiful on my phone. But I have a PlayStation 5, so that excuse won’t work. When the news dropped last summer that Partiful wasfounded by former Palantir employees, I could have deleted it on moral grounds and assumed others would follow my lead. It doesn’t seem like anyone’s stopped using it, so tech inertia does as intended. I still have it, but I hate it.Ready to give up social media? ‘Advice pollution’ might just get you there | Emma BeddingtonRead moreIf you’re as decrepit and old as I am, you will rememberFacebookused to do this for people. There was a tab for events; you could invite your friends and post photos from the occasion on the event’s wall. Boy, those were the days. I sure miss Facebook and how convenient it was to have only one social media app for everything. Someone should bring back Facebook.Sorry … Facebook still exists, you say? And people use it? To post anti-vax conspiracy theories and AI mashups of SpongeBob with JD Vance’s face? Huh. Well, no wonder I’m not on there any more.When Facebook lost every last shred of cool factor and became a place for boomers to get scammed for their social security numbers, a horde of other apps came rushing in – not to fill the entire void that Facebook left, but one teeny, tiny function that was a fraction of what Facebook could do. People started posting photos on Instagram, soFacebook bought it. Even though Facebook itself allows you to post photos. Facebook Messenger became a dead zone of thieves and horny security guards on lunch break attempting to invade your DMs. WhatsApp rose to popularity as an alternative messaging service that’s fully encrypted.Facebook bought it, even though Facebook itself has a messaging function.You get it. There are simply too many apps, all doing essentially the same thing, except progressively uglier. And Partiful is uglier than most. But young people don’t call things “ugly” any more. They call them “vibey”, as the New York Timesdescribed Partiful’s candy-coated hellscape in 2024, when the app was first starting to invade our precious personal time. Their logo – a stylized “P” that looks like someone poured liquid mercury on a dinner plate – is transparently aimed at gen Z nostalgia for the 2000s, a mostly awful decade defined by September 11,shockingly ill-fitting pants, andRuben Studdard’s Sorry 2004.Once you get past the violet puke background, you can respond to invites from people who know you or browse a list of open events in your area that anyone with a smartphone and functioning cell service can attend. Things called “Club Brat” or “Hootermania” that could be a high-level performance art piece or an orgy. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.Just like literally any other invitation app (Paperless Post, Evite, Apple Invites), you have to respond to the host that you will either attend, not attend or let them know you will “maybe attend”. I love the “maybe” button, because it allows me to feel less guilty about skipping “Carmen’s Flirty 40th” at Dave & Buster’s. I will consider your party up until the exact moment it starts, when I will decide to absolutely, positively not go.Except Partiful actually shames you for responding “Maybe”! When you click it, something like an early 90s video game cut scene pops up that asks you to “Pls Commit Soon.” Yes, it says “Pls”. Giving up on spelling words is vibey, I suppose.Dear gen Z, take a lesson from this zillennial: to be cringe is to be free | Eleanor BurnardRead morePartiful won’t even let me be passive-aggressive without chastising me and aggravating my sense of grammatical propriety. If I can’t pretend to want to go to your party, then what’s the point of our pretend friendship anyway? We need an alternative to Partiful as soon as humanly possible, and I think I have just the idea.I won’t suggest going back to Facebook, since everyone who doesn’t believe in shapeshifting lizard people has long since abandoned it. You could invite people via a “close friends” Instagram story, but you will accidentally invite the random sexy Russian bot you followed “by mistake”.The answer is simple: handwrite your invites. Go old-school and sit down with a pen, some stationery, a stack of envelopes and a few stamps. Not only does this avoid the need for downloading yet another app that does one simple thing poorly; you will be so sick of writing – your hand cramping, the nerves in your arm stinging, the ink staining your clothes, all that licking of things – that you will immediately realize that throwing your “Radical Pool Day Spectacular” isn’t worth the hassle.Thank me later.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionMetaFacebookSocial mediaDigital mediaSocial networkingFriendshipcommentShareReuse this content"

It is full of trapsJan-Werner MüllerThe administration is trying to make nine universities an offer they seemingly cannot refuseTue 7 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 13.20 EDTShareSticks are bad, but sometimescorruption through carrotsis worse. TheTrump administration– after having brutally cut federal funding earlier this year – is now trying to make nine universities anoffer that they seemingly cannot refuse. In exchange for preferential treatment in funding and bonuses like “invitations to White House events” – apparently the same logic as a fancy credit card that promises you backstage access at concerts – theuniversitiesare expected to sign a “compact” with the government. All nine institutions must reject this proposal: it is a thinly veiled attack on academic freedom; it is a test case for whether Trumpists can get away with demanding loyalty oaths; itexceeds the president’s powersto begin with; and it is bound to achieve the opposite of its stated goal of “academic excellence in higher education” (as opposed to what kind of excellence in education, one is tempted to ask).Some features of the compact might look reasonable at first sight. No one is against addressing ever-rising tuition fees (never mind that the Republican party at the same time iscappingfederal loan programs and shoveling money to high-cost private lenders). And some might welcome the Stephen Miller-lite version of xenophobia: capping the number of foreign students at 15% and forcing foreigners to take American “civics” (it is unclear who would decide the content of lessons “about how great our country is”).But the document also functions as a kind of rap sheet for institutions portrayed as single-mindedly focused on discriminating against white males. Formulations such as “signatories shall adopt policies prohibiting incitement to violence” would make one believe that, as of now, universities encourage terrorist agitators to run rampant on campus; the demand to “transform or abolish institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas” suggests that, as of now, anyone saying the wrong thing about abortion is beaten up by progressive vigilantes (never mind the question what it means to treat an idea as such “violently”).Why does the supreme court keep bending the knee to Trump? | Steven GreenhouseRead moreIt is no small irony that one of the strategists of the assault on higher education, May Mailman, charges universities with having committed to a “culture of victimhood” in aninterview with the New York Timescolumnist Ross Douthat; obviously, it is the Trumpist grievance-industrial complex which mass-produces resentment among supposed “real Americans” held down by nefarious liberal elites. For all the talk of fostering open debate, the goal appears to be the creation of safe spaces for the fragile egos of Maga students suffering from universities’ supposed culture of “negativity”.The clearest attack on academic freedom consists in the demand to ensure “a broad spectrum of viewpoints … within every field, department, school, and teaching unit”. Faculty, students “and staff at all levels” will first have to be tested for ideology; once “empirical assessments” have been completed, the diversity of viewpoints judged appropriate will have to be engineered, presumably by a bureaucracy that can also guarantee consistent viewpoints over time (for what if our new conservative colleague starts to hold different views?). In theory, the result would not just be affirmative action for the right, but forcing the economics department to employ Marxists.To be sure, some Trumpists themselves insist that the government should not be in the business of micromanaging the distribution of political attitudes. But the rejection is not a principled one centered on a proper understanding of academic freedom. It is simply the fear of setting a precedent with what they openly call “policing” and one fine day having the Democrats flood universities with leftists.As with other aspects of Donald Trump’semergingmafia state, there is no guarantee that those bending the knee will not be bullied again. The government can always come back to universities and accuse them of having violated the agreement (still too many courses in victimhood studies; still too much “violence” – as defined by bureaucrats – vis-a-vis someone’s cherished ideas). The government will also encourage donors to claim back their cash. Since the compact’s criteria are exceedingly vague, those who take the offer will probably overdo compliance.At the risk of sounding like one of those dreadful self-styled victims: universities are fragile institutions. Many American ones are excellent precisely because people trust each other and cooperate successfully without over-regulation (some Europeans can tell you what it means to be subject to constant assessments – and how a Soviet-style bureaucracy constantly distracts from research and teaching). Of course there is always plenty of academic infighting, but what the Trumpists are doing is consciously trying to create divisions by setting potential Trump administration collaborators against those determined to resist it. As has become apparent with other autocrats’ assaults on universities, even if institutions escape (sometimes literally, as they have torelocate to other countries) the worst, much damage has been done. This is why the nine universities should not only reject the compact, but also publicly explain what is wrong with it (otherwise they will be immediately charged with wanting to protect their tuition-racket, helping foreigners and “importing radicalism” to undermine American greatness).Precisely because they have been losing court cases overfree speechandvisasfor foreign students, Trumpists nowseek to entrap universities in a deal that effectively removes the protections of federal law andgives the administration arbitrary powerover them. The carrots serve to lure institutions of higher learning into a dark alley where, rather than just waiting with a big stick, the government can put a gun to their heads at any time.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionUS educationTrump administrationDonald TrumpHigher educationHigher education policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

When its governing bodies let go at last, handing the reins to the horses. When the last line holding against the sport’s self-immolating avarice collapsed and all were free to just do whatever they want. When crotchety pundits were finally right and the game was fully gone.Or maybe we’ll know precisely when it was: 6 October 2025, when the Uefa executive committeedeclared in an extraordinary releasethat it was opposed to domestic league matches being played abroad – while allowing two of them “on an exceptional basis.” Barcelona and Villarreal will stage an ostensibly domestic La Liga game in Miami in December. Milan and Como are to play a Serie A match in Perth, Australia – a mere 20-hour flight from Italy – in February.Uefa gives ‘reluctant’ approval for domestic games to be played abroad this seasonRead moreIn their statement, Uefa took pains not just to express its opposition to the measure, but also to lay the blame for it at the foot of Fifa, whose rules it said were “not clear and detailed enough” to merit a rejection. Uefa said it wants to work with Fifa to create new rules to curb league games played abroad – presumably in a way that will not run afoul of Relevent Sports, the sports promotion company whose antitrust suit got Fifa to drop its statutes. Releventdropped Fifafrom the suit without prejudice, meaning it can be reopened at any time if things aren’t to the promotion company’s satisfaction.“While it is regrettable to have to let these two games go ahead, this decision is exceptional and shall not be seen as setting a precedent,”Uefapresident Aleksander Čeferin said. It’s hard to see how that can be true. This is not how precedents work.The floodgates are open. The toothpaste has been squeezed from the tube. The foundation upon which professional soccer is built, structured primarily as a series of domestic circuits, is cracked. Any game can now theoretically be played anywhere, wherever the highest bidder happens to be. Once the Spanish league – or any league – is no longer a thing that can only be played on home soil, there is no going back.We have been on a long, unrelenting march to this place for decades. And the forces that carried the sport there were powered at least partially by American money and methods. We have to be frank about that.The La Liga president, Javier Tebas, spent more than seven years working to put a Barça league game in Miami in an effort to keep up with the Premier League – a cash-churning colossus created through the American model of sporting monetization. He and others have done this because all of soccersees the United States as an ATMwith no pin number, luring one competition after another. In this effort, Tebas was abetted by Relevent, an American promoter.Clubs will now be free to chase after revenue anywhere they can find it. People may try to get in their way on account of the sport’s – or the players’ or the fans’ – best interests, but they stand little chance of actually stopping anything with so much money at stake.Villarreal will play 18 home games this season, to every other La Liga team’s 19. Their fans will get one fewer match in their city,although they will be compensatedwith offers of free flights to Miami. Barça and Villarreal players – not to mention those of Milan and Como – will have travelled substantially more for their domestic competition than their rivals have this season. The impact of this in-season barnstorming on title races, relegation and promotion is inevitable.A great many people were clear-eyed about the ramifications downstream. Real Madrid – co-instigators ofthe failed European Super League, authors of the sport’sGalacticosera that kickstarted the financial arms race – sounded like the improbable voice of reason here.“The integrity of the competition requires that all matches be held under the same conditions for all teams,” the Spanish club wrotein a statement.“Unilaterally modifying this regime breaks the equality between contenders, compromises the legitimacy of the results and sets an unacceptable precedent that opens the door to exceptions based on interests other than strictly sporting. If this proposal is carried out, its consequences would be so serious that they would mean a before and after for the world of football.”The Spanish Professional Footballers’ Associationwas opposed as well.As wastheFootball Supporters Europegroup. So has Čeferin been, who before Monday’s announcement saidin an interview: “Football should be played in Europe, and fans should be able to watch it at home. They cannot travel to Australia or the United States to see their teams.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Moving competitions abroad isn’t innovation, it’s betrayal”.Ah well, nevertheless. Ultimately, Uefa did not make this decision alone. The leagues made it. Fifa made it by agreeing to change its policies when it wasdismissed from the Relevent lawsuit. Soccer’s professional ranks made it a long time ago, when they started playing domestic super cup competitions far afield, in China and in the Gulf and the United States.Whoever you want to blame, European soccer has now become fully Americanized, opting for unfettered capitalism, bound by no border or tradition.

But mistruths can have serious consequencesTue 7 Oct 2025 18.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 18.47 EDTShareErnest Hemingway famously said that every good writer needs a built-in BS detector. But in 2025 we all need one. High levels of scientific misinformation are threatening the wellbeing of families and our society, and the problem is worsening at an alarming rate.Artificial intelligenceand social media are turbo-charging the spread of misinformation dressed as science. Lies that once travelled slowly, and stayed relatively local, now surge across the globe.When people share mistruths – for example, about vaccines, paracetamol or clean energy – the consequences are real and sometimes tragic. Preventable diseases like measles are now returning to Australian communities because of unfounded fears about vaccines.In a world where techlords rule us by whim, Australia’s stance against deepfakes is reason to celebrate | Van BadhamRead moreMisinformation is false or misleading information. Sometimes it’s spread by people who deliberately lie about the facts; this is referred to as disinformation. And sometimes it’s spread by those who just don’t know better. Either way, it is becoming more pervasive and more corrosive at all levels.At a personal level, bad information can damage your health, lead to poor financial decisions, and undermine your ability to make informed choices. At a societal level, it erodes trust in institutions, poisons public debate, and pushes people to extremes. Ultimately, misinformation makes it harder to agree on facts, harder to work together to solve shared problems, and undermines the social cohesion and democratic resilience that Australians value.The good news? There are simple steps we can take to combat misinformation – especially if we understand why we are susceptible to it.Australia’s top science advisory body to the prime minister – the National Science and Technology Council – last year commissioned landmark reports on misinformation. As a member of that council, I look forward to their release later this year. The reports explore why individuals and communities are vulnerable to misinformation, and what can be done to build resilience.The reports show we can be vulnerable to misinformation because of the way our brains are wired. Research finds humans are naturally inclined to believe new information – especially if it’s simple, familiar, or comes from people we trust. The more we see it, the more credible it seems, even if it’s false. Poor physical or mental health can also reduce cognitive capacity, increasing susceptibility to falsehoods.When faced with large volumes of information, we often rely on mental shortcuts. While they help us process the information quickly, they can backfire – especially when the information is emotional, threatening or comes from like-minded people. We’re more likely to believe it if it aligns with our existing views or comes from someone we trust.In light of our brain’s wiring, when confronted with new information we need to pause and ask: is this the best information I can get? Would it stand up to scientific scrutiny? Did it come from someone using the scientific method – a way of rigorously testing ideas through observation, hypothesis and experiment – or just from someone I follow online?You don’t need to be a scientist to spot good science. If in doubt, look for scientific consensus – the collective agreement of experts that is based on accumulated evidence. It is built through repeated testing, peer review and open debate.Peer review – where scientists scrutinise each other’s work – helps detect and correct errors. It’s not perfect, but it’s robust. For example, early in the Covid pandemic, scientists initially underestimated the impact of airborne transmission. But peer-reviewed studies quickly corrected that understanding, leading to updated health advice. That is science working as it should.Trusting science isn’t about having blind faith in scientists. It’s trust in the scientific method: predict, test, observe, refine. Science questions everything, and while it doesn’t claim perfection, it offers the best knowledge we have at any given time. It’s not the only source of truth, but it’s a damn good one. Almost every element of modern life – including the device you’re reading this on – is built on knowledge gained through the scientific method.‘My son genuinely believed it was real’: Parents are letting little kids play with AI. Are they wrong?Read moreSorting through information in real time is hard. If we’re not confident doing that sorting alone, we’re lucky in Australia to have organisations – like the CSIRO, our universities, museums, hospitals, and health and environment departments – that can provide the best available information. We need to cherish those institutions , especially when we face significant challenges, even if the best available information evolves over time. In addition to those institutions, education and civic engagement can also play a crucial part in sandbagging our communities against a tide of falsehoods.Some BS is easy to sniff out – cancer cure scams, flat earth nonsense and evolution denial. Other misinformation is harder to detect but just as dangerous, so we must be extremely vigilant because the stakes are extremely high. Our collective wellbeing depends on our capacity to distinguish credible science from persuasive fiction. It depends on our willingness to think critically, seek reliable proof from credible sources, and keep our BS detectors switched on.Prof Tony Haymet is Australia’s chief scientistExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)Social mediaDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Then came a devastating textRanjana SrivastavaMisfortunes shouldn’t have to compete to be meaningful but a combination that fills me with dread is cancer and mental illnessTue 7 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 17.57 EDTShare“So, what do I say when they call me for surgery?”“Well, that shouldn’t happen because I will talk to them.”“But if they do?”“Don’t attend the appointment.”“Just like that?”“Yes, you wouldn’t recover well from a major operation.”“I agree, doc.”My patient, in her 60s, has two separate cancers, neither curable, both life-threatening. Keeping her well is a balancing act, hence my advice to avoid operating on one cancer at the cost of withholding treatment for the other. She also has long-term depression and has dependant relatives who are also unwell and never come with her.Misfortunes shouldn’t have to compete to be meaningful but a combination that fills me with dread is cancer and untreated mental illness.Cancer attracts significant government and philanthropic money, public sympathy and a support network deep and wide. When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, there is a clear pathway of care even though the road can be unnecessarily bumpy. Between the researchers who come up with discoveries and clinicians who use them on patients are any number of people who enrich the ecosystem: nurses, social workers, allied health and volunteers. Just last week I shared my umbrella with an octogenarian who has sat with inpatients every week for 20 years.Mental illness is the poor cousin to physical conditions. Although it is the subject of greater awareness and increased funding, as they say, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. It is difficult for people to access comprehensive care and practically impossible to receive continuity of care, arguably the most important part of recovery. In an excellent public hospital system in so many ways, I find the gap in outpatient care and support services for mental illness incomprehensible.Why do the children of elderly patients stay away? Loneliness makes them get sicker and stay sicker for longer | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThis leaves my (already disadvantaged) patients with a dual diagnosis in the invidious position of receiving the same treatment as a prince for one illness and a pauper for the other.Having emailed the surgeon and received an immediate acknowledgment, I turn to my patient.“Now that surgery is off the table, let’s talk about the rest. You need radiation for a growing lump. For this, we need to pause your other therapy.”Sensing her hesitation, I reassure her that I will personally clarify things with the many people peripherally involved in her care before consolidating her visits to one clinic and one team. At some point, as I am juggling typing and talking, she asks what “all this” means but with no time left to ascertain what she really means, I say something anodyne. She thanks me graciously and leaves.I feel self-satisfied, even a little smug at how much was achieved in our allocated 20 minutes which became 40.She had avoided major surgery that might well have proved fatal. The radiation oncologist had issued her an urgent appointment. And she had met a specialised cancer nurse who would be an ongoing help.If I had to rank the patients I helped on the day, I would put her at the top. So, the blow is especially devastating when, just hours later, I receive a text from the clerical staff.“The patient is so upset that she has asked to cancel all her appointments.”My only possible conclusion is that the patient is upset with me.An explanatory email from the patient follows. “I have nothing against the doctors, but everything is too much, and I just want to be left alone.” This only exacerbates my guilt.Then, this text from a colleague who has intuited my alarm. “I guess we will have to wait until she has a crisis.”An avoidable crisis is what every oncologist desperately works to avoid, so the patient’s decision to opt out of treatment right after meeting me strikes me as a personal failure.Thankfully, I suppress the instinct to call her. The last thing an overwrought patient needs is to be browbeaten into submission, even if it is to protect her own health.I wonder if I could have taken things even more slowly (and kept other sick patients waiting) and been more attuned to her emotions (at no additional cost).And I regret that my fervour for treating her cancer got the better of my duty to protect her mental health. But I can’t help thinking that what brought her undone was the cognitive overload of my consultation layered on top of brittle mental health never adequately addressed.When someone mentally unwell is diagnosed with a physical illness, mental healthcare should be expanded; instead, vulnerable people just grow more vulnerable.I am an oncologist. Please don’t ask me to write a business case | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreEveryone I know struggles to access timely psychological and psychiatric assistance. But in a cancer clinic where there is also a race against time, the practical reality is that people give up – both doctors and patients. If one would not expect a mental health professional to treat cancer, shouldn’t the reverse also apply?This is why every public hospital cancer service would be enriched by an embedded counsellor or psychologist. Most patients would be well served, with only those needing step-up care referred to a dedicated psychiatrist for periodic guidance. Given the ubiquity of mental illness and its many intersections with cancer, this would be money well spent.I confess my problem to a nurse who gives it a day before contacting the patient. I hate to ask how much listening and understanding it took to get there but have never been so relieved to receive a simple text.“Just confirming your patient has agreed to attend all her appointments.”Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

It’s hard believing in meritocracy, yet finding yourself polling at 15%. It’s even harder having wanged on mercilessly for decades about natural selection, yet now constantly finding yourself appearing in the same sentence as the phrase “facing extinction”.And it’s harder still to find polling guru John Curticedoing panels at your conferencein which he outlines the route back to even the same time zone as being in contention. “You’ve got to get yourself back to base camp,” Curtice explained in one mild-mannered drive-by on Sunday. “At the moment you frankly can’t even see the Himalayas.” Given the well-documented traffic issues on Everest these days, we have to face the possibility that more people have reached the summit of the world’s highest mountain this year than have joined the Conservative party.To the party’s gathering in Manchester, then, where the leadership of Kemi Badenoch continues to come off as a performance art piece entitled All Fall Down. It’s not so much a conference as one of those soap montages that signal the death of a character. By the time Robert Jenrick was on stage at midday holding up a judge’s wig like a sock puppet and promising to “take our country back” (again),20 councillors had defected to Reformsince breakfast. The conference is so mad and sad that it features an exhibition of Margaret Thatcher’s clothes, which various Tory ugly sisters and brothers have been metaphorically trying to squeeze themselves into ever since the party ousted her a full 34 years ago. After this many failed impostors, it’s just possible they should smash the glass slipper and get on the apps instead.Begging the party to swipe right – quite a bit further right – we have Jenrick, the endlessly metamorphic shadow justice secretary who’s had more eras than Taylor Swift. If you felt a seismic straining in the north-west this week, that was Jenrick desperately trying not to do an Andy Burnham and cast this conference as The Official Launch Party of a Showboy. Here, he’s been at pains to suggest, he’s just one of the team – just a humble fledgling content creator as at home in the world of short-form video as he is halfway up a lamp-post in a tight polo, carrying a six-pack of made-in-China St George flags.View image in fullscreenRobert Jenrick at the 2025 Conservative party conference.Photograph: Gary Roberts Photography/ShutterstockRegrettably – or, as far as he’s concerned, fortunately – some recorded comments of Jenrick’s from a Conservative association dinner back in March wereleaked to this newspaper, in which he lamented a visit to Handsworth in Birmingham where he “didn’t see another white face”. A few sentences further on, Jenrick stated “it’s not about the colour of your skin or your faith”, which gave Badenoch the leewayto defend himthis morning, although she did explain: “I don’t think this is where the debate should be, about how many faces people see on the street and what they look like.”I’m sure she doesn’t. Then again, Badenoch is a master of this kind of insouciantly robotic understatement, apparentlytelling a meetingof Conservative association chiefs a couple of days ago that the party’s poll ratings are “not where I want us to be”. Which reminds me that John Curtice had a few other truth bombs to drop. “The Liberal Democrat vote is now much more geographically concentrated than your vote,” he informed Tories at his conference event, “and the electoral system is now treating you like it treated the Liberal Democrats. And so although the Liberal Democrats are just behind you in the polls, they are going to almost undoubtedly win more seats than you.” Oof.It must be said this wasn’t the vibe you’d have got from shadow chancellor Mel Stride’s speech. “Let’s face it,” claimed Mel hilariously, “we’re the only party that gets it.” Nkay. Go on. “And that means we have to face some hard truths to which other parties turn a blind eye.” By way of an example, he announced the Conservatives would slash the civil service to 2016 levels. And yet, where was the hard truth – namely that the civil service has ballooned since then because of all the extra stuff it’s had to do since Brexit, the Conservative party triumph with the world’s longest list of small print?Still, there has been the odd bright spot. Unable to accept that the lethal force of the term “Boriswave” is going to permanently do for him, the undead Boris Johnson has spent recent days mounting embarrassing rearguard actions against his own policies. On Monday, he could be found popping up in frantically casual fashion to say he “went far too fast” on net zero, and that he personally “got carried away”. Of course, of course. Ever since Reformstarted saying“Boriswave” every five seconds, Johnson appears to have shed devotees at a quite alarmingly fast rate. Nigel Farage is his political Mounjaro. Even Johnson’s most devoted superfan, Nadine Dorries,has been seduced. She’ll still love him and everything, but it must be tough for Boris to face up to the fact that Nadine has defected to a party whose biggest diss literally has his name in it.Elsewhere, the Tory leadership prefers instead to suggest the party eating its lunch is touting policies that fall apart under scrutiny. As Badenoch whined this week: “Reform is saying stuff because it hasn’t thought it all through.” Well, yes. In time-honoured tradition, they are just saying some shit to get elected. Which is, let’sactuallyface it, a little something they learned from their predecessors. More than anyone else on the political spectrum, the recent iteration of the Conservative party popularised the idea that actions did not have consequences, that cake could be both had and eaten, and that there were no trade-offs on the route to what Badenoch was this weekstill calling“the sunlit uplands”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet incredibly, after having had to live through the post-2016 convulsions alongside the rest of us, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves failed to realise that their own bullshit would also not survive contact with the reality of government. As waspointed out at the time, Starmer and Reeves sought power by making ridiculous promises about what they wouldn’t have to do, either because they were hopelessly naive, or just hopeless. They are now reaping that particular whirlwind, which will reach category 5 with next month’s budget.Thus it increasingly feels as though cautionary tales are this country’s only remaining manufacturing success story.

I hope they draw strength from each otherTue 7 Oct 2025 07.06 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 07.47 EDTShareIt’s amazing how much of my life has been shaped by Crumpsall when I think about it. Which I hadn’t until last Thursday,and the horrific attack on the Heaton Park synagogue.Crumpsallis a small area of north Manchester, 1.2 sq miles with a population of 18,000. When I became seriously ill at the age of nine I was initially taken to Crumpsall hospital. When I finally went back to a special school two years later, it was Crumpsall Open Air; when I went to synagogue, it was Higher Crumpsall.For many years, I took Crumpsall for granted at best, or dismissed it. It was associated with some of the most painful parts of my life (illness) and my least favourite (religion). I preferred to talk about Cheetham Hill, less than two miles away, because it seemed cooler and more secular, though in reality it was often impossible to separate the two neighbouring areas. Ironically, and stupidly, I also preferred Cheetham Hill because it seemed more street; more dangerous.I moved away from Manchester to university in Leeds and then to London decades ago. My parents continued living in a middle-class Jewish suburb calledBroughton Park, within a mile of where they had both grown up. It seemed suffocatingly insular to me. And then when my sister and I moved away, they downsized to a home a couple of roads away. When Dad died nearly 20 years ago, Mum stayed there in her tiny house in her tiny close.For a long time I couldn’t bear going there. It felt so claustrophobic, physically and socially. I always wondered why she stayed there. However much I loved her (and believe me I adored her), I was snobbish about where she lived, and thought she deserved a bigger, better world. She was a fish out of water in the close – an observant but largely secular Jew (if that’s not a contradiction) living among a largely Hassidic community. The area had become more and more religious over the decades –or as we Jews called it, frummer and frummer.In a time of hate and rancour, two Jews sought to pray – and were killed. Let Manchester be a turning point | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreBut what did I know about smallness and insularity? In the final few years of Mum’s life, I spent more and more time in the house, both with her and without her. When she was in hospital with various ailments, I often stayed there alone while visiting her. And when she was back home recovering, I stayed there because I wanted to be with her.I began to love both the house and the community. Or should I say communities. In the decades I’d been away, more and more Muslims had moved into Crumpsall and Cheetham Hill. They did not displace Jews, they lived largely separate lives, peacefully side by side. It wasn’t just different religions, it was different degrees of religion. So ultra-frum Jews lived along frum and not-so frum Jews, and likewise ultra-frum Muslims lived alongside frum and not-so frum Muslims. Rainbows within rainbows. Far from being the shtetl that my parents’ generation thought it was, Crumpsall/Cheetham Hill was fantastically, cinematically diverse. (It really would be a wonderful location for a movie.)Of the18,000 people who live in Crumpsall, just under 10,000 are Muslim, 1,000 are Jewish and 4,000 are Christian. Inthe 2021 census, 0.5% of the English and Welsh population identified as Jewish, while 6.5% identified as Muslim. So both the Jewish and Muslims populations of Crumpsall are roughly 10 times the national average. Alongside the 4,600 residents born in the Middle East and Asia (roughly 25%), more than 1,000 came from Africa. Affluent areas bordered on some of the most impoverished in the country.There’s a Tesco about five minutes’ walk away from Mum’s old house. It’s huge and I’ve never seen a supermarket that caters for so many cultures. Mum used to wonder why I spent so much time there, or wandering along Cheetham Hill. I told her I found it inspirational – all classes, religions and races going about their business under the one grey sky. I couldn’t get over my belated discovery – that the place I’d dismissed as parochial was one of the greatest melting pots on the planet.And, five days after the terror attack, it still is. While politicians and men of God and populist journalists try to sow division in Crumpsall, while they tell us that the attack was an inevitable result of the British government’s recognition of Palestine as a state, or its refusal to clamp down on demonstrations about the genocide in Gaza, or its failure to police synagogues, it’s important to remember that this grotesque attack was an outlier. It was the actions of a single man (though others have been arrested in connection with the incident), not one community waging war on another as some would have us believe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party that embraces those things will prosperJustine Greening is a former Conservative ministerTue 7 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 13.20 EDTShareAs the existentially challenged Conservative party meets in Manchester for its annual party conference, it has much to ponder on where it goes next. It’s not even clear if there isa road forward at all. These are tough times for a party that now has little, if anything, new or unique to say to voters.It could have been so different if it had made tangible progress on an agenda that matters to people across the country:Levelling up. Yet Boris Johnson’s government hadn’t got the first clue on how to turn his zeitgeisty rhetoric on levelling up into policy reality. For the two years after the 2019 election, it debated what the term even meant.I found it bizarre, because I’d already told Johnson what levelling up meant when we first spoke about it during his leadership campaign. The phrase was language I created and used at the Department for Education to talk about social mobility. It was our departmental mantra, and its definition is clear: levelling up is the means by which we achieve equality of opportunity – not by taking opportunity away from those who already have it, but rather by extending opportunities to those that don’t. I first used the term at theConservative party conference in 2015while still international development secretary, when I was attempting to encourage the then party leadership to focus on domestic social mobility.The other key DfE phrase we used, “talent is spread evenly across our country,but opportunity is not”, again was a purposeful phrase, representing thetwo halves of a social mobility strategy. First, talent spread evenly but not developed consistently through our education system. Second, opportunities not spread evenly by businesses or our economy. Thus, education and business were key to achieving stronger social mobility. This was an agenda about the social fabric of our country – investing in people’s potential and connecting them to opportunities.Labour’s plan to revitalise high streets is good - now it has to make sure people hear about it | Morgan JonesRead moreWhat did levelling up become under Johnson’s Conservatives? Atowns fundadministered out of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). Hanging baskets and reconfigured roundabouts and roads. Awhite paper was launchednearly three years after Johnson became leader, which saw existing policy approaches rebadged under the new levelling up banner.As a result, a broader social mobility agenda went undeveloped, as well as all the reform that it might have driven – in investment, business, economic policy, tax and in place-making. And, of course, in education, including a higher education sector that has become a punchbag for politicians of all stripes – even though it remains the most powerful engine of social mobility for young working-class people, including myself, this country has had over the past 30 years. Perhaps the only engine of social mobility, operating at scale.Aspiration is crucial for our country to succeed. For people to have aspiration, there needs to be a credible sense that effort and reward are linked; that if people aspire, they can achieve. For any government, being able to instil a sense of optimism about the future is crucial.Research by the Institute for Policy Research at Bath Universityand others, published last month, showed that the DfE’s 12 “opportunity areas” I introduced as education secretary – place-based approaches to improving education outcomes – led to young people in those communities being up to 18 percentage points more optimistic about their future than those in comparable communities without these programmes in place. The evidence is clear: just making an authentic start on pro-social mobility policy can quickly and positively change how people feel about their future.Oblivious to this, and in the midst of its post-Johnson leadership contest, in September 2022, the Conservative government closed opportunity areas down. Why would anyone in those communities vote for a party that did that? The opportunity areas policy is one example of what could have been a transformative Conservative government agenda on levelling up, but that chance was hopelessly squandered. Approaches such as this can inspire hope and aspiration. In contrast, as theConservativeslearned, breaking the promise of social mobility is the costliest mistake any political party can make. Voters punished the government for its incompetence but, perhaps most of all, for its broken promises on levelling up.Now the baton on social mobility and equality of opportunity has passed to a Labour government. The levelling up rhetoric has been cast off. Labour has its own political rhetoric of “breaking down the barriers to opportunity”. The party that is steadily supplanting the hapless Conservative party, Reform UK, also has its own language – “reindustrialisation”. It’s a phrase to talk about new opportunities in communities like the one I grew up in, in South Yorkshire. It promises that an industrial past can reincarnate into an industrial future.For voters, it must feel like a Groundhog Day-style loop. Same issue, different language. But – as yet – no results.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Britain’s endemically weak social mobility remains the key issue for our country, with young people unable to get a decent career start, those working hard in full-time jobs with little to show after the rent has been paid, and people across the country without any real hope their children will be able to do any better in life than they have.Politicians can talk about fairer opportunities however much they like. But where is the party that has the comprehensive policy agenda on social mobility? I see none. Whoever gets there first, wins. Not just for themselves, but, more importantly, for a whole country that has never needed equality of opportunity so badly.Justine Greening is a former Conservative minister and was MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019Explore more on these topicsSocial exclusionOpinionPovertyCommunitiesConservativesLabourReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

He asked me to check on his mother, who at that time was hospitalised in East Jerusalem. He had been unable to contact her for several days. When I asked him for her details, he stopped replying.A month ago, out of the blue, I got a message from him: “Hello Orly,” in Arabic. Excited, I asked how he was, where he was, and how his family were doing. The reply I received was: “Mahmoud was killed at the beginning of the war, this is his sister.” I wrote words of condolence and asked about her condition. I heard nothing more.It is extremely hard to put into words the unprecedented hell these past two years have brought, but perhaps the single word that best captures their indescribable essence is this: disappearance.It feels as if everything has vanished. Not only thetens of thousands ofPalestinians in Gaza erased without graves, without records, as if they had never existed – so many other things have been hollowed out: basic conceptions of morality, decency, compassion, humanity, hope, future.The organising logic of everyday life has vanished. Nothing makes sense, and it feels as though no one here even expects sense any more. A war whose declared aims were the return of hostages and the dismantling of Hamas has, under the cover of a vague promise of “total victory”, turned intofull-scale genocide. Israeli society has embraced it – terrified and enthralled at once by a taboo finally permitted to be broken, and by the possibility of openly dreaming about the total disappearance of Palestinians.Two years ago, days after the massacre of 7 October,I warnedof revenge that would achieve nothing but yet more violence and suffering. I feared the unbridled Israeli response I knew would follow, but even in my worst nightmares I did not imagine it could amount to such systematic, calculated annihilation. I did not believe Israel would reach the point ofstarving people to death. I did not believe it would, on average, erase a classroom of children every single day for two whole years. Nor did I believe the world would permit Israel to do all this – a perverse, inverted antisemitism that effectively says: the rules of humanity do not apply to this Jewish collective.Very abnormal things were normalised here in these two years. Debates erupted over whether the bloated-bellied Gazan children had truly died of starvation, or whether they had pre-existing conditions and thereforeIsraelhad no hand in their deaths; the conversion of a hilltop lookout in the Israeli border town of Sderot into a popular tourist spot for Israelis who came to watch, with a grim pleasure, the mushrooming plumes of smoke over Gaza.A dizzying cognitive dissonance gripped Israeli society: even after it became beyond doubt that destroying Gaza and its population would not bring the hostages back and in fact endangered them – as every released hostage testified – and even after it was proved that the only way to bring them back alive was through agreements and a ceasefire, it took a very long time before demonstrations for the hostages also included calls for an end to the war. And even then, almost no one dared speak of the crimes against humanity the Israeli army was committing, and there was no mass movement of conscientious objectors among soldiers refusing to take part in those crimes.Since 7 October, the media, too, has disappeared, in the sense of what media ought to be. Apart from a few pockets at the margins, the Israeli presspurposefully hidthe horrors in Gaza so that throughout the war, a random citizen almost anywhere else in the world has known more about what has been happening in the strip than the average Israeli. And even when images circulated on social media, people lacked the most basic tools to understand what they were seeing. Thus, while the world recoiled at Israel’s starvation of Gaza and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, in Israel the state was lauded for its generosity in allowing any aid trucks into “the enemy” during wartime.The Jewish opposition disappeared as well. Politicians who had built whole careers on opposing Benjamin Netanyahu closed ranks behind him when it came to the eradication of Palestinians in Gaza, and to every dangerous and senseless Israeli strike on a series of states across the Middle East. This madness reached its apex in the opposition’s enthusiastic support forbombing a Hamas delegation in Doha– a delegation meant to negotiate the fate of Israeli hostages in Gaza – even as each of these politicians wore on their lapels a pin professing solidarity with the hostages for two long years. Any real opposition to the war was brutally silenced from day one by the police, under Itamar Ben-Gvir’s command. Palestinian leaders were arrested simply for intending to hold rallies against the war. Hundreds of Arab citizens were detained or removed from their jobs forshowing solidaritywith Gaza’s residents.Jews who opposed the war were vilified as traitorous and as “self-hating Jews”, including by former peace-camp partners. With a broken heart I watched those former comrades “come to their senses” after 7 October and foster violent, hateful discourse against Palestinians in Gaza, Palestinians as a whole and Islam. Here is another thing that disappeared in these two years: so many personal bonds, including with close friends and immediate family members.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it’s a fantasy | Roy SchwartzRead moreOn a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum a few weeks ago, I was struck by how familiar the photos looked, although in terms of devastation, Gaza looks far worse than Hiroshima after the atomic bomb – which did not pulverise kilometres of standing structure. In Hiroshima, the bomb took between 90,000 and 140,000 lives. In Gaza, some estimates already top100,000, and the final figure when the dust settles will be unknown.One photograph especially caught my eye at the museum:Human Shadow Etched in Stone, the shadow of a person who was apparently sitting at the entrance to a bank when the bomb dropped, the only thing left being the imprint of their shadow on the steps. Perhaps that is always what great horrors become: the absence they leave behind. So in Gaza, and in a deeply different way, so in Israel too.I do not know if, or what, will grow out of the void created by two years of destruction and death that are not yet over. It is too early to tell. One thing can be said: no growth is possible until we look into that void, that absence, that abyss, and internalise its dimensions and bring this madness to an end.Orly Noy is a journalist and editor at the Hebrew-language news magazine Local CallDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It won’t come from Badenoch – it may come from a new generation of one-nationersTue 7 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 09.21 EDTShareBritain needs the Conservative party. That’s a line I never expected to write. For most of my life under their fiefdom, the “natural party of government” has commanded the media, business and political donations. It has presided, especially since the 1980s, over capital supremacy at the expense of labour, sky-high inequality, public service degradation and me-first individualism.So it should be a joy to read its obituary everywhere, as it apparently faces “oblivion”, “the abyss” and “extinction”. The prospect of Britain without a Tory party is hard to grasp. But we may miss them if they are replaced with something worse. The next iteration of the right risks being the Trumpist, foreigner-persecuting world of Nigel Farage andTommy Robinson. Kemi Badenoch’s opening conference speech walked her party further along that plank: mimicking his policies, she makes Faragism respectable, a small step for Danny Kruger defectors.Polling at 16%, its membership has fallen below the soaring Greens, suggests Prof Tim Bale, expert on conservatism. Tory voters under 50 are rarer than red squirrels, less educated older voters their last domain, says Bale. Tories, in one form or another, have never placed less than second in a parliamentary election since the reign of William of Orange. No wonder their demise feels so astonishing.They could still save their skin, butBadenoch chooses the annihilation path. She dives after Robert Jenrick, who apes Reform UK. No centre-right parties chasing after far-right populists have ever succeeded, warns Prof Robert Ford, a political scientist at Manchester University. None. They get devoured by those they mimic. Committing to leaving the European convention on human rights and abolishing the Climate Change Act, she actively repels lost Tory voters. “She swims against the tide of opinion,” warns Bale. Why? She is attempting to woo the traditional Tory media – the Sun, Telegraph, Mail, Express – as they shift towards Reform.She ignores the more than a third of remainers who used to be Tories, horrified by her Brexit reprise in leaving the ECHR: it risks ripping up the EU trade deal and Good Friday agreement, deepening the defence and political rift with Europe. Same story on abolishing the Climate Change Act, with its net zero target, enacted by Theresa May,who is appalledat Badenoch’s “catastrophic mistake”. A majority of 2024 Tories worry about the climate. An alliance with Reform might save some Tory seats, but delivering a Reform-led government would finish off her party. Here’s a problem: if she increases the Tory vote with a few points reclaimed from Reform, that now helps Labour.She ends any pretence of a broad church, more a one-pew confessional. An immigration“removals force”, modeled on Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), would seize 150,000 people a year, including those with decades of indefinite right to remain. Even supporters would be shocked to see people who have been legally residing for years in their neighbourhood or workplace – the corner-shop owner or GP nurse – dragged away by force.What a curiosity to watch this self-destruction. What began with Brexit infiltrators, John Major’s “bastards” taking over the party, ends with its remnants becoming more extreme. Anyone (but them) can see the gaping vacancy in British politics where traditional conservatism used to be. That yawning space belongs to one-nationers – moderate, socially liberal, pro-business, pro-Europe, pro-competence, aiming at low taxes and a smaller state, but only where pragmatically possible. Where are they now? Outside active politics: the expelled Dominic Grieve stays out of the party, the expelled David Gaukehas just rejoined, suspecting the computer accepted him unknowingly. Inside, the MP Karen Bradley is one who speaks openly to me of the need for that “grownup” party of old.Michael Heseltine shows the Tories’ theirmoral duty to fight off Faragewith a rallying roar in the Observer: “The rightwing equivalents to the fascists of the 1930s are back on the march.” And later, “to describe [asylum seekers] as thieves or rapists … encourages the worst sort of prejudice.” He excoriates leaving the ECHR and abandoning climate change laws. But he’s still a Tory, with “no faith” in Labour’s ability to rebuild the economy. “We must make clear that we will never have any part in the populist extremism of Nigel Farage.” Badenoch only attacks Reform’s incompetence, drawing no moral red lines.Some one-nationers survive inside this regime, keeping their heads down. I talked to a few, who don’t want to be quoted: Badenoch banned all sectarian groups. The Tory Reform Group exists, just; One Nation hardly breathes. The groupNext Gen Toriesare the young ones tugging centre-wards, demanding an increase in housebuilding, championed byDavid Willetts, whose pioneering book The Pinchaccuses the old of stealing the futures of the young. But bare-knuckle fighting was never in One Nation’s DNA: it should be now.For a pin-prick of light, meet Cody Butler, a possible signpost. A 20-year-old student, he has just formed the One Nation Conservative Network. Not one of those camp young fogeys with a kitsch obsession with the Iron Lady, he’s well versed in Tory history, seeking a return to Macmillanism, marking Thatcher as the point when it all went wrong. He’s the right age to help shape a credible revival a decade ahead. What would it take?No point in a new leader without a turn to Heseltinian conservatism to fight off Farage, and Tommy Robinson thuggery. Oppositions do influence governments: no sooner had Starmer raised spirits with his moral indignation for “the battle for the country’s soul” than his home secretary clamped down on migrants with leave to remain in a Badenoch-lite style. A better brand of conservatism would do the country good; the alternative is terrifying. But it may be too late and the party too far gone, about to be eaten alive by Farage.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochReform UKConservative conferenceTommy RobinsonLabourMichael HeseltinecommentShareReuse this content"

I hoped Israeli leaders would come to realise the futility of protecting their country by building walls, however impregnable.Instead, the attack did the opposite. It led to a war of revenge that has now lasted for close to two years, killing more than 65,000 Palestinians and causing the widespread devastation ofGaza, including destroying 92% of its residential buildings. Initially, I was shocked by this, and the dehumanisation of the people of Gaza which immediately came from Israeli leaders – Yoav Gallant, who was defence minister at the time of the attack, justified the war by declaring: “We are fighting human animals and are acting accordingly.”I should not have been surprised. For many years, the army has been using similar tactics and language against Palestinians. In April 1983, the Israeli army chief of staff Rafael Eitan likened Palestinians in the West Bank to “drugged cockroaches in a bottle”. Throughout the years of Israeli occupation, house demolitions have also been used as a supposed deterrence as well as shooting innocent people caught in army raids. The walls and checkpoints restricting contact between Israelis and Palestinians pushed the two sides further apart, making it possible to demonise each other even further. Even the ethnic cleansing which Israel is attempting in Gaza is not without precedent. In the 1948 Palestine war, more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs were expelled or fled from their homes, and Israel’s military carried out dozens of massacres targeting them.Yet the intensity of the atrocities committed by the Israeli army in Gaza since 7 October has been on a different scale to anything that has happened previously. On the West Bank, we have no previous experience of what it would mean to live next to a statecommitting genocideagainst our people and the widespread tolerance of the Israeli people of these actions. We watch in horror what is taking place in Gaza, and also with trepidation. We wonder when our turn will come for the kind of attacks from the air that Gaza has been subjected to.Confined as we are by hundreds of checkpoints and gates to our small enclave of Ramallah, we have been subjected to repeated attacks by Israeli settlers and the army inside the city itself, which, according to the Oslo accords of 1995, is supposed to be under the full control of the Palestinian Authority and its security force.It is a constant source of pain to witness more of our land being colonised. The hills around Ramallah are becoming more militarised, with settlers’ outposts being built on high grounds and masked settlers brandishing machine guns roaming the hills, ready to attack anyone daring to take a walk. The sense of danger when venturing to these areas has been heightened.In August this year, the head of the Israeli army’s central command, Avi Bluth, ordered the felling of around 3,000 olive trees in the village of Al-Mughayyir, in Ramallah, which would have soon been ripe for the autumn harvest. For decades the Israeli military has uprooted olive trees – an important cultural symbol and source of income for Palestinians. The justification for this felling was the claim that the trees posed a “security threat” to a main Israeli settlement road that runs through the village lands. And this week, with the start of the olive-picking season, settler attacks are beginning –as happened last Friday in the village of Farkhasouth-west of the city of Salfit.Soldiers also imposed a siege on Al-Mughayyir and stormed homes there. Bluth explained: “The first mission is to hunt [the assailant] … The second is to carry out shaping operations here, and to ensure that everyone is deterred – not only this village, but every village that tries to raise a hand against the residents [settlers].”View image in fullscreenA Palestinian man inspects olive trees reportedly uprooted by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank village of Al-Mughayyir, 24 August 2025.Photograph: Zain Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the past, when confronted with such human rights violations our hope was that we could win some reprieve through the efforts of Al-Haq, the organisation I helped establish 45 years ago. I could never have imagined that it would be sanctioned and prevented from providing the services to our community. We Palestinian have always expected disproportionate repression to our efforts to secure our rights. But the brazenness of this move, combined with its dramatic implications for those in Europe and the United States standing with us, should be a wake-up call for everyone.I never expected that it would be destroyed by none other than the one-time champion of human rights, the United States of America. It had long been an ambition of mine that the organisation would find a route to prosecuting Israel for its violations. I could not have predicted thathelping the international criminal courtwould be deemed a fatal offence .In August, the Israeli government gave final approval for the controversialE1 extensionof a settlement project which would effectively fragment Palestinian lands, link thousands of illegal settlements in occupied East Jerusalem to the Ma’ale Adumim settlement bloc, and undermine the viability of a future Palestinian state by ending any chance of a contiguous Palestinian territory.The international community’s response has been mixed. Citizens in European countries are realising that, should Israel continue to get away with its repeated infringement of international law, this would contribute to the destruction of the rules-based world order. This has motivated many protest groups to indicate their opposition to Israel’s policies against Palestinians. Most recently, hundreds of activists from 44 countries were intercepted on theFreedom Flotillaafter setting sail with the intention of breaking the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and delivering aid. However, even with more citizens taking action, their governments remain lethargic, pronouncing tepid criticism of Israel’s actions while continuing to support the state’s war effort.Yet, despite this disappointing institutional response, the war in Gaza has led to significant changes in the way Israel is perceived worldwide. The fact that the country came into being through the violent displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 Nakba has become better understood. So many misconceptions about Israel’s foundation propagated over the past 77 years are being exposed. This has also led to a significant shift in willingness to platform Palestinian voices in spaces which were closed to them in the past.Following Donald Trump’s proposed “Gaza peace plan”, Hamas has approved the release of all “prisoners of the occupation” and signalled its “readiness to enter into negotiations”. Consequently, Trump has ordered Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza. If the war were to end and the siege on Gaza were to be lifted, Palestinians have the expertise to rebuild their country. They have the engineers, workers and technicians with decades of experience of working under siege. If they are given access to machinery they could rebuild faster than any external contractor.There is no doubt about the Israeli army’s fighting capabilities. But Israel must choose between perpetual war or living in peace. This can only happen if the country recognises Palestinian self-determination – a prospect that, at present, seems remote. At the culmination of this war, Israel might end up destroying Gaza, but it will also destroy itself.Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian lawyer and writer, and founder of the human rights organisation Al-Haq.

Let’s learn from that moment of graceSharone Lifschitz is a London-based film-maker and academic whose parents were taken hostage on 7 OctoberTue 7 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 04.33 EDTShareSo much about the past two years has been horrific, but let me tell you how it began for me. On the morning of 7 October 2023, I was sitting on a train with my son and husband on our much anticipated way to pick up a new puppy. Life seemed predictable enough.I open my phone and see that something is happening on the Gaza-Israel border. I call my mum as usual, waiting to hear her cheery, relaxed voice telling me that she is in the safe room with Dad, telling me there is nothing to worry about. She doesn’t answer. Neither does my dad. I look again at the news feed. I call my brother and he answers. His voice is so different, altered, that I know already, before he tells me, that the worst has happened. “Terrorists broke into the kibbutz,” he says. “Dad said in his last call that he can hear Arabic. Soon after that, we lost him.”I have seen so many people on the news whose life was upended. Their eyes letting you know they have not yet understood what they have lost. Now it is me, us. The flood is in full motion, and the debris has yet to settle. Maybe everything will be OK in a moment, maybe the damage can be contained.My son is looking at me above his laptop. I move to a different seat so I can call people. By the time we arrive in York I will see the brutal execution of my childhood carer Bracha Levinson, now almost 80 years old, as it was livestreamed on her Facebook page by the terrorists who seized her house. Then I see the reporter Muthana Al-Najjarcovering the Hamas takeover of Nir Oz(I still cannot believe that a journalist was attached to the terrorists, his coverage then legitimised, quoted and shown by major media outlets), standing 100 metres from my parents’ home saying “we were able to enter a kibbutz; the most important kibbutz of the occupation”. I recognise the turn in the road and the lamp-post. Around him are armed terrorists. There is the sound of fire; on the screen, the mood is of ecstasy.I remember thinking: “Not one of our loved ones will survive.” At some point I saw the footage from the terrorists’ camera showing fire bursting from the windows of our home. Even so, days later I will still not believe that the house was burned down. Not until my brothers send me images and footage.By the time we reached York, I called the dog breeder to say I would not be coming for the puppy. I said: “A war has started. My parents are probably dead. My community has been taken over by terrorists.”I remember sitting on the train home, trying to contact people and find out where my friends and family were, while also trying to moderate what my son was seeing and being told. The images of that day were beyond anything any of us could have imagined. Our neighbour’s 12-year-old son, Erez, being taken by several terrorists; my maths teacher, Margalit Moses, driven on a golf cart in the direction of Gaza.People were sending Telegram videos that seemed impossible. One of my mother’s friends, 86-year-old Yaffa Adar, being taken to Gaza, also on a golf cart. A video – also taken by Al-Najjar – of my friend’s daughter Shiri Bibas and her two little sons, with whom I had played a couple of months previously, being rounded up by several armed terrorists, the fear in her eyes paralysing. I think those images were designed to break and terrorise those of us who were not there.It seemed to take for ever for the Israeli army to arrive. Then began the agonising wait for information. Later in the afternoon there came a single image of a group of survivors. My mother and father were not in it. A message came from my sister-in-law: they could not find my parents.For days and weeks afterward, as members of the community I grew up in helped forensic teams collect and identify the bodies, we scoured the internet for traces of our loved ones. We saw torture and mutilation; we saw the horrified faces of those we loved. We never found any footage of my father; we have no visual clue to what he thought, felt, experienced.Over the following days, the picture slowly became clearer. My elderly parents, Yocheved and Oded Lifschitz, were taken hostage from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz with 74 other members of our community. My father was 83, my mother 85. In the chaos and terror of that day, one in four members of our small community was murdered or abducted. Seventeen days later, my mother emerged fromHamascaptivity. Before being taken away by the Red Cross, she turned back and shook the hand of her captor. “Shalom,” she said. The image was broadcast around the world: a simple, human gesture in the midst of unimaginable horror. Five hundred and two days later, my father’s remains were returned. He was killed in Khan Younis, Gaza, just two miles from our home.These events and their mediation through the footage taken by the Hamas terrorists that day terrorise me and have inflicted a deep wound. All that has taken place in the two years since, our desperate campaign to save our hostages, my father’s horrific end,the war, the devastation of Gaza, has compounded it. Both my parents were peace activists all their lives. My mum still is, as are most of my family. We know that hate and revenge cannot bring even a momentary relief from the pain.I am writing this through my tears. As time passes, talking about the events become harder, not easier. The children of my friends are still held hostage and the weight of what followed is heavy. To myself I call dwelling in what happened “swimming in the trauma”. We are used to telling the story in order to campaign for the release of the hostages, mourning is a privilege we cannot afford,and two years on, our campaign continues.Not one word of this is written as justification for the war between the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas. I have been consistently against it from the beginning. The people of Gaza have suffered beyond imagination. I am horrified by the decisions of the Israeli government, but I am also insistent that Hamas is not some benign agent of resistance. Because I know what they did that day. Hamas betrayed its own people – they ensured the suffering of them along with the suffering of us, who lost so much because of its murderous ideology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My UK community is facing unprecedented antisemitism, and my community in Israel has fought its government for two years and has been betrayed again and again. Across the fields from my destroyed kibbutz, the devastation in Gaza is visible and visceral. It horrifies me. At the same time, the moral carte blanche so many former friends and colleagues seem to afford Hamas and Islamic Jihad makes me despair.Yet, I am humbled and encouraged by the faith in humanity I still see in freed hostages like my mum, and in my friend Galit Dan, whose daughter Noya and mother Carmela were brutally murdered holding each other. I cherish new and old friendships across the divide with Palestinians who, like me, want a long-term agreement. They are able to show empathy towards me in a way many British self-proclaimed friends of the Palestinians cannot. For too many of the latter, it seems a zero-sum game in which one side should win and the other must lose. For us, the wish is for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians .In the past two years, hate seems to be in fashion. I hear death chants at Glastonbury and see posters saying “destroy Israel” at San Fermín. From Hamas to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, people are shouting, “May your village burn.” And I think: my village did burn. Are these chants the best we can wish for one another?Then there is my mother’s handshake, that moment of impossible grace, that instinct for making peace that has touched so many. There are many of us that long to build bridges. It takes two to make peace, my mum reminds me time and again. We made peace with the Germans, she adds and we will make peace with the Palestinians. Sometimes I find it hard to believe her. The algorithm is so set on rewarding our craving for hate. Compassion seems slippery in comparison.Today marks two years since that day. Sixty-four members of my kibbutz were murdered then or afterwards, in captivity. Forty-eight hostages remain in a devastated Gaza. We are told there may soon be a deal. I cannot bring myself to imagine it. Too many times we have been told it was about to happen, only for hope to dissolve again. May we find in ourselves the strength to end this war for all our sakes.Sharone Lifschitz is a London based film-maker and academic, originally from Kibbutz Nir Oz, whose parents were taken hostage on 7 OctoberDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Still, his backdrops are fabulous – usually more interesting than his subjectsCharlotte JansenTue 7 Oct 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 19.03 EDTShareAt the entrance to the National Portrait Gallery’s new Cecil Beaton exhibition, there’s a wall-sized reproduction of a 1948 colour transparency, originally printed in Vogue. In it, eight coiffed white women wear elegant evening gowns by designer Charles James, chatting and preening in an 18th-century style French-panelled room. They engage only with each other, uninterested in the camera, looming larger-than-life above us. The effect on the viewer is of being excluded, unseen. This feeling only mounts as you proceed through Cecil Beaton’s Fashionable World, a show that presents the photographer as a sharp-tongued socialite obsessed with high society, beauty – and himself.Beaton’s first exhibition at the NPG was in 1968. It was then the first ever solo show by a photographer at a British museum. Sixteen surviving silver gelatin prints from it are presented in the show’s first room. They are lavish, theatrical portraits of brooding beauties with dark-painted lips, a swansong to the age of elegance.He photographed Greta Garbo dressed like a clown. She thought it was a private shoot, but the picture ended up in VogueBeaton was known as the “King of Vogue” – he worked for the magazine for almost half a century, but was also a very willing subject himself. The exhibition includes an edifying caricature of him by Anthony Wysard and photographs by Dorothy Wilding and Francis Goodman. Each shows his panache as a performer – he never plays the same character twice. As soon as he had the right kit for it, he started to take self-portraits, though you can never be sure which pose represents the real Beaton. The wall text points to a telling diary entry he wrote as a child: “I don’t want people to know me as I really am, but as I am trying and pretending to be.”View image in fullscreenA very willing subject … Cecil Beaton, c 1935.Photograph: The Cecil Beaton Studio Archive,This made him a good fashion photographer, but not a good portraitist. The expressions of his sitters are flat, the poses repetitive. Beaton’s backdrops are often more interesting than his subject – he experiments with foils, fabrics and fresh flowers, adding different transparencies and textures to the image. This understanding of textiles made him a great success as a costume designer, from the clothes he made for his little sister for a ball to his Oscar-winning creations forMy Fair Lady, which end the exhibition.The show includes a segue into a small selection of Beaton’s war photography. His photograph of a three-year-old blitz victim sitting in a hospital, head bandaged and clutching a doll, appeared on the cover of Time magazine and became world-famous. Yet some other pictures seem to aestheticise conflict – soldiers have smouldering stares like models in a fashion shoot. They are shown in a room next to glossy portraits of smiling Royals – another frequent subject.It is uncomfortable to see how narrow Beaton’s idea of beauty was, especially when you remember the notorious incident in which he included an antisemitic slur (so small that a magnifying glass had to be used to see it) in a cartoon he drew for Vogue. I am drawn to a 1929 picture of the Chinese American actor Anna May Wong, in which she poses laconically, while Beaton brings all his romance and photographic technique to the image, to scintillating effect. The portrait stands out for its beauty but also because Wong is the only woman of colour I see in the exhibition, which has more than 200 works. It’s a reflection of the times, but also where Beaton was looking and what he was interested in – white women with classical, slightly masculine Edwardian features. His work wasn’t about representation, but the artificiality of it all becomes wearying.View image in fullscreenEven his wartime soldiers look like fashion models … Aircraft Recognition Room, 1941.Photograph: The Cecil Beaton Studio Studio AOne of Beaton’s first subjects outside his family was the late historian Steven Runciman. They met at Cambridge after Beaton accidentally set fire to a passerby’s straw hat, when he chucked a cigarette out of the window. Beaton described Runciman as “huge and ugly and strong”. But in the picture, he seems pensive, shy, a young man holding a flower. Beaton saw something else in him. It’s one of the few moments of emotional depth in the show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionCecil Beaton’s Fashionable World raises more questions about the man who made the images than the evolution of fashion photography – and there’s certainly plenty of dirt on Beaton, much of it drawing on the often vicious accounts of events he recorded in the diaries he kept throughout his life. It all gets borderline stalkerish in the scrapbooks he kept on Greta Garbo, with whom he had an on-off romance. He once photographed her dressed like a clown in a ruff – and though she thought it was a private shoot, the picture ended up in Vogue. There seems to have been few limits to what Beaton would do to climb the social ranks – he even tried to have his family home’s postcode changed to W1.It seems difficult to get away from Beaton at the moment. Another show on him atLondon’s Garden Museumhas only recently closed. Fantasy and frolics are fine but A Fashionable World is pat, reinforcing a very English idea of beauty and fashion that now seems constricted and parochial. It might be Beaton’s world, but I’m glad I don’t have to live in it.Cecil Beaton’s Fashionable World is at theNational Portrait Gallery, London, from 9 October to 11 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArt and designCecil BeatonExhibitionsNational Portrait GalleryPhotographyMy Fair LadyreviewsShareReuse this content"

So why did the German artist want to postpone his new show?Tue 7 Oct 2025 12.25 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareAndreas Gursky started out shooting mostly black and white landscapes on a handheld camera, but in the 1990s he switched, taking the pictures that he has now become famous for. Out went analogue and in came epic panoramas that were digitally stitched together, capturing in intricate detail and colour stock exchanges, factories, Amazon warehouses, 99 cent stores, Olympic skiers and the crowd at a Madonna concert.“My works,” he recalls, “were selling for more and more.” In fact, his rising status in the art world was reflected in his photographs inside Prada and Gucci stores – the former was taken while he was waiting for his wife, who was shopping there. Then, in 2011, Gursky’s 1999 colour photograph Rhein II, a horizontal vista of the river flowing across flat fields near Dusseldorf, stunned auctioneers when it fetched $4.3m (£2.7m), almost double its estimate, making itthe most expensive photograph ever sold. “How do you deal with a thing like that?” he says. Rhein II held that record until 2022, when it was overtaken by Man Ray’s surrealist masterpiece Le Violin d’Ingres, which went for $12.4 million.Angela Merkel didn’t want to be shot from behind. I guess it wasn’t a very charming offerGursky’s huge works are incredibly complex, often taking several years to complete. On average, he finishes three a year. He makes them by taking a series of pictures, sometimes at different locations, then suturing the parts he feels fit together into one single, impossible image. Given their ambition, their complexity and their scale, Gursky’s pictures have been likened to paintings. The scale is crucial: “They’re really done as big as I can,” he says. “You can’t get bigger technically.” People may not realise how much effort goes into making them – does that bother him? He shrugs.View image in fullscreen‘How do you deal with a thing like that?’ … Gursky with Rhein II, then the world’s most expensive photograph.Photograph: Joerg Koch/DDP/AFP/Getty ImagesWe are speaking via Zoom but a week later we meet at White Cube Mason’s Yard in London, where he is installing his new exhibition. There is an entourage of technicians and assistants buzzing around. Although the exhibition includes just 16 pieces, Gursky says: “I don’t think I’ve ever presented such different types of work.”It was all planned this way, though. The show features Gas Cooker, one of his earliest works. Dating from 1980, the shot gives a slightly elevated view of the hob at his student flatshare, its three rings eerily illuminated. Another image shows German activists in trees protesting against the destruction of a village, their sign in German saying: “The view from here is shit.”There’s a new, melancholic image of a glowing steel ingot, a swansong to the Rhine’s precarious steel industry. And then there’s one of Gursky’s first iPhone pictures, a playful diptych of his wife at home adding a block to a tower of Jenga, with a box on her head. In short, this show reveals other sides to the German artist, more tender, intimate and spontaneous – quite a contrast to the distant observer, the mass-scale creator.I was under huge pressure to create for the exhibition – then an image fell into my lapA few months ago, he called gallerist Jay Joplin and asked to postpone the show. “He said, ‘No way, no deal – I’ve given you the best date in the whole year. You have to cope and get it done.’” So he made 10 new pictures for the show. “That’s a lot for the way I work.”For someone who has spent most of his career meticulously constructing images that couldn’t exist, Gursky, now 70, seems to take delight in the simplicity of the iPhone. The exhibition includes several smaller-scale, more diaristic snapshots, from a newborn family member to a folded towel fallen into a bath. Shot from above, the towel seems suspended in space, with bubbles of water around its still folded form. Get up close and you can see the pixels fuzzing at the edges.View image in fullscreenA swansong to industry … a glowing steel ingot in Thyssenkrupp, Duisburg, 2025.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeIt sounds like the kind of thing only a hugely famous artist could get away with. But it underlines what Gursky has always been interested in: how we see the world in photographic fragments. “The towel fell into the bathtub by mistake,” he says. “Underwater, it looked like magical realism. I just loved the way it looked. I was under huge pressure to create for the exhibition, then an image fell into my lap. I pressed click and there it was.”The towel appears next to another new image: a remake of a quintessential work made in 1993. He says the new shot is better. It depicts an apartment building with 1,122 windows in Paris. The new version consists of several pictures taken in winter, meaning the sun wasn’t too glaring and the curtains were mostly open, allowing dozens of tiny vignettes into people’s lives. As you move closer, more and more details emerge – you could spend hours looking at it. But move back and it’s a gorgeously rich abstract expressionist piece, a composition of squares, from black to pastel-coloured.“It’s about the inner life of the building,” he says. “It’s a panopticon of habits, tastes, and how people like to furnish their flats.” It’s also a paradox of an image – the picture gives a view of almost the whole building, which would be impossible to see in reality. It is the result of a series of photographs of segments of the building, shot from the hotel opposite then spliced together.View image in fullscreenShame about the view … protestors in Lüzerath, 2023.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeSide by side, the two pictures show how far-ranging Gursky’s interests and influences are. Another new work is sure to cause a bit of excitement: a picture of a famous English pop star. He won’t reveal who, although they met through Joplin. The musician was a fan of Gursky while the photographer, in turn, had “never heard of him”. Still, they became friends and Gursky accompanied the star on tour. The picture is taken from behind the musician as he performs in a glittering Gucci ensemble. Beyond is the stadium crowd, a sea of shimmering, cheering, screaming faces and iPhones. Gursky once asked Angela Merkel if he could shoot an image from a similar vantage point but the former German chancellor refused. “I guess,” he says, “it wasn’t a very charming offer – to photograph her from behind.”When we speak via Zoom, Gursky remembers an evening he spent in the pub with his then fellow studentThomas Ruff, when both were at the fabled Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. A respected German art dealer walked up to them and declared: “You guys are going to be famous!” Gursky says: “At the time, I couldn’t have imagined I would become an artist and that I would exclusively devote my life to photography.”View image in fullscreenKomori by Gursky, which features in the show.Photograph: © Andreas Gursky / DACS 2025. Courtesy White CubeGursky speaks from his vast, bright studio in Düsseldorf, where he has been based since those 1980s student days. He shares the building, a former electricity factory, with Ruff, as well as artists Laurenz Berges and Axel Hütte. The building has been transformed over the decades they’ve been there by architectsHerzog & de Meuron, who designed Tate Modern in London. There’s now a gallery there that houses some of Gursky’s art collection. “It’s mostly German artists from the Rhineland area,” he says.Gursky is one of the world’s most feted photographic artists. You could almost say his success seems preordained: his grandfather Hans and his father Willy were both successful commercial photographers who trained him in the techniques of advertising photography from a young age. When he got to art school, he says, “I have to admit there were advantages. I was very familiar with the technique – but it was also an enormous disadvantage, as I was shaped by the aesthetics of advertising photography. I had to lose that along the way, somehow.”At the Kunstakademie, he studied under Bernd Becher, one half of the hugely influentialhusband and wife duocredited with kickstarting the Düsseldorf school of photography – the biggest art movement in Germany since Bauhaus. The Bechers encouraged their students to bring a detached, dispassionate perspective to documentary photography; a bleak view of postwar Germany’s faltering industrial landscapes and architecture.“We worked at their place,” he recalls. “There were only six of us in the class, so it was very intimate and intense.” They taught Gursky and his cohorts “how to see – and you do that best if you concentrate on one subject in depth”. His time with the Bechers “led decisively to me deciding to become an artist – just seeing the way the two of them worked and what could be done with photography.”The White Cube exhibition is a testament to Gursky’s very particular way of seeing: seismographic, at times deadpan, and never short of awe. In a world flooded with thoughtless photographs quickly forgotten, everything hanging in this gallery was made for a reason. “Content plays a big role,” he says. “But it’s only after I have taken a photograph that I really discover what an image is about. I ask myself, ‘Is it relevant for society – or is it just formalism?’” And if it’s the latter, what does he do? “Then I delete it,” he says.Andreas Gursky is atWhite Cube Mason’s Yard, London, from 11 October to 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsAndreas GurskyPhotographyExhibitionsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Wasn’t that a genre that had peopleabuzzback in the 00s? Its revival by the British Museum’sprints and drawings departmentas a title for an exhibition of modern and contemporary Scandinavian graphic art seems desperate. Forget our oldies like Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci – we’re all about new stuff by hot young Scandi artists! Maybe it’s understandable; after all theNational Gallery is also moving in on modern art. But Nordic Noir shows just how far overeager neophilia can go wrong. A museum that specialises in history has gone fishing in contemporary waters and, like a lonely angler on an Arctic lake, has come up with absolutely nothing.The big surprise is that most of the works here are not on loan. TheBritish Museumowns them. It has “acquired” 400 examples of Nordic graphics with the support of the AKO Foundation. What’s that? It’s the cultural arm of AKO Capital, “one of Europe’s leading investment partnerships” managing “approximately $20.3bn across long-only and long-short equity funds”.View image in fullscreenBland print … The Fallow Deer, 2016, by Mamma Andersson.Photograph: Reproduced by permission of the artist/The Trustees of the British MuseumWhy is the museum working with this foundation to bring us a pile of so-so Scandinavian “modern” art? It’s funny how these long-short funds never apply caution to buying art. A lot of the newest works in this show will, by the law of averages, lose all interest for later generations or quite possibly this generation in a couple of years. In fact they might not have any interest now. But the British Museum has taken on a duty to preserve them for ever, like all its treasures.Like a second-rate corporate art collection, it’s the name of the celebrity artist that counts in some cases, not the work.Ragnar Kjartansson’s woodcut of a yellow and orange flame is pretty cool, right? No, it’s dull as ditchwater. AnOlafur Eliassonis better, but not in the least noir.Mamma Anderssonis touted as a star but her bland print of a fallow deer could be a decoration from Ikea.The exhibition’s thesis does not hold water, not even frozen fjord water. It starts with the great Norwegian symbolistEdvard Munchand posits some continuity in woodcuts, watercolours, screenprints and sketches from his masterpieces to today. This is like saying British art now is in the tradition of Aubrey Beardsley. There may be overlaps but they are random and irrelevant compared with the differences of intent, audience and, let’s not forget, quality.View image in fullscreenNicely cut … Suopan (Lasso), c.1928-34, by John Savio.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumIf the exhibition had no Munch works, its glib claim of continuity between his self-evisceration and the rest might be unthinkingly accepted. Perhaps realising the danger, the curators include only two of his prints. They are devastating. His 1902 colour woodcut Melancholy III depicts a man in black, brooding by a black fjord, under a near-black sky. For a moment the exhibition looks like it might live up to this cracking start. Prints by Munch’s Norwegian Sámi contemporaryJohn Savioshow life in the Arctic north – not in Munch’s league, but nicely cut.Henrik Finnedepicts the flensing of a whale with hard-edged objectivity. The thick, dark ink coolly delineates men going at the great carcass with shovels.But soon you start to wonder, what is this about? None of the artists rival Munch and there is precious little of his soulfulness on show. It all falls apart when abstract prints that are obviously derivative from Malevich and Klee lead to screenprints mourning Che Guevara and what may as well be designs for the filmTroll Hunter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vanessa Baird’s big scary watercolours dig into appalling personal stuff. Her work My Mother is a wizened figure with eyes of hate. In another, an apparent self-portrait, her severed head screams above what looks like her mother’s corpse. Equally worrying isSverre Malling’s hyperrealistic drawing of a possibly maniacal man holding a severed horse’s head. If the entire show attempted to sustain this genuinely noir spirit it might have worked.Even so it seems premature for the British Museum to collect these artists. Baird and Malling are both striking, but are they so good that the museum, that is the nation, needs to own their work?

The beige rectangular tupperware that contained its wires would, when connected to a TV by the aerial, bring a serviceable Pong copy to the screen.View image in fullscreenArcade fire … East German attractions at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumAt the time, they thought the home-brewed device was a singular example of ingenuity behind the iron curtain. But earlier this year they found anotherSeifendosen-Pong (“soap-box Pong”), along with a copy of a state-produced magazine called FunkAmateurcontaining schematics for a DIY variety of Atari’s 1970s gaming sensation.The discovery rubbed up against received wisdom that the dawn of computer gaming had at best been tolerated and at worst suppressed by socialist EastGermany. Instead, here was evidence that gaming enjoyed a level of official support, including from the regime’s notorious secret service.A new joint exhibit from the Allied Museum and the Computer Games Museum in Berlin brings cold war gaming curios from both sides of the iron curtain to light, including East Germany’s only arcade cabinet, the Poly-Play, which visitors can try out. With honey-coloured wooden panels and a brightly lit typeface, only 2,000 of the machines were made. In the late 80s, adolescents would crowd the cabinets at youth clubs and holiday retreats, to the extent they were available, where they could play a number of games cloned from western originals.But the Poly-Play “was only possible with help from state security,” says Veit Lehmann of the Allied Museum. Lacking programming expertise and manpower, manufacturer VEB Polytechnick turned to the Stasi for help. They were the ones with “the experts and the computing capability” to code the games.Instead of Pac–Man, there was Hase und Wolf–a canine-dodging hare swapped for Namco’s famous cheese-wheel-shaped ghost-evader. There was Hirschjagd(“Deer Hunt”), a repackaged take on the sci-fi shooter Robotron: 2084.There was Schießbude,a copy of a carnival shooting game; a butterfly-collecting title called Schmetterling;a memory puzzler; a skiing game and a racing game among the rest.View image in fullscreenTamed … the Poly-Play Hase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) game.Photograph: VEB Polytechnik Karl-Marx-StadtThe Poly-Play was many East Germans’ first encounter with computers, and it “opened up a completely different world for them”, says Regina Seiwald at the University of Birmingham. “The Poly-Play was seen as a machine for the whole family, who’d enjoy a weekend, go for a walk and then jointly play on one. It was seen as an innocent pastime, but with a bit of technical skills training added in.”But, as arcade-goers in the west commandeered tanks in Battlezone or blasted dragons from jetpack-propelled gunners in Space Harrier, the Poly-Play had all notions of violence removed. The GDR liked to present itself as an idyllic, peace-loving state, and its media law deemed all forms of “calls to violence” unconstitutional. “The GDR’s attitude towards computers was an idea of a harmonic self-image and a fear of the unknown,” Seiwald says.Yet, away from the Poly-Play and its PG approach to gaming, self-described “freaks” gathered at computer clubs to test the tolerance of the police state. The east declared technology an economic priority in the late 1970s but, with the CoCom trade embargo blocking exports to the socialist bloc, western technology was only available through smuggling routes, with ZX Spectrums sewn into car seats or hidden in chocolate boxes for cross-border journeys.View image in fullscreenLong arm of the state … an exhibit at ColdWarGames.Photograph: Wikimedia CommonsState factories did produce their own machines – such as the Bildschirmspiel 01 pong clone and the VEB Robotron series of microcomputers – but only in small numbers. High price tags made them unattainable for most.As early enthusiasts began to establish clubs at universities and youth centres from Berlin to Dresden and Leipzig, the state wondered if this youthful interest could help carve a path out of its technical quandary. “They thought if young people spent their time with games and computers, they might develop something better,” says Lehmann. Perhaps, the state thought, this interest could stir new generations into careers in microelectronics, where they might develop much-needed homegrown chips.An oft-repeated phrase among GDR officials, adds Martin Görlich, managing director of the Computer Games Museum, was that “learning from the Soviet Union means learning how to win”. So embracing computing echoed the position of the USSR, which also had arcade games – Frankenstein-like hybrids that blended physical action with screens – and ran its own computer clubs.View image in fullscreenEastern blocks … ColdWarGames.Photograph: Dora Csala/AlliiertenMuseumOf course,the USSR also gave birth to Tetris, the fast-paced puzzler designed by software engineer Alexey Pajitnov to test a new computer. (The game was initially traded between engineers, but led to a dramatic race to secure distribution rights from the Soviet Union between Dutch-born game designer Henk Rogers and Kevin Maxwell, son of disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell.)Over in East Germany, citizens often relied on bootlegs to get around restrictions or shortages. Would-be fashionistas stitched their own clothes, musicians cobbled together audio equipment, and enterprising sorts hand-painted banned board games such as Monopoly, with Mayfair swapped for Karl-Marx-Allee and a party conference square taking the place of jail.A DIY approach to computing was thus in keeping with the state’s policy of self-reliance, where civilians were encouraged to knit, build, tinker and repair all they could. Official magazines such as FunkAmateurand Jugend und Technik responded by promoting games – which they called “computer sports” – and publishing programming code. “The GDR was very aware of the constraints it had in technology,” says Seiwald. “People educating themselves in technology, or pushing the boundaries of what was available, was viewed positively.”Tantalisingly for young hobbyists, some of the computer clubs, such as the House of Young Talents in ast Berlin, possessed much-desired Commodore 64 machines, which were far superior to the GDR’s domestic equivalents. Most club attendees were young and male and, unsurprisingly, interested in games above all else.Some learned to code their own games on state computers such as the KC 85 by VEB Mikroelektronik, while others played them, such as René Meyer, who was 16 when he was introduced to a computer club at the University of Leipzig.“The GDR’s home computers were not compatible with other systems, creating a unique ecosystem for computing in the east,” says Meyer, whose favourite game was Bennion Geppy, its hero tasked with traversing dungeon rooms, dodging monsters and collecting keys.Paradoxically, while the state seemed to support these groups – club-goers were sometimes rewarded with fast-tracked routes to engineering colleges – they were also infiltrated by Stasi informants and closely monitored, their computing activities regarded with suspicion. One report from the Stasi archive lists all the games in circulation at the House of Young Talent. Next to acceptable titles such as Superbowl and Samantha Fox Strip Poker, games such as Rambo and Stryker were singled out for their glorification of violence.Later, as internal conflicts within East German society intensified, the Stasi grew more paranoid about war-themed games, computer viruses and anti-socialist messaging in software. Perhaps their fears weren’t unfounded: in neighbouring Czechoslovakia, underground gamers programmed titles such as The Adventures of Indiana Jones in Wenceslas Square, a text adventure where the fedora-decked explorer could meet a grisly fate at the hands of bloodthirsty police officers.The east wasn’t alone in its mistrust of technology. In 1984, West Germany banned children from playing arcade games, concerned that they encouraged gambling. Then, it introduced strict age-gating for supposedly violent games, such as the Activision title, River Raid. This suspicion around gaming extends well into the 21st century: publishers have had to alter the content of their titles to get around censor boards. Players of the German version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, for example, were punished with failure if they shot civilians in its notorious‘No Russian’ mission, where terrorists massacred travellers at a Moscow airport.While East Germany promoted decentralised computing, over in the west, the state held a firm monopoly on telecoms, criminalising home networking and especially hacking. In the 1980s, activists in West Germany responded by founding the Chaos Computer Club, which continues to this day, even creating a DIY modem from toilet pipes in protest: the Datenklo (“dataloo”).“The west was very harsh in punishing hackers and crackers,” says Seiwald. “That the GDR was more permissive surprises a lot of people.”Coldwargames: It’s All a Game is at the Alliiertenmuseum, Berlin, until 30 June 2026Explore more on these topicsGamesGermanyCold warPCEuropeBoard gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the space of five days, the 32-year-old New Yorker married his fiancee, actor Marisa Abela; attended the Venice film festival for the premiere ofThe Testament of Ann Lee, a musical about the Shaker movement in which he stars – and sings – opposite Amanda Seyfried; and began rehearsals for Safe Space, his first produced play.View image in fullscreenJohn C Calhoun photographed circa 1845.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAs well as writing Safe Space, Bogyo appears in it as one of a group of Yale students debating whether Calhoun college, so named in honour of the 19th-century US vice-president and slavery advocate John C Calhoun, should be renamed and his statue toppled. If such a tussle already sounds quaint in 2025, along with the play’s title and its references to “snowflakes”, then that is intentional. Written by Bogyo in 2019 and based on events that occurred three years earlier, Safe Space begins its run one month after thekilling of the rightwing influencer Charlie Kirkat a campus event. Wisely, there has been no attempt made to introduce hindsight into a period piece that is set near the end of Barack Obama’s second term.“It has to feel current but I don’t need it to feel zeitgeisty,” says the tall, toothy, floppy-haired Bogyo over coffee before rehearsals. “It has to deal with things that are bigger than just what you’ve seen on the news recently. The political climate of the world hasn’t moved forward that much from 2016. We’re just looking through a different lens now. Like: how did we get fromtheretohere?”The emphasis, though, is on characters rather than issues. “These kids are trying to find their identity in the age of identity politics.” They include Annabelle (Céline Buckens), a well-meaning white liberal perturbed by what she suspects is institutional favouritism toward her Black friend Stacey (Bola Akeju), and Isaiah (Ernest Kingsley Jr), a soloist in the college’s a cappella group who is pressured to lend his name to the anti-Calhoun cause.The Bin Ladens are a huge family – and the kid I tutored was sweetBogyo says Safe Space is about how we love people with whom we disagree. What experience does he have of that? “When I was younger, I prided myself on not getting worked up by disagreements. But I’ve realised that came with a certain level of privilege. Rarely as a straight white man did I feel personally attacked, so I could compartmentalise an ideology that I knew was problematic. You know, ‘Oh, they’re probably just saying this because of their upbringing.’ I would look for that human level of connection. Those excuses can make you feel flimsy on the inside. That’s something that some of these characters also struggle with.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve realised I had a certain level of privilege’ … Bogyo.Photograph: Rhys FramptonThe statue exists in the play to give the past a concrete physical presence on stage. “There never was a Calhoun statue,” Bogyo tells me, “but the arguments against the name were real.” He was a senior at Yale in 2016 when it all kicked off. What was his contribution? “I made some impassioned … Facebook posts. I said stuff that I thought sounded meaningful but was also a bit cringe. There was the worry that if I didn’t postsomething, I’d be judged for my silence.” He hasn’t stinted on cringe in the play, whether it’s Annabelle’s performative idolatry of Obama, or Isaiah being caught masturbating. The latter scene will cause one former Yale student no end of blushes. “It really happened,” Bogyo says.Bogyo has hitherto been associated with musical theatre, including the West End run of Moulin Rouge!, for which the Observer critic Susannah Clapp called him “the discovery of the evening”. Hardly surprising from a Broadway baby whose mother was an opera singer and whose father was an assistant to Stephen Sondheim. Bogyo Sr also taught Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver to “ribbet” for the original Yale production of Sondheim’s The Frogs.View image in fullscreenA statue of Calhoun is taken down in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2020.Photograph: Sean Rayford/Getty ImagesFuture writing projects, though, will see Bogyo continuing to dramatise the world of education. For some years now he has run a private tuition company, American Education Experts, and once tutored the children of the super-rich. One family took him to Ibiza on their luxury yacht. Another client was a Bin Laden. Bogyo looks slightly abashed when I bring this up. “They’re a huge family,” he explains. “And he’s a sweet kid.”He has vague plans to write an action caper based on his tutoring experiences, but is currently working on a comedy-drama about SATs, in which he hopes Abela will play a teacher. “The pressures bring out so many interesting qualities in parents and students alike,” he says. Then he heads off to rehearsals where a mock-up of his old Yale dorm room awaits.

Hail to a lost era of multiplex entertainmentJordan ProsserTue 7 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 20.29 EDTShareAt the threshold between life and death sits the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra … and at the threshold of many a millennial adolescence (including mine) sits 1999’s The Mummy, a story about a hot lunk (Brendan Fraser) and a sexy nerd (Rachel Weisz) learning first-hand the consequences of expatriating cultural artefacts.A turn-of-the-millennium Spielbergian blockbuster with shades of the superhero craze to come, Stephen Sommers’ desert romp remains dizzyingly fun to this day. Both masterfully well-made and refreshingly horny, it is one of the last great examples of a specific mode of multiplex entertainment now all but lost to the sands of time: the mid-budget action-adventure movie.Eat the rich … before they eat you: in praise of body horror classic SocietyRead moreFor an 11-year-old in 1999, blissfully ignorant about the folly of colonialist fantasy, nothing was more important than the adventure movie – your Mummies and Jumanjis and Jurassic Parks and even, dare I say it, your Wild Wild Wests. These films seemed to mirror coming of age; their characters existed on the knife-edge of discovery. Frightening but never harrowing, libidinous but never obscene, these films promised young audiences a world beyond this one, filled with swashbuckling danger and forbidden sensation. (And all this for seven dollars at the Pacific Six Cinemas at the Tuggeranong Hyperdome.)Universal execs in the early 90s originally sought to update 1932’s seminal The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, as a low-budget horror for the modern era. But the film they ended up greenlighting drew just as much from 60s sword-and-sandal epics and 80s action comedies: one part Cleopatra, two parts Romancing the Stone, with its resurrected antagonist less a lovesick corpse than a bronzed-up Terminator. Sommers handles these tonal shifts flawlessly, from sprawling action set pieces to Buster Keaton-inspired comedy beats to genuinely grisly moments of horror: a particular instance of a scarab beetle crawling under a sidekick’s skin rivals onlyHook’s Boo Boxin my pantheon of childhood traumas.To render its hungry scarabs, biblical plagues and walking dead, The Mummy embraced Industrial Light & Magic’s still-developing CGI technology. And while the effects themselves may look hokey by today’s standards, they still stand out for how thoughtfully they’re integrated with the film’s more tactile elements – its gargantuan handbuilt sets, lavish costumes and gooey prosthetics – without ever subsuming them.View image in fullscreen‘Every character on screen exudes sweaty sexual energy’ – including an ‘oily-pecced Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep himself’, pictured here with Fraser.Photograph: Keith Hamshere/APA climactic sequence of Fraser’s Rick O’Connell taking on a troupe of CGI mummified guards (a clear nod to Ray Harryhausen’sjanky stop-motion skeletons in 1963’s Jason and the Argonauts, and just as impressive to audiences of its day) remains thrilling not because the effects are “believable” but because of how well the digital objects complement the real-world choreography – as opposed to a lone human actor thrust into a green screen void, forced to fight their way out.Also key to The Mummy’s enduring legacy is its status as asacred text of millennial bisexual awakening. From floppy-haired Fraser to smoky-eyed Weisz, from Oded Fehr as a face-tatted desert warrior to an oily-pecced Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep himself (once his skin grows back), every character on screen – regardless of gender or narrative affiliation – exudes sweaty sexual energy. What’s more, there is unfakeable chemistry between the two romantic leads. This may be a film essentially populated by action figures but at least these action figures have genitals under their jodhpurs – as opposed to those in our now-mandatory biannual superhero corporate retreats, whereeveryone is beautiful but no one is horny.no one is “born bi,” you watch The Mummy at a formative age and the whole cast turns you bi— elle 🐉 (@Elle_Enasalin)December 30, 2020Alas, the Mummyverse would quickly fall victim to the same overindulgence that now defines pop culture; trust a studio exec to ignore their own film’s warning about meddling with the dead. 2001’s The Mummy Returns somehow managed to be both too Spielbergian with its grating child sidekick and too Marvelesque with its soupy third-act CGI. 2008’s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor barely bears mentioning, while 2017’s attempted Tom Cruise reboot was so universally loathed that it single-handedly kiboshed the studio’s plans for an MCU-style interconnected Dark Universe.But as a standalone object of weapons-grade entertainment, 1999’s The Mummy remains an oasis in a desert of faceless tentpole film-making: a relic from a time when Hollywood’s biggest hits could pay homage to their past while still breaking new ground.The Mummy is available to stream on Binge and Prime Video in Australia and HBO Max in the US. In the UK, it is available to rent.

When it comes to shocking lyrics, though, it faces strong competition ...Tue 7 Oct 2025 09.44 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareShall I compare thee to a redwood tree? Thou art more sappy and more decadent. Rough winds do shake … OK, enough of that. I apologise for the cod Shakespeare but I just couldn’t help myself. Taylor Swift mania is at fever pitch and I have found myself swept up in the chatter about the lyrics from her new album,The Life of a Showgirl.Swift has routinely been described as a lyrical genius, and not just by 11-year-olds. Sir Jonathan Bate, a Shakespeare scholar, once called her a “literary giant” and used her work as a teaching aid. On her latest album the billionaire liberally sprinkles in plenty of Shakespeare references, but what’s really got people talking are the (supposed) allusions to fiance Travis Kelce’s “magic wand”. If you’re not interested in a blow-by-blow account of the magic, I’d advise you to do a vanishing act because I’m about to quote from Swift’s song Wood.“Forgive me, it sounds cocky,” the modern-day Shagspeare writes. “Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see / His love was the key that opened my thighs.” Swift then references Kelce’s podcast, which is called New Heights, singing: “New Heightsof manhood, I ain’t gotta knock on wood.” In case you weren’t quite catching her drift, there’s also a reference to a “hard rock”.None of this is remotely risque in the grand scheme of things, but there’s something about Swift’s squeaky-clean brand that makes it all feel a bit ick. I’m not being prejudiced, OK? I don’t care what a consenting adult does with another consenting adult in private. Love is love! But, my God, I wish some of these heterosexuals would stop shoving their lifestyles in our faces.To be fair, while Wood may not be Swift’s strongest work (she has some very strong work!) there is stiff competition when it comes to cringe lyrics. Forgive me, it sounds cocky, but I’m going to take it upon myself to rate some of the most embarrassing lyrics of all timeright here, right now.The first category is songs with factual errors that even a slightly stupid child could spot. Top prize here goes to Jake Paul, an American YouTube personality who also dabbles in boxing and rap. In 2017 he came out with a song calledIt’s Everyday Bro, which featured the memorable line: “England is my city.” The weirdest thing about this is that even though Paul has admitted hewrote the line, Nick Crompton, a British influencer who presumably has a passing understanding of his country’s geography, is the one who sang it. Crompton then rhymed city with “litty” and wasnever heard fromagain.Category two: lyrics that sound as if they were hallucinated by ChatGPT. The Killers obviously get a mention, with their famous line: “Are we human, or are we dancer?” But the winner isDes’ree’s Life(1998), which contains the immortal lines: “I don’t want to see a ghost, It’s the sight that I fear most, I’d rather have a piece of toast, and watch the evening news.” This segment has been widely panned but – like all great art – it makes you think, right? With the news the way it is, I think I’d take the ghost sighting myself right now.Next up we have budget brags. I’ve invented this category entirely forTinie Tempahand his 2010 hit Pass Out, where he sings: “I live a very, very, very wild lifestyle … I’ve got so many clothes I keep some in my aunt’s house.” So bathetic, it’s beautiful. That song also includes the line: “I’ve been Southampton, but I’ve never been to Scunthorpe.” It’s hard to explain the splendour of that to an American, but I’ve tried.Last up: unnecessary mentions of cancer in otherwise upbeat techno bops. Yep, it’s Snap!’s classic song Rhythm Is a Dancer coming in top here, with the line: “I’m serious as cancer when I say, ‘Rhythm is a dancer.’” Surely it wasn’t that hard to find another rhyme, was it? Anyway, time to wrap this up with a line from my forthcoming studio album, The Life of a Freelance Writer: “I’m as urgent as a rash when I say I have to dash.”Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now the threequel is the festival’s opening gala: Josh O’Connor is the principled young priest who finds himself in the frame when his fierce clerical superior is whacked – and Benoit has to find out the truth.The Secret AgentOne of the best films of the year – perhapsthebest. Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho sets his expansive, freewheeling dramedy-thriller during the 1970s Brazilian dictatorship and Wagner Moura plays a dissident scientist on the run from government forces who want to dispose of him. With its visual brilliance, sensual big-city intrigue and languorous mystery it feels like Elmore Leonard mixed with Antonioni’s The Passenger.The Ice TowerAn eerie and unwholesome spell is cast in this fairytale of deathwish yearning and erotic submission from Lucile Hadžihalilović, whose partner Gaspar Noé has a cameo as a seedy movie director. A teen runaway in 60s France with an obsession with Hans Christian Andersen’s Snow Queen breaks into a movie studio where this story is actually being filmed starring a magnificently chilly Marion Cotillard: it’s a dreamy and narcotic melodrama.Father Mother Sister BrotherJarmuschwon the Venice Golden Lionwith this diverting and beguiling anthology movie, whose cast includes Adam Driver, Charlotte Rampling, Indya Moore, Cate Blanchett and Tom Waits. It’s a triptych of family scenes: separate scenarios with mischievous, mysterious moments in which they appear to cosmically resonate with each other.BugoniaProlific Greek auteurYorgos Lanthimosis back with another macabre, startling and amusing film featuring his superstar muse Emma Stone. It’s a bizarre black comedy about online conspiracy delusion whose final, sensational montage of images sent Venice audiences reeling out of the auditorium. Stone plays an icy corporate CEO who is kidnapped by crazed eco-activist Jesse Plemons who is convinced she is an evil space alien.DreamsMexican auteur Michel Franco can be relied to deliver the shock factor, and so it proves again with this hypnotically disturbing, chilling satire-nightmare of erotic obsession among the liberal superrich in the US. Jessica Chastain plays a wealthy, entitled heiress (like one of the Roy family in TV’s Succession) who conceives an erotic obsession with one of the ballet stars in the dance school her family bankrolls.HamnetA creative take on the private life of William Shakespeare needs audacity — and directorChloé Zhaohas boldly taken on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about young William, his wife Anne Hathaway and the imagined heartbreak caused by the death of his young son Hamnet, that name so close to that of his great tragic hero. Paul Mescal is Shakespeare and as the grieving Anne, Jessie Buckley is already being spoken of as a best actress contender at the Academy Awards.The Voice of Hind RajabThis docufictional movie had tearful audiences on their feet at Venice: Tunisian film-maker Kaouther Ben Hania recounts the true story of the five-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who was stranded in her uncle’s car during a 2024 assault by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, and desperately stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestine Red Crescent Society, begging for help before she was killed, with many others. Ben Hania uses the real audio recording of the girl’s voice and has actors playing the agonised staff on the other end of the line.Die My LoveBig performances, big emotions and big scenes in this movie from Lynne Ramsay, who brings the gothic realist steam heat to this study of a lonely, passionate woman played byJennifer Lawrence– a performance which brings back memories of Gena Rowlands’ work for Cassavetes. Lawrence’s character has postpartum depression, left alone in the house all day with the baby, supposedly writing a novel, while her husband (Robert Pattinson) absents himself.The MastermindHere’s an art heist movie with a downbeat vibe:Kelly Reichardtgives us a non-hero who is anything but a mastermind here, wonderfully played by Josh O’Connor. He’s the art school dropout in the 1960s who conceives a bizarre get-rich-quick scheme: using his wealthy parents’ money, he pays a couple of tough guys and a getaway driver to help him steal paintings from a local gallery.H Is for HawkClaire Foy stars in this adaptation of the classic of nature-writing and memoir. She is Helen who suffers a near breakdown when her father dies and to process her grief and loss, trains a fierce goshawk named Mabel, which is as unsentimental a beast as could possibly be imagined – much prized for hunting. It’s a film perhaps to set alongside Kes?It Was Just an AccidentIranian director and democracy campaigner Jafar Panahi continues to work, continues to be harassed by the authorities, andwon the Cannes Palme d’Orthis year with this satirical suspenser about state violence and revenge. A man suffers an accident at night when his car hits a dog and the careworn mechanic helping out realises with a chill that he knows this man – and he must now exact revenge on him.Explore more on these topicsLondon film festival 2025London film festivalFestivalsRian JohnsonJim JarmuschYorgos LanthimosChloé ZhaofeaturesShareReuse this content"

The band – who deny allegations of antisemitism – were subsequentlydropped from Manchester’s Radar festivalin July, but plan to visit the city next month on their We Won’t Go Quietly tour.Who are Bob Vylan? The British punks who had their US visas revoked for anti-IDF chantsRead moreThe JRC first called for November’s Bob Vylan gig to be cancelled last month. After Jihad al-Shamieattacked Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagoguein Manchester on Thursday, leaving two worshippers dead and three other people injured, demands to stop the concert have increased. Shamie, 35, was shot dead by police at the scene.In a statement backed by politicians including the Greater Manchester Labour MPs Navendu Mishra, Jo Platt, Graham Stringer, Christian Wakeford and Paul Waugh, the JRC said it was “deeply concerned by Manchester Academy’s decision to host Bob Vylan”, saying the band’s “statements and actions do not provoke debate but carry a real danger”.“There is a vital distinction between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government and speech that veers into antisemitism,” the statement added. “We call on the Manchester Academy to cancel the performance and commit to clear policies to ensure that it will not legitimise prejudice under the guise of freedom of speech.”The JRC chief executive, Marc Levy, whose father, Alan Levy, was among congregants at the synagogue who barricaded the doors to stop the attacker getting inside, said freedom of expression had to be balanced with the safety of a Jewish community under threat.He said: “[Heaton Park] is my synagogue, I have grown up there, my kids have grown up there, and people who I’ve known all my life now have this sadness in their eyes.“The worst thing is that the attack was inevitable. It was inevitable because you have individual venues prepared to give a platform to artists like Bob Vylan who talk about ‘hunting down Zionists’ and ‘death to the IDF’.“We understand the need for freedom of expression, but we can’t be having people like that performing on our streets.”Manchester Academy has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsManchesterBob VylanGreater ManchesterJudaismnewsShareReuse this content"

But now, for [the twins], it’s like – they’re not on their iPads, you know? They have dinner with grownups and have to take their dishes in.“They have a much better life. I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France – they kind of don’t give a shit about fame. I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”Clooney’s father, Nick, now 91, was a local TV anchor in Cincinnati and the actor reflected that the age gap between himself and his own children means that similar comparisons will be harder to draw.“The only thing I feel lucky about is that I’m so much older that the idea that my son would be compared to me is pretty unlikely, because by the time he actually will have done anything, I’m gonna be gumming my bread.”He also spoke about his desire to ensure his children were self-sufficient, through encouraging them to help out in the grounds and witness his handyman skills fixing, variously, a fan belt (using a pair of his wife’s stockings), a coffee machine and the automated cover for the swimming pool. “It’s important to me that they can survive,” he said.Daniel Day-Lewis, Paul Mescal, Lynne Ramsay and George Clooney set for London film festivalRead moreIn April 2025, Amal Clooney was among a number of senior legal counsels to the International Criminal Courtwarnedby the foreign office they may be at risk of sanctions by the Trump administration, including being banned from entering the US.Last year, Amal Clooney sat on a panel that recommended lead ICC prosecutor Karim Khan issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant. The warrant was duly issued in November 2024, citing the allegation that the men had committed war crimes in Gaza, including using starvation as a method of warfare, during Israel’s fight against Hamas.In February, Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC and naming Khan in its annex, promising to “impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members”.Clooney did not comment on his wife’s work, although speaking to Anderson Cooper in the spring, he batted back concerns of persecution from Trump, saying: “My wife spent two years in a bunker trying Hezbollah. She’s the only person to put Isis on trial. She’s the bravest person I’ve ever met. We have other issues besides just worrying about an American administration saying unkind things about us.”Clooney was then publicising his Broadway run in a stage version of 2005 filmGood Night, and Good Luck, which, he told Esquire, was made considerably more stressful by his age.“As you get older, it doesn’t matter how many granola bars you eat; your brain starts to lock up,” he said. “I had all these long monologues, and I was afraid of blowing my lines. So every single night for 100 performances, I would do the whole play in the dressing room before I went onstage. I was so terrified.”Clooney is currently promotingJay Kelly, Noah Baumbach’s film in which he stars as a Clooney-esque film star reassessing his life ahead of a lifetime achievement tribute. Making the movie, said Clooney, also caused him to look back at the highs and lows of his own career, and the impact it had had on his own health and family.He told Esquire that although never addicted to alcohol, he had “runs where I’d get pretty toasty every night” as well as having dabbled in cocaine during the early 1980s.“At the time, it was like, ‘No, this is not like heroin. It’s not addictive.’ But then it was like, ‘Oh, well, it’s actually pretty fucking bad.’ Plus, it was all cut with mannitol. The baby laxative. Everybody would do a line and then take a shit.”Watching film classics from the same period with his wife had also caused him to reassess that time, he said, recalling a viewing of Animal House, which he billed as a film with “no equal”.“She said: ‘Well, let’s watch it.’ I go, ‘I don’t know if it’s going to hold up.’ Like, thefirst scene,a 13-year-old girl passes out and the devil pops up on the guy’s shoulder and says, ‘Fuck her brains out!’ And my wife’s looking at me like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this isterrible!’”Explore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyFranceLos AngelesChildrenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both give important insights into the type of music Purcell was writing in the last five years of his short life.”Rose heads a project, titledMusic, Heritage, Place: Unlocking the Musical Collections of England’s County Record Offices – a collaboration between Royal Holloway, University of London and Newcastle University, cataloguing music manuscripts in local archives that are “often struggling after decades of local authority funding cuts”.The printed song, “As soon as day began to peep”, was written for a character called Monsieur le Prate, a French fop, in a 1691 play titled Love for Money, which lampooned a girls’ boarding school. Its author was Thomas D’Urfey, a frequent collaborator of Purcell.Rose said that, in this song, the fop is “not quite in control of his emotions” in trying to woo a woman: “He comically compares himself to a cat howling and scratching at the door of his beloved, with Purcell representing the miaows in music.”He added that, at the play’s performance in London, audience members booed it as a malicious attack on the girls’ boarding school in Chelsea, where D’Urfey had stayed in 1690: “Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas was performed at the same school in around 1687, so it is interesting to see Purcell also involved in a play that satirised the venue of his opera and the girls who sang in it.”Although incomplete, the newly discovered song had survived among legal warrants. It can now be performed again, having been reconstructed by Alan Howard, chair of the Purcell Society and college associate professor of music at Selwyn College, Cambridge.He described the find as “highly significant”, adding: “This is a piece we were completely unaware of by Purcell, the major composer of that era inEngland. It’s almost unheard of for something like that to turn up. We would normally know about it from the published play text or a diary entry by someone who heard it in the theatre. But there’s just nothing like that.”The keyboard manuscript has a lavish binding in red leather with gold decoration, suggesting that it was once owned by a wealthy individual. It had been repurposed around 1810, with some of the blank music staves being used as lines for the index of Thetford town council records.Yet it contains nine pieces by Purcell and his fellow composer John Blow, in different versions from those currently known. Rose said: “Three of the pieces by Purcell are in the composer’s own hand, recognisable for its distinctive note-shapes and musical symbols …“They include early versions of his G minor suite. It contains many differences of keyboard texture and ornamentation, giving insights into how Purcell may have played the harpsichord.”The Norfolk keyboard manuscript will feature in the final episode of the BBC Radio 3 programme The Song Detectorists, to be broadcast on 24 October. Rose will perform its version of Purcell’s G minor Allemand.The Norfolk and Worcestershire archives are each making digitised versions available. Further details on these discoveries will be published in a scholarly article by Rose, Howard, Caro Lesemann-Elliott and Andrew Woolley.The research project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicHeritageOperaEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, in an Instagram post supportingthe Screen Actors Guild’s campaign against AI, she wrote, “I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/recreate actors who cannot consent, like Dad. This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real.“I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want and while I find it personally disturbing, the ramifications go far beyond my own feelings.“These recreations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”Williams’ latest post comes as celebrity deepfakes continue to proliferate across social media, in everything frompornographicand political content toscamsand advertising.In January, actorScarlett Johansson warned of the “imminent dangers of AI”after a deepfake video of her and other prominent Jewish celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld, Drake and Adam Sandler, speaking out against antisemitic comments made by Kanye West, went viral.In August, a scam ad featuring a deepfake ofCrowded Housefrontman Neil Finn falsely talking about erectile dysfunction went viral, prompting the band to issue a disclaimer.The Robin Williams deepfakes are part of a broader trend ofAI slop– low-quality content generated forentertainment– fuelled by the rapid growth of free-to-use generative AI apps.Several recent videos of Robin Williams on TikTok appear to have been created using OpenAI’s new video generator app, Sora 2, including a fake ad for Apple and an awards ceremony interaction between the comedian and the late Betty White.Within a few days of launching,Sora’s feed was floodedwith videos featuring copyrighted characters from shows such as SpongeBob SquarePants, South Park, Pokémon and Rick and Morty.OpenAI told the Guardianthat content owners can flag copyright infringement using a “copyright disputes form” but that individual artists or studios cannot have a blanket opt-out.

Were the thieves merely low-level opportunists, or were bigger forces at work?ByPhilip OltermannTue 7 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 7 Oct 2025 11.28 EDTShareOn 16 October 2023, a young man and woman sat down in the back row of the second-floor reading room of the university library of Warsaw, Poland. Their reading cards carried the names Sylvena Hildegard and Marko Oravec. On the desk in front of them were eight books with yellowing pages that they had ordered up from the library’s closed-storage 19th-century collection: rare editions of classic works of poetry, drama and fiction by two greats of the Russian canon,Alexander Pushkinand Nikolai Gogol. They studied the books closely, taking photographs on their phones and measurements with rulers.When the duo did not return from a cigarette break and the invigilators checked their desk, they found that five of the eight books had gone. One of the missing Pushkin works was a narrative poem about the adventures of two outlaws, The Robber Brothers. It was as if the thieves had wanted to send a message.In the days that followed, a more thorough investigation of the library’s stocks revealed that a further 74 books of Russian literature had been stolen in the weeks, or even months, leading up to the final swoop. The thieves had managed to avoid detection by replacing the books they had stolen with what one newspaper described as “high-quality facsimiles” of the originals. They did not have to worry about causing a scene when they left the building. Most books in the Warsaw library have been fitted with a magnetic strip that raises an alarm at the exit unless deactivated. But older books went without this, as an expert had advised that the glue on the magnetic strip could damage the paper.The books’ disappearance made headline news in Poland. “It was like gouging out the crown jewels,” said Hieronim Grala, a former diplomat who helped the university assess the damage. Established in 1817, in a period when Poland was ruled by the Russian tsar, the library collection has been shaped by complex historic ties to Russia. “Those books were given to Poland at very significant historical moments,” said Bartosz Jandy, the Polish chief prosecutor who was tasked with investigating the thefts. “The fact that they are a testimony to Russian imperialism doesn’t mean they don’t belong to our heritage.”The Warsaw book heist was not an isolated incident but one of the final stops on an unprecedented grand tour of bibliophilic crime, which snaked its way from north-east to south-west Europe between spring 2022 and winter 2023. As many as 170 rare Russian books, valued at more than £2.5m, vanished from the shelves of the National Library of Latvia in Riga, two university libraries in Estonia, Vilnius University Library in Lithuania, the National Library of Finland in Helsinki, the National Library of the Czech Republic in Prague, Bibliothèque Diderot in Lyon, the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the University Library of Languages and Civilisations in Paris, the Bibliothèque de Genève in Switzerland, the State Library in Berlin and the Bavarian State Library in Munich. “In terms of scale and sophistication, we have never dealt with anything like this before,” said Laura Bellen of Estonia’s southern district court, one of the first public prosecutors to investigate these thefts. “Libraries just aren’t used to thinking of themselves as targets for major crime.”MapThe thieves’ tactics in each of these cities were broadly the same: two people would use fake identities to order up rare Russian books from the stacks. If they were being watched closely, one would distract the librarians while the other walked out with the books. Their cover stories varied, and they were not always the same two people. In Warsaw they posed as Slovakians, in Helsinki as Poles. In Riga, they claimed to be Ukrainian refugees who wanted to research Russian history. In Paris they were Bulgarians studying “democracy in Russian literature of the 19th century”.As early as the spring of 2022, authorities had begun to suspect that these were not isolated crimes. In December that year, police in Latvia arrested a man whose DNA had been found on books left behind during the theft at the National Library in Riga eight months earlier. The suspect owned library cards from Munich, Vilnius, Paris, Kyiv and Vienna, as well as a collection of library stamps and tools for restoring printed matter, such as a set of needles and spools of thread. Burly and balding, with salt-and-pepper stubble, the man was identified by his passport as Beqa Tsirekidze, a 46-year-old Georgian citizen. Investigators discovered he had a background in antiques dealing and a criminal record for theft. His DNA also matched that found at the scene of the April 2022 book thefts in neighbouring Estonia, where he was extradited and put on trial.Tsirekidze’s arrest was far from the end of the story. During two trials in Tartu and Tallinn in the first half of 2024, he remained tight-lipped about whether anyone had commissioned him to steal books, even though this would have alleviated his sentence. He was given a compound sentence of three and a half years in prison. “I would say it’s rather likely that there is some kind of other force that made him carry out these thefts,” said Bellen. “But we don’t have any evidence of who that may be.”To solve the continent-spanning riddle of the Pushkin heists, a moment of pan-European cooperation was required. In March 2024, the EU crime-fighting agency Eurojust set up a joint investigative team consisting of police from France, Lithuania, Poland and Switzerland. Georgia, which is not formally a member state of the cross-border crime agency but only an “operational partner country”, was invited to join, too.These countries were unified in their determination to crack the crimes, but their working theories weren’t necessarily the same. Were all the thefts masterminded by the same set of people, or were authorities looking at rival gangs, competing with each other for the same prized titles? Above all, there was the uneasy fact of the thefts’ timing. The crimes began two months after Putin had announced the full-scale invasion ofUkrainewith a speech that evoked the “culture and values, experience and traditions of our ancestors”. In the aftermath, relations between Russia and the European Union had reached new levels of hostility. Was this a bunch of small-time criminals making use of lax security, or were investigators looking at something bigger, a state-sponsored Russian exercise in recouping cultural heritage that had been scattered across the continent? “In my opinion,” said Jandy, the Polish prosecutor, “it’s impossible that a group of thieves initiated this action without the involvement of a state.”The common denominator in all the thefts was the work of Alexander Pushkin, the early 19th-century Romantic poet and playwright. Outside Russia, Pushkin is mainly known for two works that inspired operas by Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades. He is otherwise little read. “The problem with Pushkin is that he was mostly a poet, and poetry is very difficult to translate,” says Pierre-Yves Guillemet, a London-based bookseller who specialises in Russian literature.In Russia, on the other hand, Pushkin is regarded as a foundational figure. Over the past two centuries, his ambiguous politics have enabled very different regimes to embrace him. “He was definitely a great patriot, and like nearly his entire aristocratic class, he was a monarchist,” says Andrew Kahn, a professor of Russian literature at the University of Oxford. Yet there was rebellion in Pushkin’s writing, too. In his youth he wrote a poem,Dagger, which celebrated regicide, and he was personal friends with some of the key players in the failed 1825 coup d’etat against the Russian empire.In 1937, Stalin chose to mark the centenary of Pushkin’s death with statues, commemorative exhibitions and plays, and new multilingual anniversary editions of his books. It was, in part, a calculated move to create a unifying figure that the multi-ethnic empire could rally around. Later, in the twilight years of the Soviet Union, dissident writers such as Andrei Sinyavsky tried to wrestle Pushkin back from the hands of the communists, emphasising his sensuality and eroticism over his ideological leanings.View image in fullscreenA defaced monument to Alexander Pushkin in Bahrianyi Park (formerly Pushkin Park) in Kyiv, Ukraine, November 2023.Photograph: Sopa Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesIn the 21st century, however, the Russian state has chosen to emphasise his most jingoistic works. Pushkin supported the violent suppression of the November uprising of 1830-31, in which Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Ukrainians revolted against the Russian empire. His poem about the revolt, To the Slanderers of Russia, suggested that the choice for the Slavic peoples was either to merge their streams “into the Russian sea” or simply to “dry up”. In November 2022, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, released avideo of himself recitingTo the Slanderers of Russia, interspersed with images of US president Joe Biden and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Earlier that year, as Russian troops advanced into Ukrainian territory, theyput up placardswith Pushkin’s portrait in towns they captured.Ukrainians who grew up on Russian culture in the post-Soviet era have come to see the veneration of Pushkin as propaganda, and a smokescreen for war crimes. “The world is still so sentimental about Russia’s great cultural heritage,” says Oleksandr Mykhed, a Ukrainian writer and literary scholar. “It makes it so easy for Russians to say: we will kill you and then we will ask for sorrow and forgiveness, and then we will kill another people in another country, but what can you do, our soul is just a mystery.”One of the striking things about the thefts was how straightforward many were. The first “heist” was barely worthy of the name. Between 24 March and 8 April 2022, Beqa Tsirekidze was able to borrow 10 volumes of rare books from the Tallinn University Academic Library, including an 1834 edition of Pushkin’s The History of Pugachev. The only criminal energy required was resisting the urge to return them.In April 2022, Tsirekidze and an accomplice visited the National Library in Riga, Latvia. They were able to order an 1829 edition of Pushkin’s Poltava – worth an estimated €10,000 – to the library’s unsupervised main storage reading room, alongside two other valuable works. To prevent theft, most academic libraries in Europe rely on trackable tags that are typically glued on the inside of a book’s back cover. In Riga, the thieves merely found a quiet corner, scraped off the tags, put the books under their sweaters and walked out.What about the supposed “high quality” of the forgeries some of the thieves left behind? Nick Wilding, a British-born Renaissance historian who is also one of the world’s leading specialists in print forgeries, is sceptical about that description. In 2012, Wilding gained international fame for de-authenticating a copy of Galileo’s Sidereus Nuncius, a treatise that includes the first printed depiction of the moon as seen through a telescope. Its forger, Italian librarian Marino Massimo de Caro, had taken great care: he had made his own paper, then artificially aged it by steaming it in sulphuric acid on a low heat. The only things that aroused Wilding’s suspicion about the book’s authenticity were a minor irregularity in the library stamp and a typographic impossibility. By De Caro’s own account, it took him over a year to make his master forgery.View image in fullscreenA university employee presents a fake copy of an 1822 poemKavkazskiy Plennik: Povest(The Prisoner of the Caucasus) by Alexander Pushkin at the University of Warsaw Library in 2023.Photograph: Wojtek Radwański/AFP/Getty ImagesBy contrast, Wilding reckons that most of the Pushkin and Gogol facsimiles could have easily been made in a day. Photos of a facsimile of one 1802 book show a stark contrast between the pristine paper colour of the title page and the yellowed pages of the rest of the book. To trick overworked librarians at the checkout desk, Wilding believes that the thieves merely copied and pasted a facsimile of a work’s title page into a less valuable 19th-century book, possibly a second edition of the same work. At Tartu University in Estonia, librarians found that Pushkin and Gogol books were forged by simply stuffing pages from 19th-century German books into the original leather or paper bindings. “It’s pretty amateur,” he told me. “I’m not sure forgery is even the right word, they are so bad.”All this left investigators with one central question: were these thefts really the work of a team of criminal masterminds, or just a bunch of chancers grabbing cultural treasures that were there for the taking?After Estonia and Latvia, the thefts moved further north to Finland in spring 2023, and on to Lithuania in May. Then they hit France. In July 2023, 10 books were stolen from the Diderot Library in Lyon, including an early copy of Pushkin’s Boris Godunov worth an estimated €70,000.In Paris, a librarian named Aglaé Achechova noted this development with alarm. Achechova is head of the Russian collection at Paris’s University Library of Languages and Civilisations (Bulac) and in July 2023, she sent an email to her French colleagues. “As a former curator of 18th-19th century books in the Pushkin memorial museum in St Petersburg, I am convinced that this was a commissioned theft,” she wrote. The thieves who stole these books, Achechova believed, must have been hired by a wealthy collector. She warned her colleagues that the collection at their university might be next.Until the Pushkins started to vanish across Europe, the most spectacular book crime of recent times was the so-called“Feltham heist” of 2017, when a gang of Romanians abseiled into a warehouse near Heathrow airport to steal 200 rare books valued at more than £2.5m. Because the gang left behind a considerable number of books, the thieves were initially thought to have been working from a master list provided by a book collector. But by the time of their 2020 trial, this theory had been discarded. “The suspects stole as many books as they could carry, and there was no obvious thought put into selecting one book over another, other than [taking] the ones with ornate fonts,” DI Andy Durham, the lead investigator in the case, told me. The thieves appeared to have struggled to offload their goods, eventually burying their entire haul under the floorboards of a house in the Romanian countryside.Achechova believes the Pushkin thefts were different and that there really was a rogue collector or knowledgable dealer behind them. What convinced her, she said in her email to colleagues, was that all the books that had been stolen up to that point were “legendary items for any serious Russian-speaking bibliophile”.From a collector’s point of view, what makes the stolen Pushkins so alluring is less the ideology contained within their covers than the fact that they were published before the author’s death at the age of 37. (In an echo of his verse novel Eugene Onegin, Pushkin died in a duel with a French officer rumoured to have had an affair with his wife.) The two other authors whose books were second and third on the list of stolen works in 2022 and 2023 were Mikhail Lermontov and Gogol, who lived until just 26 and 42 respectively. Tolstoy, by contrast, died aged 82. “It’s the same logic you have with rock stars: the younger they die, the more valuable they become,” says Guillemet, the bookseller.In the late 2010s, so-called “lifetime editions” of Pushkin sold for remarkable sums. In 2018, an 1829 edition of the narrative poem Poltava went for £32,500 – more than double its estimate – at an auction at Sotheby’s in London. In 2019, a first edition of Eugene Onegin, estimated at £120,000,fetched £467,250at Christie’s. In the wake of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the biggest auction houses in western Europe havestopped working with buyers and sellers in Russia, which has throttled the supply of rare books and further driven up the prices of works that are available.In her email to colleagues, Achechova attached a list of the rarest Pushkin books in Bulac’s own collection. “In a way, we began to wait for the criminals to arrive,” she told me. They did not have to wait long. Three months later, on 9 October 2023, two men claiming to be Bulgarian nationals registered at Bulac and ordered precisely the titles highlighted on Achechova’s list.Unlike at previous libraries, the men found they were only able to look at the Pushkins under the eyes of watchful staff. That evening, Bulac’s management contacted Paris police, but the thieves made their move before the authorities could act. Overnight, they broke one of the street-facing windows with an iron bar and entered the reading room they had visited during the day. Finding that the most valuable books had been locked away in the basement, the thieves left the premises with only a few handfuls of worthless pamphlets. Worse still, in entering through the broken window they had injured themselves and provided detectives with further evidence: the next morning, police found bloodstains on one of the wall racks and on the yellow carpet.A week after the botched attempt in Paris, the final Pushkin thefts in Warsaw took place. And the following month, in November 2023, librarians at the Bavarian State Library in Munich discovered that they, too, had been targeted. Two books by Nikolai Gogol, published during his lifetime, had vanished and been replaced with facsimiles. What was notable about the theft was that the two books were volumes two and three of a four-volume collected works of the writer. The thieves had ordered up and inspected all four volumes but decided to steal only two, further hardening the impression they were ticking off a list.That November, eight months after Eurojust’s joint investigative committee had been formed, it notched up its first success. Mikheil Zamtaradze, a Georgian citizen who had been identified as a suspect in connection with the thefts in Paris and Vilnius, was arrested at Brussels airport and extradited to Lithuania on a European arrest warrant. On 24 April 2024, four further Georgian nationals were arrested in Georgia, followed by a fifth suspect on 16 May.During the interrogation of the suspects in Tbilisi, the investigators achieved a breakthrough. In custody, one suspect confessed that she was one of the pair who had stolen the books in Warsaw. Finally, it seemed, investigators had a source who could shed light on the inner workings of the Pushkin heists.On 21 October 2024, the woman identified on her Warsaw university reading pass as “Sylvena Hildegard” appeared in front of a judge in Tbilisi. Her real name was Ana Gogoladze. The courtroom was packed with spectators, friends and members of her family, and the 23-year-old woman, who had dyed red hair, initially appeared nervous. As she described how she had gone about stealing the books, her voice became calmer.A month before the Warsaw theft, Gogoladze had received a message from her husband, Mate Tsirekidze – the son of Beqa Tsirekidze, the man convicted earlier that year for book thefts in Latvia and Estonia. Gogoladze and Mate had married a few years earlier and become parents, but at the time that Mate contacted her on Telegram, they were on bad terms. She was raising their child as a single mother in Tbilisi, while he was mostly working abroad as a builder. His message contained an unusual proposal: Mate asked if she would accompany him to Poland to steal rare books. Since she needed the money, she begrudgingly agreed.In Tbilisi, Mate’s sister handed them fake IDs and their plane tickets to Warsaw. On arrival, they checked into a guesthouse, and the next day they registered at the library under their fake names. Gogoladze, who has no university education and reads only basic Russian, did not bring any expertise to the job. She told the court that she had only recognised Nikolai Gogol’s name on one of the book’s covers because it reminded her of her own. After the theft, the couple threw away their fake IDs and travelled by taxi to another Polish city whose name Gogoladze could not recall, before moving on to Vienna, where they handed the stolen books to a contact and flew back to Tbilisi.Far from resolving all the questions swirling around the thefts, Gogoladze’s testimony had thrown up numerous new puzzles. If she and Mate had stolen only five books, who took the other 74 books missing from Warsaw? And then there was the fact that when Gogoladze and her husband returned to Tbilisi, her sister-in-law handed them back the five books they had stolen and told them that they were worthless: they were replicas that had already been forged by someone else. It was a crushing blow for Gogoladze. Instead of receiving a handsome reward, she was reimbursed only for her travel expenses. By the end of the year, she and Mate had split up again, this time for good. (In February 2025, Mate, Gogoladze and three other defendants were found guilty of stealing Russian books from libraries in eight EU countries. All were sentenced to several years in prison, with Gogoladze receiving a suspended sentence.)Rather than a coordinated effort by a single gang, Gogoladze’s testimony suggested an alternative possibility: the Pushkin thefts as a Marx Brothers-style farce, in which competing gangs swapped real books with fakes at dizzying speed. According to several sources involved in Eurojust’s joint investigative committee, there was significant disagreement among the national crime agencies looking into the thefts. The Georgian prosecutor was convinced that some of the books that Gogoladze had taken in Warsaw were real, and that her sister-in-law had simply lied to her in order to swindle her out of a reward. The Polish side was not so sure. They believed that the young couple had indeed stolen worthless facsimiles, possibly as a carefully planned attempt to cover the tracks of an earlier heist.View image in fullscreenA book of Alexander Pushkin’s poetry amid debris in a damaged apartment in Donetsk oblast, Ukraine, January 2024.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesConflicts over what may seem like minor details pointed to a broader debate: the more sophisticated the operation, the more plausible the theory that the Russian state had played a role in its facilitation. Prosecutors from EU states became increasingly frustrated with the narrowness of the charges brought by the public prosecutor in Tbilisi – one source told me that more suspects allegedly involved with the thefts should have been charged – as well as the glacial pace of court proceedings, which were slowed down by high-profile trials of pro-European protesters taking place at the same time. Georgia, one prosecutor from a European country told me, was “scared of doing anything that could worsen its relationship with Russia”.The lack of a breakthrough was also testing everyone’s patience. Fourteen months into the investigation, the National Library of the Netherlands belatedly reported that six rare Pushkins had also been stolen in March 2023 from its premises in The Hague, not far from Eurojust’s headquarters. Instead of zeroing in on a mastermind, there was a sense that the scale of the crime they were uncovering was ever-expanding.It was not until April of 2025 that the picture began to become clearer. Mikheil Zamtaradze, the man arrested at Brussels airport in November 2023, appeared in front of a court in Vilnius, Lithuania. He was accused of stealing 17 books, worth more than €600,000, from the city’s university library in May 2023. Zamtaradze, a thick-set 50-year-old Georgian with a high forehead and a chinstrap beard, did not deny stealing the books. He did, however, present the theft as a crime of opportunity. He told the judge he earned an income by buying and then selling old items, and that he had visited the Lithuanian capital with the intention to buy books, not to steal them.Evidence presented in court painted a different picture. From library staff, the judge heard how Zamtaradze had charmed them and how he had moved piles of books between different rooms to confuse the supervisors. Information obtained by French investigators also showcased Zamtaradze’s ingenuity: when visiting the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris later the same year he did so with what appeared to be a broken arm, hiding stolen pages inside his sling. He created basic forgeries by printing copies of the title pages in his hotel room with a colour inkjet printer – so cheap that he threw it away when the cartridge ran out. GPS data from his iPhone showed that Zamtaradze had spent much of 2022 and 2023 jetting across the European continent, visiting not just Lithuania but Poland, Germany, France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Ukraine – a remarkable itinerary for a father of five who claimed to be unemployed and on benefits.Zamtaradze presented himself as a lone wolf. In cases where there was a proven personal connection to other suspects, he claimed not to have been in touch with them for years. But booking receipts and CCTV footage showed Zamtaradze had often stayed in the same hotels – sometimes the same hotel rooms – as the other Georgian suspects he claimed to have not been in touch with. One of these, a 45-year-old used car salesman called Robert Tsaturov, was a former acquaintance from military service years, though messages extracted from his phone suggest their relationship wasn’t exactly one of equals. “You’re pissing me off,” Zamtaradze admonished his former comrade in one message; “You’re a good kid,” he praised him in another. “Are you [expletive] blind or just pretending,” reads the transcript of a voice message dated 4 August 2023.One particularly damning exchange fell into the hands of France’s art police unit because Zamtaradze had typed it into his phone right underneath a CCTV camera on the terrace of the François-Mitterrand site of the Bibliothéque nationale de France on 25 October 2023 while on a cigarette break. In it, Zamtaradze appears to be directing Tsaturov to swap out a book with a forgery inside a library: “Act cool and everything will be fine,” he wrote. “No one is following you, it’s just your inner fear. The most important thing is the discreet exchange, everything else is irrelevant.”In June 2025, Zamtaradze was found guilty and sentenced to three years and four months in prison in Lithuania. By the end of the trial, the judge concluded that the accused had not acted alone but operated within “an organised group whose members, having divided roles among themselves, sought to carry out a premeditated plan to steal books and exchange them”. Mikheil Zamtaradze and Beqa Tsirekidze had been the group’s brains, while a host of relatives and old acquaintances acted out their scheme. Within this group, there appeared to have been a degree of coordination but also an element of competition and mutual deception. When interrogated by Polish investigators after the Vilnius trial, Zamtaradze claimed it was he who had stolen the books from the Warsaw library, pipping Mate Tsirekidze and Ana Gogoladze to the post and leaving them to steal worthless forgeries.One larger question remained: on whose orders were the Georgians acting? On this, Zamtaradze was surprisingly forthcoming, though his story sometimes strained credulity. While in Vilnius, he said, he had received a phone call – apparently out of the blue – from a man saved in his phone as “Maxim”. He described the man as a Russian collector and dealer of rare books to whom he had sold antiques in the past. On the phone, Maxim allegedly expressed an interest in old books by Pushkin, and Zamtaradze had sent him photos of the most valuable Pushkins in the Vilnius library. A week later, Maxim sent Zamtaradze 12 forgeries of the same titles via a coach from Minsk, Belarus. These were of considerably higher quality than the amateurish copies that Zamtaradze had manufactured in his hotel room. Zamtaradze claimed that he entered the library, swapped the originals for the fakes, and placed the originals in a parcel on a coach back to Minsk. In return, he claimed to have received cryptocurrency worth $30,000.In court, Zamtaradze gave his buyer’s full name as “Maxim Tsitrin”, though no person with that name is known to operate in the Russian rare books trade. There is, however, a Russian book dealer named Maxim Tsipris, who is executive director of Moscow-based online bookstore Staraya Kniga (“Old Book”). In a2019 interview, Tsipris described “lifetime editions by classic authors” as the “most interesting” items on his shelves. In a phone call, Tsipris confirmed he had received my email outlining the story Zamtaradze had told the court, but failed to take up his right of reply.Whether Tsipris is the buyer of the stolen books is not known – some inside observers of the Russian book trade suggest he is too small a player to orchestrate such a large crime, and speculate that Zamtaradze may have been trying to frame him. It is also possible that there were many different buyers. According to the internet history on his iPhone, Zamtaradze searched for a Russian auction house that specialises in books, Litfund. Its director is Sergey Burmistrov, a bibliophile with impressive contacts in high office: he has previously offered expert consultancy to the Russian ministry of culture and used to run a magazine for book collectors, having been appointed to the role by Mikhail Seslavinsky, the head of the federal agency for press and mass media. After its foundation in 2014, Litfund quickly became a market leader and now operates from offices in Moscow, St Petersburg and Krasnoyarsk. In July 2023, Litfund set a new Russian record for the sale of antique books, when a copy of Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin went under the hammer for 26m rubles (£233,000).Librarians in Warsaw believe that just a few months before this record sale, Litfund also auctioned off Pushkins that had been freshly stolen from their shelves. Checking this claim is not easy, mainly because information about the content of these suspect lots has been scrubbed from the internet. Litfund’s website says the relevant lots have been “moved, deleted or may never have existed”. There is similarly no record of these lots on Bidspirit, an Israel-based web portal that tracks international auction sales. But a snapshot of the catalogue of the sale archived on Wayback Machine shows that on 22 December 2022, Litfund’s St Petersburg house did fetch 12m rubles (£107,000) for “one of the rarest editions” of Pushkin’s poems, which carried a Warsaw University Library stamp on its front page.When I contacted Burmistrov via email to ask whether Litfund had sold stolen editions of Pushkin, he told me: “We do not sell any books that carry on their pages any stamps or marks indicating their belonging to any existing state libraries, and our experts are very careful about it; we work in accordance with existing Russian laws.” Yet on 20 April 2023, Litfund sold another edition of Pushkin’s poems, this one for 2.6m rubles (£23,000). And a screenshot of the picture in Litfund’s catalogue, taken by Warsaw librarians before it was scrubbed from the web, once again shows a Warsaw University Library stamp on the first page, as well as imperfections that the librarians say were distinct to the copy held by them. Burmistrov did not respond when I put these allegations to him in an email.The mysterious novelist who foresaw Putin’s Russia – and then came to symbolise its moral decayRead moreEven if these books were indeed sold through Litfund, this does not prove that the auction house commissioned their theft. Meanwhile, the idea that the Kremlin coordinated the repatriation of valuable cultural heritage remains extremely speculative. The apparent unwillingness of Russian authorities or private companies such as Litfund to aid in the European investigation, however, suggests they are at the very least comfortable with the current outcome. Of the approximately 170 books that have gone missing, none of the originals have been recovered. “I don’t have any hope we will get them back in the near future,” said Jandy, the Polish prosecutor. “That would need cooperation with Russia, and while we’re almost at war that’s impossible.”In an article for the Russian edition of Forbes magazine published in 2024, Burmistrov waved off the allegation that the Pushkin thefts could be traced to Russia or were even part of “a special operation to export Russian books from Europe”. But his article strikes a bullish note. European libraries did not do as much to protect these valuable literary works as their Russian counterparts, he claimed – a result of a lack of interest in Russian culture, owing to geopolitical tensions. That common criminals were able get their hands on lifetime-edition Pushkins in the first place, Burmistrov seemed to imply, was above all a sign of European weakness.Additional reporting for this piece by Natalia Jalaghonia and Ada PetriczkoListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.This piece was amended on 7 October 2025 to replace an image which incorrectly identified a fake volume of Pushkin poetry.

I’d dropped out of my university literature course – with the arrogance of youth, I thought I could read books anywhere. After a chance meeting in a Putney pub, I got a job as assistant cook in theBird Observatory in Fair Isle. At that point, I didn’t even know where Fair Isle was. I came from Devon and hadn’t made it farther north than Durham. Scotland was unknown territory.Of course, Fair Isle is part of the Shetland group and lies halfway between Shetland mainland and Orkney. That summer, I fell in love with the Northern Isles, with the romance of the isolation, the bleak beauty and the stories. Over the summer, I worked in the observatory with Alison, an Orcadian lass, who was there for her college holidays. “When you’ve finished your contract,” she said with the easy hospitality of islanders everywhere, “why don’t you come and stay? It’s kind of on your way home.”A map showing the islands of OrkneyIt kind of was, and so I did. Alison lived with her parents in a solid house on the outskirts of Kirkwall. After my nine-month stay on Fair Isle – three miles long and a mile and a half wide, a scattering of crofts, 50 people and a lot of sheep and seabirds – Kirkwall felt like civilisation. There was a beautiful cathedral, a street of shops and bars, schools and a hospital. What struck me most, though, were the views. Much of Orkney mainland is low and green, and there are lochs so big that a stranger might think they were looking at the sea. So, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge sky.At that time, Alison was more into partying than history, so I didn’t do a lot of sightseeing. We went to a dance at the Harray community hall, and I drank too much. There was little communication with the locals there. I’d become used to a Shetland voice, but an Orkney accent is quite different, lilting, musical, almost Welsh. I missed much of what was said to me.Later, I got the plane to London, on my way home. If Kirkwall had seemed big, London with its towering buildings was overwhelming, and I scuttled west on the train to be on the coast again.View image in fullscreenThe Stones of Stenness.Photograph: Peter Burnett/Getty ImagesOver the years, I’ve come to know Orkney better. My husband and I went to Alison’s wedding in the cathedral. She was magnificent in a grand white dress, and she sailed up the aisle to Chariots of Fire. That evening there was another party, only a little more sedate than the Harray dance. Drink was passed round in the traditional Orkney way, in a wooden bowl, known as thecog, created for the purpose. I’m not sure what was in it, but it was warm, and it packed a punch.At other times, we stayed with friends who lived in a converted chapel, looking down to theStones of Stenness. Just as there’s always a view of water in Orkney, there’s always a reminder of its neolithic past, and I would come to explore the islands’ history more deeply when I was researching my latest novel, The Killing Stones.On Orkney, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge skyOver time, we explored some of the smaller islands: Hoy with its dramatic cliffs, the tiny island of Papa Westray, home to theKnap of Howar, the oldest domestic stone dwelling in Northern Europe, and North Ronaldsay, where we stayed in theBird Observatory’s accommodation, a reminder of the work that first took me north. North Ronaldsay is surrounded by astone dyke, not to keep animals in, but to keep them out on the shore. The island sheep have adapted to living on seaweed, and perhaps because of that the meat is delicious.For years though, Shetland was the focus of my trips north. One of my best friends lives there, and I was still writing the Jimmy Perez books, adapted for television as Shetland. In 2018, I decided to finish the series with the novel Wild Fire. I didn’t think I could find anything fresh to say about a community of only 23,000 people. I’d already killed too many of them.The book ends with Perez and his partner moving south to Orkney. Perhaps I was influenced by a real police inspector, who covered both sets of islands and made the move. Certainly, I had no intention of writing about Perez again.View image in fullscreenThe Old Man of Hoy.Photograph: North Light Images/Getty ImagesMore recently, I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summers. For the dramatic contrast between long, clear horizons and secrets hidden in small communities. I remembered that first image of Orkney, the stretches of land and water, and I realised it was time to go back. After all, to explore Perez’s new life, I’d have to stay there. It’s small details that bring a book to life, and Google research can’t help with that.I stayed with my friend Stewart in his rather grand house on Orkney mainland. He became my driver, fixer and human research. I’d met him first when he worked for Orkney libraries. We’d had book-related adventures together – flying into North Ronaldsay in the eight-seater plane to celebrate the anniversary of a scheme that brought book boxes to islanders, and a crazy attempt to set a record by doing 24 events on 24 of the Northern Isles in 24 hours. We met the challenge, but only with the support of library staff in Orkney and Shetland, and the help of other writers.I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summersMy research visit took place in December 2023. It was clear, still and very cold. The frost didn’t melt all day. Stewart took me to the island of Westray, where he grew up and his family still farms. We stayed in thePierowall Hotel, which features in the novel, and explored the site of the abandonedNoltland dignear Grobust Bay. I talked to his parents and to volunteers in the Heritage Centre. The book wouldn’t have been written without their help.Back on Orkney mainland, we explored Kirkwall and Stromness and drove south across theChurchill Barriers, the causeways built between islands after a German U-boat entered Scapa Flow in 1939 and sank HMS Royal Oak. I was met everywhere with kindness and the most useful information. The pattern of the book was starting to take shape.View image in fullscreenStromness on Orkney mainland.Photograph: Nicola Colombo/Getty ImagesI ended my stay with an almost mystical experience.Maeshoweis a neolithic burial chamber. Entry is through a low, narrow tunnel positioned so that at the winter solstice, as the sun sets behind the hills of Hoy, the light floods in. There aren’t many entirely cloudless winter dusks in Orkney, but we were lucky enough to experience the magic. In the chamber, first a trickle of apparently liquid gold ran across the floor, then it grew wider and wider until it flooded the entire space with light. As the sun set, all was dark again.I believe that setting is more than a pretty backdrop to the action. It informs character and moves the action of the plot. The Killing Stones couldn’t have been set anywhere other than Orkney, and I couldn’t have written it without spending time there with Orcadians.The Killing Stones by Ann Cleevesis published by Pan Macmillanat £22.

Inadequate staff training coupled with jammed fire doors aiding the spread of the fire and the subsequent release of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas from burning laminates resulted in the deaths of 159 people. The disaster was initially blamed on one of the passengers – a lorry driver and convicted arsonist. The fact that this suspect was also one of the fire’s casualties and thus unable to refute the charges against him was almost certainly part of the reason why the truth about the tragedy took so long to come to light. In 2020, a six-hour documentary revealed that the fire had most likely been started deliberately as part of an insurance fraud.In the first volume of Asta Olivia Nordenhof’s Scandinavian Star sequence,Money to Burn, an unnamed narrator is travelling on a bus through Copenhagen when she finds her attention drawn to an elderly man on the street outside. As the bus moves away, she has the “eerie sense” that she is carrying a part of him with her. Compelled to travel the same route again in search of him, the narrator finds herself in a landscape that is at once alien and deeply familiar. She introduces us to Maggie and Kurt, a couple whose feelings for each other are struggling to survive the pressures of their conflicted pasts. In that book’s final pages, we learn that the root of Kurt’s disaffection might possibly be found in the shattering effects of a bad investment made on his behalf by a man known as T.The Devil Book opens with an extended prose poem in which the narrator informs us of her struggle to write T’s story. “In this volume, two,” she writes, “we were supposed / to follow him/ from childhood up until / the night / when he sat waiting for / the news that / the fire / on the Scandinavian Star / had successfully been / set.” Overwhelmed by the task she has set herself and thrown off course by the pandemic, she approaches the story obliquely, as a form of parable. “I came to think / that I / can do / whatever I want / so this / is my book / this is / for you / this is / an erotic thriller / about businessmen and / the devil.”A tale gradually emerges of a woman who spends lockdown in London with a virtual stranger and who over the course of those weeks relates to him what happened to her a decade before, when she accepted an offer from a man who claimed to be the devil to grant all her wishes, so long as she didn’t question his motives in doing so. As the threads of the two stories become more intertwined, we begin to suspect that they are one and the same – or at the very least that the identity of T is legion, for there are devils everywhere.There is another fire here: a passionate, magnetic commitment to writing as a political actLiterature teaches us that it is the devil who does deals, not God, and that we engage in them at our peril. But what if the narrator herself is the devil? A third narrative comes finally to light – the story of a girl whose childhood was marred by abuse and who spent time in a psychiatric hospital, under pressure to conform with societal norms or suffer more of the same. “[The devil] knows that in the game you’ve set for it, there are two outcomes: submit or remain a monster.” A third way out is finally revealed through a series of poems to the night that are also a call to arms against the forces of capital.Many British readers of Nordenhof’s Scandinavian Star novels will think immediately of the Grenfell Tower fire, which although accidental in origin shares similarities in that the resulting tragedy and loss of life can be blamed at least partly on the devil’s bargain of putting profit over people. In these first two volumes of what is projected to be a seven-book series, the fire on board the ferry and the series of fraudulent business deals that ended in mass murder are a sinister background presence, revealing themselves only in brief flashes of detail or inference yet casting a deepening shadow over everything that occurs. Some readers may question how far it is possible to read The Devil Book as a stand-alone work, when its purpose and meaning is so intricately bound into a larger whole whose final form, at this stage, is unknowable.There will be others – and I count myself as one of them – who will fall in love with Nordenhof’s project purely as text, as properly experimental writing whose moral and artistic purpose are so deeply entwined as to make them inextricable. “Write poems / for we need / that too.” There is another fire here: a passionate, magnetic commitment to writing as a political act.

Ahmed and his family – descended from a long line of nomadic herders – raise camels on the plains of Kutch in westernIndia. Their daily rituals, making rotis over open fires and nursing their livestock, unfold in intimate, unhurried scenes.These routines are deeply in communion with nature, but the landscape has irrevocably shifted, threatening their very existence. A drought rages, leaving little water for Ahmed’s ailing animals. Climate change is not the only cause; in impressionistic wide shots, we see glimpses of wind turbines and factories, private enterprises that turn the surrounding environment into barren land. Moreover, while laws allocate grazing ground for cows and buffalo, no such measures are provided for those with camels, goats and sheep. Malnourished, Ahmed’s herd grows increasingly sick. In a heartbreaking turn, mounting debts and medical costs soon force him to sell most of his livestock.Though critical of modern commerce, Sumaria’s film does not romanticise tradition. Along with their pastoralist customs, Ahmed’s family clings on to outdated views of gender roles. Much of the housework is done by the women, including his daughter Hanifa, while her brothers are allowed to play. Here, young girls are not given a proper education; they are expected to get married young. This film could have dived deeper into these problematic aspects, linking them perhaps to the larger issues regarding the lack of government support. Nevertheless, for a feature debut, this remains a captivating and empathic portrayal of a vanishing community.Under the Open Sky is at Bertha DocHouse, London from 12 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIndiaSouth and central AsiareviewsShareReuse this content"

The subject is none other than his cousin Rodrigue, who is consumed with a weighty secret: both he and his wife Reine are living with Aids. Within their deeply religious community, the condition is sorely misunderstood; in his fervid sermons, the local pastor associates Aids and HIV with witchcraft, curses, and even God’s punishment. Such superstitious and moralistic sentiments take deep root in the minds of the believers, worsening the social stigma surrounding an ongoing health crisis.Unable to speak their truth, Rodrigue and Reine are torn between their private troubles and public personas. The sensorial soundmix powerfully conjures the cacophony of voices that envelop their daily existence. Religious preaching, received with thunderous applause merges with the twittering of rumours and gossip, along with various community quarrels. In this town, words are never just words. Rendered tactile through editing, they become the ties that bind Rodrigue and Reine to their secret.Amid this atmosphere of conservatism, the couple only find relief when they are on their own. As Rodrigue’s illnesses worsen, the cinematography lends a tableaux quality to their acts of care. Reine tends to her husband with moving tenderness, and their humble home is transformed into a safe haven for two restless souls. While the film touches on the economic and medical obstacles that hamper Aids treatment in the CAR, in focusing on this personal relationship the film emphasises that the existing hurdles are more than material. For those like Rodrigue and Reine to be freed from their burden, meaningful changes need to start from a place of empathy.The Burden is on True Story from 10 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsCentral African RepublicAids and HIVReligionAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

That is the fate of Sian Silver. Played with verve by Liz Ewing, sporting more sequins than is medically safe, she is a 75-year-old singer whose seasons in the fictional town of Sunthorpe On Sea are coming to an end.In this bijou lunchtime musical written by actor turned playwright Hannah Jarrett-Scott and actor turned composer Brian James O’Sullivan, she gives us a taste of her routine: bouncy music-hall numbers, delivered with a cheery smile and brassy confidence.On a miserly £250 a week, and with astage door Johnnystill turning up for her autograph, it is a wonder she has made it this far. Her last show was called Sinatra: Comin’ Atcha. It is not that she is bad, just hopelessly out of time.She is reminded as much by an apparition: the ghost of her younger self, played with sparkle by Julia Murray, who also doubles as Sian’s male visitors in Lesley Hart’s good-hearted production. Like a kid fromFamein silver leotard, leg warmers and flowing red curls, she has none of the regret and resentment of her older self, only positive energy. When she delivers a music-theatre style number such as I Miss My Baby When He Goes Away, she sings it like she means it.By contrast, the older Sian putting on a bright red dress to sing Tomorrow, the big hit from Annie, is creepily disturbing.For all the sweet-and-sour banter, however, the backstage misery of a faded starlet is overly familiar territory. It is hard to sympathise with an entertainer whose delusions of stardom have left her so bitter. Has it really taken her this long to see the emptiness behind the glitz? The encounter with her younger self changes little, making the play’s purpose unclear.AtÒran Mór, Glasgow, until 11 October.

Having built a career out of overcoming obstacles – breaking out of the shackles of both a girlband (the 55m-selling Pussycat Dolls) and various TV talent show judging panels – a little polite animosity isn’t going to rain on her parade. Later, during a rendition of Maybe This Time from Cabaret, just as hope overcomes despair, she introduces the crowd to her friends “Lawrence and Tony”, AKA the awards she won for her rapturously-received turn in Sunset Boulevard.Billed as An Evening with Nicole Scherzinger, tonight’s aim is to fuse all of her career tangents. Split into two acts, the first focuses mainly on musicals, from Funny Girl to Follies, plus a standard cover of Diamonds Are Forever. More memorable than the songs, however, are the in-between chats, with Scherzinger’s chaotic humour pushed to the fore. At one point, when discussing her heritage, she says “I also have some English in me …” before raising an eyebrow, pointing at her fiance and adding “his name is Tom”. By the time she shuffles off for the interval, having been onstage for less than 50 minutes, there’s a sense of having witnessed a bizarre standup routine.View image in fullscreenIn magnificent voice … Nicole Scherzinger.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockAct two changes that. She tears through I Am What I Am, her magnificent voice ricocheting overhead, and receives extended standing ovations for Sunset Boulevard’s With One Look and As If We Never Said Goodbye, which she greets like old friends. There’s also a new original song, about growing impatient with a long-term partner’s inability to pop the question. Scherzinger, aware of her esteemed environs, introduces it by listing the great wordsmiths of our age: “There’s Keats, there’s Shakespeare, there’s Scherzinger,” she says, before announcing the song’s title, Bullshit. A vampy, retro soul stomper with a country twang in the chorus, it sounds promising.Nicole Scherzinger: ‘One of my favourite British things is the roasts. Last Sunday I had two’Read moreFor the encore, she suddenly sheds the floor-length dresses and demure standards for a Pussycat Dolls medley performed in a lace jumpsuit with full choreography. The stylistic whiplash is so great you worry that some audience members may need neck braces. As the crisp electropop of her 2011 solo No 1 Don’t Hold Your Breath fills the room, everyone’s on their feet, borderline dumbstruck at what they’ve witnessed.

Impressed? OK, what if I told you that all this merely describes the first album on the shortlist?Such is the radical eclecticism of female trioAdwaith’s Solas, a double album, sung in Welsh and recorded in various locations including the Outer Hebrides and the drummer’s parents’ barn. How, I wondered – just 20 minutes into a playlist of 15 albums that stretched over 10 hours – was anything expected to beat this?When I agreed to be a judge for this year’s WMP, now in its 15th year, it wasn’t as if I was unaware of the strength and diversity of Welsh music. Previous winners have included Joanna Gruesome’s noise-pop debut Weird Sister, harpist Georgia Ruth’s Week of Pines andlast year’s winnerBlood, Sweat & Fears by rapper Lemfreck.But still, there were dazzling records on this shortlist by artists I’d never even heard of, though in the case of Tai Haf Heb Drigolyn’s Ein Albwm Cyntaf Ni, my ignorance can perhaps be excused given that was only physically released on a limited edition cassette run of 50, and its biggest bit of press to date seems to be an enthusiastic endorsement from 67-year-old punk poet Attila the Stockbroker in the Morning Star. It turned out to be a defiantly lo-fi yet irrepressibly melodic way to spend half an hour.I had my own favourites on the list – indeed, I had to resist wearing myTubsT-shirt for the judging session for fear that it might have been deemed a subversive attempt to swing the jury in favour of my favourite indie band in years. The Tubs’ debut Dead Meat hijacked my stereo throughout 2024 in a way that bordered on obsessional. Cotton Crown was a strong follow-up, not least because the band’s ability to marry sunny jangle-pop with sharp lyrics about deteriorating mental health reached its zenith on the final track Strange, in which singer Owen Williams opened up about the suicide of his mother, the musician and writerCharlotte Greig. Choosing to focus on the more peculiar aspects of grief nobody prepares you for – the way friends would only bring it up when they were high, the things Williams might say to play it down (“I say it makes me more interesting / Then we laugh, and then it’s all fine”) – this was evidence that Williams is one of the most insightful lyricists around at the moment.Kelly Lee Owens’Dreamstatealso made a big impression on me – a synth-driven reframing of daydreaming as an act of resistance to capitalism. It opened with precision-honed dancefloor tracks but also slowed down the tempo for a few ballads in its relentless quest for transcendence.Other judges on the panel passionately championed their own choices. We went through the shortlist album by album, covering anthemic emo (Breichiau Hir’s Y Dwylo Uwchben), uplifting Taylor Swift-esque pop (teenage singer Buddug’s Rhwng Gwyll a Gwawr), inventive solo piano compositions (Cerys Hafana’s Difrisg), diaristic dreamscapes (Gwenno’s Utopia), Emitt Rhodes-style power pop (Keys’ Acid Communism), cinematic electronica (Siula’s Night Falls on the World), drunken punk (Panic Shack’s self-titled debut) and – what else? – a psychedelic concept album about a utopian village in which the local mill is powered by music (Melin Melyn’s Mill on the Hill). The Gentle Good’s Elan was notable for its track Desert of Wales, a collaboration with Rajasthani folk pioneers SAZ. Sage Todz’s Stopia Cwyno (which translates as Stop Moaning) involved the rapper exploring his own version of Welsh patriotism.And yet despite the formidable competition, there was one record that seemed to encapsulate everything so vital and vibrant about this shortlist. Don Leisure is the stage name of producer Aly Jamal, a crate-digging hip-hop artist who was invited to get inventive with the freshly digitised catalogue ofesteemed and historic Welsh label Sain. Like a one-man Welsh Avalanches, Jamal dived into the nooks and crannies of the catalogue, digging out some extremely niche cuts from the 60s and 70s – alongside more present-day recordings – and transforming them into fresh new sounds. It wasn’t just that I hadn’t heard this source material before – I had no idea Welsh music had ever sounded like this.‘Together in creativity for peace!’ Sain, the indie label pushing Welsh music forward for 56 yearsRead moreListen to Tyrchu Sain blind and you’d probably guess its source material was taken from across the globe – there are harpsichords, spiritual chants, psychedelic rock riffs. Even the more traditional material, such as Delwyn Sion’s Aros yn Dy Gwmni, is given a crackling makeover: Gruff Rhys is enlisted to transform Sion’s original into a gorgeously dreamy outsider pop song.Jamal has talked about how digging into the history of Welsh music led to him think about his own family’s roots in India and east Africa. That’s maybe the genius of Tyrchu Sain: that it feels like a tour of the world as well as a tour of Welsh music history; a record that encompasses the past, present and burning bright future of Welsh music.Explore more on these topicsMusicAwards and prizesPop and rockHip-hopFolk musicPunkPsychedeliacommentShareReuse this content"

I’d dropped out of my university literature course – with the arrogance of youth, I thought I could read books anywhere. After a chance meeting in a Putney pub, I got a job as assistant cook in theBird Observatory in Fair Isle. At that point, I didn’t even know where Fair Isle was. I came from Devon and hadn’t made it farther north than Durham. Scotland was unknown territory.Of course, Fair Isle is part of the Shetland group and lies halfway between Shetland mainland and Orkney. That summer, I fell in love with the Northern Isles, with the romance of the isolation, the bleak beauty and the stories. Over the summer, I worked in the observatory with Alison, an Orcadian lass, who was there for her college holidays. “When you’ve finished your contract,” she said with the easy hospitality of islanders everywhere, “why don’t you come and stay? It’s kind of on your way home.”A map showing the islands of OrkneyIt kind of was, and so I did. Alison lived with her parents in a solid house on the outskirts of Kirkwall. After my nine-month stay on Fair Isle – three miles long and a mile and a half wide, a scattering of crofts, 50 people and a lot of sheep and seabirds – Kirkwall felt like civilisation. There was a beautiful cathedral, a street of shops and bars, schools and a hospital. What struck me most, though, were the views. Much of Orkney mainland is low and green, and there are lochs so big that a stranger might think they were looking at the sea. So, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge sky.At that time, Alison was more into partying than history, so I didn’t do a lot of sightseeing. We went to a dance at the Harray community hall, and I drank too much. There was little communication with the locals there. I’d become used to a Shetland voice, but an Orkney accent is quite different, lilting, musical, almost Welsh. I missed much of what was said to me.Later, I got the plane to London, on my way home. If Kirkwall had seemed big, London with its towering buildings was overwhelming, and I scuttled west on the train to be on the coast again.View image in fullscreenThe Stones of Stenness.Photograph: Peter Burnett/Getty ImagesOver the years, I’ve come to know Orkney better. My husband and I went to Alison’s wedding in the cathedral. She was magnificent in a grand white dress, and she sailed up the aisle to Chariots of Fire. That evening there was another party, only a little more sedate than the Harray dance. Drink was passed round in the traditional Orkney way, in a wooden bowl, known as thecog, created for the purpose. I’m not sure what was in it, but it was warm, and it packed a punch.At other times, we stayed with friends who lived in a converted chapel, looking down to theStones of Stenness. Just as there’s always a view of water in Orkney, there’s always a reminder of its neolithic past, and I would come to explore the islands’ history more deeply when I was researching my latest novel, The Killing Stones.On Orkney, there are long vistas from land to water and then land again. And more water. All under a huge skyOver time, we explored some of the smaller islands: Hoy with its dramatic cliffs, the tiny island of Papa Westray, home to theKnap of Howar, the oldest domestic stone dwelling in Northern Europe, and North Ronaldsay, where we stayed in theBird Observatory’s accommodation, a reminder of the work that first took me north. North Ronaldsay is surrounded by astone dyke, not to keep animals in, but to keep them out on the shore. The island sheep have adapted to living on seaweed, and perhaps because of that the meat is delicious.For years though, Shetland was the focus of my trips north. One of my best friends lives there, and I was still writing the Jimmy Perez books, adapted for television as Shetland. In 2018, I decided to finish the series with the novel Wild Fire. I didn’t think I could find anything fresh to say about a community of only 23,000 people. I’d already killed too many of them.The book ends with Perez and his partner moving south to Orkney. Perhaps I was influenced by a real police inspector, who covered both sets of islands and made the move. Certainly, I had no intention of writing about Perez again.View image in fullscreenThe Old Man of Hoy.Photograph: North Light Images/Getty ImagesMore recently, I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summers. For the dramatic contrast between long, clear horizons and secrets hidden in small communities. I remembered that first image of Orkney, the stretches of land and water, and I realised it was time to go back. After all, to explore Perez’s new life, I’d have to stay there. It’s small details that bring a book to life, and Google research can’t help with that.I stayed with my friend Stewart in his rather grand house on Orkney mainland. He became my driver, fixer and human research. I’d met him first when he worked for Orkney libraries. We’d had book-related adventures together – flying into North Ronaldsay in the eight-seater plane to celebrate the anniversary of a scheme that brought book boxes to islanders, and a crazy attempt to set a record by doing 24 events on 24 of the Northern Isles in 24 hours. We met the challenge, but only with the support of library staff in Orkney and Shetland, and the help of other writers.I felt a longing to go north again in my fiction, a kind of homesickness for the islands, for the dark winters and the bright, light summersMy research visit took place in December 2023. It was clear, still and very cold. The frost didn’t melt all day. Stewart took me to the island of Westray, where he grew up and his family still farms. We stayed in thePierowall Hotel, which features in the novel, and explored the site of the abandonedNoltland dignear Grobust Bay. I talked to his parents and to volunteers in the Heritage Centre. The book wouldn’t have been written without their help.Back on Orkney mainland, we explored Kirkwall and Stromness and drove south across theChurchill Barriers, the causeways built between islands after a German U-boat entered Scapa Flow in 1939 and sank HMS Royal Oak. I was met everywhere with kindness and the most useful information. The pattern of the book was starting to take shape.View image in fullscreenStromness on Orkney mainland.Photograph: Nicola Colombo/Getty ImagesI ended my stay with an almost mystical experience.Maeshoweis a neolithic burial chamber. Entry is through a low, narrow tunnel positioned so that at the winter solstice, as the sun sets behind the hills of Hoy, the light floods in. There aren’t many entirely cloudless winter dusks in Orkney, but we were lucky enough to experience the magic. In the chamber, first a trickle of apparently liquid gold ran across the floor, then it grew wider and wider until it flooded the entire space with light. As the sun set, all was dark again.I believe that setting is more than a pretty backdrop to the action. It informs character and moves the action of the plot. The Killing Stones couldn’t have been set anywhere other than Orkney, and I couldn’t have written it without spending time there with Orcadians.The Killing Stones by Ann Cleevesis published by Pan Macmillanat £22.

The UK is not part of the Schengen area.Instead of using stamps, countries in the zone will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates.“The EES will gradually replace passport stamps with a digital system that records when travellers enter and exit, making border checks faster and helping staff to work more efficiently,” the EU’s official website says.This is also aimed at preventing irregular migration and giving border enforcement more access to travellers’ information, which the countries say will decrease security risks.When will it happen?While the rollout begins this weekend,the changes will be gradual, with the EES expected to be fully operational by 10 April 2026.‘Like it had been put on Earth specially for me’: readers’ favourite European city breaksRead moreWho will be affected?Anyone without a EU passport travelling to the Schengen area countries for a short period will use the EES, which is free.A short stay means up to 90 days within any 180-day period, according to Travel Europe. This period is calculated as a single period for all the European countries using the EES.If travellers use the self-serve system available at their destination, or a mobile app if the country they are travelling to offers one, crossing the border will be quicker.What do travellers need to do?Once travellers have arrived, they will have to answer the Schengen border code questions, which will create a record of their details. This record is held for three years so only fingerprints or photographs will be used for re-entry in that timeframe.The Australian government’sSmartraveller site is warningthat the rollout may create delays at first: “The registration process should only take a few minutes, but when the system starts, you may experience longer border queues.”Staying longer than 180 days?Australia has visa waiver agreements with several countries in the Schengen area, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.Each of these countries offers visa waivers in its own way, and travellers planning longer stays will need to make sure they know what the agreement is.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Union holidaysEuropeEuropean UnionBiometricsEurope holidaysexplainersShareReuse this content"

That’s good dolloped on the side of sausages, and it keeps and freezes well, too.Mark Diacono, author ofAbundance, says Emily should consider going down two main savoury routes: “One is to use apples almost like a mild spice – something that you wouldn’t necessarily pick up is there, but you’d miss it if it wasn’t.” Take celeriac and apple soup as an example: “I love celeriac a great deal, but if you’re not careful, it can make a soup that would hold wallpaper to the vertical.” Introduce some apple to the mix, however, and the fruit will change the texture of the celeriac, and also soften its bitterness: “It just lets a bit of air out of its tyres. You wouldn’t perhaps say, ‘That’s celeriac and apple soup’, but you would say, ‘That’s an amazing soup’. And that would be down to the apple doing its thing.”The fruit’s other “thing”, Diacono says, is contrast, both in terms of flavour and texture, which is perhaps best shown in a tumble salad: “One of those where you’ve got bitter leaves, the sweetness of, say, roast beetroot [though you could use pickled, too], some root veg [maybe parsnip, maybe carrot], walnuts or hazelnuts, soft cheese, salt, and the apple, either raw and cut into wedges, or even lightly fried in a bit of bacon fat, which I really like.”There are, of course, a huge number of apple varieties grown in the UK, so which work best? Diacono would come at it from the other direction and instead build the salad to suit the particular apple that needs using up: “I’d be happy with a sharper apple, some salty cheese and a bitter leaf, but if I had something more aromatic – less granny smith and more braeburn, or russet, if I was lucky enough to get my hands on one – I’d go for the likes of burrata or mozzarella.”Finally, for any apple peelings or cores that aren’t destined for the compost, Labron-Johnson suggests turning them into vinegar. “There are two ways to do this: either steep your apple scraps in an existing vinegar – something like a nice white-wine or cider vinegar, say – or make your own by steeping them in water with a bit of sugar and leaving to oxidise.” That’d work a treat in sauces, or simply reduce with some honey to make a sharp syrup and use that to glaze meat (think pork belly or duck) or onions. It’s sure to keep the doctor away, too.Got a culinary dilemma?

In the Middle East there arekofta, in Italypolpette, in Franceboulettes, in Germanyfrikadellenand in Spain we call themalbóndigas(oralmóndigasas it’s pronounced in my village in Extremadura). The Moors brought them to Spain centuries ago, and they quickly became an integral part of our cooking culture, a dish to share with family and friends. In fact, they don’t even need to include any actual meat: in today’s dish, I make them with a hearty, earthy and slightly sweet combination of chickpeas, parsnip and apple, and serve them in a rich, golden and full-flavoured saffron and tomato broth.Parsnip, apple and chickpea albóndigas in saffron-tomato brothPrep15 minCook45 minServes4-61 tbsp olive oil1 small onion, peeled and chopped2 celery sticks, trimmed and chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed6 large ripe vine tomatoes, chopped1.2 litres good vegetable stockSalt and black pepper1 good pinch saffron threadsExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishFor the albóndigas570g jar chickpeas, drained1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 large parsnip(200g), peeled and coarsely grated1 small apple, peeled, cored and grated1 tsp ground cumin1 good pinch chilli flakes50g fresh white breadcrumbs1 largeegg1 handful finely chopped flat-leaf parsleyOlive oil, for fryingFirst, make the broth. Put the oil in a saucepan on a medium-low heat, add the onion, celery and garlic, and cook gently, stirring often, for five minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and stock, season and bring to a simmer. Leave to cook for 10-15 minutes, then crumble in the saffron and cook for 10 minutes more. Fine strain, pressing down on the solids to extract every last drop of liquid, then return the broth to the pan;discardthe solids.Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mash the chickpeas with a fork – you want them fairly well combined, but with a few whole and big bits of chickpea still in there. Mix in the crushed garlic, grated parsnip and apple, spices, breadcrumbs and egg, then add the parsley and plenty of seasoning, and mix until it’s all well combined. Meanwhile, heat a thin layer of oil in a nonstick frying pan.Scoop spoonfuls of the chickpea mixture into your hand and shape them into good-sized balls – you want them to be a bit bigger than a walnut – then fry in batches, turning regularly, for three or four minutes, until they’re golden all over – take care when you turn them, because the balls are delicate and you don’t want them to break up.Divide the fried albóndigas between warmed shallow bowls. Heat the broth to a simmer, then ladle some over each portion of albondigas. Drizzle over some good oil, and serve with a final twist of black pepper.Explore more on these topicsSpanish food and drinkMain courseFoodVegetarian food and drinkVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
