Another cloudless sunny day. The water mill-pond flat. What better way to pass the time than to take to sea and film yourself for X? This was the world shaped in his own image. A small rubber boat, rammed with irregular migrants being escorted across the Channel. First by the French navy, then by UK Border Force.And Nige wouldn’t have wanted it any other way. Every successful migrant fuels his grievance and adds to his popularity. He’d be gutted if the French made more efforts to stop the flow of migrants. Would be at a loss to know what to do with himself. But for Keir Starmer, who was in the middle of trying to negotiate a migrant deal withEmmanuel Macron, the image of another small boat arrival was distinctly suboptimal.When an international press conference gets delayed it generally only means one thing: that one side is less than happy with the deal negotiated and is desperately trying to secure a better deal. Begging, pleading. Anything to be able to say they have got something to shout about. Otherwise, the whole thing is a bit of a letdown. All that work. All the pageantry. The royal banquets. The honour of an address in the royal gallery to both houses of parliament. And for what? A result you’re going to struggle to sell to a sceptical nation.The presser at the Northwood headquarters to mark the end of the Anglo-French summit and Macron’s three-day state visit to the UK was originally scheduled for 3.30pm. That came and went with no sign of the prime minister or the French president. We waited. And waited. Then came the news it would start at 4pm. Both men would definitely, definitely be ready by then. The time slipped by. You could almost hear Keir saying: “Please, please. Manu, you’ve got to give me something more than that. I can’t go on live TV with what I’ve got.”The next deadline was 4.20pm. Still no one. Eventually, at 4.30pm, an hour later than planned, both men appeared. Presumably, Macron had finally convinced Keir that there was no better deal to be had. He would have to make do with the one the French had leaked to the press the night before. And if Keir didn’t get the press conference done and dusted right now, he would be doing it on his own. Emmanuel had a plane to catch.It was Keir who went first. Trying to look happy. As if everything had been a great success. What we had to remember, he began, was that the president’s state visit had never been about the deals that could be struck on the periphery. It had been about the vibes. Two world leaders – the only two in Europe with nukes – who were also besties. And it had all gone off superbly on that score. He was just sorry to see Manu go back to France. He wished the visit could have been even longer. Macron nodded bashfully.Then Starmer moved on to the details. He might as well get the immigration deal out of the way first. They had agreed a brilliant pilot scheme, the first of its kind. He didn’t go into the numbers. No point in turning the proceedings into a real downer. People coming to the UK would be detained and then sent back to France. It would be a real deterrent. He made it sound as if every irregular migrant who arrived in Dover would be on their way back to France. Not just 50 a week. And in return for each, we would take one legitimate asylum seeker from France. But this, he assured us, would be a major deterrent to anyone thinking of making the crossing. Above all, he definitely, definitely wasn’t in the slightest bit disappointed. This was the most historic of days for serious diplomacy. And the world. Where we lead, others will follow. Over to you, Emmanuel.The main thing we learned from the French president was that he clearly loves the sound of his own voice. I take it all back about Keir. I’ve sometimes suggested in the past that he can be a bit boring and drone on a bit. But compared with Macron, he’s Mr Laconic. The master of brevity. Or maybe it’s just that the president loses something in translation. Though, after also saying how much he had enjoyed himself en Angleterre, it turned out that the president’s recollection of the meetings he had had over the last three days were somewhat different to the prime minister’s. Or rather, he had very different priorities.Macron waxed lyrical – a good 10 minutes or so – on the nuclear agreements, the coalition of the willing and the strategic benefits of the new defence pact. Just as we were hoping Emmanuel was winding up what were meant to be a few brief opening remarks and not another state address to the UK nation, he took a deep breath and spoke for another 10 minutes about EDF, the Bayeux tapestry and Sutton Hoo. The latter being the one unequivocally one in, one out deal the two leaders did get over the line.Almost as an afterthought –et une autre chose– Macron turned his attention to irregular migration. Oh that? He had almost forgotten about that in all the excitement of meeting the king. First, he wanted to let the Brits know that the French were busting a gut to stem the flow of migrants. But it wasn’t his problem if they all were dead set on coming to the UK. And he had shut down the road and rail routes, mainly because the smugglers had worked out that small boats were a great deal easier.It was mainly a UK problem, he suggested. Keir should stop telling people what a great success he was making of running the country. He was only adding to the pull factors. And if the Brits really want to understand the massive increase in immigration, they only had to look to Brexit. We Brits had been duped. Brexit had only made it harder for the UK to return irregular migrants to the countries from which they had departed. So suck it up.Keir and Emmanuel shook hands. Unsure of whether to go for the full man hug. The bromance was still intact. Just about.Merci et bonne nuit.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumThe politics sketchKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacroncommentShareReuse this content"

If not now, when?Thu 10 Jul 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 14.01 EDTShareIt was only a handful of “middle-class women of a certain age”. That’s how the MasterChef host Gregg Wallace originally dismissed his accusers, when allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour first surfaced. Just a few humourless posh birds, in other words, who couldn’t take a joke from the self-styled “cheeky greengrocer” and star of a cookery show enjoyed by – well, lots of other middle-class women of a certain age, for starters.But those jokes were apparently sexualised enough that the former Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark, no shrinking violet,raised concerns privatelywith producers after appearing as a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef. Meanwhile, her fellow broadcaster Kirstie Allsopp, whorecalled Wallaceallegedly describing a sex act with his partner within an hour of meeting her at work, succinctly described all the reasons women mostly didn’t say anything at the time: “Because you feel, in no particular order, embarrassed, a prude, shocked, waiting for a male colleague to call him out, not wanting to ‘rock the boat’, thinking it’s better to plough on with the day, assuming you misheard/misunderstood or just don’t get the joke.”Or, of course, because you’re frightened that if you complain you won’t get hired again – which is precisely why it’s often those pesky older women, financially secure and senior enough not to be easily brushed off, who end up making a fuss on behalf of those who can’t.We now know thatmore than 50 people, in addition to the 13 who originally complained to BBC News, have come forward after an inquiry into Wallace’s conduct set up by Banijay, the production company behind MasterChef. Many were said to be young women on precarious freelance contracts, scared of losing work in a ridiculously competitive industry.One was in her 20s when she claims Wallace pushed her on to the sofa in his dressing room and dropped his trousers; when she reported the alleged incident to senior staff, she was allegedly informed that she was over 16, so “you’re not being Jimmy Saviled”. Another alleged that Wallace put his hand on her groin under the table at a dinner ahead of filming the cookery show Saturday Kitchen, asking if she liked it. (Wallace, for his part, insists the most serious allegations against him have been dismissed; at the time of writing, the report is still unpublished.)So far, so familiar, from all the other stories of big shots behaving badly that women are sick and tired of hearing but from which some institutions still can’t seem to learn. It’s happening fromTVtopolitics, banking to and sport. For the avoidance of any doubt, the take-home lesson from this parade of the gropey, the sleazy and the justifiably cancelled has never been thatgreat men – for it’s usually men – just come with baggage, like tortured latter-day artistic geniuses. More banally, it’s that people mostly do what they can get away with, and those who make a fortune for their employers or shareholders are often allowed to get away with way too much. But this particular iteration of the story comes with an unexpected twist, namely Gregg Wallace’s apparently unswerving belief that the real victim here is Gregg Wallace.He was hired, he protested on Instagram, to be “a real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all”, and for 21 years that was the brand; only now, “in a sanitised world”, have the rough edges suddenly become a problem. (Though isn’t the point of creative industries that they move constantly with the times? How many brands wouldn’t need a refresh after two decades?) But crucially, Wallace went on to add that he was recently diagnosed as autistic, after years of speculation that he might be neurodivergent: while he admits his language was sometimes inappropriate, he is angry that the BBC apparently did nothing “to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment”. (Dangerous for him, presumably, rather than the women, though I do see why you might be confused.) Friends of the presenter, meanwhile, blamed his reported habit of not wearing underpants – a recurrent theme of the allegations – on “hypersensitivity to labels and tight clothing”.As it happens, this week I read a moving interview with the England footballer Lucy Bronze, also diagnosed with autism as an adult. She spent her 20s struggling desperately to fit in, making herself “feel uncomfortable so that others felt more comfortable”, she told Women’s Health magazine: she would watch and copy her team-mate Jill Scott, teaching herself to make eye contact like the other players did even though it felt unnatural. (Even now, she finds hugging people difficult.)Let’s just say Bronze’s story will probably resonate a lot more than Wallace’s with the many, many autistic people quietly exhausting themselves trying to decipher and comply with all the unspoken etiquette of office life – the things most people just absorb without even thinking about it – who have nonetheless managednotto be accused of sexual harassment. No autistic person needs the added stigma of being associated with trouser-dropping.But even taking at face value Wallace’s argument that theBBCshould have done more to protect him from himself, what helps most autistic people (and actually many neurotypical people) thrive at work is setting very clear rules, spelling out exactly what is and isn’t done in your organisation. As luck would have it, that kind of clarity would be an absolute godsend for the prospective victims of sexual harassment, too.TV freelancers fearful of speaking up, union leader says after firing of Gregg WallaceRead moreThis week, the government announced that it will implement a form of Zelda’s law – named after Zelda Perkins, former PA to the rapist Harvey Weinstein – banning employers fromusing non-disclosure agreementsto silence victims of sexual harassment. It’s a nice change from the days when the Labour partystood accusedof asking its own staff to sign them, and an important step towards transparency. But for most women, it’s not a formal gagging order so much as fear of professional repercussions or a fumbled investigation that stops them speaking up.Ultimately, there’s no substitute for managers or board members actually managing: drawing red lines around what is acceptable, and then enforcing it from top to bottom, so that everyone – no matter how senior or junior, how good or bad at reading a room – knows where they stand. Of course, it’s embarrassing having to tell someone that their smutty jokes aren’t safe for work, that their manner is terrifying, that they can’t carry on like it’s the 1980s. But it’s even more embarrassing, as theMasterChefsaga illustrates, for everyone to end up this publicly in the soup.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But should finding out something is a cheap dupe really make us enjoy it less?Nell StevensThu 10 Jul 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 11.38 EDTShareMany years ago, I met a man in a pub in Bloomsbury who said he worked at theBritish Museum. He told me that every single item on display in the museum was a replica, and that all the original artefacts were locked away in storage for preservation.I was shocked and challenged him. It surely could not be the case that millions of annual visitors to the British Museum were encountering and experiencing not tangible, concrete treasures of human history, but the shallow simulacra of replicas. I may have even used the term “fraud”.Yet on my way home that night, I began to question my own experiences at the British Museum. I wondered what it meant if the Greek water jar I had been so moved by, depicting a woman who may have been Sappho bent over a scroll, had in fact been a worthless copy. Did that make the experience any less real?Later, Googling, I discovered that none of what the man had told me was true. The artefacts in the British Museumareoriginal, unless otherwise explicitly stated. It was the man who claimed to work there who was a fake.View image in fullscreenAre the brushstrokes too rough, the colours too unusual? … visitors admire Samson and Delilah by Peter Paul Rubens at the National Gallery in London.Photograph: Guy Bell/AlamySo began my years-long fascination with the question of fakes, and the way we feel in their presence. If that Greek water jarhadbeen a fake, I could never have known just by looking with an inexpert but appreciative eye. Would it devalue my overwhelming sense of connection to the past in the moment I saw it? This is one of the questions that led me to write my new novel, The Original, about fakes and the people who fall for them. Following a female art forger at the end of the 19th century, the book is about making and believing in fake art, fake stories, and fake people. I wanted to think, in the story, about the experience of being duped, because we live in a world that feels, at times, increasingly fake.Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum ofArtin New York, has suggested that about 40% of artworks for sale are fake. Yan Walther, chief of the Fine Arts Expert Institute, puts the figure at 50%.That muscular back! Those fleshy breasts! The National Gallery’s ‘fake’ Rubens looks very real to meRead moreLast month, debate over the authenticityof Rubens’ Samson and Delilah, bought by the National Gallery for £2.5m in 1980, reignited. The painting, dating from 1609 or 1610, was lost for centuries, and since arriving at the National Gallery has been subject to repeated controversies surrounding its authenticity. Are the brushstrokes too rough, the colours too unusual? Is the composition too different to copies of the original that were made at the time it was painted? Speaking to the Guardian, the former National Gallery curator Christopher Brown, who oversaw its original acquisition, appeared to suggest that the gallery itself had been responsible for replacing the painting’s backing board, so destroying evidence about the painting’s real age and provenance (he later went back on this statement) which sparked suspicion the Gallery may have covered up a fake for decades. The National Gallery responded by saying: “Samson and Delilah has long been accepted as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. Not one single Rubens specialist has doubted that the picture is by Rubens. A full discussion of the panel was published by Joyce Plesters and David Bomford in the Gallery’s Technical Bulletin in 1983, when Christopher Brown was the Gallery’s curator responsible for the picture. Their findings remain valid, including their unequivocal statement that the panel was attached to a support before the picture was acquired by the National Gallery.”View image in fullscreenCo-owner of the Vienna Museum of Art Fakes Diana Grobe with a Tom Keating work painted after the French impressionist Jean Puy.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesThis latest controversy follows a study conducted a few years earlier, during which an AI analysis of its brushstroke patterns found there was a 90% probability the painting was fake. I visited the painting after that story broke, having by then developed a slight obsession with questions of authenticity. It was the autumn of 2021 and we were all still adjusting to existing in the world beyond lockdowns. Seeing a painting in the flesh felt novel; the colours vivid: Delilah’s illuminated neck, Samson’s gleaming muscles, the shadowed scissors at the moment his hair is cut. The texture of those questionable brushstrokes was exhilarating. I stood in front of the painting and I wanted it to be real because I liked it so much.A 2014 study published in the journal Leonardo tested how the belief in authenticity of art shapes our perception of it. Participants were shown paintings labelled either originals or, erroneously, copies, then asked to rate their experience. Paintings that were labelled as copies were consistently rated as less moving, less well-made, less well-composed and the work of less talented artists. It’s a stark example of the extent to which our experience of art is moulded by the story we are told about it: the value we place on authenticity trumps reason, perception, our own eyes. A copy is automatically worse, even when it’s not really a copy.View image in fullscreenWoman Reading Music, 1935-1940, by Han van Meegeren.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThis same quirk of human impulse comes up in all sorts of other contexts. There are those expert sommeliers who are unable, under study conditions, to tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine. So-called “dupes” of high-end fashion items are a part of the clothing industry’s ecosystem; the internet is full of videos of vox pops in which people fail to identify, when faced with two near-identical outfits, which one cost tens and which thousands of pounds. Human beings are pretty inept at understanding our world without context, without story.As you wander through the Museum of Art Fakes in Vienna, an institution dedicated to showcasing the art of forgery, what strikes you most is how unconvincing it all is, how hazy and dilapidated the fakes look. The colours look wrong. The materials look cheap. The brushstrokes look lazy and the way the paint adheres to the canvases seems insubstantial. But then, how could these pieces look otherwise, housed as they are in the Museum of Art Fakes? Removed from this cheapening context,Han van Meegeren’s Vermeers, once pronounced “the finest gems of the master’s oeuvre”, appear lovely, almost otherworldly. To emerge from the Museum of Art Fakes and head straight into Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum to view works by Vermeer and Rubens is an upending experience: you feel so certain, looking at those paintings, that you’re in the presence of originals. Then you think about how they might appear if they were displayed in the unassuming basement gallery of the Museum of Art Fakes, and that certainty begins to fade.It’s striking that we have turned to AI to help us solve our authenticity questions (where humans err, artificial intelligence can distil brushstroke patterns to mere data points) when AI is simultaneously creating fakes at a rate previously unimaginable. Our online world is littered with photographs of people who don’t exist, articles recommending books that have never been written, videos of imaginary places. Even as we learn to spot the tell-tale glitches of an AI-generated image (too many fingers, those terrifying misaligned teeth, an Escher-like impossible quality to the structure of buildings, furniture, bodies), AI improves and outpaces us again. It’s embarrassing to admit to having felt a rush of interest or pleasure at a video of, say, a lamp-lit hillside village in the rain, only to realise it’s a nonsense, empty fantasy, and worse: twee. To realise you have fallen for an AI-generated image, song or essay, untouched by a human mind, is to feel at once less human and horribly, vulnerably human: foolish and naive.View image in fullscreenMaster forger Tom Keating in 1977.Photograph: John Dee/ShutterstockHuman fakes, when contrasted with the emptiness of AI, start to seem quite affecting: the mischief of them, the skill and the audacity of the endeavour. Even the art market, on occasion, agrees: the works of prolific forger Tom Keating, who produced thousands of fakes in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, are now collector’s items in their own right, to the extent thatfakes of Tom Keating fakes began to appear too. Perhaps it’s no wonder that such forgeries can move us, designed as they are to do just that, to be paintings of paintings and at the same time, blank canvases upon which we project all the things we want to care about and experience when we look at art.When I think back to my conversation with the man in the pub years ago, it strikes me that there is something wonderful in having believed him. Perhaps there is beauty in embracing the lessons taught by fakes, that what we bring to art is our human selves: subjective, easily bamboozled, ready to be moved. The man who entertained himself one winter’s night by telling a silly lie to a credulous stranger, inadvertently led me instead to something true.The Original by Nell Stevens is published by Scribner (£16.99).

And should readers really feel betrayed?Lucy KnightThu 10 Jul 2025 06.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 07.51 EDTShare“The Salt Path is an unflinchingly honest, inspiring and life-affirming true story,” reads the description of Raynor Winn’s bestselling memoir on its publisher Penguin Random House’s website.View image in fullscreenWhich is unfortunate wording if accusations made at the weekend turn out to be true: aninvestigation by the Observeralleged that the 2018 book – which has recently been adapted intoa film starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs– is not all that it seems. Winn writes in The Salt Path that she and her husband, Moth, had their home repossessed due to an investment in a friend’s company that went on to fail. With nowhere to live, as she tells it, the couple decided to walk the length of the South West Coast Path, wild camping along the way and relying on the kindness of strangers. The Observer piece suggests Winn’s account of becoming homeless is untruthful, and reports that she took £64,000 from her former employer. It also questions the legitimacy of Moth’s diagnosis with the neurological condition corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a core part of the memoir.Winn’s immediate response called the article “highly misleading”, adding: “We are taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time.” She stood by her book being “the true story of our journey”. Still, after the report, PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and formerly worked with Winn and her husband,terminated its relationshipwith the couple.On Wednesday, Winn published a moredetailed statement, defending her book’s truthfulness and giving more detail about the events that led to the couple losing their home. She also provided medical letters addressed to her husband in defence of allegations relating to his illness.This is not the first time a much-hyped memoir has come up against accusations of lying.Belgium-born Misha Defonseca’s 1997 bookabout how she was raised by wolves during the second world war turned out to be completely fabricated.Love and Consequences by Margaret B Jones, which was sold on release in 2008 as the true story of the author’s experience growing up as a mixed-race foster child in South Central Los Angeles, turned out to have been written by Margaret Seltzer, a white, privately educated woman who grew up with her biological family.View image in fullscreenJames Frey at the Union Chapel, London, in 2011.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPerhaps the most famous instance isJames Frey’s A Million Little Pieces, a 2003 memoir of drug addiction and alcoholism that, after being championed by Oprah Winfrey in 2005, shot to the top of the New York Times bestseller list and remained there for 15 weeks. It was billed as “brutally honest”, but later it came to light that chunks of the book had been made up. Winfrey in particular was furious with Frey, telling him it was difficult to talk to him when he came on her TV show to explain himself in 2006. “I feel duped,” she said. “But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers.”“How could they lie?” is a question many readers ask when a memoir they love is proved to be untrue. But there’s another question that needs to be answered, too: how could the authorget awaywith it? How did they manage to get their lies past an agent and multiple editors, all the way into a published book labelled as a true story?The short answer is that if someone is lying about their own life, it is often very difficult for others to tell. Dr Pragya Agarwal, the author of books including the2021 memoir (M)otherhoodand a teacher of memoir writing, says that a big part of writing nonfiction “is about trust between the writer and the reader. I am not really sure how someone’s life story can be factchecked in its entirety.”Others say it is not the publisher’s role to investigate whether an author is telling the truth or not. Grace Pengelly is a freelance writer and editor who formerly worked as a nonfiction commissioning editor at HarperCollins. An editor’s role “is to help the author craft their story as compellingly and accurately as possible”, she says, and that requires believing in the writer. “Without a certain degree of trust from the outset, it is difficult for an editor and author to work with each other effectively.”That doesn’t mean that memoirs are not fact-checked. “Prior to acquiring a memoir, a publisher would look into the background of the author and their story to see if it checks out,” says Pengelly. Any “question marks around the veracity of an author’s story would definitely be a reason why a publisher wouldn’t offer on a book”. But the research undertaken at this stage wouldn’t tend to involve checking whether someone was actually incarcerated for as long as they said they were (one of the major falsities in A Million Little Pieces), or whether a couple who claimed to be homeless actually owned a property in the south of France, as was alleged by the Observer regarding Winn and her husband (a property Winn has since described as an “uninhabitable ruin”).View image in fullscreenRaynor and Moth Winn.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFinding out that kind of information might be possible only if publishers had specific teams dedicated to it. The publishing consultant and editor Katy Loftus, who previously worked for Penguin Random House, says she isn’t aware of any publishing houses with a factchecking department. “Other than top executive salaries, publishing is run on a shoestring. Books make much less money than people think,” she says. The big publishers have legal departments, “who will give an opinion on something flagged up to them by a commissioning editor, and occasionally do a complete legal read if requested”, she adds. But the main factchecking responsibility tends to fall to the commissioning editors, who are “responsible for hundreds of tasks” – from briefing book cover designers, to negotiating deals with authors, to managing teams of people. The editing itself “is often at the bottom of the list, and factchecking is only part of the editing process.”Even when it comes to legal checks, the main concern is that a book doesn’t contain anything that might lead to the publisher being sued, rather than actually analysing the factual content, says Ian Bloom, a media lawyer who has worked in publishing. “To some extent, nobody much cares if they’ve got dates wrong and facts wrong, as long as there’s no legal implications.”Bloom suspects that a number of celebrity memoirs in particular contain omissions or embellishments. “There’s no real harm done if they gloss over certain things in their lives,” he says, as long as it’s not defamatory to anyone else.Aside from rare exceptions – such as when a group of readerssuccessfully sued Frey’s publisher, claiming they were defrauded as they bought his book under the impression that it was true, and were refunded the cover price – publishers do not face serious material repercussions for lies told in memoirs. Reputational damage, meanwhile, is usually put on the author. “When an author signs a contract with a publisher, there are usually author covenants that include clauses about the truthfulness and integrity of the material to the best of the author’s knowledge and belief,” Bloom says. The publisher is then entitled to cancel that author’s contract, should a book’s veracity be called into question.Of course, authors can get around this by writing “autobiographical fiction” rather than memoir: books such as the actor Carrie Fisher’s Postcards From the Edge, based on her own life but categorised as a novel, or the Booker-winning autofictional novelShuggie Bainby Douglas Stuart, don’t come under fire for being made up, because we all know that’s what fiction is. So why didn’t authors like Frey turn their stories into novels? Perhaps the books wouldn’t have done as well marketed in that way – in a true-crime-obsessed world, we’re all familiar with the strength of desire for real stories.“Autofiction isn’t as well-established a genre as memoir,” Pengelly says. “So marketing teams face discrete challenges in framing and taking these stories to the public. A ‘true story’ has historically proved easier to build a campaign around.”Once a book is out in the world, any inaccuracies tend to be spotted by journalists or academics – there is no regulator of the publishing industry equivalent to the Independent Press Standards Organisationand Ofcom for the media in the UK. Withapproximately 200,000 books publishedannually in the UK alone, “There’s no regulator on Earth who can read them all … it’s impossible,” Bloom says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In light of the Salt Path allegations, Pengelly is sure publishers will be considering ways to avoid such a scenario coming up again. “If a narrative arc seems too neat and tidy to be true, perhaps it’s worth considering why, and employing a freelance factchecker to investigate,” she says.View image in fullscreenWinn on her travels in south-west England.The trouble is, neat and tidy narrative arcs are often exactly what many readers – and viewers of film adaptations – want. A memoir Pengelly worked on,Zig-Zag Boy by Tanya Frank, is about a mother coming to terms with her son’s experiences of psychosis. That book was a more modest commercial success than The Salt Path, but could it have been more of a hit if Frank had ended it with her son being “healed”, rather than with her accepting his altered state? Quite possibly. Triumph in the face of medical adversity is a seductive concept, as readers of Winn’s books will know from their stories of Moth’s ability to overcome the symptoms of his illness and undertake long walks.Nic Wilson, whose memoir Land Beneath the Waves is about how the natural world helped her to navigate and accept her chronic illness, is disparaging of the “nature cure” trope we often see in popular books about health. It creates an unrealistic expectation that the order of events should be “diagnosis, illness, recovery. And I think readers come to expect that,” she says.Clearly, authors may have something to gain by bowing to such expectations and embellishing or omitting certain facts of their life stories. But they also have the most to lose if lies in their books are exposed: they could have their publishing deal dropped, which might mean having to pay back their advance, and they risk no publisher wanting to be associated with them again.Frey’s publisher, Nan Talese, was particularly aggrieved by the way her author’s reputation was attacked. Winfrey displayed “fiercely bad manners – you don’t stone someone in public, which is just what she did”, shetold the Dallas Morning Newsat the time.If a narrative arc seems too neat and tidy to be true, perhaps it’s worth considering why“Scandal has stalked memoir since the genre was invented,” Loftus says – an early example being the 1836 memoir Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, a 20-year-old woman’s story of life in a Montreal convent, which was vilified as a hoax. “In practice the publicity rarely does more harm than good to the publisher, whereas an author’s life can be left in tatters.”That’s not to say that they won’t continue to make money: A Million Little Pieces kept selling even in its second iteration, which had passages rewritten and contained a “note to the reader” addressing its inaccuracies. And whatever happens after the allegations made against Winn, having already sold more than 2m copies of The Salt Path, she has been made rich by this book and its sequels, and will continue to receive royalties for as long as people keep buying them.The fact that there is money to be made – with very few legal repercussions – by telling the most marketable version of a story, rather than the true one, makes it difficult to believe that this controversy will be the last of its kind. After all, no memoir can be completely true. “Memories are fallible and selective; we always remember half-truths, and the story an author chooses to tell is only ever one story of a particular situation,” Agarwal says. “But what any reader wants to believe is that the story they have put their faith in is closest to the writer’s truth, that they have not been deliberately misled, that they have not been manipulated. This is essential.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And aperitivo hour would be nothing without a perfectly chilled spritz in hand.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Aperol spritz – the much-Instagrammed vibrant concoction of bitter Aperol with prosecco and soda over ice with a slice –has had us Britons in a chokehold for several summers now. But there’s more to spritzing than our distinctive orange-hued friend, says Alessandro Botta, founder ofAperitivo Club: “At Aperitivo Club we don’t see the spritz as a trend, but as a timeless tradition that encourages people to slow down, savour the moment and enjoy it together.”So what are the key components of a traditional Italian spritz to be served at aperitivo hour? “An aperitivo spritz should be light, refreshing and made with prosecco,” says Botta.It’s also deeply rooted in place, with each variation reflecting local flavours and traditions. In Padua, it’s made with Aperol; in Milan, Campari; in Venice with Select (a juniper-based, floral aperitif); in Naples with limoncello; and in Trentino-Alto Adige, where elderflower and alpine botanicals abound, the Hugo Spritz (made of prosecco, soda, elderflower liqueur and mint).Italians are characteristically traditional with their spritzes, generally sticking to the components of prosecco, soda and some kind of liqueur. Across Europe the love for a pre-dinner low-ish-alcohol drink continues with a wider brief; in France pastis and Pernod are diluted with water for a longer, lighter serve, and the deliciously classic kir royale is common at this hour; while in Spain you’ll see vermouth and soda; and Portugal’s light and bright port and tonic fits the mould too.For the purposes of this piece, we’ll keep things fairly traditional, with components of these spritzes similar to their Italian inspiration. All of my recommended serves are effervescent, wine-based and tend towards a botanical aspect; most have soda water in the mix, too. They all also drink best from a large wine glass over plenty of ice with good, salted crisps on the side. I’ve kept things on the lower-ABV side; the early evening drink is best kept to mid-strength to avoid spoiling proceedings later in the night, after all.Here are my favourite twists on the spritz to get your summer aperitivo hours off to the most sparkling start.The best spritzes for 2025The cherry spritzView image in fullscreenBellamie cherry liqueur aperitif, 70cl£34.99 at Drink SupermarketNot keen on the bitter, herbal liqueurs so commonly used when aperitivo rolls around? Try a cherry spritz made in the French aperitif style: Bellamie cherry liqueur aperitif makes for a fruitier and sweeter spritz when mixed with prosecco and soda, but brings a lovely tartness to take the edge off. On the menu at the original Ivy, it’s made in Kent using real cherry blossom, cherry fruit and cherry stones, and is free from artificial colours and flavours despite its beautiful deep garnet hue.Garnish with a stick of good green olives – the umami, briny flavour really makes the cherries pop – and enjoy alongside salty snacks.The limoncello spritzView image in fullscreenLimoncélimoncello, 50cl£16.88 at Master of Malt£16.05 at AmazonI developed a love for limoncello spritzes when I visited the Amalfi coast; all over the lemon-growing south of Italy, this is an aperitivo equally as popular as the Aperol spritz and even more refreshing. Try with Limoncé limoncello, one of Italy’s top limoncello brands, which uses only Sicilian femminello lemons, handpicked in winter. Serve one part Limoncé to two parts soda over ice in a large wine glass and top up with chilled prosecco for citrusy spritz heaven. A scoop of lemon sorbet has been known to find its way into mine, too, which is the ultimate in naughty summer refreshment or a perfectly acceptable pudding alternative.The Italicus spritzView image in fullscreenItalicusrosolio dibergamotto, 70cl£31.50 at Master of Malt£27.50 at Waitrose CellarNot just a beautiful bottle, Italicus rosolio di bergamotto is a bergamot-based liqueur using native Italian botanicals. It’s made to an original 1850s recipe foraperitivo di corte(royal aperitivo), so named as it was the tipple of choice for the king of Savoia. Today it’s still widely enjoyed across Italy, with its gently floral citrusy profile working wonders when splashed into a glass of iced prosecco. Hold the soda, though: Italicus isn’t as bitter as many aperitivo, so doesn’t need further dilution. Garnish with three green olives.The English garden spritzView image in fullscreenBolney Estate Englishgardenspritz, 75cl£16.95 at Slurp£17 at Bolney Wine EstateI came across this delicious spritz during my quest forthe best mid-strength drinks. Indeed, the beauty of so many spritzes is that they fit into that mid-alcohol zone – this one is a very civilised 6%. This ready-to-drink spritz is crafted from the Sussex Bolney Wine Estate’s 2022 chardonnay-based white vermouth and the estate’s own kitchen garden botanicals. Think tart, juicy grapefruit and native English florals, blending sweet and bitter flavours for a fresh and pretty aperitif.The gin spritzView image in fullscreenJawboxapple &gingerginliqueur, 70cl£25 at Tesco£25 at AmazonGin is a natural bedfellow for prosecco in a spritz, thanks to its juniper-led, piney bitterness, and a shot of your favourite stirred into an icy prosecco along with a dash of juice is a classic. This summer I’m into Jawbox apple & ginger gin liqueur (20% ABV as it’s not straight spirit), which uses an unusual Belfast apple variety grown on the distillery’s country estate. Use 500ml mixed with a bottle of prosecco and 250ml of soda in a giant jug for parties. Throw in plenty of lime wedges and fresh green apple slices to garnish.The Hugo spritzView image in fullscreenAperitivo Club Hugo Spritz£7.98 for two cans at Aperitivo ClubView image in fullscreenSt-Germainelderflower liqueur, 50cl£26.50 at the Whisky Exchange£20 at AmazonNorthern Italians gave the classic St-Germain spritz an update in 2005 by including fresh lime and sprigs of mint to create the Hugo spritz. It’s one of the most popular summer drinks in Europe at the moment and shows no sign of going anywhere; an ad campaign for St-Germain sees Sophie Turner sipping on a Hugo spritz in the south of France. Make your own using St-Germain or stock up on these dreamy aperitivo-ready cans for enjoying on the hop: the Hugo spritz is mixed to fresh and floral perfection.The rose spritzView image in fullscreenMirabeau x Fever Treerosespritz, 75cl£14.99 at the Bottle Club£15 at John LewisSparkling wine is a key component of any spritz, but thinking pink can keep things interesting. This rose spritz from pale Provence rose peddlers Mirabeau went down very well with me at this year’s Chelsea flower show. Its blend of French rose and Fever Tree’s raspberry and orange blossom soda makes it a subtly fruity and afternoon-appropriate drink at a respectable 8.3%. I serve in flutes, Chelsea-style, or over ice with muddled raspberries– satisfying when you want a longer drink. Similarly, cava house Codorníu is now making a canned wine-basedCodorníu Spritzinfused with raspberry and hibiscus – perfect to pop in your bag for emergency summer spritzing.The desi mango spritzView image in fullscreenDesi Darualphonsomangovodka, 70cl£34.99 at Master of Malt£39.94 at AmazonView image in fullscreenLondon Essence Cowhitepeach &jasminesoda, 150ml£17.25 for 24 cans at the Whisky Exchange£4 for six cans at AmazonThe origins of aperitivo mean we tend to see European flavours, but why not harness the tropical flavours of Goan beach sundowners instead? Desi Daru alphonso mango vodka is on the menu in London restaurants such as Hoppers and Benares, and swirling a shot into a standard Aperol spritz gives it a heavily fragrant south Asian makeover that I find far more tempting than the original iteration. I’m also a fan of increasing the desi flavours further with 25ml of Desi Daru alphonso mango vodka, 25ml sauvignon blanc and 100ml of London Essence Co white peach & jasmine soda, served over ice and garnished with a fresh curry leaf.The Nozeco spritzView image in fullscreenNozecospritz, 75cl£3.32 at Asda£19.50 for six at AmazonSober people like to spritz too, and this ready-to-drink 0% alternative is lovely enough to be enjoyed in its own right. The Nozeco spritz has just won a prestigious IWSC gold award, with judges citing the alcohol-removed wine and natural orange blend as a “delightful medley of orange peel, rhubarb and a hint of rose, complemented by herbal rosemary”. They said it has a “lively acidity, culminating in a refreshing crisp finish that lingers with a pleasing bitterness”. They’re right; my testers and I agree it’s a sure-fire summer hit and a bargain to boot.I tried 60 low- and no-alcohol drinks: here are my favourite beers, wines and spiritsRead moreThe rhubarb spritzView image in fullscreenMoninrhubarbsyrup, 70cl£9.33 at Master of MaltAsk a bartender the flavour of the moment and they’ll likely say rhubarb. I recently enjoyed a divine fig and rhubarb spritz (vodka, fig liqueur, rhubarb syrup, lime and soda) at Caravan, while Bar Termini’s popular Spritz Termini comprises gin, rhubarb, Aperol and prosecco. Monin’s classic rhubarb syrup is a simple way to make all manner of on-trend cocktails, particularly the classic spritz: mix 20ml of Monin rhubarb with 120ml of sparkling wine and 60ml of soda, then stir with ice and garnish with lemon. It’s light and summery without going down the more predictable berry or citrus route. For something harder, I like to swap the soda for a shot of gin.Joanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Remember the first Dexter finale 12 years ago? It climaxed with Morgan sailing his boat into an unsurvivable storm, a sure sign that our favourite serial-killing blood spatter analyst had finally met his end. But then the show lost its nerve and he somehow ended up in a postscript with a new job (lumberjack) and a new beard (unconvincing).Next came 2021’sDexter: New Blood, a series that was conceived as a definitive full stop for the character. That run ended with – spoiler alert – Dexter being shot dead by his son Harrison. However, now Morgan finds himself back yet again in Dexter: Resurrection, in which we quickly learn that this apparently fatal injury was merely a flesh wound.“Well, you know, he didn’t get shot in the head,” shrugsMichael C Hall, who plays the titular character. Hall is attempting to explain Dexter’s latest miraculous comeback to me over Zoom – and if he’s getting tired of people like me telling him that they thought he was dead, he’s doing a pretty good job of hiding it.View image in fullscreenMichael C Hall, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, Jill Marie Lawrence and Sharon Hope in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeThis might be because it was his idea to bringDexterback. “The conversation started as a result of my saying, ‘What if he didn’t die?’” he says breezily. “I can’t take credit for the whole scope of what we’re up to, but it was a notion that I casually floated. What if the end of New Blood was something that enabled Dexter to relinquish some burden that he’d been carrying for a long time?”What changed his mind? “Time passing, perspective shifting, recognising what a wonderful thing it is to collaborate with this family,” he says. “And realising that how New Blood seemingly ended could be a way to move the character into a place he hadn’t quite earned until then.”How well the character moves into that place remains to be seen. As we speak, the show is still in production, and only the first episode has been made available to view. Its early scenes might creak with tortured exposition – hardly surprising, given the near-impossible task of bringing someone back from the dead – but happily, the old Dexter magic is still present. There are callbacks and cameos and grisly scenes of dismemberment. Better yet, the season promises all kinds of warped bonding between Dexter (a serial killer) and Harrison (his son and, until quite recently, murderer).“Harrison has been through a lot, and has a sense of maturity that he didn’t have when we first met him in New Blood,” says Hall. “Dexter initially is very much compelled to check in on his son, but is also daunted by the proposition of making contact, because he’s afraid his son will reject him, or won’t want him, or will wish he’d stayed dead. But I think finding themselves on the other side of this traumatic event will result in both Dexter and his son growing up a little bit.”View image in fullscreenUma Thurman as Charley in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeWe also have a new fleet of faces to look forward to. Peter Dinklage and Uma Thurman are there, respectively playing a billionaire venture capitalist and his head of security, plus Neil Patrick Harris, Eric Stonestreet, Krysten Ritter and David Dastmalchian will all appear as villains invited to what sounds an awful lot like an international murder convention. “Dexter sort of trips into a literal and figurative invitation to a gathering of unsavoury …” teases Hall of this year’s plot, before trailing off for fear of spoiling anything. “Actually, I’m not sure how much I can say. But it’s really validating and gratifying, the fact that the show remains compelling to the kinds of actors who’ve agreed to join us.”Perhaps another reason for Hall’s willingness to return was this year’s Dexter: Original Sin. A prequel series that took the form of Dexter’s life flashing before his eyes post-shooting, Original Sin didn’t star Hall (although he provided the voiceover), instead casting Shadow and Bone’s Patrick Gibson as Morgan.I had wondered if the simple envy of seeing someone else do his job drove Hall back to Dexter, but apparently this wasn’t the case. “I thought it was interesting, once all those blanks had been filled in, to find the character on the other side of it,” he says. “But it was weird to see Patrick embody some of what had evolved as Dexter’s characteristic ways of being. Yes, it’s very strange. In fact, at one point I was like, when I go back to work, I gotta make sure I’m not just doing a Patrick Gibson impression.”View image in fullscreenPeter Dinklage in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeThere will be more Original Sin (a second season was greenlit this spring): another sign of what looks like an ever-expanding Dexterverse. There’s likely to be continued Resurrection – more about that shortly – plus there are rumours of a spin-off focused on John Lithgow’s Trinity Killer. All of which perhaps underlines how much better television as a whole was in Dexter’s heyday.The original Dexter came out in 2006 at the height of the golden age of TV, with its focus on anguished male antiheroes. Much has been made lately of the demons that plagued James Gandolfini before his death, some attributed to the burden of having to play a character as dark as Tony Soprano for so many years. As Dexter, though, Hall played a serial killer who had to murder and dismember countless people. Did the darkness of the role ever get to him?View image in fullscreenMichael C Hall on satellite radio station Sirius XM in New York this week.Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM“I think Dexter exists in a world that is, to some degree, dialled away from reality,” he explains. “It’s fantastic in its way and, because of that fantastical element, maybe it doesn’t play the same trick on me that it might otherwise. And you know, as intense as it might be to convey someone who’s wrestling with such formidable darkness, it’s maybe therapeutic. You can endow these victims with whatever it is you’d like to do away with in your own world. Maybe I’m a healthier person for having done all this.”There is also the question of how comfortable Hall is with returning to the same character over and over again. After all, Dexter aside, his stock in trade is playing a dizzying breadth of characters – he was JFK in The Crown, the Emcee in Cabaret, the lead in David Bowie’s Lazarus musical, a professional bowler in a Tim Robinson-written episode of Documentary Now!. Yet he keeps being drawn back to Dexter. Surely he must be aware that this will be the first line of his obituary.“I mean, what are you going to do?” he shrugs. “That’s the way it’s unfolded. Whether I were to do more of this or not, I think that would remain the case, and it’s OK. None of it fundamentally matters anyway. But it’s been really fun. Being able to work as an actor feels like getting away with something. Being able to work as an actor while playing a character like Dexter feels exponentially so. I feel very lucky to have gotten away with this.”A knottier question to bring up is the internet. As well as the initial finale routinely being brought up as one of the worst in television history, aHollywood Reporter interview with showrunner Clyde Phillipslast year suggested that fans weren’t exactly happy with how New Blood ended, either. “The internet hated it,” Phillips said bluntly. With this in mind, I ask Hall if he keeps up with the ins and outs of reactions to the show.“No, that would make me crazy,” he replies. “But some fans found the notion of Dexter surviving more plausible than him dying. There’s something about the character that people just don’t want to see him die. They don’t want to see his agency extinguished.”Watch a trailer for Dexter: ResurrectionMichael C Hall on death, dogs, depravity and Dexter: ‘It was fantastic to be ethically unbound’Read moreThe good news for these fans is that Dexter: Resurrection is intended to be a long-running affair. The introduction of so many guest stars this season is designed to trickle out across several years, or, as Phillips put it to USA Today, the duration of the comeback is “up to Michael”.“Well, I guess it’s hard for Dexter to happen if I’m not there,” Hall sighs when I mention this to him. Does this mean he would like Resurrection to run and run? Is there a world where it could end up rivalling the length of the original series? “That sounds insane,” he laughs. “All I can say is that I don’t think we resolve things at the end of this season, and we’ve done it with the reasonable expectation that there will be more to come.”So you don’t get shot at the end of this one? “We still have two and a half weeks left of filming, and I suppose someone could present some new pages to me,” he smiles. But what would be the point? After all, Dexter Morgan cannot die. And we should all be thankful for that.Dexter: Resurrection is on Paramount+ on 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsDexterMichael C HallTelevisionTV crime dramaDramaUS televisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

It is also the first time the government has increased the number of safe routes through which asylum seekers are able to reach Britain.Speaking in a joint press conference, Starmer said: “There is no silver bullet here, but with a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent, we can finally turn the tables.“For the very first time, migrants arriving via small boat will be detained and returned to France in short order.”Macron also welcomed the scheme, while blaming Brexit on various occasions for the number of people crossing the Channel illegally.“Many people explained that Brexit would make it more possible to fight effectively against illegal migration,” he said. “But since Brexit the UK has no illegal migration agreement with the EU … That creates an incentive to make the crossing, the precise opposite of what Brexit promised.“The British people were sold a lie, which was that [migration] was a problem withEurope. With your government, we’re pragmatic, and for the first time in nine years we are providing a response.”The pilot is expected to begin in the coming weeks and will include a safe and controlled route “only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, the prime minister said.Those who have crossed the Channel will have biometrics collected at Manston immigration centre, and those who have been identified as suitable to be part of the pilot agreement will be detained.Starmer refused to say how people would be chosen for return to France, but those who are deemed to qualify will be told their claim is inadmissible in the UK because they have arrived from a safe country. People will have the ability to claim any exceptional circumstances that may mean that they are not suitable for return.Those in France who wish to travel to the UK will be allowed to apply via an online platform and if successful will be allowed to claim asylum in the UK.According to a report in Le Monde earlier this week, the pilot scheme would lead to the return of only 50 people a week, a fraction of the number who cross. Starmer did not deny that report, but declined to say how many people would be returned under the pilot.Macron declined to say whether the scheme would expand as British officials have promised. He said: “I’m totally committed to make it work, because this is clearly our willingness and our common interest. And in this pilot project, I wanted to insist on one point – that there is a deterrent effect.“What we want to do is precisely to have this deterrent effect so that all these smugglers … sense the message that we are efficient and they have no more interest to try.”He added that he wanted to secure the agreement of other European countries before implementing the deal, with Spain, Italy, Greece, Malta and Cyprus all having expressed concerns.Starmer said: “This will show others trying to make the same journey that it will be in vain, and the jobs they have been promised in the UK will no longer exist because of the nationwide crackdown we’re delivering on illegal working, which is on a completely unprecedented scale.”He also defended the concept of safe routes of asylum despite objections from the populist right. “We accept genuine asylum seekers because it is right that we offer a haven to those in most dire need,” he said.UK government backs French police immobilising small boats, minister saysRead more“But there is also something else, something more practical, which is that we simply cannot solve a challenge like stopping the boats by acting alone and telling our allies that we won’t play ball.“That is why today’s agreement is so important, because we will solve this, like so many of our problems, by working together.”The two leaders also agreed to cooperate more closely on using their nuclear deterrent – something Macron called historic and that could involve the two countries using their weapons in tandem should Europe come under attack.Macron also challenged Starmer to recognise the state of Palestine, something France has pushed the UK to do for months.Both men were effusive in their praise of each other and the relationship they have forged during Starmer’s first year in power.Macron also had some words of electoral advice for his fellow beleaguered centrist. “Never cede to the temptation of populism, which is the denial of science or a travesty of the facts,” he said.“Populists sold you a response which is through nationalist withdrawal. Budgetary, immigration, growth problems from nine years ago. Were they solved by Brexit? No.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronRefugeesFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Project Hope, which runs the facility, said operations at the clinic had been suspended until further notice.“This morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open. This is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law,” said Rabih Torbay, the NGO’s chief executive.The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas terrorist who had participated in the 7 October 2023 attack, but “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals” and that the incident was under review.‘They’re skin and bones’: doctors in Gaza warn babies at risk of death from lack of formulaRead more“What was our fault? What was the fault of the children?” asked 35-year-old Mohammed Abu Ouda, who had been waiting for supplies when the strike happened. “I saw a mother hugging her child on the ground, both motionless – they were killed instantly.”Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 67 other people across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry, including 15 people in five separate strikes in Gaza City.On Wednesday, Hamas agreed to release 10 hostages in exchange for a ceasefire and the US president, Donald Trump, expressed optimism for a ceasefire deal, saying there was a “very good chance” of a deal being reached this week or next.Qatar, which is helping to mediate the indirect ceasefire talks, cautioned that a deal could take time, as there are still key stumbling blocks. Israel is demanding that it be allowed to resume military activity in Gaza after the ceasefire, while Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not restart fighting.On Thursday afternoon in Washington, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said if the two sides reach agreements on the US 60-day truce plan, Israel will begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. He reiterated Israel’s terms for ending the war, including Hamas disarming and no longer ruling Gaza.A previous ceasefire broke down in March after Israel decided to renew fighting instead of progressing to a second stage of the deal that could have led to a permanent end to the conflict. Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas and its departure from Gaza, something the militant group has refused.Residents on Thursday reported Israeli tanks and bulldozers advancing towards encampments hosting displaced people south-west of Khan Younis, with Israeli soldiers opening fire and throwing teargas at the encampments. People began to flee the area amid the attacks, carrying mattresses and whatever belongings they could take with them amid scorching heat.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, one of the last functioning hospitals in southern Gaza, reported a large influx of wounded people over the past 24 hours. A picture sent by a member of the medical staff showed Israeli tanks stationed on the edge of tent encampments surrounding the hospital.The staff member sent a video of a piece of twisted shrapnel that flew into the window of the intensive care unit from a nearby strike, which they said was still hot to the touch.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee Khan Younis amid an Israeli ground offensive.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersOn Tuesday, Hamas killed five Israeli soldiers, a rare deadly incident, after the militants targeted them with explosive devices in northern Gaza.The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people on 7 October 2023, prompting retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Israeli military operations have killed more than 57,000 people in Gaza and created famine-like conditions as the country restricts humanitarian aid into the territory.More than 500 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli forces while trying to access food distribution sites run by the US- and Israeli-backed logistics group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Israel backed the GHF after accusing Hamas of stealing aid under the UN aid system, something for which humanitarians say there is little evidence.Aid groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates core principles of humanitarianism. The GHF said it had provided more than 69m meals and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.At least three people were killed by Israeli gunfire while trying to access a distribution centre in Rafah, a civil defence official told AFP.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Social media companies are not just neutral platforms but actively curate what you see online, and they must be held accountable.”Neither misinformation nor disinformation are harms that firms need to address under the OSA, which only received royal assent less than two years ago. State-sponsored disinformation can amount to an offence of foreign interference.The report examines the role of platforms including X,Facebookand TikTok, and comes after this week’s opening of a public inquiry into missed opportunities to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, on 29 July last year.Just over two hours after the first call to the emergency services, a post onXclaimed the suspect was a “Muslim immigrant”, and within five hours a false name, “Ali al-Shakati”, was circulating on the same platform, the MPs found. Within a day, these two posts had received more than 5m views. In fact, the attacker was Axel Rudakubana, a British citizen born in Cardiff.Another X post that evening calling for violence towards asylum hostels received more than 300,000 views, and the next day the false name was on X’s “Trending in the UK” list.TikTok suggested to users under its “others searched for” function the words “Ali al-Shakti arrested in Southport”, and by the end of the day after the attack social media posts with the false name had accrued 27m impressions and violence had broken out outside Southport mosque. On 3 and 4 August a Facebook post called for violence against the Britannia hotel in Leeds, where many occupants were asylum seekers.The committee called for fines of at least £18m if platforms do not set out how they will tackle significant harms that derive from content promoted by their recommendation systems even if it is not illegal.It concluded: “The act fails to keep UK citizens safe from a core and pervasive online harm.”It called on the government to make social media platforms “identify and algorithmically deprioritise factchecked misleading content, or content that cites unreliable sources, where it has the potential to cause significant harm.” But it stressed: “It is vital that these measures do not censor legal free expression.”The MPs called on ministers to extend regulatory powers to tackle social media advertising systems that allow “the monetisation of harmful and misleading content”, with penalties rising depending on severity and the proceeds used to support victims of online harms.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has been approached for comment.Ofcom said it held platforms to account over illegal content but stressed that the scope of laws requiring platforms to tackle legal but harmful content was a matter for the government and parliament.A spokesperson said: “Technology and online harms are constantly evolving, so we’re always looking for ways to make life online safer. We’re proposing stronger protections including asking platforms to do more on recommender systems and to have clear protocols for responding to surges in illegal content during crises.”TikTok said its community guidelines prohibited inaccurate, misleading or false content that may cause significant harm and it worked with factcheckers and made any content that could not be verified as accurate ineligible for its “for you” feed.X and Meta were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaSouthport attackXFacebookTikTokInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

The report’s findings are expected imminently.On Tuesday the BBC said in a statement: “Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.”Wallace has already admitted using inappropriate language and apologised, but claimed earlier this week to have been cleared of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.Powell’s letter, obtained by the Telegraph, said the corporation had taken into account that Wallace was a presenter on a flagship BBC show and referred to the “impact that your comments had on the BBC’s reputation”.“I have also taken into account whether your behaviour could be improved with training and/or coaching,” she stated. “However, having reviewed the 2025 findings, I do not have the confidence that you can change what seems to be learned behaviour for you to make what you perceive to be jokes in the working environment, without understanding the boundaries of what is appropriate.“I also have to consider the fact that various people in the BBC have spoken to you about your behaviour over the course of your career, and that you also already received training/coaching in 2019.“I do not have confidence that your behaviour can change to ensure there is a sufficiently safe and respectful environment for others working with you in the types of programmes the BBC has engaged you to present.“Such productions are not heavily scripted programmes and involve sound and consistent levels of judgment in relation to interactions with others which cannot constantly be monitored or supervised.”The Telegraph also reported Wallace was preparing to sue the BBC for discrimination. The 60-year-old has revealed a recent autism diagnosis. In a statement early this week, he accused the BBC of failing “to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years”.Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceMasterChefBBCTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes at a time of unprecedented pressure on the Ukrainian economy as Vladimir Putin widens his targets across Ukraine, deploying record numbers of long-range drones.There is deep uncertainty surrounding a US-led plan for peace that is expected to include territorial concessions. Areport last monthfound that more than a third of Ukraine’s estimated reconstruction costs, or nearly $200bn (£150bn), would fall to a bankrupt Russia if Ukraine were forced to concede the loss of control of four territories as part of an eventual peace settlement.The figure – a challenge to policymakers meeting at the Ukraine reconstruction conference in Rome – underlines the likelihood that Ukraine’s future will be one of not just political division but also divergence in terms of wealth and economic growth, with eastern Russian-held territories likely to suffer significantly.The focus of the conference is on encouraging long-term private-sector investment, but this has been overshadowed by the urgent need to protect Ukraine’s population and its economy from the spiralling impact of the drone strikes.Zelenskyy said in Rome: “Russia has also prepared, I must say, for this meeting because unfortunately last night, a few hours ago, there was a massive, heavy attack on Ukraine. In this case the target was the capital, the city of Kyiv.”Merz railed against the Russian attacks, saying: “These are practically only civilian targets. This is terrorism against the civilian population. This has nothing to do with a war against military targets.”He added: “Our political duty is to increase pressure on Russia, to change Putin’s mind and bring him to the negotiating table.” Merz appealed to Slovakia to lift its veto over an 18th round of EU sanctions against Moscow.The Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), an Italian thinktank, has predicted based on World Bank research that the reconstruction costs in four largely Russian-held regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – will be $188bn. Those regions could remain with Russia under a future peace deal, although Kyiv has not agreed to that.Overall, the World Bank predicts that a 10-year plan for reconstruction and recovery, to be implemented between 2025 and 2035, would require investments of at least $524bn.Although the entire territory of Ukraine has been hit by attacks since 24 February 2022, 66% of the direct damage ($116bn) and 47% of the total recovery and reconstruction costs ($248bn) are attributable to Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as well as Kharkiv.“If Kyiv decides to concede the four disputed regions in order to achieve the end of hostilities, it is plausible that Russia will have to shoulder a significant share of the costs of reconstruction,” the ISPI said.The difficulty for postwar planners in designing realistic scenarios is underlined by the fact that since the last recovery conference, in Berlin in 2024, the damage to energy infrastructure has risen by 93% in a year.Sectors most affected include housing (with damage of $57bn), transport (about $36bn) and energy and mining (about $20bn).The expansion of the war through drones, and a widening frontline including in the Dnipro and Sumy oblasts, has also had an impact on the economy. High war spending is leading to rising inflation, which recently reached 15%. Economic growth is slowing, partly due to the increasing attacks on industry and infrastructure. The World Bank has revised its growth forecast for this year by 4.5 percentage points to just 2%.There is frustration among analysts that a succession of reconstruction conferences has not produced meaningful results.In a fierce critique for the Centre for European Policy Analysis, the former US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker wrote: “Past Ukraine recovery conferences have convened thousands of experts and produced grand ideas, with zero follow-through. The humanitarian aid and budgetary support that have kept Ukraine afloat have been provided by the EU, its member states, and the United States, Japan, the UK, and the World Bank. A genuine strategy for Ukraine’s own economic renaissance has been woefully absent.”Volker has called for a permanent body to be set up to drive private-sector investment.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But the data indicates present-day discrimination is also playing a role. We heard reports of really overt racism from private landlords – refusing to house people because they’re black, particularly if they’re refugees, or imposing rules or restrictions on them that they don’t impose on other tenants.”The team from the university’s Institute for Social Policy,Housingand Equalities Research analysed 750,000 household outcome records from official homelessness data from 2019-20 to 2021-22 and found that 10% of black families in the statutory homelessness system gained access to social housing, compared with 24% of white families.They also found 11% of migrant-headed households accessed social housing, compared with 17% of all households. Analysis of English Housing Survey data found that Pakistani-Bangladeshi households were more than seven times more likely and black households six times more likely to be overcrowded than white households.Data obtained via freedom of information requests by Shelter found black-headed households were more likely to be stuck in temporary accommodation (TA) for long periods of time. They found 43% of black-headed households in TA had been there for more than two years, compared with 25% of white-headed households. Almost a fifth (18%) of black-headed households in TA had been there for more than five years, compared with 8% of white-headed households.Mairi MacRae, the director of campaigns and policy at the charity, said inequality “remains hardwired into our housing system”.She said: “The evidence is clear – devastatingly, Black people are more likely to become homeless and less likely to have a safe and secure home. Racial stereotyping, culturally insensitive communication and unjust treatment from housing officers, as well as excessive questioning around eligibility in the application process, leave Black people feeling unheard, neglected and dehumanised.”Shelter’s separate report, My Colour Speaks Before Me, describes people’s experiences of stereotyping, judgment and stigma, and facing an “uneven burden of proof”, with excessive questioning and heightened scrutiny when applying for social housing.Black social housing applicants reported being treated more poorly than white applicants, facing longer delays and receiving support that was not culturally aware.View image in fullscreenUchenna Eneke spent 15 years living in a one-bedroom flat with her two children while bidding for a social home in east London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOne of the report’s 16 peer researchers, Uchenna Eneke, 43, spent 15 years living in a one-bedroom flat with her children while bidding for a social home in east London, and struggled to get basic maintenance repairs or speak to housing officers.“It makes you question everything – is it because I’m black? Is it because I’m a woman? Is it because I’m a single mum? I was seeing people getting rehoused around me, and I came before them,” she said. “Especially with a name like mine. Sometimes I had to change my name to an English name – I used to call myself Gillian – just to get through to speak to someone.”Her children, now 17 and 10, spent most of their childhoods sharing a room with their mother, and one developed chronic rhinitis due to persistent mould in the property.“I tried asking for help but nothing happened. You just keep to yourself, keep your head down, don’t get your kids taken off you. I ended up having a bit of a nervous breakdown,” she said.She now volunteers with Shelter and advocates on behalf of other people struggling with housing. “We need the laws to change because people are going crazy. People are losing their lives, losing their families, losing their jobs,” she said. “Imagine someone being homeless but still having a job at the same time. That’s not normal.”Fitzpatrick said their research was designed to “fill a longstanding gap in knowledge about race and homelessness in the UK”, particularly after the widely condemnedSewell report on racial disparityin 2021, which made little reference to housing.She said their recommendations included using the private rented sector landlord ombudsman proposed in the renter’s rights bill to tackle racism by landlords, and rejecting ethnicity-blind approaches in housing departments.“It’s really unacceptable that people who are already in a crisis situation are sometimes traumatised by their treatment at the hands of local authority homelessness officers that are there to assist them,” Fitzpatrick said. “If you’ve got people coming into a system with structural disadvantage, you have to be aware of that.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessSocial housingHousingRaceInequalityCommunitiesSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Of these women, 65% reported having experienced domestic abuse before or during their pregnancy, while a third had experienced abuse during their childhood.The study included a review of anonymised care records for 47 of the women included in the research, which found uncoordinated involvement of maternity and mental health services with social care and other medical specialists, resulting in overwhelming and disjointed appointments.Many of the women who died and were in contact with children’s social care services came from “backgrounds of trauma and abuse, and yet despite their efforts to keep up with demanding appointment schedules, they often face scrutiny and judgment rather than receiving support for the issues they are facing”, according to Kaat De Backer, the lead author of the study, from King’s College London.She added: “Too often, the professionals the women are in touch with don’t work together to provide holistic care, which increases the pressure on a mother.“When women have access to designated multi-disciplinary teams with specialist knowledge and capacity to provide integrated and holistic care, these barriers can be overcome. It makes it easier to understand who is doing what and when, for women and professionals.”The researchers called for urgent changes to be made to how mothers with social care involvement are treated by clinicians and other agencies during their pregnancies and early motherhood.Naomi Delap, the director of Birth Companions, said the study highlighted the “acute need for better care for women with children’s social care involvement, and the significant barriers that get in the way of providing that care”.She added: “To help improve things, we need coordinated national policy and clear expectations across the health and social care systems.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The White House has not commented on the report.Trump and Starmersigned a trade deallast month on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada that formally lowered some US tariffs on imports from Britain.The deal came after the prime minister visited the White House in February, presenting Trump with an invitation from King Charles for a future state visit, which Trump accepted.The US president is expected to visit his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire golf courses and is set to officially open a new 18-hole golf course at his resort on the North Sea coast at Menie, north of Aberdeen, named in honour of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. He is not expected to visit London during the trip.Trump has made numerous visits to his golf course in Aberdeenshire, which he bought as a small country estate and opened in 2012, and several trips to his more prestigious resort at Turnberry in Ayrshire.His mother was born in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, and Trump has frequently claimed that has given him a close bond to Scotland. He has visited Lewis once and spent little more than a minute in her former home.Scottish police said on Wednesday they werepreparing for a possible visitby the US president to Scotland, which would mark his first visit to Britain since the US election last November.The assistant chief constable, Emma Bond, said: “Planning is under way for a potential visit to Scotland later this month by the president of the United States. While official confirmation has not yet been made, it is important that we prepare in advance for what would be a significant policing operation.”The long-rumoured visit is not expected to include a meeting with King Charles, despite earlier suggestions the US leader could meet the monarch at either Balmoral or Dumfries House in Ayrshire.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs byEd RamThu 10 Jul 2025 14.29 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 16.07 EDTShareIt is 5.45am, the dawn light strengthening. A large inflatable dinghy carrying 20 or more people has come discreetly to the east end of the beach at Gravelines. Though it looks packed from the shore, it is perhaps only two-thirds full, according to regular observers. Each person on it wears a fluorescent lifejacket, soon to embark on a risky crossing fromFranceto the UK.For a few minutes the boat halts several metres from shore, probably waiting for others to run from the scrubland behind the beach, where some have been hiding all night to try to get on. But the only people waiting are a small group of journalists. Once it becomes clear there is nobody else to pick up, the boat’s engine fires up, heading north-west to England, while one person onboard waves back with the sign of peace.In London, where France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is visiting, further proposals are being discussed to stem the number of people coming to the UK in small boats. But on Thursday morning in northern France, the more significant variables are the strength of the wind and the height of the waves. It is calm, ideal for crossing after days of higher winds.As the dinghy sets off, it becomes clear that a small number of French police officers have been watching from the dunes, about a kilometre or so away. It is estimated that 1,800 officers patrol the coast, a security effort partly funded by Britain, which is paying France about £480m under a three-year deal ending in 2026. But the size of the beaches and the length of the coastline used by migrants and refugees – roughly 70 miles – makes stopping all the boats impossible.View image in fullscreenPolice on Sangatte beach near Calais on Wednesday.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianEven so, leaving is not simple. Another dinghy got stuck in the mud as a group tried to embark from the canal that runs through the centre of Gravelines at about 5am. Though the people onboard were rescued by the fire brigade, according to aid workers at Utopia 56 the police used teargas to break up a group that had collected. Others then tried to restart the boat’s engine but, with the tide going out, the effort failed and for a time they were stuck in the thick canal mud before being rescued.Starmer says ‘one in, one out’ deal will allow UK to return small-boat migrants to FranceRead moreThe most significant factor, though, is the determination of people to arrive – the human spirit, so often driven by necessity, which overpowers the relentless political and security initiatives during 20 years of efforts to half irregular flows of people to the UK. It is an obvious point but, in debates about migrant numbers, essential to repeat.Two days earlier, in the makeshift camp near Grande-Synthe, west of Dunkirk, where people typically have originally come from troublespots and war zones in Asia and Africa, Khaled, an Afghan, suggests that the Guardian search on ChatGPT on a mobile phone. This is unexpected, but he wants to show that his wife is a noted human rights activist – a picture produced in a search looks exactly like her.“Please don’t identify us,” adds Khaled (not his real name). “It is dangerous for my parents back home. We don’t want the Taliban to know we have left the country.” The couple and their boy, now five, have been travelling overland for a year after initially fleeing to Iran, but such is his nervousness that he does not want their faces to be photographed as he talks, his son playing around him.View image in fullscreenAn abandoned boat next to a canal that leads to the sea in Gravelines.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianPeople have made lengthy, dangerous journeys to get this far. One, Bashir, says he has already travelled “nine days in a boat from Senegal from Spain” – and so the prospect of crossing the Channel does not appear to unduly worry him, though 19 people have been reported to have died or disappeared trying to make the crossing so far this year. Like several others, he says French police slashed a dinghy he had got into with a knife, making it sink before it left shallow water, a tactic exposing refugees and migrants to more danger and trauma. “I will try again,” he says simply.The squalor in the camp remains profound and in many respects little has changed in the two-and-a-half years since this reporterpreviously visited. There is no sanitation, though one charity, Roots, provides basic showers. Charities distribute food and provide electricity for phone charging. People cook on open fires – and offer visiting reporters tea.View image in fullscreenPeople cook in a makeshift camp near Loon-Plage, Dunkirk, on Tuesday.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianThough it feels safe to walk around with a photographer and talk to the those at the camp, there are dangers. There were two non-fatal shootings on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, the police presence was nervy and the Guardian arrived just as the victim, who had been shot in the leg three times, was evacuated by ambulance. Two migrants were killed in separate incidents last month. Aid groups such as Utopia 56 argue that if the camps were “more dignified”, there would be less violence.This time, however, there is a growing minority of women and children. Next to the Afghans are camped a group of Somalis. Five women fleeing the violent, unstable country gather around to talk. Yasmiin says she tried and failed to obtain asylum in the Netherlands, and says because the UK is outside the EU’s system she has a second chance in the UK. She playfully suggests marriage. “No, not you. Do you have a brother?” she asks.Katie Sweetingham, a coordinator with Care4Calais, a charity that works with refugees and migrants, providing clothes, tents and other non-food items, says there has been a huge increase in families and that at a recent clothes distribution in Dunkirk “we had about 100 women and about 30 children” turn up. For comparison, the charity budgets for handing out clothes or other items for up to 700 men, though it also admits that stockpiles of clothes and tents are not as high as it would like.View image in fullscreenCare4Calais volunteers fold blankets in a warehouse in Calais.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianAid workers are not sure why the numbers of women and children have gone up but there is tentative evidence that the cause may be the people smugglers’ new taxi boat model, where a large dinghy waits near the edge of a beach, allowing as many people as possible to pile on, creating a dangerous shallow-water scramble that is particularly difficult for children and family groups to navigate.Asmaan, 13, who is nominated by her mother as the family spokesperson because she speaks some English, says she and her family, from Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan, were unable to get on a small boat five days earlier. “We could not get on together, it was too difficult,” though the effort was moot because, she says, the boat was slashed by the French police.View image in fullscreenA family in a tent in a makeshift migrant camp near Loon-Plage.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianEven allowing for the new emphasis on disabling the taxi boats, so far this year as of 6 July at least 21,117 people have made the crossing by a small boat, up 56% compared with the same period in 2024. The asylum claims made by those coming to the UK via small boats aresuccessful 53% of the time. But people coming from certain countries have avery high rate of asylum claims accepted, such as 97% for Afghanistan.Organisations working with refugees and migrants estimate there are perhaps 2,500 in and around Calais and Dunkirk at the moment. Every two days, French police, partly funded by British taxpayers, clear out informal camps in Calais, taking or slashing tents and removing any possessions if their owners are not present. Afterwards, Care4Calais distributes replacements and the cycle repeats.View image in fullscreenPolice clear an area near a food and assistance distribution point near Loon-Plage.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianIn the rough, wooded open ground near Dunkirk, the clearouts typically take place on Wednesday mornings. However, this week the effort did not take place, prompting some charities to assume it was to avoid negative publicity while Macron was in London and while journalists were likely to be about.Instead, according to Thomas Gilbert, the founder of the refugee support charity Roots, French refuse workers quickly cleared away “three or four skiploads of rubbish” on Wednesday morning that had been collected by volunteers.“It’s just really frustrating, especially today: it took us probably five or six days for three different groups to collect the rubbish, and they can just show up because of what is happening in the UK,” he says. A more humane approach to the migration crisis is possible, he argues, but it is not the path politicians choose.Names of refugees and migrants have been changedExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceEuropeRefugeesMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Some fanspaid more than £350for tickets with a face value of £150.The watchdog said Ticketmaster had failed since then to provide any undertakings that it found acceptable to resolve the issue of the way it sold the tickets.Oasis have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsOasisNews agenciesNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

An enthusiastic campaigner for remain at the referendum, he became a big champion of Boris Johnson, then backed the most moderate candidate, Tom Tugendhat, for party leader.But after Tugendhat inevitably faltered, he became one of the loudest enthusiasts for Liz Truss’s premiership, under which he wasgiven the post of Tory chair. After her brief leadership ended in collapse, Berry was one of the party’s most restive malcontents. Now, he says, the future is Reform.The statement from his former local party pulls no punches, accusing him of wallowing in “grievances of the past” and saying the former MP “never truly recovered from the downfall of Liz Truss – a prime minister whose brief and chaotic tenure he enthusiastically supported”. After that came “disengagement … from the serious business of representing his constituents”.Berry’sdecision to defecthas caused a lot of anger in the party – coming on the heels of another former cabinet minister David Jones.It is a serious problem for the Conservative party if defections continue apace. And the most serious are the defections such as Berry – eccentric as his political ideology may seem – for two reasons.First, as a former party chair he has significant organising experience, which has always been a weakness in the Reform party because of the relative lack of experience among the grassroots. The more experienced Tories defect, including local association chairs and party agents, the more Reform gains vital ground game knowledge – mostly at the expense of the Tories.Second, and perhaps even more damagingly, it sends a signal that there are many ambitious Tory ex-MPs who do not feel ready to be put out to pasture – and they do not see the Conservative party as their route back to relevance any time soon.Because of the scale of the party’s losses in July, there are many former Tory MPs who are relatively young and who might have hoped to find a return to parliament. Berry’s defection shows he has come to the conclusion it is a mug’s game to attempt to do that via their old party.How can Badenoch respond to that when her party may yet slip to fourth below the Liberal Democrats? Can she promise them, seriously, that if they stay the course they can find their way back to a safer seat?There is one saving grace for theConservatives. There may come a point where it becomes much more unpalatable for Reform to continue to act as a retirement home for failed Conservative politicians.Berry’s defection is probably still a net positive, but if hordes of his ilk begin to follow then there will come a time when that becomes deeply awkward for a party that has made gains on the back of Conservative failures.CanNigel Faragetruly claim to be running an insurgent party railing against the chaos of the past 14 years of Tory rule – especially the perceived failures on migration – if his party is suddenly stuffed full of former Tory ministers hoping desperately to now stand for Reform and return to parliament under his banner?What if – for example – Truss was to offer to join? Farage lavished praise on her mini-budget initially – but the taint of her tenure may be too much.The former home secretary Suella Braverman has long been tipped as one of the most likely to jump ship – and has been a loud advocate of the Conservatives needing to do a pact with Reform at the next election. Farage has dismissed that suggestion because of the need for the party to eat as much of the Tory lunch as possible in order to gain enough votes to win seats.There was one interesting voice warning Farage against the temptation to accept more former Conservative MPs. It came from Rael Braverman – the husband of Suella – who is now a high-profile supporter of Reform. “Reform must not become Tory 2.0,” he posted on X – following it with a dismissive – “Jake who?”Explore more on these topicsReform UKConservativesNigel FarageJake BerryanalysisShareReuse this content"

He encourages them to seek connections, yet the 39-year-old is the first to admit it: when you’re a guy, making real friends in midlife is difficult. “It feels like an uphill battle,” says Mohler, who lives in Baltimore.Some call it afriendship recession: a time in midlife when close male friendships sink to their lowest. According todatafrom the Survey Center on American Life, 15% of US men said they do not have close friends in 2021, compared with 3% in 1990. Those reporting 10 or more close friends decreased from 33% to 13% during the same period.Authentic or close friendship may mean different things to different people. One straightforward description is finding “someone who sees you as you see yourself, and you see them as they see themselves”, says Niobe Way, a developmental psychology professor at New York University. Jeffrey Hall, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas who studies friendships and has previously found it can take 200 hours to make a close friend, says: “A true friend will support and stand by you no matter what, will stand up for you, and tells you the truth.”Overwhelmed by company? Five introvert-friendly ways to hang outRead moreThe reasons for the friendship recession are complex, says Hall. Straight men Mohler’s age often depend on their partners for socializing. Some dive deep into parenthood. College buddies disperse. Work priorities take over. And moving to a new city or country can dissolve formerly strong bonds. Ultimately, it can feel too hard to invest time in new and deeper friendships.Despite loneliness due to estrangement from relatives or different family structures, “many gay men find and build community around an embrace of shared spaces,” says Matt Lundquist, a therapist in New York, which he finds is less common for heterosexual men. “This sort of intentional taking on a project of searching for new, deeper friendships is more a heterosexual project. It is a demographic that is very isolated.”“My clients are looking for more connections,” Mohler says. “I have ideas and skills and solutions, but I’m still personally searching for practical ways to do that.”He is not the only one feeling the itch to turn a workout buddy into someone he can call on a Saturday afternoon. US men aged 15 to 35 are among the loneliest in wealthy countries, with 25% reporting feeling lonely for a lot of the previous day, according to a 2025Gallup poll. Marketing professor and popular podcast host Scott Galloway recently touted the benefits of authentic connections for men amid what he called a “perfect storm of loneliness”.“Men have it drilled into us from an early age that vulnerability and emotional connections are signs of weakness,” Gallowaywrote. “They aren’t, and men with influence have an obligation to cleanse this bullshit version of masculinity from the zeitgeist.”The men I interviewed say they don’t want to be just a stat in the much-toutedloneliness epidemic, which is also increasingly being tied topoorer physical and mental health outcomes. Still, it’s difficult to avoid in practice.“There’s a certain cultural understanding that men don’t know how to enact intimacy or that it’s simply not practiced very much,” says Hall. “And even men’s popular culture doesn’t show you how to go about the process.”Some are figuring it out. Jedidiah Jenkins, 42, an author living in Los Angeles, says he’s had to relearn about the importance of maintaining close bonds with other men. As a teenager, he had plenty of friends; making them seemed effortless. “You didn’t have to work for it,” Jenkins says. “We have to learn in the same way that we actively download dating apps and pursue a relationship that we have to pursue friendships.”I’m in my 20s with lots of online friends, but can’t seem to connect IRL | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreFor the last few years, Jenkins has organized a weekly hangout at his house. Anywhere from three to 20 friends show up for what he calls “riff raff Thursdays”, including a handful of regulars. He starts a bonfire and serves hot tea, mezcal and peanut butter pretzels. The consistency means that his friends know what they are doing that week, and takes away the pressure of scheduling one-on-one meetups.“It doesn’t require the full energy of finding time for a weekly coffee date,” he says.How male friendships fall by the waysideBefore the second world war, same-sex male friendships were a large part of public life, and women’s friendships were seen as frivolous and less important, Hall explains. But these roles have since reversed. Today, most heterosexual men feel they are marrying someone who becomes the default events planner, and their genuine close friendships fall away, Hall says. “They rely on their wives to develop the social calendar – they think: ‘She’ll do it and I don’t have to do it’,” he says. “There’s atrophy in their skillset.”Way, the developmental psychology professor, says girls and boys start out on the same trajectory of prioritizing friendships. But boys feel pressure to give up their same-sex friendships because it feels “girly or gay”. Rates of male suicide alsotick uparound adolescence. “It’s not that they naturally don’t want these friendships. They had them when they were younger,” she says. “It’s not some weird biological thing.”View image in fullscreenJedidiah Jenkins, 42, says he has had to relearn about the importance of maintaining close bonds with other men.Photograph: Jason Russell/Jedidiah JenkinsWay, who receives emails from hundreds of men each year about her research, says more of them feel like it’s possible to secure closer friendships after the pandemic because the topic is receiving more attention. “They are now recognizing what the problems are,” she says. “They’ve hit the bottom of the barrel.”At the same time, her research points to a culture that doesn’t value friendships. Since the 1980s, she says, the United States’ focus on self-fulfillment has reduced the importance of friendships for everyone. Digital life distracts us too much or provides a simulacrum of closeness; even listening to podcasts can bring afaux feeling of intimacy. “We focus more on the self, and the tech just exacerbates it,” she says.Bringing men togetherIn Hebden Bridge, England, former professional rugby player Craig White has started hosting nature retreats for men to encourage deeper connections. White, now a mentor and coach, runs a “mid-life intensive” program that offers online meetings along with a three-day in-person meet-up. White’s retreats involve hiking, spending nights around a fire, discussing feelings openly and bonding outside of day-to-day pressures.When it came to his father, “healthy male friendship wasn’t modeled and the friendship groups involved alcohol,” he says. “A lot of my clients are brilliant men, but a lot of their old friends are still doing the same thing and there’s a reluctance to go back to that.”Draymond Washington, an entrepreneur and former financial adviser, founded a private club in Chicago called Three Cities Social earlier this year, and says connecting midlife professionals is the goal. But after months of hosting events, he realized that while the club’s membership is roughly 40% male, event attendance was typically 80% women, he says.Men aren’t always willing to come to the club to socialize. So he has started hosting events aimed specifically at men in their 30s and 40s: boxing classes, pickleball and boat rides. “Guys like to do stuff,” Washington says. “Someone needs to curate and then they do want to show up.” He’s been able to engage more men this way, but it’s been more difficult than he expected.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Hall says men must work against decades of complacency to build friendships powerful enough to dispel loneliness. His priorresearchshows that men tend to have low expectations for their friendships in general, and often say that even those low expectations aren’t being met. (Women, on the other hand, have expectations that are too high.) Such low-stakes relationships tend to leave them feeling even more alone when compared with deeper friendships, he adds.Kevin Cleaver, 40, who relocated from New York to Highland Park, Illinois, says he decided to focus on making connections after Covid-era isolation. In New York, Cleaver felt increasingly alone, and he wasn’t willing to go through that again in a new city. “That mindset helped me take the bull by the horns to meet others here,” he says.View image in fullscreenDraymond Washington, left, founded Three Cities Social in Chicago this year. Jaquis Covington, right, is a member.Photograph: Josh OnwordiThe transition from casual to deeper friendship can take time, and it’s not always apparent who is eager to make the leap, says Cleaver. He started at the gym, saying hello to people he saw after workouts. One is now a genuine friend; they bumped into each other at the grocery store and were both buying steak, which they took as a sign to socialize outside the gym.“The more we ran into each other, the more we’d chat, but it was only after we found out that we had an interesting overlap in life and relationships that we became closer,” he adds. They have since bonded over similar romantic predicaments and regularly meet to chat over beer.The role of significant othersSome men – especially those in heterosexual relationships who have children – have mixed feelings about how their partners affect friendship, feeling their lack of support makes it difficult to pursue even platonic relationships outside marriage.Jenkins, the author from LA, says that based on his and friends’ experiences, significant others are not always supportive. Some assume men hanging out together can lead to inappropriate behavior, reinforcing a cultural narrative that “when men are spending time with other men, they are probably doing devious activities, going to strip clubs or having sex with somebody else or getting trashed,” he says.I was getting lonely. Here’s what happened when I tried to make new friends in my 30sRead moreRecently, though, he has witnessed some of the women in his friend groups let go of their protectiveness and encourage these friendships, he adds.But Mohler, the therapist, says he emulates how his partner, a woman, handles her own friendships. For example, he checks in with friends after a fun evening or makes sure to schedule future plans when he’s hanging out with someone. “I say: ‘I had a really great time; we should do this again – let’s keep the ball rolling,’” he says.Additionally, he has let go of surface-level friendships, prioritizing those that have the potential to deepen. “I have a little bit of sadness and grief for male friendships that don’t go beyond the surface,” he says. “I want to hear what they are struggling with, and I want them to help me.”The path forwardHall, the professor, says that many men still consider friendships to be a women’s issue. And despite the idea ofsocial healthbecoming more mainstream, he’s unsure whether many men are aware of or influenced by these ideas, such as loneliness affecting physical health.He has yet to see evidence that there’s a persistent trend of men seeking out meaningful friendship. “It could be just a flash in the pan,” he says.Could younger men offer a bright spot? Someresearchon undergraduate males from 2017 showed they want more intimate bonds and are comfortable with “bromances”, which they say rival or exceed romantic relationships.Jaquis Covington, 29, is a member of Three Cities Social; he grew up in a large family and says he witnessed his own parents turn only to other family members for support. Seeing his parents feel alone at times has motivated him to do things differently. Outside of his work in commercial real estate, he spends time playing video games or golfing with friends he met through the club.“My parents’ best friends were probably their kids. I need to invest in friendships outside of what I’m accustomed to,” he says. “I think about who is going to be at my wedding.”"

But for Laing, nothing beats giving back to her community – starting with a huge hometown festivalThu 10 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareIn the centre of a dancefloor in aDundeepark, a group of athleisure-clad teens are dancing to a Crazy Frog remix with a middle-aged couple wearing head-to-toe smiley face print. They’re in a re-creation of the Highlander, a Scottish bar in Ibiza, complete with Saltire flags and Buckfast cocktails. Across the park, a crowd of thousands are hanging on for the drop in Ultrabeat’s Pretty Green Eyes as played by trance icon Judge Jules. It may be late afternoon in Dundee, but the vibe is pure late-night riviera hedonism.This is last weekend’s Doof in the Park festival, curated by Hannah Laing in her home town. From Manchester to Ibiza, Amsterdam to Tokyo, the Scottish DJ and producer has brought her sets of hard house, trance and techno to every big club scene in the world, but the festival “had to be at home”, she says two days before it begins, fresh off a plane from Ibiza. “InScotland, we’re lucky to have crazy crowds. The atmosphere here always hits different.”While hard dance is often derided or ignored in the media and polite society, Laing’s music – insistent, almost aggressively euphoric – has a large and committed following: 2.7 million people listen to her each month on Spotify and Doof in the Park sold out its 15,000 tickets within a week. Across the festival site there are hundreds of fans in merch from her Doof record label, as well as bootleg efforts including handmade Doof earrings and customised Uniqlo crossbody bags; one man has “Doof” shaved into the side of his head.Laing wryly describes her rise as “10 years of overnight success”. Even after landing her first Ibiza residency in 2014, she was juggling DJing with her day job as a dental nurse. “I was playing at the weekend then going straight to work on a Monday,” she remembers. “There came a point when I was doing interviews with the BBC in my surgery. I was getting a lot of gigs but still doing lots for free, and I never thought I could make a living from it.” She eventually quit her job in 2022, after a breakthrough set at Creamfields. “I was on first on Sunday at 2pm and didn’t know if anyone would show up, but there were over 10,000 people there and tons of Scottish flags,” she says. “I’d been building up this reputation in Scotland, and when I got that big opportunity, everyone came out to support me.”“She’s one of us,” says Lisa, who has travelled to the Doof in the Park from Aberdeen with her friend Shona. Like Laing, Lisa is in her early 30s and grew up going to raves. “She’s been brought up like us. She’s a normal girl who’s done well for herself.”In 2024, Laing launched her label, named after the “doof doof” rhythm of her music. This summer, she’s playing a residency at one of Ibiza’s most sought-after clubs, Hï, and releasing her techno-influenced Into the Bounce EP.She credits her taste – “hard house, trance, music that really makes me feel something” – to her parents, 90s ravers whose generation make up a significant part of her audience. “It’s a great feeling when people who properly know their stuff come and say: ‘You got me out of retirement!’” she says. “Also when my mum comes to see me, she doesn’t feel old.”This is very much the case at Doof in the Park. “I’m 53 and I thought I’d be the oldest here, but I’m not,” says Claire from Johnstone, accompanied by her 20-year-old daughter. “I’m 51 and I’ve been doing this for years,” adds Natalie from Aberdeen. “There’s such a mix of ages and everyone’s so friendly.” Natalie’s niece Carla has been following Laing for years, and emphasises the inclusive community she is building, which extends to the access support at the festival. “Sometimes, if you’re sick like me, you can’t go to stuff, but the accessibility team have been fantastic,” she says. “They gave me a direct phone number if I needed anything on the day. It’s all been thought out.”View image in fullscreenOpening Doof in the Park, with suitably Scottish musical accompaniment.Photograph: Eddy Hubble‘Seeing climate change like this, it changes you’: dance duo Bicep on making a new project in GreenlandRead moreAs well as hard dance legends such as Armin van Buuren and Lisa Lashes, Laing booked local DJs for the Highlander tent, styled after “the bar in Ibiza where I had my first residency, which I wanted to pay homage to. For most of the DJs, it’s their first ever festival.” Laing’s support of the local scene will continue with the in-construction Doof Studios, a DJ workshop in Dundee that she recently crowdfunded with non-profitTurn the Tables. It’s set to be a resource for up-and-coming DJs in the area, as well as people affected by homelessness, addiction and ill health. “It’s going to have loads of benefits,” she says, “not just for people who want to DJ full-time, but for people who just need that focus.”Whether it’s building a community studio or creating music for intergenerational revelling, all of Laing’s work has genuine care for people at its heart: “Being able to give back, there’s no better feeling.”Into the Bounce is out now on WUGD/Polydor. Hannah Laing plays every Monday at Hï in Ibiza until 29 September, andtours Europe this summer, playing the Emerge festival, Belfast, on 23-24 August, and the Cause, London, on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsDance musicElectronic musicClub cultureDundeeFestivalsScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nanny McPhee (2005)Emma Thompson’s Mary-Poppins-with-warts is a dog’s dinner of a movie, but Celia Imrie amuses herself (and occasionally us) with a broader-than-usual turn as the widowed Mrs Quickly, who is pursuing a father of seven (Colin Firth) forced by his aunt to marry within 30 days or face penury. Imrie cites this as one of her favourite roles, despite having a live tarantula on her head in one scene and a wriggling worm in her mouth in another.19. House of Whipcord (1974)Among Imrie’s earliest credits was this exploitation horror about a secret, sadistic correctional institute for young women. Barely glimpsed amid the frenzy of whipping, she tries to alert the outside world by throwing a Bible from a window. “Whenever I am in one of those awful out-of-the-frying-pan situations where you escape only to end up back where you started, I still use the phrase: ‘How House of Whipcord!’” she recalled in her 2012 autobiography, The Happy Hoofer.18. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)View image in fullscreenAll guns blazing … in The Phantom Menace.Photograph: LucasfilmA casting director spotted Imrie opposite Harold Pinter in his play The Hothouse and recommended her to George Lucas for the tiny role of the fighter pilot Bravo 5. She wore rust-coloured jodhpurs, but, on Lucas’s orders and to her chagrin, no lipstick: “I did my bit and fired my guns, but I haven’t a notion what side I was on, who I was firing the guns at, who I was hitting and whether or not we won.”17. Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001)Nothing very much for Imrie to do as Una, the best chum of Bridget’s mother, beyond presiding over the barbecue and offering to sieve the gravy, but she gets the occasional faux pas and adds generally to the impression of a high-calibre cast free of dead wood. She returned for extra helpings in the sequels.16. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie (2016)View image in fullscreenRivals … Imrie with Jennifer Saunders(right)and Jane Horrocks in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie.Photograph: David Appleby/Fox Searchlight/AllstarFeeling more like a victory lap than a fully fledged movie, this allows Imrie to reprise her sitcom role as Claudia Bing, the PR rival to Jennifer Saunders’ Edina Monsoon. It is Claudia who blows the whistle after Edina apparently kills Kate Moss by knocking her into the Thames, and Claudia who prevents Jon Hamm from rushing valiantly to the model’s aid.15. Highlander (1986)View image in fullscreen‘Full rustic wench costume’ … in Highlander.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyImrie was kitted out in “full rustic wench costume” for this time-travelling folkloric fantasy, butChristopher Lambertwas too weedy to lift her on to his horse for the intended goodbye kiss. Instead, she simply grabs his calf and jogs beside him “while delivering the dialogue that I should have been doing as we galloped along together”. There was more drama for her off-screen than on: she was briefly snatched from her hotel by a man who declared himself intent on continuing the Pictish tradition of kidnapping women.14. Revelation (2001)This The-Omen-meets-The-Da-Vinci-Code potboiler stars James D’Arcy as the cryptographer uncovering a plot to revive the antichrist. Po-facedTerence Stampand Udo Kier have considerably less fun than Derek Jacobi, seen fleetingly as a librarian who brandishes a pair of cotton gloves and promises to check Isaac Newton’s papers “for stains and so on”. Imrie is the hero’s mother, burnt to a crisp in only her second scene and squeezing out her final words in a high-pitched squeak.13. Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! (2018)Razzle-dazzle … watch Imrie swap her mortar board and gown for a feather boa.Most of the razzle-dazzle in this part prequel, part sequel comes courtesy of Cher, who makes her entrance by helicopter. But Imrie lets her hair down as the vice-chancellor of Oxford university on graduation day. Once Lily James, as the young version of Meryl Streep’s character, Donna, has warbled her share of When I Kissed the Teacher and zoomed off across the quad, Imrie leaps from the stage trailing a canary-yellow feather boa and trilling: “What a mad day!”12. Imagine Me and You (2005)View image in fullscreenNuanced delights … with Anthony Head and Piper Perabo in Imagine Me and You.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyIn this London-set lesbian romcom, the newlywed Piper Perabo leaves her husband for the florist (Lena Headey) who supplied their wedding bouquets. As the bride’s mother, Imrie nails the character in her haughty opening lines: “Darling, tell your father he can’t wear that suit … I’ve seen better dressed crab.” But there are nuanced delights to come, including the thawing of relations between Imrie and her husband (Anthony Head) during the sort of last-minute race through traffic that was compulsory in Britcoms of theRichard Curtisera.11. A Cure for Wellness (2016)If there were ever a movie star in dire need of a spell at a Swiss spa resort, it’s the sickly looking Dane DeHaan. In this horror inspired by Magic Mountain and Shutter Island, he is the executive sent to retrieve a colleague, only to find madness and murder afoot. Imrie, first seen doing a crossword with her fellow bathrobed guests, dispenses gobbets of backstory about the institute’s sinister origins. With prim lips and loaded stares, she delivers her portentous dialogue with aplomb. “There is a terrible darkness here,” she warns DeHaan. Next stop: the morgue.10. Year By the Sea (2016)View image in fullscreenManic pixie dream aunt … in Year By the Sea.Photograph: Montabela Productions/Kobal/ShutterstockEmerging from the Cape Cod fog like a mermaid, Imrie plays one of the wacky catalysts for a disillusioned writer’s journey of self-discovery, offering a slogan for every occasion: “Who wants the burden of control?” “If we can’t show our feelings, we might as well be men!” She has a fine rapport with the film’s lead, Karen Allen (of Raiders of the Lost Ark), but her character is essentially a manic pixie dream aunt who twirls coloured scarves, whoops among the waves and impishly ignores the “Do Not Enter” signs around the lighthouse. ImagineFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, but served as a side, not a main.9. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011)View image in fullscreenPastures new … Imrie and Judi Dench in The Best Exotic Marigold.Photograph: Fox Searchlight Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarWith Maggie Smith, Judi Dench,Bill Nighyand Tom Wilkinson, this Brits-in-India getaway is the Avengers Assemble of older British character actors. Imrie gets the slimmest pickings plot-wise, as the grandmother who opts for Jaipur rather than an eternity of babysitting. She packs her shrewd smirk and that reliable libido (on securing an airline upgrade: “I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent it was practically phone sex”) and gets several other choice lines, complaining about getting old (“I don’t want to be the first person they let off the plane in a hostage crisis”) and offering terse advice on how the unhappily married Nighy could celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary (“Perhaps a minute’s silence?”). A 2015 sequel offered her character a glimmer of romance.8. What We Did on Our Holiday (2014)Or Outnumbered: The Movie. The writer-directors Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin preserve the partly improvised nature of their kids-say-the-darnedest-things sitcom while replacing its stars, Hugh Dennis and Claire Skinner, with David Tennant and Rosamund Pike. The “sit” in this “com” is the birthday party of their dying grandpa (Billy Connolly). After he expires on the beach in the company of the children, Imrie is called in from the child welfare unit. Reacting with understated incredulity to the kids’ tales of Viking funerals and the Norse god Odin, she rounds up their crayon drawings as evidence.7. The Borrowers (1997)View image in fullscreenDelightful … with Jim Broadbent in The Borrowers.Photograph: Working Title Films/AllstarMary Norton’s adventure novel about a tiny resourceful family who live in the skirting boards and hide from “human beans” has been the source of numerous adaptations, including Studio Ghibli’s Arrietty in 2010. This inventive British version, with Imrie andJim Broadbentdelightful as the parents and John Goodman in full panto mode as the hissable developer threatening their home, is a charmer. Gemma Jackson’s production design is a special highlight. “It was fabulous walking around the gigantic chair and table legs and sitting on huge cotton reels,” said Imrie.6. Hilary and Jackie (1998)View image in fullscreenTenacious mother … with Charles Dance in Hilary and Jackie.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockIn a structurally daring biopic scripted by Frank Cottrell Boyce and carved into two contrasting perspectives, Imrie plays the tenacious mother of the cellist Jacqueline du Pré (Emily Watson), encouraging competition with her sister Hilary (Rachel Griffiths). “If you want to be together, you’ve got to be as good as each other,” she insists, establishing a pattern of rivalry that splashes over into their love lives.5. Love Sarah (2020)In her early scenes as the grieving mother Mimi, Imrie makes you realise that, with the help of some heavyweight roles, she could have approached the gravitas of her pal Glenda Jackson (she was Goneril to Jackson’s Lear in 2016). Just look at her deep grooves of experience and regret, her instant access to purse-lipped froideur. That dissipates as Mimi helps to launch the west London patisserie her late daughter never got the chance to open and tensions vanish beneath a dusting of feelgood whimsy thicker than several inches of icing sugar. But Imrie is highly watchable in her flirtations with the neighbourhood inventor (Bill Paterson), whom she invites up for coffee. If it isn’t decaf, he says, he’ll be “up all night”. Cue the naughty Imrie twinkle: “Lucky me.”4. Malevolent (2018)This haunted-house horror stars Florence Pugh and Ben Lloyd-Hughes as bogus ghostbusters hired to rid a country mansion of the screams of the wee poppets who were murdered there. Imrie was their foster mother, her son the killer, so it’s no surprise when she announces that the brats had it coming. Whatisstriking is how she maintains her cool, and keeps the volume down, even once she turns torture-porn-style aggressor. “It’s quiet time now,” she whispers, approaching her victim’s mouth with a needle and thread. It all goes a bit wild after she whips the hacksaw out.3. Calendar Girls (2003)View image in fullscreenCherry on the cake … in Calendar Girls.Photograph: AlamyTime has been kind to this factually inspired Britcom about the Women’s Institute members – played by stars including Helen Mirren, Julie Walters and Linda Bassett – who strip for a charity calendar, ruffling feathers but raising enough to fund an entire leukaemia ward at their local hospital. Eventually, they end up in Hollywood, hob-nobbing with Jay Leno and the thrash metal band Anthrax, of all people. Imrie gives lots of comic side-eye as she works out with a hot young trainer in preparation for the big shoot; she is the only one to express disappointment that her breasts will be tastefully concealed in the final product. “Yours good, are they?” asks Mirren, to which she coolly replies: “They’retremendous.” Accept no Imrie-tations.2. Finding Your Feet (2017)View image in fullscreenFree spirit … with Imelda Staunton in Finding your Feet.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyImelda Staunton is the hoity-toity snob (“Lady Nevershit”, as she is referred to) who flees her cheating husband and moves in with her wild-swimming, dope-smoking, bisexual sister, Bif (Imrie), in the latter’s council flat, as well as joining her and classmates Timothy Spall and Joanna Lumley at the local dance group. Imrie is in free spirit mode again, but more complex here than in Year By the Sea – although, weirdly, both films show her boogieing to the Big Bopper’s Chantilly Lace. Until cancer puts paid to her Extinction Rebellion vim, she exudes sexual swagger. “Thirty minutes and I’ll be good to go,” says her date, waggling a blister pack of Viagra. “I’ll get you there in 10,” she grins.1. Blue Black Permanent (1992)View image in fullscreenFaintly formidable … in Blue Black Permanent.Photograph: BFIThe only feature to be directed by the Orkney-based poet and film-maker Margaret Tait gave Imrie an early dramatic lead. She plays Barbara, a discontented photographer puzzling over the life and death of her mother, who drowned years earlier. Was it sleepwalking or suicide? Sifting episodes from her own and her mother’s childhood, Barbara dreams of flying, wrestles with guilt (“I should have been able to stop her, or save her”) and spars with her own lover, played by the perpetually sanguine Jack Shepherd. This gives Imrie room to exhibit her brittle, indignant intelligence and to sigh an awful lot. With her faintly formidable air, it’s easy to imagine she could have become the next Charlotte Rampling.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedCelia ImrieBill NighyEmma ThompsonAbsolutely Fabulous: The MovieTerence StampDerek JacobifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted anantisemitic tweetthat drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference – which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger:“Go fuck yourselves.”Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said. “Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”In the two years since, Yaccarino has had to contend with the unpredictability of Musk, ongoing content moderation and hate speech issues on the platform, increasingly strained relationships with advertisers and widespread backlash her boss received for his role in Donald Trump’s administration. Her response in some cases was to remain silent; in others, shechose to defend the company.Through it all, however, experts say it was clear Yaccarino was the chief executive in title only.Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Elon Musk’s XRead more“The reality is that Elon Musk is and always has been at the helm of X,” saidMike Proulx, research director at Forrester VP. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive. Her background and actual authority positioned her more as the company’s chief advertising officer, rather than its CEO.”Even in her de facto role as a chief advertising officer, Musk’s incessant posting, impulsive decision making and obsession withXand other platforms becoming too “woke” posed huge obstacles for Yaccarino.“The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Proulx.This week alone, Grok, the AI chatbot integrated with X, posted several antisemitic remarks, including some praising Hitler, after the company included new guidelines for the chatbot. In guidelines xAI published, Grok had beeninstructednot to “shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated”. xAI removed that guideline from its code on Tuesday evening.Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO of X was not only bookended with antisemitism scandals – Musk’s and Grok’s offensive tweets – but was also punctuated with several accusations of antisemitism against her boss throughout her short stint. In 2023, the non-profit watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate published a report on the prevalence of hate speech, both antisemitic and otherwise, on X as well as the lack of moderation. The company’s response was to sue the organization; the suit was ultimately dismissed. Similarly, the non-profit Media Matters for America highlighted the appearance of pro-Nazi tweets alongside branded advertisements in a report that preceded a mass advertiser exodus from the social network. X sued Media Matters.Most notably, Musk was accused of doingback-to-back Nazi salutesat a Trump inauguration rally at the start of 2025. Musk brushed aside the allegations that it was a Nazi salute and posted several Nazi puns on X. At the time, Yaccarino provided no additional comment, but posted a laughing face emoji in response toMusk’s jokes.Musk’s salute and the ensuing backlash was one of several moments that solidified the overall rightward shift of the social network as droves of users began to flock to alternative platforms like Bluesky, and even Reddit communitiesbegan banning X links.Promises of an X revitalizationWhen Yaccarino joined X, she set about courting celebrities and partnerships to reinvigorate the social network’s brand and repair relationships that Musk’s contentious takeover had damaged. Musk had long talked of making X into an “everything app” that would integrate payments, AI, messaging, livestreaming and other new features alongside the social network’s public posting, another task given to Yaccarino.Yaccarino led a delegation of executives, including Musk himself, to meet with industry leaders at the Cannes Lions festival in 2023, and began seeking media figures who could feature on the platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lemon’s first interview for the platform was with Musk, in what was intended to be a showcase of how X was shifting and bringing in big-name creators. The plan backfired after Lemon’s interview with Musk grew heated over questions about the billionaire’s drug use, which was quickly followed byMusk telling Lemon’s agentthat his contract was canceled. Future shows with big-name creators never materialized.In the ensuing two years, rather than become a destination for mainstream talent, a streaming powerhouse or the “everything app” that Yaccarino promoted, X has largely become a megaphone for Musk to air his grievances, boost and then feud with Trump, and promote his companies. Far-right influencers,porn spambotsand meme accounts proliferate, while many media outlets have deprioritized the platform or left it altogether. Misinformation and extremism are rampant, sometimes coming from Musk himself.The day before Yaccarino resigned, X became involved in a scandal that epitomized much of what the platform has become. Musk had recently posted that he would be reconfiguring xAI’s chatbot, Grok, because he did not agree with the responses it was generating. On Tuesday, users noticed that the chatbot had begun toreply to queries with blatantly antisemitic postspraising Nazi ideology. A flood of users began posting more screenshots of Grok posting rape fantasies, identifying itself as “MechaHitler” and promoting conspiracies before the company removed the posts.Incidents like Grok’s foray into Nazism are some of the many reasons Yaccarino’s goal of revitalizing X has sputtered. Although she succeeded in courting a number of major companies to begin advertising again last year, at a time when Musk’s connections to the White House were strongest, the platform’s ad revenues have never reached anywhere near their pre-Musk levels, accordingto the research firm Emarketer. The platform also resorted to threats of lawsuits against major companies such as Verizon if they did not buy advertising on the site, according toa Wall Street Journal reportthat Yaccarino has denied.After more than two years of Yaccarino running damage control for her boss and the platform’s myriad issues, Musk issued only a brief statement acknowledging she was stepping down.“Thank you for your contributions,” Musk responded to Yaccarino’s post announcing her resignation. Minutes later, he began sending replies to other posts about SpaceX, artificial intelligence and how his chatbot became a Nazi.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She was so mean and secretive, I imagined she wanted to kill meByElena Gosalvez BlancoThu 10 Jul 2025 00.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 05.05 EDTShareIfirst readPatricia Highsmith’snovels in the autumn of 1994. I was 20 and living in a room in her house in Tegna, Switzerland, that was plastered with bookshelves full of her first editions, organised in chronological order. Pat was 73 and knew she was about to die; she had been, it was rumoured, diagnosed with cancer or some other terminal disease. I was trapped in her world with her, trembling. She had weeks left to live and had spent so much time writing about how to get away with murder. I fantasised that she might try to kill me.The story of how I ended up in that house begins a few months earlier, in Zurich, with me on a blue tram, on my way to dinner at the house of Anna and Daniel Keel, a couple I’d grown friendly with. Anna was a brilliant painter for whom I had been modelling since I was 17. Her studio smelled like oil paint, instant coffee and the brine in which floated the mozzarella balls that she ate while working. She was a genius. Anna’s husband, Daniel – or Dani, as we called him – was a book editor and the founder and owner of Diogenes Verlag, a Zurich-based publishing house that was (and still is) a major publisher of European fiction. He was brutally honest but had kind eyes and piles of books that he used as furniture.Anna and Dani hosted what they called “interesting dinners” at their house, inviting random combinations of people they found fascinating. The night I arrived, all the doors were opened so the fresh air from their tree-filled garden could fill the dining room. Dinner was served on an oval wooden table covered with platters of pasta and cantaloupe and delicious prosciutto, along with many different bottles of French and Italian wines.Dani mentioned that he was distracted by a work problem. He was looking for an English speaker with a European driving licence to take care of one of his authors in Ticino, the Swiss-Italian part of Switzerland. “I am desperate,” he whispered. “This is for someone important; I can’t really advertise the position.” The divorced man who had been doing the job for some months, Dani told me, had just called to say he was not going to do it any more; he had decided to become a monk.Dani got up to open yet another bottle of chianti. Without thinking it through, I volunteered for the job. “I speak English,” I said, in English. “And I am licensed to drive in Europe and the US.” As Dani knew, I was about to go back to Spain to start my junior year of college, so he shook his head. But I insisted, explaining that all I needed to do was go to class for a month to meet the professors and collect the philosophy books assigned; after I had done that, I could help until my exams in December. (Attendance was not mandatory at my university.) My grandfather had been a theatre impresario and patron of the arts, and growing up, I had heard many stories about him helping all sorts of artists. When I eventually got to meet them, they seemed incredibly grateful for all my grandfather had done for them. So helping a writer in need seemed like the thing to do.As he served the new wine to the group, Dani told me very quietly he was talking about Patricia Highsmith. I did not react. “How many of her books have you read?” he asked. “None,” I answered. He laughed loudly, and Anna, who had been listening from the other side of the table, said she was sure that I had at least watched Hitchcock’s filmStrangers on a Train, which was based on one of Highsmith’s novels. I did remember having liked it on TV.Later, after a few more bottles were emptied, Dani told me he would ask Pat if she might consider me. But given how young I was, he said, I was not to get my hopes up.Within a week, Pat agreed to interview me. I took the train from Zurich through a heavy summer storm. On the way, I finished reading my first Highsmith novel,The Tremor of Forgery(1969). The man who had been taking care of her came to pick me up at the train station in Locarno, a Swiss town on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore, not far from her house. He looked old to me, not too tall, with glasses. He greeted me as if it were he, not I, who had finally arrived home after a long trip. We ran into a cafe, and over a quick cup of coffee, he told me about his months with Pat. He talked about her irritability, how difficult it could be to deal with her temper, and her health issues. He spoke about his reasons for moving into a monastery and his hope of finding peace. Our conversation scared me a bit; he seemed to be in the midst of an existential crisis, and he disclosed far too much to me, a 20-year-old stranger.“Pat is an amazing writer,” he said. “So imaginative. But she does not like people. You will feel you are bothering her, but don’t think it is something you did. She is like that.”I found his description of Highsmith perplexing. How can someone so isolated write so well about human nature, I thought. I could see, touch and almost smell the characters in the novel I had just finished. I felt as if I were still with Howard Ingham – the main character – in Tunisia, questioning the absurdity of our moral codes, rather than having coffee with a future monk on an unpleasant, rainy summer day.The future monk seemed on the verge of tears as we got into an old Volkswagen Polo to drive to her house. Tegna is only three miles from Locarno, but those 10 minutes felt long. It had stopped raining, but it did not feel like August. He dropped me off at the door, yelled “Good luck!” without getting out of the car, and quickly backed down the driveway. I straightened my wet, wrinkled dark-blue dress.The house in front of me was a one-floor brutalist structure made of large bricks. It looked like the letter U. Highsmith had designed it in the late 1980s with the help of an architect from Zurich. It was her dream house (as in, she had literally dreamed it), similar to one she describes in Strangers on a Train. In the book, though, the shape is a Y. I liked how the house’s hard lines contrasted with the beautiful valley, and that, by European standards, it was quite far away from other houses. The concrete blocks, which had once been white, looked dusty. The garden was full of bushes and leaves. The effect was uncanny.Highsmith opened the door before I rang the bell, as if she had been waiting behind the curtains. She was shorter than me, very thin, petite. Wearing a sweater and oversized jeans, her greasy grey fringe partially hiding her face, she looked unfriendly. She shook my hand in silence, then said: “Thank you for coming.” I closed the door and followed her into the house. Without turning around, she offered beer or tea; I asked for water. She looked fragile, but she moved quickly. She told me to sit on a large white sofa covered with colourful cushions and blankets, then disappeared into what I guessed was the kitchen.View image in fullscreenAlfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train (1951), based on Highsmith’s 1950 novel of the same name.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyIt was a cosy living room. I stared at the bookshelves around me. An orange cat crossed the room, ignoring me. On the coffee table, I spotted a European magazine opened to a feature on the 100 best living writers. Pat was right below Gabriel García Márquez. She finally returned with my water, moving as stealthily as the cat had.She sat down in a chair across from me and asked: “Do you like Hemingway?”She looked me in the eyes for the first time. I drank some of my tepid tap water. I knew the question was important. But I did not know anything about Pat or her life history. I did not know her tastes, or her relationship with other 20th-century North American writers. I did not even know she had lived in New York and Paris. I had read only that one book by her, just before on the train. I set my glass on the table, knowing I was running out of time, like in a gameshow, and I decided it was a heads-or-tails choice. I could not guess the right answer, I reasoned, so I might as well tell the truth. “No,” I answered, as if putting my last chip down on the roulette table.“I HATE Hemingway!” she screamed.She stood up and walked to the door to show me out.Is that the entire interview, I wondered, following her. I had a thousand questions about the job, the daily tasks, the car, the salary, the conditions. But I didn’t dare open my mouth. She thanked me again for coming and told me she would call Dani as soon as possible to convey her decision. She shook my hand, then quickly slammed the door behind me.The Volkswagen reappeared as I walked down the driveway. To get in, I had to pick up a large pile of mail on the seat that had not been there 15 minutes earlier. The future monk told me he had known the interview would be short, but not that short. “Maybe she did not like me?” I asked.“The next train to Zurich leaves very soon, so I have to rush you back to Locarno,” he said, ignoring my question. He looked worried; I thought he was wondering if Pat would ever find someone to replace him, and if he would be capable of leaving her alone without feeling guilty. I did not say anything. I stared at the 40 or so envelopes I was holding, all different sizes and with various coloured stamps on them. Most were simply addressed “Patricia Highsmith, Switzerland.”On the long train ride back to Zurich, I dreamed about orange cats, the Tunisian heat and the U-shaped house swallowing the pensive assistant I’d met. I was sure I would never again see the mystery-novel author who received mail that didn’t even include an address. And I knew it would take a while to get over the intensity of our brief encounter.A few days later, though, as I was about to leave for the airport to return to Madrid to start university, Dani called me at my boyfriend’s house. “Pat wants to know when you can start,” he said. “This is a miracle!” He sounded relieved.I said I could be in Tegna by late October. My boyfriend was going to be doing his military service in Switzerland, so he could visit me or we could meet somewhere on his days off. Dani told me to call him once my travel plans were confirmed, and thanked me over and over.“Just thank the fact that I don’t like Hemingway,” I said. Dani laughed and said that he and Anna would come visit once I was installed.As promised, I made it back to Tegna a couple of months later, after flying to Zurich then taking four trains. The red one-car train that chugged from Locarno to Tegna seemed like a toy in a set made just for me. The arrangements had all been made so fast that I did not have time to understand what I was getting into. I came wearing my long coat, heeled boots and black hat, ready for a literary adventure.Inside Pat’s house, a woman who had been helping around the home waited, impatient to leave. She and the cleaning lady would now come as little as possible. Pat showed me to my room. It was big and had a queen-size bed. She pointed to the bookshelves with all her first editions “in order”. That’s when I told her I had read only The Tremor of Forgery and had loved it. She said that in her opinion it was by far her best novel, so from now on her books would just disappoint me. This turned out not to be true: Edith’s Diary soon became my new favourite. But I understand why Pat, a queer person who never felt accepted by society (and who had a hard time accepting her own queer self), preferred The Tremor, a book about the need to question the moral codes we are handed, to all her other work.The shelves in my room also held autographed books by, and biographies of, her friends, like Graham Greene (the ones from Truman Capote were out in the living room), as well as many volumes about Marlene Dietrich, with whom she was obsessed. Pat’s personal and literary notebooks were stowed in closets and shelves right outside my room. She told me she had written almost every day for over 50 years.My room was freezing. It had large French doors leading out on to a courtyard, on the other side of which was Pat’s room. Her curtains were open, so I could see the single bed and writing desk in her messy bedroom. This voyeuristic setup also, of course, allowed her to see me and my room. She left me to unpack. I had no idea what was expected of me other than my presence. I came back into the living room, but she was in her room, typing. When she finally emerged from her room for dinner that first night, I followed her into the kitchen. She boiled water in a pot and added a bouillon cube. She asked me if I wanted supper, and I nodded, so she added another cube. That was dinner. She served herself a large mug of dark beer from a box she kept in the pantry and announced that the next day, she would teach me how to go to the supermarket.View image in fullscreenCate Blanchett in Carol (2015), an adaptation of Highsmith’s lesbian romance The Price of Salt (1952).Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/ShutterstockI read Strangers on a Train later that night, lying in bed. I could see, across the courtyard, Pat moving around in the dark of her room with a torch. I did not understand why she was using a torch when the electricity worked just fine. It was unnerving, but I was too absorbed by the novel to question her strangeness.The next day, I became the driver of the Volkswagen. I was a new and terrible driver, but Pat was very enthusiastic about my driving, probably because I went so slowly, which she said used less petrol. We went to the supermarket and bought soup cubes, beer boxes and food for the cat, which, Pat said, ate raw cow offal that the butcher was kind enough to reserve for her. She told me I would go shopping by myself once a week to pick up these things. We also got cheap bologna, white sandwich bread and six small apples. She introduced me to the butcher, who kept repeating “Charlotte” (the name of Pat’s cat) with a funny Italian accent. Pat paid with cash and brought used plastic bags to avoid paying for new ones. I was trying to remember everything and did not realise I was going to starve unless I bought my own beer for calories.I soon discovered that a neighbour stopped by every few days with minestrone soup or chicken stew, which she made at her home, since Pat did not allow her to cook in the house. Each evening, we would “dine” together at seven o’clock. We served ourselves in the kitchen and then, since the dining table was covered with unopened mail and other clutter, we unearthed a couple of place mats from beneath the junk and sat down. The room was dimly lit at all times, and Pat barely tasted those meals – her bowl was usually empty or had only a little broth. But she always brought a litre of beer to the table.I would eat slowly, trying to match her lack of appetite, and ask many questions that she enjoyed answering. She never offered me any beer and seemed surprised that I did not bring my own. She told me the doctors had forbidden her from taking her favourite poison (whisky), but I found a bottle of scotch hidden in the kitchen, and it kept getting emptier, even though she told me it was just for visitors (who never came). She’d had to quit smoking and was not supposed to drink at all because of her health. (Whatever was wrong with her seemed to be a secret, but Anna had implied it was cancer.) She was clearly used to drinking as much as her characters do; they sometimes comment that their liquor servings are “smallish”.At dinner a few days later, I asked if she had a computer, and she told me she still wrote all her work, and all her letters, on the same typewriter she had used to write Strangers on a Train at Yaddo, the artists’ colony in Saratoga Springs, New York. Hitchcock’s decision to adapt that novel into a 1951 film had changed Pat’s life. She had been making ends meet by writing comic books and taking other low-paying gigs, such as an editorial assistantship. When Hitchcock bought the rights to her novel anonymously – in order to pay less – Pat got $7,500. But more important than the money was the fact that, once the film was made, she became known, making it easier for her to meet people, get more writing jobs and publish books. This was why Pat kept using that typewriter, even though she had others, all of which looked prehistoric to me. “Superstition, I suppose,” she concluded.Pat did not talk much. She did tell me that although Hitchcock’s adaptation had “destroyed” her novel, she was forever grateful to him. In Strangers on a Train, she explained, the perfect crime is successful; both antiheroes win. But at the time, Hollywood had a morality code – the Hays Code – which meant that evil could not go unpunished, and so Hitchcock had a screenwriter come up with a new ending. She did not blame him for this. She seemed to be proud that Hitchcock liked her novel the way she had written it.Early the next morning, Charlotte woke me up meowing, as she would every morning. During the day, she slept somewhere or went hunting, but she always roused me at dawn. Pat had shown me how to slice the cow lungs we got from the butcher who kept saying “Charlo-TTe”. And now, every morning, Charlotte circled my legs, pushing impatiently as I prepared her breakfast. When I cut the lungs with the kitchen scissors, the alveoli would explode, popping like bubble wrap. It was an unsettling, disgusting sensation.After, as I washed my hands with detergent, I would hear Pat’s radio crackle on. She listened to the BBC for an hour every morning before getting up. Some days, I could not hear the radio until a bit later, and I would fear that she had died. I dreaded the thought of having to find her dead. (One morning towards the end of my stay, Pat did not turn on the radio at all, and I spent hours listening for movement behind the closed door.)View image in fullscreenHighsmith at home in Switzerland, 1985.Photograph: Dino Fracchia/AlamyAs Charlotte ate her breakfast, I would make myself a black tea. Dressed and ready to go in case Pat needed anything, I would read until I heard her come out of her room. Most days, she went briefly to the bathroom and then to the kitchen and then returned to her room, after which the typing would start. At that point, she was writing only letters, I believe. Sometimes she came to find me so she could share her plans, or ask me to get the mail because she was waiting for something or had something to send.On days when it was clear she was not going to need me, I would volunteer to go to the post office, just so I could walk around Tegna and have a coffee at the tiny town bar. The post office always had mail for Pat, but the postal workers were not friendly. My guess is they had heard Pat was a lesbian with no family, so must have assumed that I, the young woman living with her, had to be some sort of well-paid lover. And to be fair, I did not look like a nurse. I understood why Pat had stopped going there long ago and did not allow those judgy postal workers near her house.My walks allowed me to get fresh air, look at the mountains and take a break from the oppressive indoors. The house was depressing because Pat did not consider herself to be among the living. She explained that the magazine I saw during my interview had invited the 100 best authors alive to a celebratory event in Paris. “I obviously declined,” she told me. And I understood that she thought she was among the 100 best but did not consider herself to be really alive.Dani and Anna called us on Sundays. At one point, Dani explained that Pat had to go over the galleys of her novel Small g: A Summer Idyll, and I had to fax him her corrections. She had finished the novel a few months back, but she made significant last-minute edits. Every day, Pat made me fax the same page several times as she made changes. She was a perfectionist and studied each page for hours. She called Small g, which is about Zurich’s gay scene, her last novel, so my guess is she wanted it to be a great one. I did not get to read it until several months after she died. I was impressed by how much she knew about the city’s gay community and by her realistic portrayal of the Aids epidemic.Pat did not let me use her phone to call my boyfriend. Whenever he called, she told him I was not there. I did not dare confront her, even though I was counting on him visiting, even staying over occasionally. One day, I worked up the courage to ask her, and she told me that he could not enter her house or garden; if I met him at the town bar, I could not be gone for more than an hour, in case she needed me. My boyfriend and I decided he should not come, since I couldn’t even get away to meet him in Locarno. We just wrote letters. The same went for my friends and parents. A letter from Spain took 10 days to reach its destination, but she was clear that I could not occupy her phone line. When someone did call me, she would pick up the phone in her room, loudly clear her throat and announce she needed the phone for an urgent call, which she then never made.I did not question her rules or the assertiveness with which she refused to let me out of her world or anyone in, insistent that nobody could interrupt her routine or distract us from her bitter wait. I was weak and submissive, because of a lack of experience and because of the constant fear that something might happen to her while she was on my watch. I obsessed over not bothering her, and shortened my walks around town, tortured by my sense of responsibility, worried that Pat was unwell and alone, or needed me to fax the same page yet another time. So I adapted to her ways, becoming just as isolated, always home with her or near her, accompanied by only her novels, waiting for something to happen. I was mesmerised by the perfect crimes she had created in her books, and given how angry at life she seemed, I wondered if she had ever tried to kill someone herself.The only regular intrusion of the outside world into our claustrophobic existence was the Sunday phone call from Dani and Anna. Dani would talk to Pat for a bit, and then Anna would talk to me for 10 minutes. Anna could hear in my voice that I was not doing well, so she and Dani came to visit, as promised. They gave little notice of their plans, and afterwards Pat complained for days about having had to host them. They arrived late – “So rude,” she kept saying – and brought a gorgeous bouquet of two dozen tea roses. Pat told me to put them in a vase, whispering about how they had probably spent more than 500 francs on something that we would have to watch die. Dani was used to Pat’s insults and understood that aggression was her way of relating, so he just moved on to talking shop about Small g.Dani got along with her, maybe because he could be just as impatient and abrasive. He had overseen her world rights for years. She respected him. Pat was on bad terms with all her previous editors. While they talked in the living room, Anna took me to my room, worried about the dark shadows under my eyes and my weight loss. “We knew this would not be easy,” she told me.“I am fine, Anna,” I answered, trying to smile.“You are living with a difficult person who is waiting to die, and you remind her of everything she can no longer have,” Anna consoled me.View image in fullscreenGwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley, the 1999 adaptation of Highsmith’s 1955 novel of the same name.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarPat could not say no to Dani, so she allowed them to take me out to the only restaurant in town, where I ate a real dinner, including wine and zabaglione, a fluffy gift of hedonism and freedom that became my favourite dessert. They reminded me there was life out there, people to talk to, good food, laughter, air. I confessed that not being able to call anyone or have visits was hard, but I had got used to it. I told them I understood that old Pat had her ways but was not trying to hurt me.I said the hardest rule to follow was her mandate that I keep the lights off at night because she thought electricity too expensive. That’s why she used a flashlight and gave me one to use, too. I had got used to fearing her flashlight reflecting across the patio, but I dreaded total darkness because of what that could mean. I found it puzzling that the most basic expenses worried someone who had so much money. She yelled at me if I turned on a light by accident or used too much water, too many stock cubes, too many paper napkins, too much fuel for her car. She gave me very little money for groceries and petrol, and I told them that she had not paid me and that I was starting to feel as if I preferred not to be paid. Her pathological obsession with saving money shocked me.I also told Dani and Anna that I had been reading the first editions on Pat’s shelves in chronological order, during the day and by torch at night. I was in awe of her characters, human antiheroes, complicated souls. I was well into the Ripley saga by then and joked that maybe she would achieve the perfect crime by killing me even if she could not steal my identity. Later, as we were saying goodbye, Anna said something I didn’t expect: “It is obvious. Pat is just in love with you.”I did not know it then, but Pat had written many years ago, in her diary, that there are no sexually satisfied killers. She wrote that around the time she was creating Ripley. It was obvious from the Ripley series that frustrated desire was the catalyst for crime in Pat’s world, and Anna telling me that Pat was upset and short with me because she might love me made me even more afraid. Like Ripley, Pat could be charming but also dark, possessive, irrational and impatient.When I got back home from dinner, Pat was watching TV. She was upset that I had been gone for almost three hours and had missed half of the weekly BBC true-crime special we watched together. She told me that the show had given her ideas for her work, so she found it inspiring. I hated true crime.We watched the rest of the show together in silence. I could not stop thinking about what Anna had said to me.Once or twice a week, I drove Pat to Locarno’s hospital for her treatments. They took a long time. As I waited, I read my philosophy homework because I did not want her to see me reading her books in public; she was uncomfortable with being recognised.I did not know what kind of transfusions she got at the hospital (the fact that she had lung cancer did not become public until after her death), but they always made her feel better afterwards. Certainly, her mood lifted, though never for very long. She was private and worried about what others would say of her. Much later, I read that when she was young she had felt guilty about her gayness and so had hidden it, dating men and even trying psychoanalysis so she could marry a man, a fellow writer who was her good friend. All that negativity and frustration Pat radiated seemed to come from a deep guilt about being who she was. After her diaries became public, some articles noted that she had moments when she was able to accept being a lesbian and was unbothered by her significant drinking problem, but the Pat I knew had reverted to her shame.View image in fullscreenAlain Delon in Plein Soleil (1960), an adaptation of Highsmith’s novel The Talented Mr Ripley.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyI left her in early December to return home to take my exams. I had reminded her of my departure date for weeks. She did not make other arrangements for someone to look after her, just asked me to stay. I explained that I could not miss my finals, and that my family expected me for Christmas in Spain, but she ignored me. She pretended she could write our lives as if we were in one of her novels.On our last night together, she avoided talking to me or even looking at me. When I put my bags by the door the next morning, I expected a hug, as if I were the granddaughter she never had; instead, she offered me her hand for the third and last time. Her eyes were wet. I asked her to sign a German edition of a book about her that Dani had given me. She simply wrote her name without a dedication or personal note. She was angry. I was abandoning her, she finally said, just like “others” had done. She handed me an envelope with the weeks’ worth of salary she owed me, then went to her room. I had to close the door behind me and walk to the tiny red train that took me to Locarno. I never saw her again.On the train, I dreamed that I never made it home. When my parents called Anna, she called Pat, who said I had left the house to catch the morning train after she autographed my book and wished me the best. Soon, the police were telling my parents that I hadn’t made my flight and they couldn’t find me. I woke from the dream exhausted as my train was pulling into Zurich. I wiped the fog off the window with my hand to look at the city. Boring normal life felt so good, and I could not wait to be home, to get home alive.After Christmas, I spoke with Dani, who told me that Pat’s health had deteriorated after I left, and she had been admitted to the hospital in Locarno. I do not think she ever returned home. She died there at the beginning of February. Part of me was guilty and ashamed to realise this, but I was glad I had not been there for her worst days. Dani invited me to her funeral, which took place in March on my 21st birthday, but I declined.It took me decades to digest my time with Pat. I did not want to think or talk about it. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that Pat had not been in love with me, and had not, of course, been trying to kill me, but I do think she loved and hated the fantasy of being me: young, positive, loved, hopeful, straight, healthy, maybe even happy.The savage suburbia of Helen Garner: ‘I wanted to dong Martin Amis with a bat’Read moreIn late 2022, I returned to Tegna to visit the house where I had lived with Pat for those few weeks. She had told me that, after her death, it would be made into a museum dedicated to her life and work. That did not happen. Instead, the house is surrounded by the weekend homes that popped up around it, and today a family lives there with a lot of useless stuff everywhere. From the manicured garden, I saw that the foyer that led to my old bedroom was now filled with toys. And a swimming pool had been installed in the courtyard that formed the U, where Pat and I used to look across into each other’s rooms. I felt happy that she did not live to see this. We will miss the good things that happen after we die, but we will be spared some major disappointments. The house Pat dreamed up did not have a pool.This is an edited version of a piece that appeared inThe Yale ReviewListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readPatricia HighsmithCrime fictionFictionAlfred HitchcockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The jubilance for the coming-back-together of Oasis andBlack Sabbathis understandable. These acts are legends born from Britain’s working class.The reunion of Noel and Liam Gallagher has caused most excitement. Ever since the Britpop brothers announced themselves with their1994 debut Definitely Maybe, their anthemic sounds have become part of the UK music canon. Wonderwall is an unofficial national anthem of sorts, one belted out after rounds of beers. With the Manchester indie rockers’ first shows in 16 years, more than 1 million fans will feel justified insplashing out about £766 on average(tickets, travel, hotels) in a total projected tocrest £1bn.The prime minister has even joined in with the celebration,promising to tackle ticket-pricing problems. For those who were priced out or who couldn’t get tickets, the culture industry has sagely transformed into Nostaliga Inc around the gigs. There’s anOasis photo exhibition in Manchester, while Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery iscelebrating Ozzy Osbourne all summer long, aligning with the Prince of Darkness’sfarewell gig at Villa Park. The city centre pub where the heavy metal pioneers learned to gig has been trussed up with Sabbath photos. A local brewery has even created a Sabbath beer.But look a bit closer and thepub covered in Sabbath images, the Crown, remains functionally derelict, owned by developers. In 2023,125 grassroots gig venues closed. Last year,43.8% reported an operating loss. Just11 of the 34 venues that Oasis played on their first tour exist today. Moneyspinning stadium concerts are in rude health, sure, but other venues?Yet the UK has thethird-largest domestic music market in the world– so how did we get here? Landlords and developers play a central role. Rents are rising, venues are being served with eviction notices, and developers are refusing to use historic cultural assets for their intended purposes. Noise complaints against venues are also rising as apartments shoot up around them. Lack of public money, too, plays a part. The Crown was, at one stage, in line for a Birmingham council loan to help put it back into use, but the authority is broke and withdrew.Elsewhere, Night Time Industries Association data shows the rising cost of living isstopping punters going out. Increasingly, we spend on one-off big events, such as this summer’s legends’ gigs. Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster, sells tickets for such gigs andmade $22.7bn in 2023.It’s not inevitable that musical dinosaurs dominate the charts. Here’s how we rescue pop in Britain | Eamonn FordeRead moreWithout the smaller venues and gigs, where will we discover the next great acts? And just as importantly, where will they earn a living? In an era dominated by streaming, which pays out less than a penny per play, diversified income is a must. Touring, important for name-making and earning, is increasingly unaffordable for those who come from the same class backgrounds as Ozzy and the Gallaghers. A musicians’ census in 2023 found thatalmost half earned under £14,000 a year. Working-class representation in the arts as a whole hashalved since Sabbath’s heyday. Noel Gallagher has questioned where the next working-class rock stars will come from.They can’t afford guitars, he says.Thegovernment admits, at least, there are serious issues, not least with equitable class access. But arts funding is largely static,despite discussion of a levy on arena and stadium gigsto keep breathing life into the smaller venues that help all artists starting out. In a topsy-turvy manner, the ageing legends part of the ecosystem is in rude health while younger talent ails.Leftwing critic Mark Fisher would say that this is exactly where capitalism would lead us: the cancellation of anything new. The system doesn’t care, it just needs to sell us more things: dynamically priced gig tickets, pop-up shop merch or our own nostalgia. But this represents a cultural cul-de-sac, with new talent unable to make its way into the mainstream. Not if it’s working class, anyway.This summer, regardless, more than a millionOasisfans will belt out the lyrics to songs such as Live Forever. Memories will be made that will last a lifetime. Just maybe, the gigs will inspire another generation to make music, and maybe – but hopefully definitely – we’ll be able to hear it.Dan Cave is a freelance journalist and writerExplore more on these topicsPop and rockOpinionOasisBlack SabbathIndieMetalClass issuesInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s 100% real news: the Israeli prime minister who has been indicted by the international criminal court for allegedwar crimes in Gazahas proposed the US president, his largest weapons supplier and strongest political backer, as a candidate for the world’s top peacemaking prize.It’s absurd, akin to nominating one’s drug dealer for the Nobel prize in medicine. But there’s a cynical logic behindNetanyahu’s publicity stunt: he is exploitingTrump’s need for flattery to prolongIsrael’s brutal war on Gazaand to continue attacking other countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Lebanon and Yemen. Before Netanyahu showed up for dinner at the White House on Monday with a copy of his Nobel nomination letter, Trump was eager to announce aceasefire dealbetween Israel and Hamas this week.Taken aback by Netanyahu’s gesture, Trump backed off on pressuring the Israeli leader to reach an agreement with Hamas. And Netanyahu wins yet again by playing for time, as he has done since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023. The prime minister has repeatedlysabotaged negotiationsto stay in power. He wants to keep his extremist government coalition intact so he can avoid early parliamentary elections, which his Likud party is likely to lose, and to blockan independent investigationinto his administration’s security failures that led up to the Hamas attack. But most of all, Netanyahu wants to save himself: he’s clinging to power to avoid a bribery andcorruption trialthat is rooted in one of his earlier stints as premier.Seeking bulldozer drivers to demolish Gaza: how a genocide is being outsourced | Arwa MahdawiRead moreNetanyahu,often dubbed“the great survivor” of Israeli politics, is an astute tactician who figured out what makes Trump tick: extreme flattery and distraction. The prime minister knows that he can’t compete with wealthy Arab petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which can provide Trump’s family business with billions of dollars in real estate and golf deals, or lavish gifts like a$400m luxury jetto be used as Air Force One. But Netanyahu correctly presumed that he can appeal to Trump’s desire to be recognized as a global peacemaker.That’s exactly what Netanyahu did when he walked into the White House this week and tapped into Trump’s sense of grievance over being passed over for the Nobel peace prize. For years, Trump insisted that he deserves the prize for his efforts during his first term as president to broker a series ofdiplomatic deals, known as the Abraham accords, between Israel and several Arab states. The agreements, which were negotiated in 2020 by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser at the time, included the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. But Trump and Kushner could not convince the most important Arab state, Saudi Arabia, to sign on to a normalization deal with Israel.The Abraham accords were built on a delusion: that Washington could solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by ignoring the reality of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, and an Israeliblockade of Gazaat the time. Trump and Kushner, who both approach political dealmaking through the prism of real estate transactions, decided to avoid the Palestinians and their concerns altogether, and negotiate directly with autocratic Arab regimes that wanted to formalize their existing secret relations with Israel into more open diplomacy. In other words, the Trump administration treated the Palestinians as real estate holdouts who were refusing to accept a glitzy deal that would ignore their rights while others reaped the benefits.The problem, of course, is that if Trump truly wants a shot at winning the Nobel prize, he would first need to stop the bloodshed in GazaIt’s no surprise that Netanyahu used the flawed Abraham accords as the basis for his recommendation of Trump for the Nobel prize. “President Trump has demonstrated steadfast and exceptional dedication to promoting peace, security and stability around the world,” the prime minister wrote in hisnomination letter, dated 1 July and addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the annual winner. Netanyahu sent his letter a mere 10 days after Trump orderedUS warplanes to bombmajor nuclear facilities in Iran, briefly joining a war started by Netanyahu in mid-June, when Israel launched a surprise attack against dozens of targets across Iran.At their White House meeting, Netanyahu piled on his fawning over Trump. “I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people,” Netanyahu said as he presented Trump with his nomination letter. “You deserve it,” the prime minister added, reinforcing Trump’s belief that he has been unfairly denied the prize.Trump was clearly pleased with Netanyahu’s gesture and sycophancy. “This I didn’t know. Wow. Thank you very much,”the president said, feigning surprise. “Coming from you in particular, this is very meaningful.”Netanyahu also appealed to Trump’s desire to be a strong man who imposes peace through strength, ashis advisersare fond of saying. And the Israeli leader knows how to make Trump feel like a winner, who has basked in the reflected glory of Israel’s military achievements against Iran and its allies in the region. Trump loves winners – and he hates to be associated with “losers” or any kind of failure, as he never tires of reminding everyone.The problem, of course, is that if Trump truly wants a shot at winning the Nobel prize, he would first need to stop the bloodshed in Gaza. And that means using American leverage –billions of dollarsin US weapons and unwavering diplomatic support for Israel at the UN and other international bodies – to pressure Netanyahu to end the war. So far, Trump has refused to use that influence over Israel, much like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Netanyahu with a virtually unlimited supply of arms, only to be rewarded with the Israeli leader’s scorn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Israeli militarydropped hundredsof these 2,000lb bombs in the first month of its war on Gaza – an intensity of aerial bombardment that had not been seen since the Vietnam war.Trump also dreams of securing his Nobel prize by negotiating a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an expansion of the Abraham accords that the Biden administration failed to achieve. But the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, who is Trump’s favorite Arab leader, has vowed not to sign a deal with Israel until it commits to theestablishment of a Palestinian state. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is Netanyahu, who has bragged that he spent most of his political career obstructing just that. “Everyone knows that I am the one who for decades blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger our existence,”he saidin February 2024.While Netanyahu was wooing Trump with his Nobel nomination letter in Washington, other Israeli officials were brazen in describing their plans for the forced mass displacement of civilians in Gaza. The defense minister, Israel Katz, described a proposal to concentrate Palestinians in the territoryinto an internment campon the ruins of the southern city of Rafah.As Netanyahu fawned over Trump, the Israeli leader’s allies were laying out a blueprint for committing new war crimes.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Erecting walls won’t bring us peace and prosperityLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the president of BrazilThu 10 Jul 2025 08.47 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 08.58 EDTShareThe year 2025 should be a time of celebration, marking eight decades of theUnited Nations’ existence. But it risks going down in history as the year when the international order built since 1945 collapsed.The cracks had long been visible. Since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the intervention in Libya and the war in Ukraine, some permanent members of the security council have trivialised the illegal use of force. The failure to act vis-a-vis the genocide in Gaza represents a denial of the most basic values of humanity. The inability to overcome differences is fuelling a new escalation of violence in the Middle East, the latest chapter of whichincludestheattack on Iran.The law of the strongest also threatens the multilateral trading system. Sweeping tariffs disrupt value chains and push the global economy into a spiral of high prices and stagnation. The World Trade Organization has been hollowed out, and no one remembers theDoha development round.The 2008 financial collapse exposed the failure of neoliberal globalisation, but the world remained locked into the austerity playbook. The choice to bail out the ultra-wealthy and major corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens and small businesses has deepened inequality. In the past 10 years, the$33.9tn (£25tn) accumulated by the world’s richest 1%is equivalent to 22 times the resources needed to eradicate global poverty, according to a report by Oxfam.The ‘new world order’ of the past 35 years is being demolished before our eyes. This is how we must proceed | Gordon BrownRead moreThe stranglehold on the state’s capacity for action has led to public distrust in institutions. Discontent has become fertile ground for extremist narratives that threaten democracy and promote hate as a political project.Many countries have cut cooperation programmes instead of redoubling efforts to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030. The available resources are insufficient, the costs are high, access is bureaucratic, and the conditions imposed often fail to respect local realities.This is not about charity, but about addressing disparities rooted in centuries of exploitation, interference and violence against the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. In a world with a combinedGDP of over $100tn, it is unacceptable that more than700 million people still suffer from hungerand live without electricityor water.The richest countries bear the greatest historical responsibility for carbon emissions, yet it is the poorest who will suffer the most from the climate crisis. Theyear 2024 was the hottest in history, showing that reality is moving faster thanthe Paris agreement. The binding obligations of theKyoto protocolwere replaced by voluntary commitments, and the financing pledgesmade at COP 15 in Copenhagenin 2009 – promising $100bn annually – never materialised. The recent increase in Nato’s military spending makes that possibility even more remote.Attacks on international institutions ignore the concrete benefits the multilateral system has brought to people’s lives. If smallpox has been eradicated, the ozone layer preserved and labour rights still protected in much of the world, it is thanks to the efforts of these institutions.In times of growing polarisation, terms such as “deglobalisation” have become commonplace. But it is impossible to “deplanetise” our shared existence. No wall is high enough to preserve islands of peace and prosperity surrounded by violence and misery.Today’s world is vastly different from that of 1945. New forces have emerged, and new challenges have arisen. If international organisations seem ineffective, it is because their structure no longer reflects the current reality. Unilateral and exclusionary actions are worsened by the absence of collective leadership. The solution to the multilateralism crisis is not to abandon it, but to rebuild it on fairer and more inclusive foundations.This is the understanding that Brazil – whose vocation has always been to foster collaboration among nations – demonstrated during itsG20 presidency last yearand continues to demonstrate through its presidencies of the Brics andCop 30this year: that it is possible to find common ground even in adverse scenarios.There is an urgent need to recommit to diplomacy and rebuild the foundations of true multilateralism – one capable of answering the outcry of a humanity fearful for its future. Only then can we stop passively watching the rise of inequality, the senselessness of war and the destruction of our own planet.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the president of BrazilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now Miliband should be less absolutist on his 2030 goalsNils PratleyThe imperative ought to be to bear down on costs for consumers, starting with a more pragmatic approach to generation targetsThu 10 Jul 2025 14.36 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 15.10 EDTShareThe chief executive of Ofgem, Jonathan Brearley, backed zonal pricing. Fintan Slye, the head of the National Energy System Operator, also supported a system that could have led to different parts of Great Britain charging different rates for their electricity. Chris Stark, the head of the “mission control” unit within Ed Miliband’s energy department, declared himself to be “zonal curious”.But it’s not going to happen. After intense lobbying from both sides of thegreat philosophical dividein energy-land, Miliband haskilled the zonal option. The policy wonks are now obliged to go back to fiddling with internal network charges – the fees paid by generators to access the transmission network – to calculate the sweet spots to encourage more renewable generation where it’s most needed, while not stifling it completely in places where, for example, it is windy. That means yet more rounds of consultation.UK government abandons energy ‘zonal pricing’ planRead moreIn the meantime, the maddening “constraint costs” will clock up. These include the payments to windfarms (usually in Scotland) to turn off when it’s too windy because the local grid would otherwise be overloaded, plus those made to other generators (usually gas-fired plants in the south of England) to fire up. Constraint costs, charged to our bills, were £2.7bn last year and are projected to hit £4bn by 2030 even if the newly commissioned extra transmission capacity actually arrives on time, which it probably won’t.Put simply, too many windfarms were built before the grid could cope. Everybody involved in energy policymaking for the past decade, including a long succession of Tory energy ministers, should be squirming. Octopus Energy, the noisiest advocate for zonal, was able to cite analysis that Seagreen, Scotland’s largest windfarm, was paid to restrict its output71% of the timelast year. If the figure is only roughly accurate, it is still excruciating.Yet Miliband’s resistance to zonal is understandable. The switch wouldn’t have happened until the mid-2030s, so it would have done nothing to reduce constraint costs out to 2030, his target for a clean power system. And the real zonal killer, even if Miliband didn’t quite spell it out, was the cost of disruption. The non-Octopus parts of the industry probably weren’t making it up about increased costs of capital under a more uncertain pricing system.Bids to build windfarms, for example, don’t solely depend on the initial contract-for-difference, or price guarantee for 15 years. A developer also has to take a view on the likely wholesale price of electricity once the subsidies drop away. Miliband will have feared the next auctions to build offshore wind would spit out truly painful prices. As it is, this autumn’s winning bids will probably arrive well above the current gas-dictated wholesale price of electricity, as described in this columnearlier this week. Windfarms are capital-intense projects and the age of cheap money is over.Miliband is reportedly under pressure from Downing Street to show how his project for clean power by 2030 will bring down bills for ordinary consumers. So he should be.“Stepping back from zonal pricing does not, in itself, constitute a strategy,” commented Kate Mulvany, of the research firm Cornwall Insight, calling for reforms of the national pricing setup to be bold. “Presently, consumers face the worst of both worlds: paying wholesale prices that are still driven by volatile gas markets, and premium costs to replace gas in the power system with renewables,” she said. “We cannot assume they will be willing to pay like this for ever. Households and businesses care about affordable, reliable energy above all else. If reform fails to deliver that, the legitimacy of the entire system will be called into question.”In a similar vein, Marc Hedin, of AuroraEnergyResearch, said: “We need to act quickly to minimise the cost of managing network congestion ahead of 2030, which is a sword of Damocles that could severely hurt bills and the whole credibility of the current framework.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a world of trade-offs, the imperative should be to bear down on costs. The industry now has more certainty over investment. The next step should be more pragmatism, and less absolutism, about generation targets.Clean power has been defined, oddly, as 95% low-carbon and the 2030 target itself is arbitrary. Would it really hurt to do, say, 92% by 2032 if it saved consumers billions in their bills by ensuring the grid infrastructure is actually in place in time? That is a question that officialdom has, so far, been reluctant to answer. One hopes somebody is doing modelling because the biggest risk to the government’s long-term decarbonisation ambitions would be the election of Reform UK.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryNils Pratley on financeOfgemEd MilibandRegulatorsRenewable energyGreen politicsWind powercommentShareReuse this content"

Nice, that. Very British somehow, this kind of tongue-in-cheek modesty. I liked it so much that I’ve made the hour-long motorbike journey back out here to write this. The tea is good, the welcome warm and the sandwich substantial. It is indeed the best farm cafe in Lower Wick – there is no “possibly” about it, because, as I suspected, it is theonlyfarm cafe in Lower Wick.In this era of relentless, irony-free, fact-free boastfulness, a lesser establishment might have shouted about being the best cafe in Worcester, Worcestershire or all of merrie England. So this was refreshing to see. A good 20 years ago, I drove past a sign outside a pub near Warwick promising “crap beer, terrible food, unfriendly service”. I’ve always regretted not popping in to pay tribute to the management.Another, less knowing example of this kind of thing that has long charmed me is the sign for Monmouth golf club on the A40 just outside the town. It says, in quotation marks, that it is “arguably the prettiest course in Wales”. The “arguably” is doing a lot of honourable work there. It’s not clear who is being quoted – it may be the club itself – but a lesser establishment would have left the “arguably” out, removing all doubt from the question. Respect.Sometimes, a boast is so deliciously odd that it’s not clear whether or not there is irony at play. There is a sex shop in central London the sign of which boasts: “The only 2 storey Adult Shop in Soho!” I’ve walked past this place a hundred times and always wondered about this. Is it true? Does it matter? I’ve never worked up the courage to go in to ask.Now, I’ve ridden through the northern fringes of Worcester and chanced upon another wry sign, this one for an art gallery. It reads: “Last Gallery Before M5”. I like its style. This is a place called the Bevere Gallery. Assuming its art is as good as its signage, I’ll be back for a look.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsRetail industryOpinionBritish identity and societycommentShareReuse this content"

Whether the debacle overLabour’s welfare reform billwill leave a similarly lasting mark on the Starmer administration remains uncertain. But the signs are familiar: rushed legislation, party unrest and proposals out of step with expert advice andpublic sentiment. The bill passed on Wednesday night bore little resemblance to its original version – it was so different, in fact, that even the title had changed. Yet MPs were asked to approve it with minimal scrutiny. The rebellion of47 Labour MPscarries more weight than the numbers suggest – because it taps into questions of moral judgment.Some who voted against the bill’s third reading may be driven by factional grudges. Many think poverty is a national crisis to be ended. Rebels identified the sting in the tail of the new welfare bill: halving theuniversal credithealth element for 90% of new claimants from April 2026. The government, rattled by party dissent, had already removed the most provocative clause – targeting personal independence payments – and rebranded the bill to gain Commons assent.But old habits die hard. Ministers hadshamelesslyclaimed their new bill lifts50,000people out of poverty. This only works by counting 150,000 spared harm by scrapping Tory plans. In fact,100,000 more people– mostly disabled – will fall into poverty due to the changes in Labour’s “new” act. That’s not a progressive policy. It’s a sleight of hand disguising a deep cut. Commendably, theUNsaw through it. By not implementing the Tory change, Labour has in effectincurreda cost to the Treasury of about £3.6bn, but ministers are, paradoxically, booking this non-action as both a “net saving” and a social gain.The politics of welfare have long turned on the question of who deserves what and why. Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives try to portray cruelty as common sense with talk of“makers not takers”. Under Sir Keir Starmer, welfare is no longer a right but a test of how sick is sick enough. However, outside Westminster, the arguments sound different. They arrive not as Treasury spreadsheets, but as stories. A child telling her teacher she didn’t eat last night. A mother choosing between heating and the bus fare to school.In herreportthis week, the children’s commissioner for England offered a bleak account of what life is like for poor children. They live in dilapidated flats or hotel rooms with no kitchens and wear worn-out clothes. They talk with a clarity that adults often avoid about humiliation and exclusion. The report – based on testimony from 128 children – should have shamed the government for tolerating “almost-Dickensian” poverty. Instead, the joint call by the four children’s commissioners of the UK to tackle it was received by ministers withpolite concernlest it halt the forward march of their welfare bill.Capping key child-related benefits to the first two children in a family is wrong. Lifting it would mean 350,000 children are removed from poverty and would help 700,000 more. Seven MPs weresuspendedlast July for opposing the continuation of the two-child benefit cap. Wednesday’s rebellion was too big for Labour’s high command to punish; removing the whip wasn’t an option. Welfare preventsmisery. Blaming it for poverty won’t wash. Sir Keir must accept that – and forget about attempting to govern by excluding critics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

European solidarity must remain strong tooThu 10 Jul 2025 14.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 14.03 EDTShareEuropean leaders gathered in Rome on Thursday for a conference on Ukrainian recovery, but endurance remains the priority. Russia has intensified its assault withpunishing strikesfar beyond the frontline – including a record 728 drones and 13 missiles one day before the conference. The UN said thatcivilian casualtieslast month were at their highest for three years, with at least 232 people killed and 1,343 injured.Russia’s brutal offensive aims to break Ukraine’s spirit and European solidarity. Even Donald Trumpappears to be realising, withencouragement, that Moscow is not interested in peace. For Mr Trump, maximalism is a negotiating tactic; he does not recognise that for Vladimir Putin it reflects a fixation. Yet this week he acknowledged: “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin … He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”War is exhausting. Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, reminded the conference that Ukrainians are living in a chronic state of stress and emotional pain. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of the gap between those fighting on the frontline and those making decisions in Kyiv – even if the latter have repeatedly rushed for shelters this week.But Ukraine is fighting to remain a viable, independent state; Russia to ensure that it does not. The finding by the European court of human rightsof Russian abuses “on a massive scale”in Ukrainefrom 2014 onwards, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and forced labour, is a potent encapsulation of why resolve endures.No one should count on Mr Trump remaining aggrieved by Russia for long, still less on that producing significant action. Though the US has resumedweapons shipmentsafter a pause, the deliveries authorised by Joe Biden will soon reach their end and the US no longer sees this as its war. The long-awaited bipartisan sanctions bill promoted by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham appears to befinally making progress. But the president will not approve it unless it gives him plenty of wiggle room on actually imposing measures.European obeisanceto “Daddy”may be emetic, but aims to ensure that allies can buy the arms that Ukraine needs, and that the US keeps supplying intelligence. The future lies in European self-reliance. For now, the hope is not of decisively defeating Moscow but preventing it from winning. If victory is measured by the metre, Russia continues to grind out an advance – but slowly and at growing cost. And as Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman, the military strategy expert,wrote recently: “The question to ask is not whether Russia can keep going but whether it can meet its political objectives … For the foreseeable future, it can’t.”Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister,has suggestedthat Kyiv should pursue “strategic neutralisation”. It would seek to prevent Russia achieving its military goals, shifting “from a contest of exhaustion to a contest of operational irrelevance in which Russia may still fight, but cannot win”. This would require sharp focus and continued military innovation and should help to preserve personnel. Mr Zagorodnyuk cited Ukraine’s success in the Black Sea; it did not destroy the Russian fleet, but ensured that shipping could resume. This more limited approach may not be an inspiring prospect for a battered nation. But, with Moscow intent on subjugation and the US keeping its distance, it may be a pragmatic one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While the winner of Djokovic’s upcoming semi-final duel with Jannik Sinner will probably face Carlos Alcaraz, the two-time defending champion who just won at Roland Garros for a second year in a row does have another match to win first.Alcaraz will take on Taylor Fritz, the fifth seed, in the preceding semi-final. Although Alcaraz will enter Centre Court as the clear favourite, the outcome is far from certain.It is no wonder that those two players are heavy on Djokovic’s mind. After years of being at the top, the world No 1 for a total of 428 weeks and the player everyone in the world was trying to topple, in this final stretch of his unparalleled career Djokovic is now charged with chasing down two generational talents who still have not reached the peak of their powers. In a world where winning a grand slam title means beating at least one of Sinner or Alcaraz, he can only brace himself for the most difficult outcome.The fact that a 38-year-old Djokovic, with so many miles in his legs, remains better placed than any other player in the world to disrupt Alcaraz and Sinner is a significant achievement in itself. At the grand slam tournaments, which he has repeatedly described as his primary objective, Djokovic has clearly shown that he is their main rival. In the three major tournaments this year, the veteran has reached three semi-finals,defeating AlcarazandAlexander Zverev, the world No 3, in the previous grand slam tournaments to make them.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic lost in straight sets in the semi-finals of the French Open to Jannik Sinner, but the match was closer than the scoreline suggested.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile Djokovic and Alcaraz have continued to go back and forth in their rivalry, the significant shift in the match-up between Djokovic and Sinner has reflected the diverging paths of their careers. The Serb won four of their first five meetings, including two at Wimbledon. SinceSinner recovered from triple match point down to defeat Djokovicin the Davis Cup semi-finals in 2023, however, he has dominated their matches, winning their past four meetings. Until late in the second set of theirFrench Open semi-final last month, Djokovic, arguably the greatest returner of all time, had not broken Sinner’s serve since 2023.Their match in Paris, won bySinner in three tight sets, plainly illustrated the mental edge the Italian has built up over Djokovic. After an uncertain start, the Serb forced himself into the match and generated numerous chances that could have shifted the momentum and completely changed the match. In the past, he certainly would have taken them.But after more than a decade of Djokovic reliably rising to the occasion in the most important moments and pulling away from opponents when it truly mattered, on this occasion it was Sinner who handled the tight moments with incredible poise. “So I get another opportunity,” said Djokovic. “For me, this is what counts actually the most … Being in the last stages of grand slams and playing against the best player in the world right now.”View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic suffered a bad fall in the final game of his victory over Flavio Cobolli in the quarter-finals.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianDespite a frustrating loss, Djokovic left Court Philippe-Chatrier with further proof that his playing level is not far away from that of the world No 1. He believes his greatest challenge lies in the physical task of playing at such a high intensity for such a long time across a best-of-five-sets match. “Physically I hope that I’ll be able to sustain that,” said Djokovic. “That’s more of a concern than game-wise. I think game-wise the way I’m feeling the ball when I’m fit and ready, I feel like I can go toe to toe with those guys and even beat them if I’m playing my best.”For this reason, Djokovic has long consideredWimbledonhis best chance of winning his 25th grand slam title and becoming the oldest major champion in history. The less attritional nature of grass-court tennis just makes the surface more forgiving to a player with so many miles in his legs, allowing him to use his serve, encouraging him to play even more offensively and to shorten points by closing down the net more frequently.After his own desperatestruggles against Grigor Dimitrovwhen he trailed by two sets and was nursing a sore elbow before the Bulgarian’s shocking retirement due to sudden injury, Sinner brushed his own physical concerns away with aruthless three-set win over Ben Sheltonon Wednesday.Djokovic, who has his own injury concerns and first delayed and then cancelled his scheduled practice session at the All England Club on Thursday, will have to sustain an incredibly high level just to get close to the No 1, but so often over the years these are the occasions that have inspired such performances from him.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisJannik SinnerCarlos AlcarazfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are no plans to send him for scans, the hope being that he will recover overnight and, alongside Joe Root – who is unbeaten on 99 – “really kick on and make it a score north of 400, towards 500”.Joe Root unbeaten on 99 as England dig in against India but Stokes injury a concernRead more“Fingers crossed it’s nothing too serious, but we’ve got a big test over the next four days and a big day two coming up as well, so it is important to try and manage him,” said Pope, who scored a scratchy 44 before being dismissed by Ravindra Jadeja with the first ball after tea.“But it is one of my roles to make sure that he doesn’t push himself to a ridiculous place with whatever he’s dealing with at the moment. I’m sure the physios and medics will work with him to lay out a plan, and then I’ll help push him in the right direction.”At 3.02 runs per over, England’s innings currently ranks as theirthird slowestunder Stokes’s permanent captaincy, as the nature of the pitch and the accuracy of India’s bowlers forced them to rein in their attacking instincts.“It’s not necessarily the way we’re used to going about it but I think it’s a pretty good score,” Pope said. “Of course we’d have liked to be 400 for four, but the surface didn’t allow that at all, and the Indian attack did bowl well.It’s something we’re trying to keep developing as a team … it’s something I’m working on in my game as well, not just scoring runs in quick style, it’s also when the time is right to absorb some pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any pretensions of lakeside refinement were blasted into the sky when Riola Xhemaili, brought on as a late throw of the dice, showed the instinct Switzerland had been missing all night. They had only needed a point to continue local interest at Euro 2025 but found themselves trailing to a gutsy Finland as the match entered its second minute of added time.Then the tireless Geraldine Reuteler skewed a cross-shot into the six-yard box; Xhemaili was placed to capitalise and host nation politesse was the last thing on anybody’s minds from thereon.Finland 1-1 Switzerland: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreThe stands pulsated and perhaps this was the moment a country that has taken a friendly, generous interest in its home tournament catapults itself into a full-on embrace. Maybe a hugely likable, manifestly flawed Swiss team has finally made its point and the anticipation will surely ramp up to fever pitch in the eight days until their first ever quarter-final. Never mind that their opponents will almost certainly be Spain: an evening of such magnitude deserves bathing in a while longer.It even made an impression on Pia Sundhage, who may have thought she had seen it all during her 50 years in football but has never enjoyed a more satisfying draw than this. “It was the most exciting,” she said. “These kinds of moment make you think ‘I can go on for ever and ever’. It’s inspiring to be around these players and staff members.”Sundhage’s young side are a scintillating proposition in full flow but for long periods it seemed familiar failings, evident in their opening-nightdefeat against Norway, would scupper them. They had raced out of the blocks, roared on by the most vibrant and partisan atmosphere this summer has mustered so far.Viola Calligaris should have paved the way for a smooth ride but miscued an 11th-minute bicycle kick in front of goal. The Barcelona prodigy Sydney Schertenleib tested Anna Koivunen but by half-time the early fire had been dampened.View image in fullscreenRiola Xhemaili turns home Switzerland’s equaliser in the second minute of stoppage time.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersHad their goalkeeper, Livia Peng, not made a brilliant stop from Eva Nyström’s deflection then Finland would have gone in ahead. Marko Saloranta’s players had worked their way into the game, presumably thinking the chance they needed would come. Oona Siren began to call the shots in midfield and there was a sense Switzerland could drift into trouble.They stepped up the pace with help from the substitute Leila Wandeler, one of three teenaged forwards who began the second half. Nobody could doubt Sundhage’s desire to open up the throttle even though risks were not obligatory. Wandeler shot over and created a half chance for Smilla Vallotto; a sense of abandon had returned but the sting that followed resembled a story as old as time.A silent scream reverberated when Calligaris hacked down Emma Koivisto, who had profited from strong work by Sanni Franssi near the right byline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Calligaris had, at that point, embodied Switzerland’s weaknesses at both ends but those concerns were soon to be banished.Xhemaili’s smart finish capped an old-fashioned kitchen sink job, the crowd recovering from its shock to suck the ball towards Koivunen’s goal. It left some of Finland’s players, who had lacked the fluency of their own narrow reverse against the Norwegians, in tears. “It’s such an empty and painful feeling,” said an exhausted-looking Saloranta.By contrast, Switzerland’s hearts are full. “We showed the whole world what Swiss people can do,” a beaming Xhemaili said.

Horner’s removal a price the parent company was willing to pay.Horner’s Red Bull exit: the end of an era that will be felt across Formula One grid | Giles RichardsRead moreThat Red Bull GmbH finally moveddecisively against Hornerafter almost two years of internecine strife appears to have met the goal of the Verstappen camp, led by the driver’s father Jos, who made little secret of his desire to be rid of this turbulent team principal.This did not appear a likely outcome when the furore overallegations against Hornerof inappropriate behaviour toward a female employee died down after he was exonerated by an independent investigation. Yet while that had perhaps been the spark, what really stoked the fire and probably provoked decisive action at Red Bull GmbH was the downturn in results and the problems that led to that point. If the power struggle is over, the fundamental issues remain.This position was pointedly noted by Verstappen’s manager Raymond Vermeulen after Horner’s removal. “We are looking for more performance so that we can return to the top,” he said. “In that respect nothing will change.”The position is stark:Red Bullwon 21 of 22 races in 2023, as dominant as any season in F1 history, but last year Verstappen managed to just claw out the title and now trails the championship leader Oscar Piastri by 69 points. Red Bull are fourth in the constructors’ championship and then only because of Verstappen. He has scored 165 points this year, the team’s second drivers’ just seven.Central to this downturn has been the performance of their car, about which Verstappen has been blunt in his condemnation. Yet for all their efforts, it shows no sign of improving. Since Red Bull lost their designer Adrian Newey to Aston Martin in 2024, the balance problems that plagued it in the second half of that season have continued into 2025 and been further exposed as other teams have improved.This cannot be absolutely attributed to Newey’s absence but it must be a factor, and that the current Red Bull design team, under technical director Pierre Waché, has been unable to solve the problems will concern Verstappen. The car Newey designed for the 2022 regulations was built to suit Verstappen and for two years they were completely dominant.However, when the other teams began catching up and Red Bull had to develop, the negative traits of the car and its increasingly narrow performance window only became more and more severe. The pursuit of extreme performance at the expense of drivability was based on Verstappen’s capability to manage it but it has reached the point where even the Dutchman is barely managing and his teammates are adrift.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen, who finished fifth at the British Grand Prix, wants a competitive Red Bull car so he can compete for a fifth world title.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockAll of this may well cast doubt in his mind as to how they will fare for the major regulation change of 2026, towards which he is now looking and which is the motivation behind himopening talks with Mercedes.Moreover there has been the loss of other key staff alongside Newey in the past two years. Horner was always bullish that the team had strength in depth but equally they were pillars of the stability Verstappen craves. Especially noticeable was the departure of personnel in key roles, such as Rob Marshall, the chief engineering officer, Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director and Will Courtenay, the head of strategy.Then there is the elephant in the room, anxiously hopped-up on energy drink, in the form of Red Bull building their own engines for the first time next season.Mercedes is believed to already be leading the field and have form in this regard as their mastery of the 2024 regulations – a similarly engine-focussed formula – proved. Emerging in 2026 with a dominance similar to the one they enjoyed that year would make their car the most desirable seat on the grid.Red Bull’s project is an enormous and daunting step into the unknown and one where notably even manufacturers with a proven track record in building engines have struggled, as Honda’s most recent travails with McLaren attest.Verstappen will probably have a good idea where the Red Bull engine programme is and Mercedes may well have given him an indication of where they are, if they are to tempt him on board. Performance-led factors are likely to carry more weight with Verstappen than personality or politics and they remain as pertinent now as they were on the day before Horner was dismissed.For the moment, then, it would seem the Verstappens have their way, certainly Jos, in Horner’s removal. For his son, however, who wants calm and focus, throwing in a new team principal halfway through developing a car for new regulations does not appear to be a recipe for a serene succession into a successful future. Certainly in comparison to the stability at Mercedes.Indeed the 48-year-old Frenchman Laurent Mekies faces a similarly intimidating task to the one Horner addressed when he began building Red Bull from the ashes of Jaguar in 2005. Whether Verstappen is there to see it through with him remains to be seen, Horner or no Horner.Explore more on these topicsRed BullChristian HornerMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Real Madrid, the best thing that could be said about their last game of the 2024-2025 season was that it was their last game of the 2024-2025 season. So in the makeshift marquee set up by the MetLife Stadium, Xabi Alonso said exactly that, and repeatedly. He had watched his team, who aren’t entirely his team yet, betaken apart by Paris Saint-Germain; now he wanted to get home and “reset”, forget about it. Well, not forget exactly: the hurt might help, lessons learned. “I want this to have an impact but not drag us down,” he said. “In August we start 2025-26, which will be different.”The way they fell was familiar, back to their recent past, their reality. “We suffered the way others have suffered against them,” Alonso said, and that was true, but it is not only PSG; it is Madrid too. This was their 68th game of the season and their 15th loss.They won only the Uefa Super Cup, a world away now, andthe Intercontinental Cup against Pachuca in Qatar. In the league, Barcelona beat them twice, scoring four each time. In the cup, Barcelona put three past them;in the Super Cup,five.Arsenal scored three in the Champions League.PSG stopped at fourbecause they didn’t need more.Mbappé gets stuck in Dembélé’s shadow in Real Madrid’s shapeless shambles | Jacob SteinbergRead moreTheClub World Cupwas a tournament and a testing ground. Alonso hadn’t been keen to take over in the US, but once it was made clear that he must, he described it as an opportunity to accelerate the processes he had planned, implement ideas early. The demand is always to win, exposed before the eyes of the world, but at least to begin with games were analysed as much through what was new, what was coming, as whether they lifted the trophy. The discourse from the new coach was recurring, all about collectivity, spirit, a structure. Every time he was asked about an individual, he turned to the group. Everyone must work, without exception.There were details too, something developing: a shifting attitude and new formation that sometimes featured three at the back, Aurélien Tchouaméni playing what Alonso called a “hybrid” role, stepping in and out of the defence. Gonzalo García was a revelation. Dean Huijsen can really play. Fran García was good. Fede Valverde was released. Arda Guler may be a deep playmaker, occupying the position for which Madrid had no one else. The spaces between them narrowed. They were actually pressing sometimes.They reached the semi-finals. Yes, they might have expected that. And no, they hadn’t beaten truly great teams. ButJuventusand Borussia Dortmund are decent tests and, apart from amad last 10 minutes in the latter game, were eliminated with an authority not seen for too long. Madrid had a manager. It was startling, and pretty grubby, how quickly Carlo Ancelotti – the coach who won it all – was condemned and the team considered fixed.View image in fullscreenOusmané Dembélé scored in PSG’s victory over Real Madrid as the Spanish team were exposed at the back time and again.Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/PSG/Getty ImagesAnd then came PSG, and it all fell apart. That’s not pressing;thisis pressing. Can you really say that a goal was coming, overdue even, when it is scored inside six minutes? You can when it is like this: by the time Fabián Ruiz scored the first, it was PSG’sfourthclear chance. Madrid couldn’t get to the ball or PSG’s players. “We didn’t manage to apply the manager’s plan,” Thibaut Courtois said. “We couldn’t press like them; from my point of view, we always arrived a little late, everyone out of position and that’s how they beat you. We weren’t close to them.”The mistakes that led to the opening two goals were truly absurd from Raúl Asencio and Toni Rüdiger. There were other conditioning factors: Trent Alexander-Arnold and Huijsen were missing, one injured, one suspended. Valverde had to play at right-back. The formation was changed. And Kylian Mbappé was back. Now, it would be far too easy to say that Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started but: Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started. No, it wasn’t about him. But, yes, it kind of was. Which is the way it has been all season, his first in Spain. There’s something quite bizarre about wondering if a striker who scored 44 goals, the best debut campaign a Madrid player has ever had, was a success, but it’s not an entirely illegitimate question. “I came to win trophies,” he said, and he hasn’t.Mbappé came to a team who malfunctioned in multiple ways and his significance is always magnified, distorted, for good and bad. Against PSG, the team that went and won it all as soon as he left, all the more so. Here it hit everyone, hard. There’s a symbolism that goes beyond his actual performance, but that doesn’t make it purely symbolic and there is something systemic there, too. Madrid hadn’t found a fit for him and Vinícius Júnior, whose form has not been the same and collapsed almost completelysince he didn’t win the Ballon d’Or. Defeat in New York brought that, and other flaws, back to the surface.“Today is ahostiathat could help us learn, correct things and keep improving,” Courtois said. Thehostiais the consecrated bread; in this context, it is a kick in the teeth, a massive blow. In its clarity, in how much it hurt, it could be helpful, no place to hide. Lessons came from both teams on the pitch, from what Madrid are and what, looking at PSG, they aspire to be. That this was no one-off but cruel confirmation of what has been seen all season may help. It cannot be ignored. No, things are not fixed so fast; they have to be dealt with properly, not patched over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you keep tripping on the same mistake, it’s not intelligent,” Alonso said. And if he was already given an authority not always conferred on coaches, his ideas engaged with, so far at least, this was a reminder to keep listening. Often it is an excuse to turn on a coach but not here, not yet: only six of the 68 matches this season are his, after all. “He hasn’t had time to do anything,” Luis Enrique said in his defence.“This is the last game of 2024-25, not the first of 2025-26,” Alonso said, and it was a recurring line. There might have been some self-preservation in saying so but there was also a message, a reminder of where they are coming from and how far they have to go, that there can be a new beginning, that failure can be left behind. If it’s not forgotten entirely. A reminder that there must be changes: in culture, dressing-room dynamics. At board level, the word “ego” is being discussed, an easy excuse perhaps, a handy distraction from failures higher up, but not insignificant. Alonso talked about wanting to “build a team that plays with unity, all together, that has feeling and spirit”.He also talked for the first time about changes in personnel too, if briefly. Some will depart – Luka Modric, Lucas Vázquez, almost certainly Rodrygo – and additions must be made. Some positions are not adequately occupied while others are overbooked. Asked about signings, Alonso replied: “We haven’t talked much about the composition of the squad during the World Cup but now we are always open to talking about making improvements and there is space for that.“Our new era is just beginning, there is still a lot of margin, lots of things we have to do better. Today hurts, we have to be self-critical, but this shows us things. We will take things from this match and from this World Cup. We leave here a better team, even if it is hard to say that right now. It can be a starting point for us, a way of beginning next season better. Today is the end of this season, not the start of next. This competition has told me a lot of things about what we are and what we have to improve. I leave here with many certainties. We will start from zero in August, when 2025-26 begins. Not from the 95th minute of today, but from zero.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupParis Saint-GermainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The England head coach was responding to the news that Jess Fishlock had justscored Wales’s first goalat a major women’s international tournament, but given the mood in the press conference room, she could easily also have been referring to her own team’s performance after they steamrolled the Netherlands.The tone and the atmosphere of the post-match exchanges was wholly contrasting to the scene in the same media room four days earlier, after the Lionesses had beensecond-best against France. This time, here was a proud Wiegman, a coach whose players had carried out her gameplan to perfection, and a coach who – while admitting she had felt “a little tension” before kick-off – clearly had always had conviction that her teamwould deliver under pressure. The back-to-back Euros winners made some big decisions for this pivotal match and they all paid off.Moving Lauren James to the right wingWiegman’s sole change in personnel in her starting lineup was Ella Toone replacing Beth Mead and, in tandem with that switch, Lauren James moved out to the right wing where she had the freedom to show the world exactly how lethal she is. The Chelsea forward caused misery for the Dutch backline, especially their left-back Esmee Brugts, who had no reply to James’s immaculate close control, balance and strength.James also found success cutting inside, exemplified by her powerful strike into the corner with her left foot for England’s opening goal, and occasionally she dropped deeper to collect the ball and dribble her way through a crowd of three Dutch midfielders, just because she can. Predominantly seeing her wide on the right, though, undeniably gave England a better balance, and in the No 10 role instead was a hard-working Toone, whose runs and off-the-ball tracking fully vindicated Wiegman’s selections.Swapping Jess Carter and Alex Greenwood’s positionsView image in fullscreenThe switch to centre-back for Jess Carter helped England neutralise the Netherlands forward line.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe other positional adjustment of note was Wiegman’s decision to switch Jess Carter to centre-back, where she most commonly plays for her club, and to move Alex Greenwood out to the left-back position, in a straight swap. Both players seem to look most at home in the centre of defence but Greenwood coped better, as a natural left-footer, than Carter had done against France, while equally Carter produced an outstanding performance on Wednesday, barely giving Vivianne Miedema a sniff of a chance.Asked why she had made that change, Wiegman explained: “That had to do with a couple of things: the pace that the Netherlands have, and we expected that in the centre, where they wanted a lot of runs in behind. They also had pace now with Chasity Grant on our [left-hand] side, and with Alex, her left foot, on the left side, in possession we hoped we would distribute more going forward.”Playing long balls over the topVery noticeable about England’s tactics on Wednesday was how frequently they sought to get behind the Dutch defence by playing well-weighted balls over the top for Alessia Russo to run on to, and it worked to excellent effect. Russo’s tireless movement and intelligent runs into channels was combined with inch-perfect long-range passing, most impressively from the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.The Chelsea shot-stopper’s defence-splitting pass that led to England’s opening goal, in particular, has deservedly been praised, as she somehow picked out Russo’s run while placing her pass through the eye of a needle to avoid every Dutch player running between the two of them. The 24-year-old’s distribution is a weapon England can add to their attacking options and Wiegman’s decision to back her as her new No 1 paid off in this regard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her goal, struck first-time into the bottom corner from range with real venom, epitomised the quality of her all-round performance and reminded everybody watching why she is such an integral part of the team.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway repaid her manager’s faith with a fine performance and wonderful goal against the Dutch.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesNot panickingStanway’s press conference on Monday had also set the tone for England to bounce back, as they once again demonstrated their ability to problem-solve. After the loss to France, the Lionesses and Wiegman faced plenty of tough questions but, instead of ripping up the strategy book, dropping four or five players or triggering fallouts between personnel in the group, the Lionesses found a togetherness, and that largely comes from Wiegman’s calm approach.Her response to wins is never too delirious and similarly her response to defeats is never too negative, and she backed her players to deliver. They, in turn, looked at themselves to address their form, rather than infighting. There is still a long way to go until the final in Basel, and England – who have alternated between wins and losses for the past seven matches – do need to work on their consistency, but they have found the blueprint now for how they can succeed in Switzerland.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Spain with their glittering array of talent have already shown the levels that they can reach in their opening two matches.Even though two-time Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí is yet to return to the starting XI after suffering from a brief bout of viral meningitis, they have caught the eye with their goalscoring prowess and command of the ball. In among the goals and dominant play, however, are there some gaps in the armour that can be exploited?England turn up the volume and drown out doubts against Netherlands | Nick AmesRead moreThere is no denying that Montse Tomé’s team are looking in frighteningly good form. Since missing out on Olympic Gold last summer, Spain have won 10 of their past 13 games and lost just once. In their opening matches of the Euros, they secured comprehensive victories againstPortugal (5-0)and thenBelgium (6-2)with an average of 75.5% ball possession.There is so much to enjoy about the wayLa Rojaplay football. Their in-possession stats are eye-catching – across the first two games, they recorded 88.5% passing accuracy – as they try to suffocate their opponents. Their midfield ranks as the best in Europe with their patience in buildup and rotations that see them thrive in central areas.Alexia Putellas has been a player on a mission after missing out on the last edition with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and is currently the tournament’s joint top scorer. After a strong season at Barcelona where she recorded 39 appearances, 22 goals and 17 assists across all competitions, she is now excelling on the European stage. She enjoys the almost telepathic communication she has with those around her. For her goal against Portugal, Mariona Caldentey launched a quarterback-style pass forward to pick out her run, a move the Arsenal player said they’ve done “about 80,000 times” before.Alexia PutellasThe structure of their midfield, supported by the under-credited deeper-lying Patri Guijarro, allows for Putellas and whomever she is partnered with to push up. When Bonmatí is involved, the rapport between all three is second nature but the fascinating thing at this Euros is that they have looked just as in sync with Vicky López starting. The 18-year-old has taken to international football like a duck to water. She marked her senior major tournament debut with a fantastic goal, a visionary run into the box and an instinctive finish that her older peers have done many times before.Another aspect not to be overlooked is the variety of goals Spain have scored. Ten of their 11 goals in Switzerland have come from inside the box and they have added a variety of buildups. While they still favour moving through central areas, they have been utilising the long ball on more occasions. In Esther González, they have an in-form traditional striker, one that has not always fit the mould of the Spanish national team.While there have been so much to praise in their opening performances, however, there are also signs that they can be undone. Belgium revealed their defensive frailties, particularly in Hannah Eurlings’ goal which showed how the opposition can expose their high line and the profile of centre-backs they possess. Irene Paredes is a renowned defender and leader but has issues when facing direct, pacy attackers in transition. Stina Blackstenius, Mayra Ramírez, Alessia Russo and Tessa Wullaert are some of strikers on a domestic and international stage to have recently got the better of the 34-year-old.View image in fullscreenIrene Paredes and Hannah Eurlings battle for the ball during Spain’s victory over Belgium.Photograph: Priscila Bütler/SPP/ShutterstockBelgium and Portugal did not have strong enough defensive or midfield units to withstand the pressure Spain put their opponents under, nor did they seem particularly willing to sacrifice their style. That is naive; if you try to match Tomé’s side in possession, you will undoubtedly lose. It is telling, however, that the one defeat they’ve suffered this year wasfrom an England teamwho were prepared to adjust. They packed out the central areas, forced Spain wide, stretched them in transition with direct forwards and held them, for the most part, to shots from distance. Back to that previous stat – just one of their goals this tournament has been from outside the box. Arsenal did precisely the same to Barcelona inwinning the Champions League final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "Content": "4h ago17.47 EDTReport: Gaupset stars on first Norway startNorway winger Signe Gaupset made the most of her first start at Euro 2025, scoring twice and creating two more goals as her side beat Iceland 4-3 on Thursday to make it three wins from three for the Norwegians, who had already secured top spot in Group A.Despite Gaupset’s tremendous performance, the Norwegians endured a nervy ending as Iceland scored two late goals, including a stoppage-time penalty after Marit Breatberg Lund was sent off for a clumsy challenge.With Iceland playing for pride, having already been eliminated, Sveindís Jónsdóttir netted their first goal at the tournament by reacting quickest when Alexandra Jóhannsdóttir’s header was spilled by Cecilie Fiskerstrand in the sixth minute.Gaupset, one of six changes from the side that beat Finland 2-1 on Sunday, cancelled out Iceland’s opening goal by firing a low volley from a corner in at the foot of the right-hand post in the 15th minute, and 11 minutes later she fired a left-footed drive into the opposite corner to make it 2-1.Gaupset heaped more misery on Iceland by teeing up Frida Maanum for Norway’s third goal four minutes after the break, and she set up Maanum for another in the 76th minute.After dominating for much of the game, the wheels came off for Norway late on as Iceland battled bravely, scoring again through Hlín Eiríksdóttir in the 84th minute.Substitute Bratberg Lund was sent off in stoppage time for a foolish challenge that resulted in a penalty which the Iceland captain, Glódís Viggósdóttir, fired home to make it 4-3, but the Norwegians held on to finish top of the group with a 100% record.The Norwegians will be joined in the last eight by the hosts, Switzerland, who came back from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Finland and squeeze into the knockout stage.Gaupset was hoping she had made a strong case to start Norway’s quarter-final. “I feel I’ve put in a good application, in any case. There’s a lot of good players and it’s up to the coaches to decide, but it was good to play today and show what I can do,” she said. “It was incredible and something I’ll remember for the rest of my life, so it’s very big.”ReutersShare"

On the 15th hole at the Renaissance Club, the Northern Irishman was in trouble; his fairway bunker shot had rolled back towards his feet. McIlroy’s ball sat in the mark created by his first attempt. “It served me right for trying to hit a nine-iron with the lip two feet in front of me,” he said later.‘It would mean a little bit more’: McIlroy returns to Europe with eyes on Open tiltRead moreThe response was notable. The world No 2 pitched out sideways, holed from 21ft – and the fringe of the green – for a bogey and rattled off three birdies in a row over the closing holes.A 68 to start at the tournament which precedes McIlroy’s Open Championship tilt at Portrush was hugely impressive in context. He sits only four shots from the lead.“It was a great finish,” McIlroy said. “The round was a bit stop-start, there was a little bit of rust in there after taking a couple of weeks off. I felt like I found my rhythm and started hitting better shots on the way in. It is the sort of course and these are conditions where the field will be pretty bunched so to be only four behind, feeling like I still have my best stuff ahead of me, is good.” The winner of five majors has the chance to make further impact from his early start on Friday.McIlroy’s finish involved converted putts of 26ft on the 17th and 19ft at the last. His birdie at 16 was a straightforward one, the par five having been comfortably reached in two. He regards his game as 80% towards where it needs to be for Portrush. “I’m ready to play,” he added. “A change of scenery has been nice, getting back over here has sort of renewed my excitement and enthusiasm for the rest of the season.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler felt he put in a decent score on his first day.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockColombia’s Nico Echavarría, Sepp Straka, Victor Perez and Jake Knapp head proceedings at six under. Marcel Siem is among those at minus five. The German, now 44, admitted he has toned down the heavy partying that sat alongside his golfing pomp. “I am not getting any younger,” said Siem. “I have to look after my body more now. I know I can stand on the range and hit golf balls, I’ve done it my whole life. But it’s more about recovery, sleeping well and not drinking.“I think those days of drinking and playing golf are over unfortunately. There is a time and place for it. It’s nice to enjoy a few pints after a good result, for example. The problem is I’m not in training any more. Two years ago, if I have one or two beers for dinner, it’s fine. But I can’t do it any more. On Monday this week, I had two pints of Guinness and felt horrible the next day. I think I am getting too old to be drinking and playing golf.” Siem is hoping to earn an Open berth with a strong performance in East Lothian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world No 1, Scottie Scheffler, looked puzzled by the greens at various points but still produced a 67. “I wish I would have played a little bit better,” said theUS PGA champion. “But overall, I felt like I did some good things out there and hung in there nicely and put up a decent score. I wish it was a little bit lower but not too bad of a first round.”Scheffler played alongside the defending champion Bob MacIntyre, who made a 68.

The opportunistic Education EasyPost rider used all the aerodynamic advantages available to him to ride on his own to the biggest win of his career.Tour de France 2025: Ben Healy wins stage six, Van der Poel pips Pogacar to yellow jersey – as it happenedRead more“I don’t push the most power out of everyone, but I just try and be as efficient as I possibly can,” he said. “I had full time-trial tyres, a waxed chain, a time-trial skinsuit, and just maximised absolutely everything.”A baking Normandy afternoon did not calm the pace of the peloton, despite the presence of six categorised climbs on the 201km stage, the second longest of the race. In the relentless ebb and flow both Pogacar’s and Jonas Vingegaard’s teammates were active on the front, until eventually thedecisive move came, but only after 100km.The eight-man breakaway was brimming with quality riders, including Giro d’Italia champion Simon Yates, American national champion Quinn Simmons, Van der Poel and Paris-Nice and Vuelta a España stage winner Michael Storer.But it was Healy who eventually took the initiative, riding clear with 44km left. Although Storer and Simmons gave chase, the 24-year-old soon opened a two-minute gap on his pursuers and forged ahead to win.“It was a very strong group of riders and I didn’t believe in just attacking purely by legs,” he said. “I was waiting for the moment to try and find some speed and take them by surprise.”View image in fullscreenTeammates of Jonas Vingegaard (right) and Tadej Pogacar (centre) battled on the front of the peloton before deciding not to chase the breakaways.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesBehind the break, Pogacar opted not to put his team to the chase and to instead relinquish the overall race lead to Van der Poel, even if the eventual margin was much closer than the Slovenian had expected.The morning after Wednesday’s individual time trial opened up a significant gap between Pogacar and Vingegaard, there was a general acknowledgment of the defending champion’s supremacy. “We remain combative and believe in Jonas,” Vingegaard’s sports director, Grischa Niermann, said.But Rolf Aldag, sports director at the Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe team, was not alone in thinking tthat Vingegaard and the rest of he peloton might have been victims of Pogacar’s cunning plan.Aldag was one of those who had high hopes for his team leader, Primoz Roglic, in the Tour’s first time trial, largely based on Pogacar’s lacklustre performance a month earlier in the Critérium du Dauphiné’s “race of truth”, whenhe lost 28 seconds to Vingegaard in 17km.“The question was how would the time trial result in the Dauphiné affect Pogacar? Because that result raised a lot of hope within the peloton that actually he was beatable,” Aldag said.“Yesterday Pogacar was better than people thought he would be, including us. So did they really fix his problems – how aerodynamic he was or what different equipment he needed – in such a short time, because that would have been difficult. Or maybe, was he playing games in Dauphiné?“We just don’t know, but I think with Pogacar everything is possible. Maybe he thought, ‘I’ll take it easy, leave things open and then destroy them in the Tour’.”As Healy celebrated his stage win, half of the peloton was still riding wearily through the Normandy countryside to the hilltop finish in Vire. Nearly 80 riders finished more than 15 minutes behind Healy, with some others losing almost half an hour.Friday’s stage seven of the race finishes on the 15% slopes of the Mûr de Bretagne, whereVan der Poel won his first stage in 2021. It also passes through Yffiniac, birthplace of Bernard Hinault, the last Frenchman to win the Tour, 40 years ago, in 1985.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, these deals have long been controversial, and not have always been seen to provide value for money to taxpayers.More than 650 public sector organisations have their buildings, IT and essential infrastructure managed by a private consortium under a PFI deal, and state bodies are set to pay £136bn in unitary charges for these contracts until 2052-3.Half of the contracts – covering hospitals, schools and transport – are set to expire during the next decade. The PAC report called on ministers to ensure such contracts were carefully managed so that private sector firms complied with their contractual obligations and “only quality assets are handed back” to government.Last year a report by the Association of Infrastructure Investors in Public Private Partnerships warned that schools and hospitals that depend on PFI contractswere in danger of “severe disruption”unless they could find a way to cope once those contracts expire.MPs on the PAC are also calling for a more comprehensive framework for how risk is shared between the public and private sector when they work in partnership, particularly after the high-profile collapse of the outsourcing companyCarillion, whichhalted work on new hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham.The government also needs to provide detailed information on the pipeline of future projects in order to attract new investors, according to the PAC, amid a current lack of data about the past performance of projects or when future ones will be delivered.“Our scrutiny has found a woefully obscured picture for any seeking to invest in big infrastructure projects in the UK, with a corresponding drain of skills overseas,” said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the PAC.“Without a long-term, consistent pipeline giving an idea of what to expect in years to come, UK infrastructure risks becoming stony ground for any investor.”The PAC is calling on the Treasury to identify which financing models it would support for money for different types of projects, such as energy, transport or communication, to attract investors and drive competition.A central database covering private finance for infrastructure investment should be published, according to the report, to help the Treasury to deliver value for money, given the huge amounts of money involved in such projects, such as the£14.2bn pledged by the governmentfor the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.Explore more on these topicsPrivate finance initiativePublic financeEconomic policyLabourConstruction industrynewsShareReuse this content"

I know some may disagree with me, but I do not believe that one in four of us can be considered disabled without the term losing all meaning,” she said.She said Britain “clearly cannot afford to support one in four people who now classify themselves as disabled”.“We are going to have to draw a line in the sand about which conditions the state gives out support for,” she said. “Food intolerances are a medical fact, but they’re not something we should be handing out new cars for. That is not a joke. This actually happens.“And anxiety and mild depression are real conditions but that doesn’t mean those suffering should be signed off work courtesy of the taxpayer.”Badenoch’s claims appear to be based on recent information from parliamentary question based on NHS data, which listed food intolerance as a condition that had qualified some people for Motability paid by personal independence payment (Pip) but the numbers involved were extremely small.The Conservative leader also said she thought young people do not appreciate the value of work and suggested the UK needed to get a stronger work ethic.“You need to go out, get a job, look after yourself and look after your family, should be the default position,” she said.She said the Centre for Social Justice thinktank had published a report saying restricting disability benefits for some conditions could save £9bn, which would be used to fund better treatment for people with mental health difficulties.After the speech, Badenoch also came under fire for failing to commit to the triple lock for pensions in future which guarantees an increase of whatever is highest – earnings, inflation, or 2.5%.She said that it was Tory policy to support the triple lock for pensions but also that she was focusing on policy “right now”, and she did not say it would still be Conservative policy by the time of the next election.Labour responded by claiming that Badenoch has “put pensioners on notice: the Tories want to slash the state pension for 11 million people”.However, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, suggested separately on Thursday that welfare for working-age people should be cut before the state pension.“So I think if we’re going to look for savings, it is better to concentrate on the working-age population. The welfare bill, as we know, is heading to £100bn by 2030 so I think it’s right that is the place to look first,” he said.Both Badenoch and Philp dismissed the idea that their party had been damaged by this week’s defection of the former Conservative chair Jake Berry to Nigel Farage’s Reform party. Badenoch called it “banana republic” politics, while Philp said it was “not going to change the political weather in any way”.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochConservativesBenefitsWelfareDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

The policy was upheld by the Lausanne-based court of arbitration for sport in 2019, and then by a Swiss federal tribunal in 2020, leading Semenya to take her long-running battle against the regulationsto the European court.On Thursday Semenya welcomed the European court’s decision, describing it as “great for me, great for athletes” as she spoke to reporters outside the court. “We need to respect athletes, we need to put their rights first,” said the 34-year-old.Caster Semenya: ‘How would I label myself? I’m an African. I’m a woman. I’m a different woman’Read moreThe decision does not changethe rulesthat effectively ended her career after she won two Olympics and three world titles. The court said it could not uphold anearlier findingby a lower chamber that Semenya had been the victim of discrimination, deeming the complaints inadmissible as they did not fall under Switzerland’s jurisdiction.But it handed her a partial victory in finding that the case required a “rigorous judicial review” as there were serious personal rights at risk and the Swiss federal court’s review had “fallen short of that requirement”. It ordered Switzerland to pay the athlete €80,000 (£69,000) for her expenses.The decision paves the way for the case to be sent back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne for reconsideration.Between 2011 and 2015, Semenya complied with a process set out by track and field’s governing body, taking medication to lower her testosterone levels. She later likened it to being used as a “human guinea pig”, saying she had grappled with side effects such as constant sickness, panic attacks and soreness even as she continued to win titles.Track authorities have argued that the limits on testosterone levels are necessary and reasonable to maintain fairness in women’s track events. Their critics say there is a lack of scientific research to support this view.View image in fullscreenCaster Semenya won gold in the 800m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter the governing body for track and field formalised its policy on testosterone levels in 2018, Semenya refused to comply, leaving her ineligible to compete. On Thursday, the governing body, WorldAthletics, did not respond to the European court’s decision.The consequences of Semenya’s legal battle could reverberate across the sports world as it dovetails with the International Olympic Committee’sconsideration of whetherto reintroduce some means of gender testing.The link was emphasised by Semenya last month in an interview with a South African newspaper. “It’s a battle for human rights now,” she said. “It’s not about competing. It’s about putting athletes’ rights first. It’s about the protection of athletes.”In 2023, Human Rights Watchdescribed the rulesthat Semenya had been subject to as “degrading and invasive of privacy, on grounds that are scientifically contested”.The regulations were incompatible with respect for women’s rights, and the freedom to live without cruel, discriminatory and degrading treatment, it added. “International sporting bodies set regulations with scant regard for international human rights norms, as if they are exempt from human rights standards.”On Thursday, Semenya, who dominated her sport between 2009 and 2019 despite the scrutiny over her gender, vowed that her battle would continue. “The fight will never be over,” she told reporters. “As long as we have injustice, we fight till the court.”Explore more on these topicsCaster SemenyaAthleticsSouth AfricaAfricaEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers at UCL and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine compared different potential scenarios, looking at levels of warming, measures to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, regional climatic differences and potential power outages. They also modelled the ageing population.Between 1981 and 2021, there were on average 634 heat-related deaths in England and Wales a year. The research, published in PLoS Climate, found that – in the worst-case scenario of 4.3C of warming by the end of the century and assuming minimal adaptation to mitigate the effects – heat-related deaths would increase sixteenfold to 10,317 in the 2050s, and would exceed 34,000 by the 2070s.Even if temperature rises are limited to 1.6C of warming over preindustrial levels and high levels of adaptation are put in place, annual heat-related deaths will still increase up to sixfold by the 2070s.Therecord-setting hot summer of 2022– when temperatures reached 40.3C in Coningsby, Lincolnshire – had 2,985 excess heat deaths, indicating a potential “new normal” by as early as the 2050s, the research concluded.The findings come as the UK Health Security Agency issueda yellow heat health alertfor all regions from Thursday 10 July until Tuesday 15 July. Temperatures were expected to reach 27-29C in large parts of England and Wales on Thursday, with hotter weather of up to 31-33C forecast for the weekend.Dr Clare Heaviside, a senior author at UCL Bartlett School Environment, Energy & Resources, said the findings painted “a sobering picture of the consequences of climate change”.“Over the next 50 years,” she said, “the health impacts of a warming climate are going to be significant. We can mitigate their severity by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and with carefully planned adaptations, but we have to start now.”The research also found that previous research underestimated heat mortality by not assessing the impact of older societies. Over the next 50 years, the population of England and Wales ispredicted to age significantly, with the greatest increase in population size for those age 65 and over by the 2060s. Older people are more vulnerable in hot weather, withan extra 250 million people worldwide age 69 or above who will be exposed to dangerous levels of heatby 2050.Dr Rebecca Cole, of the department of public health, environments and society at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and lead author of the study, said the findings showed the need for careful thought and planning in how to reduce the impact of global heating.“Increases in heat-related deaths are not just a consequence of rising temperatures – they’re also driven by how we build our cities, care for vulnerable populations and address social inequality. Concerted adaptation strategies are required, well in excess of those over the last 30 years.”Responding to the findings, Matthew Bazeley-Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “Our health is strongly influenced by the environment and the climate crisis is also a public health crisis. These alarming projections show a devastating impact.“We need to take action that curbs emissions and also prepare people to deal with the effects of climate change on our health – particularly for vulnerable populations.”Dr Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the University of Reading, said: “If floods and storms are the loud alarms of climate change, extreme heat is its silent killer. It is disproportionately lethal, often going unnoticed until it’s too late. With another heatwave bearing down on the UK, this warning feels more urgent than ever.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’ll be setting out our thinking on network charging reforms shortly”.However, Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, had previously spoken out in favour of zonal pricing.Those who backed a move to zonal pricingincluded Greg Jackson, the founder and boss of Octopus Energy, whereas some of Britain’s biggest renewable energy companies including SSE, Scottish Power and RWE opposed the idea.Responding to the government’s decision, a spokesperson for Octopus said: “We must reverse the spiralling costs of electricity, so we respectfully disagree with this announcement. The UK should have followed the majority of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and put consumer interests ahead of producers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are no published models, no cost-benefit analysis and no hope it’ll tackle the precipitously rising costs of the system.”However, SSE said the move provided “much-needed policy clarity” for investors and consumers.Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas’s owner, Centrica, said it was a “commonsense decision” and that the “theoretical benefits never stacked up against the real-world risks” in potential zonal pricing.Under the dropped proposals, zones with an abundance of electricity generation relative to local demand – such as Scotland – would have had lower market prices. But densely populated areas in the south-east of England would have run the risk of higher energy bills due to higher market costs.Those on both sides of the debate paid consultants to produce detailed analysis to serve as evidence, and engaged in rigorous lobbying to put forward their point of view.Ana Musat, executive director of policy at RenewableUK, said: “This decision is good news for billpayers, in part because the prices set in the government’s auctions for clean power contracts will be lower than they would have been under the costly zonal pricing regime.“It will give confidence to private investors that the UK is one of the best markets in the world to build new renewable energy projects, by ending the uncertainty that zonal pricing would have caused.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy billsEnergyEnergy industryRenewable energyWind powerHousehold billsEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

Analysis of Labour’s proposal by environmental economists from the consultancyEftec,suggests 97% of planning approvals – 76,800 out of 79,300 every year – would be exempt from the requirement to replace destroyed nature.This would mean an area of more than 215,000 hectares, the size of the Yorkshire Dales, could be built on over the next decade with no requirement to compensate for any nature destroyed.The biodiversity net gain rules were brought in to help tackle major nature loss. The UK isone of the most nature-depleted countriesin the world, and the government has signed a pledge toprotect 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030.Biodiversity net gain, which requires developers to ensure a 10% increase in biodiversity, came into effect for major developments in February 2024 and for small sites two months later. The report says plans to scrap the rules for small developers – who dominate planning in England – would render the scheme utterly ineffective.“Biodiversity net gain is a hugely important principle: industries that harm nature should contribute to its recovery,” said Richard Benwell, of Wildlife and Countryside Link, which commissionedthe researchwith the Lifescape Project. “The proposal to drastically widen the number of exempt small sites from the system would be a return to the bad old days of damaging development, and torpedo confidence in private investment in nature recovery.”Biodiversity net gain was supposed to apply to most planning applications but the research found 86% (69,500 out of 80,400) of planning applications approved between March 2024 and February 2025 claimed exemptions, in what the researchers believe could be widespread abuses by developers.Biodiversity net gain is not required for sites smaller than 25 sq metres, or those that do not affect protected habitats. But developers are able to “self declare” to claim these exemptions.Economists found a rise in claims for these “deminimis”exemptions, after the rules came into force last year. “The scale of misuse across different sizes of planning applications suggests thedeminimisexemption may be being intentionally misinterpreted,” the report said.Joan Edwards, the director of policy and public affairs at theWildlifeTrusts, said the government wanted private investment to help it meet its binding nature recovery targets by 2030, but changing the system could destroy the biodiversity market.“Scrapping biodiversity net gain for small sites would be a spectacular own goal,” she said. “Nothing undermines private-sector confidence more than a government that chops and changes the rules on a whim.”The economists suggest Labour should tweak its changes to improve efficiency. It suggests excluding only sites of up to 0.1 hectares that align with the government’s proposed new definition of “very small sites”. This would also remove the loophole that allows some very large sites to sidestep BNG entirely by claimingdeminimisexemption.Thousands of individuals and organisations have responded to the government consultation, which ends on 24 July.Across Europe, the financial sector has pushed up house prices. It’s a political timebomb | Tim WhiteRead moreRobert Oates, the chief executive and founder of the ecological consultancy Arbtech, said the government’s proposal “threatens both its goals: supporting nature recovery and accelerating housebuilding”.“Small site biodiversity net gain has only been in place for 13 months, yet developers and businesses have spent years preparing for it. U-turns like this create damaging instability. Developers need certainty, not another policy rewrite.”A government spokesperson said: “This government is fully committed to biodiversity net gain and this consultation explores easier, quicker and cheaper routes to deliver gains for both developers and nature. We are also consulting on how biodiversity net gain should be applied to nationally significant infrastructure projects to provide a clear framework that ensures major new developments deliver for nature and contribute to our legally binding targets.”Explore more on these topicsWildlifeHousingLabourCommunitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A contract to support this work has also been torn up and researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027, have been dismissed.A copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023, can be founddeepon the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s website. The Guardian is replicating the report here in full in a more visible way for the public to access.The 2023 assessment, which is more than 1,800 pages long, warns that the “effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States”. It adds that “without rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, the risks of accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather and other harmful climate impacts will continue to grow.”Read in full the fifth national climate assessment here (it can take a few seconds for the document to load)Download original documentNasa said it is in the process of uploading the voluminous reports on to its servers, although the administration did not respond to questions over how, or in what form, future climate assessments will be conducted after the shuttering of the research effort.“The USCGRP website is no longer active,” a Nasa spokesperson said, in reference to the US Global Change Research Program, a federally funded program to coordinate climate research. “All preexisting reports will be hosted on the Nasa website, ensuring continuity of reporting.”Researchers who have worked, for free, to produce the reports expressed concern about the future direction of the assessments under Trump, who has called the climate crisis “a giant scam” and “bullshit” in the past.As president, Trump has removedmentions of climate from federal websites,scrappedresearch work on environmental issues, andcutstaff and funding for weather forecasting and climate agencies, and has justsigneda major Republican spending bill that stymies clean energy while providing greater support for the fossil fuels that are causing dangerous global heating.“This was a labor of love from scientists to the people; these assessments were written for the public and policymakers to make decisions to keep people safe and ensure the food and water and infrastructure we need,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at the Nature Conservancy and Texas Tech University.“I felt very sad to see the website was taken down, because so many people rely on this information. I’m also worried that what will come next might meet the letter of the law without its spirit. It could be something full of misinformation, it could ask a large language AI model why Americans shouldn’t worry about climate change.

Unfortunately we are seeing resources being pulled back just as our vulnerability increases.”Environmental groups have vowed to launch legal action to fully resurrect the climate assessments while Trump’s political opponents have also attacked the removal.“Burying the legally mandated climate assessment won’t change the fact that climate change is already destroying lives and livelihoods, but Trump’s war against the truth will impede state and local governments’ ability to prepare for and protect families from climate change-fueled disasters,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisExtreme weatherUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their mortality rate was 1,336 deaths per 26,022 admissions, compared with a rate of 4,960 deaths per 154,041 admissions for white children, who had the lowest mortality rate overall.Children living in areas with high levels of child poverty had a 13% increased likelihood of dying while in a PICU compared with children from more affluent backgrounds, at a rate of 2,432 deaths per 58,110 admissions.Dr Hannah Mitchell, the lead author of the study from the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London, said the reasons behind this disparity were complex and could be due to structural factors such as discrimination and language barriers.Prof Padmanabhan Ramnarayan, the senior author of the study, said: “These children may face discrimination, both within and outside healthcare, which can lead to hesitancy seeking help or delays accessing urgent care. Language barriers may further complicate access.“Children from some ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of complex or life-limiting conditions, making them more vulnerable. Children living in poverty are more likely to develop serious illnesses such as asthma or traumatic injuries, and may struggle to access timely care due to difficulties getting help from GPs or A&E.”He added that further research to fully understand the reasons behind this disparity was needed.The study also found that children from minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to have a longer stay in PICUs, an average of 66 hours compared with their white counterparts who had an average stay of 52 hours.Minority ethnic children were also found to have an increased likelihood of an unplanned readmission to a PICU within 60 days of discharge, at 9%, compared with their white counterparts who had a readmission rate of 6.8%.Ramnarayan said: “It shouldn’t be the case that a child’s ethnicity or postcode determines their outcomes in PICU.“Our findings show the urgent need for improved access to urgent care, reducing barriers to healthcare access, earlier recognition of serious illness in children, and more coordination between hospitals and community care teams to improve PICU outcomes across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsHealthChildrenPovertyNHSHealth policyRaceSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

His getaway driver, Mohammed Syeedy, a former Manchester United steward, was later jailed for life for the murder. A third man, Mohammed Syadul Hussain, was jailed for five years for helping Kadir leave the UK days after the killing.The public inquiry, chaired by Thomas Teague KC, involved both public and private “closed” hearings, to protect national security.The public report, released before parliament on Thursday, found all three men had previously come to the attention of the police. It highlighted that Kadir was known to counter-terrorism police at the time of Uddin’s murder and had been identified as a person of high risk.Although the need for a targeted police investigation into Kadir’s activities had been recognised by December 2015, the necessary steps including the appointment of a senior investigating officer (SIO) were not implemented.A potential SIO was identified within the north-west counter-terrorism unit (NWCTU) but was not put in a position to take up duties for reasons beyond the control of that officer and the NWCTU, the report found.No further details were made public.The former detective inspector Frank Morris, who retired from Greater Manchester police (GMP) in 2021, told the inquiry an investigation into Hussain had been closed down prematurely two years before the murder.The report said the failure to appoint an SIO led to two “missed opportunities”. The first was that Kadir’s Facebook posts of September 2015 might have been scrutinised by police; he had described imams like Uddin as “dirty kufr people” and vowed to “take this on” to “paralyse them”.The report said the second missed opportunity was that other police investigative actions concerning Kadir might have detected and thwarted the murder plot.Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterIslamic StateUK security and counter-terrorismPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

He denies the charge and is standing trial at Winchester crown court.The court was told that in meetings with the “Russian agents” that were secretly recorded, Phillips said he did not want to return to a “normal” nine-to-five job and came up with the idea of “offering services” to the Russian intelligence services after a trip to Moscow.Phillips said he wanted the agents and him to be a “family” and said they could all “help each other”, the court heard.He later handed the undercover officers a bag containing a USB stick with Shapps’ details on it, including his home address, phone number and location of his private plane, the court heard.One of the undercover officers, who is employed by the Security Service, gave evidence from behind a curtain on Thursday. He was known to Phillips as Dima and spoke to him in recordings with a fake Russian accent, the court heard.At a meeting at London Bridge hotel with the fake agents, Phillips told them he retired from insolvency work five years ago and went travelling afterwards, visiting cities including Moscow, the jury heard. He said he had found himself in a position “where now I need to be earning money”.“I do not want and cannot for myself go back into the normal nine-to-five office. It’s not for me, it never was for me, but I did it,” he is said to have told them.The trial heard details of early communications Phillips had with the agents before they met in person.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

US tariff hikes “will be addressed” by Brazil, he said.Early on Thursday, Lula convened Brazilian ministers to discuss how his government should address Trump’s 50% tariff threat. The office of Lula’s chief of staff said a study group would be formed to decide how to react.Trump has already pledged to retaliate if Brazil retaliates against his attack, with US tariffs due to come into force on 1 August. “If for any reason you decide to raise yourTariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 50% that we charge,” he wrote in a letter to Lula on Wednesday, published on social media.The threatened tariffs on Brazil are part of a wave of proposed US levies unveiled by Trump this week. While the White House had beenscheduled to hike dutieson dozens of countries on Wednesday, he ordered a fresh three-week delay to 1 August.Alongside the latest delay, Trump has written letters to a string of countries, including Bangladesh, Japan and South Korea, informing them of new US tariff rates they will face unless they strike a deal with his administration.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsBrazilTariffsEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It was a “watershed moment for Caricom and the broader global movement for reparatory justice”, he added.He said that if the petition was successful, “the United Kingdom bears a legal obligation to provide reparations to Jamaica and its people for the enduring harm caused”.Jamaica’s culture minister, Olivia “Babsy” Grange, who announced the petition in June, told the Guardian it was “going to have a far-reaching impact on our efforts in the region to seek reparation”.She emphasised that countries were working together: “Various countries will be making a determination what action they take. But the bottom line is that they are all onboard in support of the position we have taken. That, to me, is the big statement – we’re working together in this effort,” she said.Other leaders reiterated their commitment, with the prime minister ofSt Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, one of the founding members of the Caricom reparations movement, saying: “We are not giving up the reparations fight.”“In theCaribbean[we] have a specific primary concern, primary responsibility to address reparations for native genocide and the enslavement of Africans,” he said, adding that the region needed allies. He said the issue would be on the agenda at the Africa-Caricom summit, scheduled for September in Ethiopia.The prime minister ofAntigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, emphasised that it was a matter of justice for those who were exploited and were not paid for their labour.“We must be able to fight for justice because not only were our forebearers exploited in terms of not being paid, but the profits that were generated were repatriated to Europe and to North America to build out their economies, and they left our countries bereft of important social institutions, hospitals, schools, and they also did not develop the infrastructure within our countries,” he said.The premier of the British Virgin Islaands, Natalio Wheatley, congratulated Caricom and Jamaica for pressing the issue in the face of opposition in the UK. “Some persons would just prefer not to listen to it. And sometimes when you hear about some of the persons in the United Kingdom, some of the journalists, etc, who almost ridicule the whole concept of reparations, and ridicule those who bring those arguments, you see really what we’re up against, but we appreciate the leadership.”Explore more on these topicsReparations and reparative justiceSlaveryJamaicaCaribbeanKing Charles IIISt Vincent and the GrenadinesAntigua and BarbudanewsShareReuse this content"

The most peculiar example might involve the reunion album by Virginia rap duo Clipse, AKAPusha Tand Malice. It was scheduled to be released by a subsidiary of Universal, home to both Lamar and Drake. But the label apparently demanded that the track Chains and Whips, featuring Lamar, be removed – despite the fact that, dazzling and pugilistic though his verse is (“I don’t,” he avers, “fuck with the kumbaya shit”), neither it nor the rest of the track seems to reference Drake. Years before the Drake/Lamar beef erupted, Pusha T released The Story of Adidon, a Drake diss track so brutal that one critic compared it to “bringing a gun to a knife fight”. Pusha T alleged that Universal’s “lyrics committee” deemed the very presence of Lamar on a track also featuring him was an act of provocation. As a result, Clipse wound up buying out their Universal contract: Let God Sort Em Out instead appears on Jay-Z’s Roc Nation label, with Chains and Whips present and correct.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Let God Sort Em Out.Photograph: KAWSIt’s an intriguing twist in a broader story – Drake is, after all, currently suing Universal for defamation over Lamar’s 2024 hit Not Like Us (Universal has called that case “utterly without merit”, and has not commented on theClipsesituation). And, if nothing else, the alleged existence of a shadowy committee fearful of Clipse’s lyrical power is useful publicity for the duo’s return.It’s 15 years since Pusha T’s elder brother Malice quit the duo, a conversion to Christianity sitting uncomfortably with their trademark descriptions of life in the cocaine trade: he subsequently changed his name to No Malice. “Came back for the money, that’s the devil in me,” he shrugs on POV, but whatever the reason, the No has gone and he’s rapping about his time as “the Bezos of the nasals” again, replete with an impressive array of euphemisms for his chief commodity: at one juncture, he refers to it as Lady Gaga.Still, Clipse’s return hardly needs a publicity boost. Their first two albums, in 2002 and 2006, spawned a rabid cult following that, as Pusha T once rhymed, “put the hipsters with felons and thugs”. As one half of production duo the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams helped propel Clipse to stardom, and is back on board. If Drake doesn’t warrant a mention, notice is nevertheless served that getting on the wrong side of Pusha T remains best avoided: on So Be It Pt II, rapper Travis Scott is eviscerated in no uncertain terms.It would be a shame if this headline-grabbing stuff overshadowed Let God Sort Em Out, as strong a restatement of Clipse’s skills and power as you could wish for. Said skills might be even more striking in 2025, because their stock in trade – vivid storytelling, technical brilliance made to seem effortless – has, aside from the occasional figure such as Lamar or Doechii, little purchase in current mainstream hip-hop, dominated as it is by vibe creators such as Playboi Carti or Future rather than genuine wordsmiths. Listening to the chemistry sparked by Clipse’s contrasting approaches – Pusha T’s relentlessness alongside Malice’s more measured style, his sense of reflection amplified by his time away – is a salutary reminder of what you’ve been missing. “You rappers all beneath me,” snaps Pusha T on Ace Trumpets. His brother concurs: “All of you imposter, simply just Ferrari window shoppers.”Great lines abound, from the chilling to the laugh-out-loud, while the feeling that guests including Nas and Tyler, the Creator feel obliged to step up – without ever quite stealing the show – is unavoidable. Something similar is true of the music. From the eerie minimalism of 2002’s Grindin’ to the metallic clatter of 2006’s Wamp Wamp, Clipse always seemed to bring out the best in the Neptunes, and likewise, Williams flying solo here. His focus these days may be on fashion – the album was part recorded in the Paris HQ of Louis Vuitton, where he’s creative director of menswear – but that feels like a shame given how inspired these beats are. The rhythm that underpins Ebitda sounds like an introductory fill that’s about to resolve into something more straightforward, but it never settles down, obstinately driving the track on. The horn riff of Inglorious Bastards is warped into a daring atonality; the gospel samples on So Far Ahead jar thrillingly with the dragging beat and low-rent synthesiser buzz; the Indian vocals and strings behind So Be It Pt II are enough even to distract attention from Pusha T’s forthright views on Travis Scott.The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreThe album’s one sonic misstep is opener The Birds Don’t Sing, its big John Legend-sung chorus venturing into a poppy commerciality that sits awkwardly with Clipse’s USP, but the track is redeemed by its lyrics, a depiction of the near-simultaneous deaths of the brothers’ parents that rains one emotional blow after another on the listener: “The way you missed mama, I guess I should have known / Chivalry ain’t dead, you ain’t let her go alone.” It’s new emotional territory for Clipse, who up to now didn’t really do vulnerable, and proof that Let God Sort Em Out offers far more than nostalgia: familiar but fresh, it’s one of the albums of the year.This week Alexis listened toDurand Jones and the Indications – Lovers’HolidayNot a cover of Change’s disco classic, rather a standout from recent album Flowers that floats gently but gorgeously along, as welcome as a cool breeze on a hot afternoon.Explore more on these topicsClipseAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPusha TRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s tonally jarring, full of laboured jokes and abandons all thoughts of innovation. You expect far betterLucy ManganThu 10 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 12.34 EDTShareIt takes a lot of talent to make something as singular asGirls. Then 26-year-old Lena Dunham created, starred in and executive-produced the show. She frequently directed, and she wrote or co-wrote 41 of the extraordinarily raw, realistic (Girls’ sex scenes reduced most screen and polite conventions to rubble), brutally funny and occasionally simply brutal 62 episodes that comprised its six seasons between 2012 and 2017. Girls’ impeccably witty script and sublime characterisations meant it pulled off a near-impossible feat. It made the story of four solipsistic, privileged twentysomethings navigating their lives one sexual/professional/ youthful/contraceptive mistake at a time in New York City compelling, funny and meaningful. As Dunham’s character and semi-alter ego Hannah Horvath said of herself – she may not have beenthevoice of a generation, but she was definitelyavoice of her generation.Since then, the output of a woman for whom the word “wunderkind” seemed woefully underpowered has itself been underwhelming. Dunham’smuch-hyped first bookdid not deliver a fraction of the humour or insight Girls proved she was capable of – although certain passages did garner much publicity and controversy, a tradition she then continued with various ill-advised (or wilfully misinterpreted) comments on the#MeToo movement, writing out of imagination rather than lived experience and other hot button issues of the past decade or so. Her US remake ofJulia Davis’s Campingwas widely considered to have lost its originator’s bleak genius in translation, and Dunham’s adaptation of the beloved and brilliant children’s bookCatherine Called Birdy, was an inoffensive bagatelle that did not detain critics or commerce long.But now, at last, we have a new, original project from Dunham (with contribution from her now husband, indie musician Luis Felber). A television series, no less. Too Much follows the adventures of early-thirtysomething Jessica (Hacks’formidableMegan Stalter) who flees to London from Brooklyn after a bad break-up. She remains obsessed with her ex, Zev (Michael Zegen), and with the woman he left her for, Instagram star and influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). She records emotional addresses to Wendy on her phone, privately, as self-therapy but of course this is the modern equivalent of Chekhov’s gun on the mantelpiece, and duly goes off in act three.View image in fullscreen‘You’re so alive!’ Megan Stalter as Jessica and Will Sharpe as Felix in Too Much.Photograph: PABefore then, however, she has embarked on a relationship with – oh, the eternal mysteries of creation – indie musician Felix (White Lotus’s Will Sharpe, in another good-guy part that gives him nothing to get his teeth into and leaves him looking very flat indeed beside Stalter’s full-blooded role and performance). He is the antithesis of Zev – patient, laid-back, appreciative of her and never finding her “too much” as her ex, from very early in their relationship which somehow staggered on for eight years, contemptuously and contemptibly did.There is a laboured joke in the first episode, about the difference between the English estate of Jessica’s period drama-informed imagination and the council flat she ends up in. This should serve as a warning to us all to lower our expectations drastically and save ourselves from as much of the quickly deepening disappointment as possible.After Jessica’s inaugural encounter with a British pub loo (you can, in fact, feel a very lived experience of Dunham here), the narrative landscape becomes an increasingly desolate place. Jessica sets fire to her nightdress and goes to hospital. Felix shows up with flowers and takes her home. Flashbacks to her life with Zev and an abortive date with a lying footballer show us how much better a bet the new guy is. They have a lot of sex and Dunham aims for her trademark realism – but without Girls’ inherent bleakness it just makes things tonally jarring for the viewer. It abandons any thoughts of innovation and hits cliche after cliche (how “the ick” can suddenly arrive and put you off your beloved for ever, for example – a well worn trope of the kind that would never have passed muster in Dunham’s earlier work). At one point, Felix even tells Jessica admiringly, “You’re so alive!” Not too much, you see! Alive! This guy is great.There are a few good lines (“I want to make the world a better place for the children I don’t want and may never be ready for”) and insightful moments (Jessica using television programmes about people with lives even messier than hers to soothe herself to sleep) but the irreducible fact remains that Too Much would not be enough from anyone. From Dunham, it is way, way too little.Too Much is onNetflixnowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLena DunhamNetflixGirlsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Having got into a chaotic affray at a pompous posh restaurant – filmed like a deleted scene from Richard Lester’s The Three Musketeers – Modigliani has to lie low from the police and dreams of quitting Paris, to the bewilderment of his quaintly imagined artist comrades Maurice Utrillo (Bruno Gouery) and Chaïm Soutine (Ryan McParland), and his lover (and subject) Beatrice Hastings (Antonia Desplat).But according to his longsuffering dealer Léopold Zborowski (Stephen Graham) he has to wait three days for a certain wealthy collector to hit town – a collector that Zborowski assures Modigliani is interested in his work; this is Maurice Gangnat, played in cameo by Al Pacino. So Modigliani must go to ground, restlessly haunting the streets and the lowlife nightspots pursued by his own demons.This lavishly produced and costumed European co-production is handsomely cast – but the range of talent here feels wasted on what is a fundamentally dated and stereotypical drama, whose Bohemian passion is diluted. Scamarcio does his best and he is arguably the best actor for the job, but there is something rather shallow here.Modigliani – Three Days on the Wing of Madness is in UK cinemas from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAl PacinoJohnny DeppPaintingPeriod and historical filmsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is confidence trickery perpetrated on the victim in parallel to narrative trickery perpetrated on the audience, who are invited to assume that however hard the fictional characters on screen are falling, the rug under their own feet is perfectly secure. Four years later, Hollywood paid this excellent film the traditional compliment of a well-meaning but inferior (and now forgotten) remake, pedantically renamed Criminal, starring John C Reilly and Diego Luna.Now restored and rereleased, the original looks sharper than ever: a drama of squalid fraud which is a tale of human greed, but also a specific, prophetic jab at Argentina’s financial shady dealers in a deregulated banking system that crashed soon after the film came out. Ricardo Darín made an international name for himself in one of the tough-guy everyman roles that was to become his brand. He plays Marcos, a hard-bitten conman browsing in a convenience store one evening, and amused to notice fresh-faced wannabe trickster Juan (Gastón Pauls) incompetently trying to pull off a petty scam whereby the cashier is bamboozled into giving him too much change. (It’s a cheap trick to compare with that of Tatum O’Neal in Peter Bogdanovich’s Paper Moon or John Cusack in Stephen Frears’ The Grifters.)Marcos saves the hapless young chump from the authorities by frogmarching him out pretending to be a cop and offers to make him his partner in a few deals he’s trying to pull off; Juan agrees, having perhaps rashly told Marcos he has saved $50,000 towards a bribe he intends to pay to a judge to save his career-criminal dad from a lengthy prison sentence. Marcos has a long and elaborate tale to tell of his own dispute with siblings over a family inheritance, and then somehow they get the chance at making a staggering fortune by selling an ultra-rare set of stamps from Weimar Germany called the “Nine Queens” to a crooked businessman with a passion for philately. Juan is saucer-eyed at the thought of so much easy money. But what’s the catch?The Nine Queens could be a subtextual comment on a certain type of secret postwar expatriate in Argentina, lurking in a concealed network of hush money, resentment and shame. The story has a little of George Roy Hill’s The Sting, but more of the double-dealing bad faith of David Mamet movies such as House of Games; it plays on a particular kind of hard-won cynicism that seems like the truth, but might not be. A fool and his money are soon parted, of course, and if something seems too good to be true, then that’s probably just what it is. But what if the Nine Queens and their promise of an instant jackpot are real, like the once-in-a-lifetime rare buffalo nickel in Mamet’s American Buffalo? What if you passed up your one opportunity of getting rich? Is your cynicism just another kind of self-destructive fakery, an admission that, in your heart, you don’t believe you deserve luck?This is an outstanding film with an amusing payoff over the final credits – and it is very sad thatBielinsky died of a heart attack just a few years after it came out, having just completed another thriller with Darín called The Aura. A potentially great career cut short.Nine Queens is in UK cinemas from 11 July, and on Blu-ray from 11 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsArgentinaAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

And if you were a young adult at that time, well, there’s also a high chance that you played Japanese role-playing games as a teenager – whether that was Chrono Trigger on an SNES or Final Fantasy on a PlayStation. Purity Ring’s new singleMany Livesis an attempt to recapture the feeling of the RPG that you discovered as a 12-year-old and immediately made into your whole personality. Inspired by games such as Skies of Arcadia, Phantasy Star Online and Secret of Mana, it is poised to tug on the heartstrings of fans of a certain vintage.This is a bold decision for a band who have previously collaborated withDeftonesand coveredEurodance classics, but members Megan James and Corin Roddick have the gaming expertise to pull it off. “We’re huge fans of the JRPG genre,” they say, naming Nier: Automata and Final Fantasy X as major influences on the sonic atmosphere of their latest work. “And we’re both currently playing Metaphor: ReFantazio – it’s an incredible fantasy take on the Persona formula.”Five years after their last studio album and with more than a decade of remixes under their belt, Purity Ring are now fully independent and working under their own imprint, The Fellowship. Their next album, out in September, is described as “the soundtrack to an imagined RPG… the record tells the story of two hapless characters - embodiments of mj and Corin - on a journey to build a kinder world amid the ruins of a broken one.”The album didn’t start out as an imagined video game soundtrack, but during production they quickly realised where the idea could lead: “There was a sense of traversing an RPG world, of a journey unfolding that felt deeply tied to the sound,” they say. With this concept identified, Many Lives and its b-side, Part II, were born. “Many Lives is the doorway into this imagined world, and its centre – sort of like the place in the beginning of most JRPG games, where the character begins their story.”The video for Many Lives, with its cel-shaded graphics, was directed by Mike Sunday.The story here centres around Purity Ring’s real-life experiences during production, as well as “memories and places of terror and comfort” from the duo’s past. “This albumis an extension of the dreaming it takes to make actual change,” they say; it explores how games can offer a journey that leads to creative rebirth.On first listen, what stands out in Many Lives is the haunting voices of the choir, reminiscent of Kenji Kawai’s iconic Ghost in the Shell soundtrack. This eerie intro is accompanied by a high-tempo breakbeat, culminating in a track that feels like watching classic anime while playing Jet Set Radio. Purity Ring aren’t shy about their love for this era. “The Ghost in the Shell soundtrack is such a striking combination with the visuals … it was very memorable to experience that as a kid.” Having revisited the anime for this project, the duo decided to create their new music in its image, citing it alongside the Japanese cult classic game Nier: Automata as an example of music that makes you feel part of the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Purity Ring aren’t afraid to turn to non-traditional instruments for ideas, claiming they aren’t big gearheads and rarely use hardware synths. “The Legend of Zeldaseries has always been a major inspiration for us,” they say. “Especially the ocarina music from the N64 titles.” You’ll hear echoes of 1998’s Ocarina of Time in the melody threading through both tracks, like a half-remembered song you’ve not heard for some time.If the nostalgic vocals and retro Casiotone MT-240 sounds aren’t enough to make you long for the golden age of games, the accompanying video’s cel-shaded graphics emphasise the duo’s love for all things RPG. Directed by Mike Sunday, the video is a GameCube daydream, inspired by “a time that felt like game developers were really embracing style over realism”. It’s Shinjuku meets Hyrule, reminiscent of the opening maps of JRPGs, places that are always beautiful and yet rarely revisited. Purity Ring are fondest of the PS2 and GameCube era, but they pay tribute to thePlayStationPortable too; the UI for their imagined RPG would look at home on several of the handheld’s bestsellers.For me, Many Lives sounds like afternoons spent playing Baten Kaitos (I’m still hoping for a sequel). For Purity Ring, the tracks “evoke a feeling of past, present and future – a nostalgia for something you’ve never experienced, but somehow still remember”. They’re keen to position this forthcoming album as a new chapter for them, capturing the sound of an era – and chasing the feeling of playing a life-changing game for the first time.Purity Ring will release their self-titled 4th album on 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesElectronic musicPlayStationNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 27 discs included the first recordings of Reich’s most recent scores,Traveler’s Prayerand Jacob’s Ladder, and now, for those who already owned the set from its previous incarnation, it has released those two works together on their own. Both pieces were composed during the Covid lockdown, and are scored for four singers and an instrumental ensemble; in both cases, too, they have Hebrew texts taken from the Old Testament.View image in fullscreenIn almost every other respect, though, the two pieces are very different. Traveler’s Prayer,first performed in 2021, is meditative and static, floating, almost ritualised. Those who associate Reich’s music with insistent rhythmic movement will find little of that here, and Reich has described the result as “closer to Josquin des Prez than Stravinsky”. The long, sinuously intertwining vocal lines for the pairs of sopranos and tenors make constant use of canons, yet harmonically the music stays rooted to the spot, without the magical shifts of tonality that give so much of Reich’s music its allure.Jacob’s Ladder, though, returns immediately to the propulsive, exuberant Reich, as the words from Genesis describing Jacob’s vision of a ladder to heaven are intoned by the vocalists over busy, insistent string and wind figures whose gently clashing dissonances add just a little edge to the textures. This buoyant music is joyously, inexhaustibly energetic; it’s hard to believe it was composed bya man who will be 90 next year.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Harvey is more interested in the tasks undertaken to keep themselves healthy and their lodgings shipshape. Simultaneously expansive and intimate, Orbital reveals how the usual routines of eating, sleeping and exercising are fraught with challenges when you are weightless: toothpaste foam must be swallowed rather than spat out and cutlery adhered to the table using magnets.Harvey is also alert to the isolation of the astronauts, even though they can’t get away from one another: “They are so together, and so alone, that even their thoughts, their internal mythologies, at times convene.” Yet their capsule proves a utopia of sorts where earthbound quarrels and borders cease to exist. Cooperation is vital as they go about their work while breathing the same recycled air.Actor Sarah Naudi is the narrator, providing a lyrical and hypnotic reading that is in keeping with the otherworldly setting. As the team hurtles through space, orbiting the Earth 16 times a day, they debate the existence of God and reflect on the wonder and fragility of human life.

Superficially at least, the Sonata in A major, D959, is the most extrovert and high spirited of that final triptych, even though, in its slow movement especially, tragedy breaks through the surface. Osborne’s performance conveys an impressive sense of both the expansive scale of the four-movement work and its lyrical ebullience. He gives the opening gesture (which will return in the final moments to devastating effect) all the grandeur it needs, perfectly balanced against the delicacy of the figuration that follows, and as the performance unfolds, every detail is just as perfectly calibrated.The six Moments Musicaux, D780, are equally well thought out, although Osborne does not seem quite as commanding and definitive in these miniatures as he does in the expanses of the sonata, in which his performance is one to set alongside the finest on record, from Rudolf Serkin (on Sony Classical) and Radu Lupu (Decca).Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Makes it all the harder to understand why they get everything wrong.” An exaggeration, of course, but one with a degree of truth to it. Why has an organisation with huge amounts of money at its disposal, a record of recruiting the brightest and the best, and the widest of remits, failed to notch up a better record? It’s true that we may not know about many of the CIA’s successes. But we know about a lot of its failures, and some of them have marked US history ineradicably.In The Mission,Tim Weiner, whose reporting on the CIA in the New York Times was always essential reading, and whose subsequent books on the US intelligence community have a place on the shelves of anyone interested in international affairs, provides a variety of answers to this essential question. As he showed nearly 20 years ago in Legacy of Ashes, his history of the CIA from its founding in 1947 to the end of the 20th century, the agency’s position by the end of the 90s was pretty desperate. It was starved of cash and bleeding talent. A high-flyer who had been station chief in Bucharest was revealed to be working for the Russians, handing them the names of large numbers of agents and employees. But the new US administration that came in at the start of 2001 wasn’t too worried. In March that year,Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, told the joint chiefs of staff: “For the first time in decades, the country faces no strategic challenge.” Six months later came 9/11. The CIA had tried to convince the feckless George W Bush about the looming threat of Islamic ultra-fundamentalism, but no one in the administration listened. The agency was regarded as broken.Presidents from Truman onwards have wanted the agency to be a secret armyPeople in British intelligence are often snarky about the CIA, as poor relations tend to be. Nevertheless, some of the private criticisms made by SIS – better known as MI6 – are well observed. (Weiner’s sources inside and around the CIA are impressive and absolutely impeccable, yet he seems to have no great interest in other western intelligence agencies; apart from a few scattered references to SIS and GCHQ in The Mission, only Dutch intelligence gets much of a mention.) SIS has tended to believe that a fault line of naivety runs through the CIA: witness the way that Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence led the agency by the nose in Afghanistan, persuading it to lavish funds on anti-western warlords whom the ISI supported for its own political purposes. The CIA’s eyes were only finally opened when, by good old-fashioned detective work, its agents discovered thatOsama bin Ladenwas living alongside Pakistani top military brass in Abbottabad.But there’s a more fundamental criticism that SIS and other intelligence aficionados level at the CIA: that it has never been allowed to be just an intelligence-gathering agency. US presidents from Truman onwards also wanted it to be a secret army, a point Weiner makes again and again.Long before the shameful Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s, when Reagan’s officials sold weapons to Iran then funded the CIA’s illegal guerrilla war in Nicaragua with the proceeds, presidents used the agency for their shady schemes despite any ethical qualms its operatives, and sometimes its topmost officers, might have had. The CIA accepted Bush’s edict, based on the highly questionable advice he received from the relatively junior White House lawyer John Yoo, that waterboarding, lengthy sleep deprivation and hanging prisoners by their arms for hours on end did not constitute torture. Perhaps, as a government agency, it had no real alternative, but its employees certainly obeyed, sometimes enthusiastically and even sadistically. Weiner is clear in his condemnation of this, but inclined to give the CIA the benefit of the doubt: “The CIA, with rare exceptions, was not a rogue elephant. When people were trampled, it wasn’t the elephant’s fault. It was the fault of the mahout – the elephant driver. And the mahout was the president of the United States.”Well, perhaps. But it’s hard to find excuses for Gina Haspel, for instance, who attended and oversaw one of the agency’s black-site prisons before rising to become the first female director of the CIA.View image in fullscreenPresidents Putin and Trump attend the 2019 G20 summit in Osaka.Photograph: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty ImagesWeiner’s sources,which are excellent,seem not to have included Haspel herself. But they do encompass several senior CIA figures from the period under discussion. These people opened up to him, and as a result the book contains many essential new details. Weiner’s account of Donald Trump’s links toVladimir Putinin 2016 is clearly based on information from inside the agency, and it leads him to assert openly that Trump was Putin’spoleznyidiot –his useful idiot. There are all sorts of other important and fascinating revelations in The Mission, but it’s the book of a journalist at the top of his game, not an academic. Some of it is written in white-hot anger at the thought of what Trump is doing to the US, and to the CIA in particular. Weiner is clearly channelling CIA opinion when he writes scathingly about the ludicrous John L Ratcliffe, who was given the job of director by Trump. Ratcliffe unhesitatingly complied with Trump’s extraordinary demand that the CIA should send the White House the first names and initials of every recent CIA recruit by non-secure email.There is little doubt that Trump has damaged the CIA, but he may not have helped Putin as much as seemed likely when Weiner was writing his book. Whatever the Russian president thought he might get from a second Trump term, he has in fact been damaged quite badly so far. He has lost his puppet and his bases in Syria, partly through the CIA’s efforts, and his ally Iran, after a shocking onslaught from Israel, now looks increasingly like a paper tiger. Ukraine – and Weiner is particularly good about the CIA’s involvement in trying to stop the invasion in 2022 – hasn’t, as many people expected, folded in the face of Putin’s assault, and it’s become harder for Trump simply to brush that war aside. Whether or not Putin indeed won the presidency for Trump in 2016 (Weiner quotes Russian government cybercriminals who he says swung the election as shouting “We made America great again!”) he is no longer pulling the strings to such good effect.As I say, thisis a journalist’s book, and bears the marks of it. But no one has opened up the CIA to us like Weiner has, and The Missiondeserves to win Weiner a second Pulitzer. Given the intense unpopularity of Trump in the upper echelons of American journalism, he may well get it.John Simpson is the BBC’s world affairs editor.

Though the job’s mental toll is clear – suicides are common, white staff never stick around and wellness support remains superficial – Girlie proves exceptionally hardy, near-perfect in her ability to identify and scrape feeds free of child sexual abuse content. Behind her productive impassivity, Castillo tells us with a sombre touch of irony, is a “glowing” line of ancestors – Filipina nurses and maids who have long cleaned up after others.Things look up for Girlie once William Cheung enters the scene, inviting her to become a moderator at Playground, a virtual reality entertainment platform newly acquired by Reeden. Girlie is a perfect fit. As the American-born daughter of immigrants, she carries a cloying sense of filial indebtedness (“there was an unspoken understanding, an ironclad cultural code: if you made money, you had to pay your family back”). With the family home under mortgage, the generous benefits package is hard to resist. And, because we’re partly also in romance territory, so is the man offering it.Castillo’s celebrated debut,America is Not the Heart, was centred on the Filipino experience in 90s America. Peopled with nurses, doctors, faith healers, makeup artists, restaurateurs and DJs shifting languages between Ilocano, Tagalog and Pangasinan, the book opened a window on to a shadowed corner of American life, but refused to trade on trauma (“the gooey heart-porn of the ethnographic”, Castillo calls it in her essay collection, How To Read Now). Instead, it honoured quiet, quotidian expressions of community and survival. But where that first novel could lean into self-seriousness, weighed down by the familiar solemnities of the immigrant story, Moderation has more fun within the genre – even if of a masochistic kind (“Parents worked all the time … Never been on vacation with my family,” Girlie says at one point. “Never been to Disneyland either”).Castillo cannily frames VR’s healing power within a darker tale of its co-option for profit, control and surveillanceThe book’s twinned look at labour and immigration all but guarantees comparisons to Ling Ma’s 2018 novel, Severance. But Girlie, unlike the Chinese-born protagonist of the latter work, is not haunted by memories of a distant homeland; her only longing is for her childhood home in Milpitas, lost in the 2008 market crash. The books’ true kinship may lie in the fact that they both unfold against a backdrop of collapse: where Ma imagined a fungal pandemic, Castillo envisions a looming digital end time.Playground’s journey, Girlie learns, began with a keen interest in the therapeutic space. The need for funding then led it to merge with L’Olifant, a French theme park company showcasing “French history to the French”. Now, with Reeden as a shared parent, the two are poised to transform the worlds of entertainment and healthcare – at least in theory.Castillo cannily frames VR’s healing power – from treating PTSD and phobias to providing pain relief and easing suicidal thoughts – within a darker tale of its co-option for profit, control and surveillance. Castillo is interested in the overlap between rightwing politics, tech culture and historiography. L’Olifant is modelled after historical French theme park company Puy du Fou, created by Philippe de Villiers, who is known for his Catholic, Eurosceptic and national sovereignty politics, and, in 2022, for backing the far-right candidate Éric Zemmour. Like Puy du Fou, L’Olifant is on a mission to make history “fun” and “exciting”, even if it means ideologically rewriting it.As the story unfolds, and therapeutic ideals, revisionist ambitions and corporate greed converge, Castillo has potent themes to work with: censorship, digital feudalism, the exploitation of biometric data for propaganda purposes, and the disturbing trade-off between principle and progress. Disappointingly, she seems more content to skim surfaces than probe depths. Her narratorial tactic of choice is to tell and tell – through flat expositional dialogue, but also the lazy shorthand of news headlines (“PLAYGROUND’S NEW VIRTUAL REALITY INITIATIVE: FAR-OUT FANTASY OR FAR-RIGHT NIGHTMARE?”) – never showing, never dramatising. The characters, as a result, can feel like bystanders, idling on the tale’s margins rather than actively inhabiting its centre. Girlie and William are interesting in their own right, but together, not exactly a match you’d ship. This is because for pages on end, the supposed romance between the pair lies dormant, only for it to comically whip into life in sudden bursts of passion. The novel tries to straddle too many worlds at once – thriller, dystopia, second-generation immigrant account, love story – but commits wholeheartedly to none. The result is a narrative that feels more scattered than layered.But Moderation is not without merits. Castillo is a writer of razor-sharp acuity who takes seriously the sinister instrumentalisation of storytelling, in a world increasingly veering right. As a novel of ideas, Moderation contains terror enough to keep you reading, and looking for signs of the nightmare its author has taken the time to document.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Will they unleash a darker side?Non-violent games about cooking, farming or tidying now rival the more traditional video game pursuits of shooting and fighting in popularity. So what will the #cozy genre tackle next?Nicole CarpenterThu 10 Jul 2025 06.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 11.38 EDTShareIn 2017, a game design thinktank called Project Horseshoe gathered a group of developers together to define the concept of cosiness in video games.Games, of course, have had non-violent elements since the medium was invented. Early life simulators such as 1985’s Little Computer People, a low-stakes game in which the player interacts with a man living his unremarkable life in a house, could fit the bill; then there was the proliferation of social farming simulations after 1996’s chibi-adorable Harvest Moon.But the resulting report,Coziness in Games: An Exploration of Safety, Softness, and Satisfied Needs, is probably the first organised effort to define a then-emerging genre. The group zeroed in on three core things: safety, abundance, and softness. Cosy games (cozy in US spelling) don’t have high-risk scenarios: “There is no impending loss of threat,” they wrote. They must have a sense of abundance: “Nothing is lacking, pressing or imminent.” And a soft aesthetic wraps everything up like a warm hug.View image in fullscreenPuzzle game … a room in Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamTake developer Witch Beam’s puzzle game Unpacking, for example, which tells a story as the player takes things out of boxes and puts them into different houses. There are limitations to where you can put things: it’s a puzzle game, after all. But there’s no timer, no scoring system, no punishments for placing something wrong. And colorful pixel art brings it all together.Project Horseshoe’s definition came alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017, a handheld console designed to be cosied up with on the couch, and at that time the genre was experiencing huge growth. By 2019, indie game designer Matthew Taylor had started a Twitter account – called Wholesome Games – to highlight games that fitted the definition. Eventually, Wholesome Games (led by Taylor and partners Jenny Windom, James Tillman and Victoria Tran) grew into a community that hosted showcases full of cute and non-threatening games, and it has now become a company that publishes them.The success of Wholesome Games mirrors the immense growth of the genre as a whole. The first Wholesome Direct was broadcast in 2020, as the cosy genre began to explode during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns (thanks in no small part to Nintendo’s chill island escapeAnimal Crossing: New Horizons), and had 25,000 viewers, Tillman claims. The most recent Wholesome Direct, which debuted in June, reached 5 million people.View image in fullscreenComfort in grief … Spiritfarer.Photograph: Thunder Lotus GamesYou can see this trend on Steam, where more and more games are tagged with the “cozy” moniker. In 2020, just 15 games on Steam were released with the cozy tag attached,according to SteamDB. That number more than doubled in 2021, with 39 games, then doubled again in 2022, with 85. And then, the explosion: 373 games were tagged cozy in 2024 – more than one released per day on Steam. Every time the genre seems to have reached its peak, it rises higher. There are massive commercial hits, too: Animal Crossing sold nearly 50m, more than any game in the Call of Duty military shooter series. Famous farming gameStardew Valley, meanwhile, has sold 41m.Kelly Boudreau, associate professor of game studies and design programme lead at Harrisburg University, says that cosy games aren’t just a genre, but an “ideological shift in game design – something that can be powerful in order to express different themes and play experiences.” You can see this in the diversity of experiences that cosy games offer.A Little to the Leftand Unpacking are wildly different games about organising household items;A Short Hikeis about a summer vacation stroll up a mountain; Spiritfarer is a comforting management simulator about death and grief, andVenbais an emotional story about nostalgia and cooking Tamil cuisine.View image in fullscreenDarker themes … Strange Horticulture.Photograph: Bad VikingMore recently, darker games have also been considered cosy:Strange Horticulturehas the player running a shop selling – sometimes – poisonous plants, whileDredgeadds a horror narrative on top of traditionally low-stakes fishing and sailing. “At the core of it, these games are joyful, hopeful, and compassionate,” says Wholesome Games partner Windom. “When people play them, we want them to feel a sense of warmth and a sense of safety. But that definition has expanded to include games that, perhaps, deal with uncomfortable or uncosy topics, but within the realm of safety.”Rhea Gupte and Prateek Saxena of India-based imissmyfriends.studio did not set out to make a cosy game, but their debut, Fishbowl, is certainly one. Fishbowl stars Alo, a 21-year-old woman who’s just moved to a new city for a job as a video editor. Then the pandemic lockdowns begin, as she grieves the death of her grandmother. Despite the weighty topics, you can see the cosy everywhere in Fishbowl – in the meticulously designed colour palette, the intricate and detailed pixel art, and the soft, comforting sound design.View image in fullscreenPlenty of cosy … Fishbowl.Photograph: imissmyfriends.studio“We started off with the themes and the story and what we wanted to express,” writer and art director Gupte says. “Thinking about the design and overall feel of the game, it felt as if it needed a comforting atmosphere, otherwise it was going to become super heavy and difficult to play through. We wanted to have that sort of melancholy yet levity in the game.”Cosy as a genre is evolving, and part of that is an understanding that cosy feels different for everyone. Still, not every non-violent game can be called cosy, Boudreau stresses: “It’s not valuable to stick that tag on everything, because it becomes meaningless.”View image in fullscreenRural pursuits … Stardew Valley.Photograph: ConcernedApeFishbowl is not a cosy game in the way thatStardew Valleyis, where players dream of an idyllic life on a farm. Gupte and Saxena spoke about the distance between how farming and agriculture are portrayed in games and what they are like in reality: “In India, agriculture is a very scary part of people’s lives,” Saxena said. “There’s a game from India called The Palace on the Hill, where the main character has to do farming to repay their debt. It’s a reverse cosy game. But in a different world, [farming] is considered a more laid-back life.”Toem, a contemplative photography game released in 2021 by developer Something We Made, is another extension of the genre. Though it’s unequivocally a cosy game, it’s lacking something the genre is known for: a colour palette. Toem is rendered entirely in black and white. Monochrome can look harsh, Toem developer Lucas Gullbo says. But Toemisn’tharsh; the use of gradients and a soft aesthetic keeps the game from having “the emotional feeling of being black and white.”View image in fullscreenCulinary nostalgia … Venba.Photograph: Visai GamesWhere does cosy go from here? Over the past year, idle games have emerged as a subsector of the genre: low-stakes affairs such as Cornerpond, in which you fish from your desktop; Ropuka’s Idle Island, where you chill with a frog; and Bao Bao’s Cozy Laundromat, where you build a launderette. These games have many of the traditional trappings of cosy – the abundance of farming and resource collection paired with cute, colourful graphics – but crucially, you barely have to do much. There’s stuff youcando, such as decorating or small mini-games, but nothing youhaveto do. The game can – and will – go on without you, and this is a big part of the appeal. Is there something inherently cosy about idleness? As the genre grows, there’s much to explore.“In the cosy, wholesome realm – but just in games in general – it’s such a young medium that we’re still discovering genres and mechanics,” Windom says. “And it’s rare when we do see something really novel come up. It felt to a lot of people, when wholesome games and cosy games emerged, that it was something they had never considered before. Instead of shooting in first-person, why don’t we take a photograph? These shifts happen. We’re still discovering what we can do with games.”Explore more on these topicsGamesGame culturePuzzle gamesStrategy gamesAdventure gamesSteamDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it a dadaist farce, scathing political satire or just empty surrealism? One thing’s for sure, it is completely Marmite, met with both whoops and walkouts on this London debut. Nature Theater of Oklahoma are in fact an experimental theatre company from New York, and No President, originally made in 2018 (when a certain president was in his first term), involves the following: a pair of security guards protecting a mysterious curtain and whatever is behind it, a love triangle (actually a pentagon), a rival security company in tutus, an insecure man rising to be a Trump-ish despot, and a lot, lot more.It’s staged as a “ballet” inasmuch as the score is Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker and the performers wear ballet flats and unitards (with cutesy knitted genitals stuck on top) while dancing their way through the show’s two hours, sometimes a bouncy jog, occasionally fouettés. Untrained dancers, like this cast, can bring many qualities to the stage – vulnerability, striving, humanity, joy – but here (at least until the very end) the mode is just lightly comic.The physicality reads like a silent movie, but one with boners, Cheetos, cannibalism and copulating wildlife. It’s a mime act accompanied by unceasing narration, a barrage of text delivered at constant pitch and overegged volume, crammed with wordiness (“afflatus”, “feculent”, “kakistocracy”) plus some pleasing details (the devil disappearing in a puff of smoke “that smells like cheddar cheese”), with the result that it’s often indigestible.View image in fullscreenA mime act accompanied by unceasing narration … No President.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt’s clever, sure, packed with a multilayered plot and lots of ideas expressed in cartoonish fashion, whether what drives people to tyranny, or the vagaries of the artist’s ego, musing on “The B-word [boring], the worst insult to any performing artist”, and wondering if “there was no purpose for the drama that’s taken place”. Very meta.The onslaught makes it too easy to switch off. Is that the point? That Donald Trump’s torrent of nonsense – “braggadocious verbiage” to quote from the script – ever more outrageous policies, and the hyper-stimulation of wall-to-wall media, has led a society to lose grip on its critical faculties. If so, it’s an eccentric way to make it.No President is a wild ride, and a marathon feat for the admirably committed performers. But somehow at the same time, it is also the B-word.AtQueen Elizabeth Hall, London, until 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedyDanceUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a rapid sequel to a popular hit, even featuring, in the style of Superman and Harry Potter, the name of the marquee hero in the title: it was initially performed as Sir John Falstaff and the Merry Wives of Windsor, granting a franchise to the obese, beery, leering knight previously seen as the mentor to Henry IV.However, in another aspect, The Merry Wives of Windsor, as it now identifies, chafes against contemporary sensitivities. The main sources of comedy are fat-shaming – whether Sir John’s belly, dimensions and contents widely analysed, will fit confined spaces – and the failure of foreigners to speak and act as the Queen’s subjects did, especially the Welsh and French, nations each represented by a gross caricature. Oh, and just how many words can make an English audience see penises or vaginas.View image in fullscreenTaking charge … Emma Pallant (Mistress Page) and Danielle Phillips (Robin the Page) in The Merry Wives of Windsor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianBut director Sean Holmes exuberantly embraces all of this, locating, in Shakespeare’s most homely comedy (his one play with an English town in the title), a template for a national strain of populist drama, driven by innuendo and xenophobia, that stretches to Carry On and ’Allo, ’Allo.Most words come twice. The devil who deceived Faust is pronounced “Mephisto-phallus.” Adam Wadsworth’s Dr Caius delivers “By Gar” (the text’s cod-Gallicism for “By God”) to sound suspiciously like “Bugger!”; the same actor quick-changing to a Slender with a Pythonesque funny walk, bow-legged and pigeon-toed.The cast, though, also bring out what is most Shakespearean about this potboiler frivolity: the fascinated ear for speech. George Fouracres’ Falstaff has Midlands tones that may echo the playwright, and impressively moves from careless gluttony and lechery to the character’s later fear and fury. As Mistress Ford and Mistress Page – the Windsor wives who Falstaff jointly targets to double his odds of sex – Katherine Pearce and Emma Pallant glory in the story’s most modern element: women taking charge. Marcus Olale has the presence to show that he in future deserves a more rewarding role than the somewhat sub-plotty Fenton and Nym.Even the admirable narrative clarity of Holmes’ staging can’t quite unravel the messy fifth act that – with tricks and faeries in a wood and Sir John lamenting that he has been turned into an ass – disconcertingly overlaps with A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which, the RSC’s favoured timeline suggests, was written in close proximity. Holmes sensibly points up these parallels with a better-known piece for this season but it is finally the play that loses a fifth star for a joyous production that is a perfect summer night’s revel for tourists and citizens alike.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, from 13 July to 20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobeWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

I thought they’d turn their backs, play the songs, and not put too much effort into it. But it was just banger after banger. The pace was incredible. For me, it was pure nostalgia, with my brother and best mate. My brother and I had our own falling out earlier in the year, so there was reconciliation all round. Nature’s healing.View image in fullscreenLloyd Williams (right), who last saw Oasis in the Principality Stadium in 2009, and his friend James.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI think my highlight was Noel and Liam bowing to each other as they walked out. ButRichard Ashcrofthad already started strongly – when he played Bitter Sweet Symphony, tops were already off.Champagne Supernova and Acquiesce were special. There were blokes crying everywhere. This was our Eras tour.I last saw Oasis in the same stadium in 2009 when I was 15, on the last day of my GCSEs, and I thought Liam sounded crap. The roof was open, there wasn’t much of an atmosphere, the sky was grey, and they just sounded off. They needed a break; we all needed a break. You never know what you have until it’s gone.Lloyd Williams, 31, London (originally Cardiff)‘I felt seen as a younger generation Oasis fan’I’ve been anOasisfan since 2020. I was out of school, and I felt a bit lost, and their music helped me quite a bit going through that tough time during Covid. It made me realise I really do enjoy music.So seeing Noel and Liam finally back together was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. It lived up to everything I ever wanted it to be; an emotional and extremely memorable night. There were older fans, and fans who were younger than me. When Noel dedicated The Masterplan to people in their 20s and thanked them for “keeping the spirit of Oasis alive”, I started crying. I felt seen as a younger generation Oasis fan. I’m extremely grateful that I got to experience the monumental first night – it’ll forever be one of the best days of my life.Millie Cottrell, 21, Monmouthshire‘Liam’s voice was back to its best’It was completely joyful, something I will remember for a long time. Oasis might not have been as talkative on stage as they used to be, but they gave the fans exactly what they wanted – hit after hit, with some of the fan-favourite B-sides.I was lucky enough to see Oasis five times back in their heyday, including Maine Road and Knebworth in 1996, so I have fantastic memories of seeing them at their very best when I was a teenager. But it felt as exciting to see them now. It was the perfect mix of nostalgia and joy at seeing them again. Liam’s voice was back to its best, and Noel – whose songs were always my favourite – belted them out with the crowd singing every word.Kate, 45, LondonView image in fullscreenMuhammed Abdelmoteleb, whose set highlight was Acquiesce.Photograph: Guardian Community‘The anticipation was palpable’Seeing Liam and Noel emerge on stage for the very first time in 16 years was always going to be electric. I was lucky enough to be there and the anticipation was palpable all day in Cardiff, with Oasis being blasted from pubs, and hordes of people wearing Oasis T-shirts and bucket hats milling around the city.Right from the opening lyrics of their first song on stage, Hello, it was clear that Liam’s voice was in top shape and the rest of the band ran a tight musical ship. I would say my highlight was Acquiesce. It’s one of the few songs where both Liam and Noel sing in shared verses – seeing them share the same song was pretty amazing.Muhammed Abdelmoteleb, 48, Newport‘I went to both nights – it felt like they had never been away’When they announced Oasis was reuniting and I got pre-sale access, I felt sick with anticipation. I classify myself as a superfan and just had to be at both opening nights. I bought a ticket to the Saturday show in the first round of sales, but friends of mine said: “Well, you’re not really going to the reunion if you don’t go to the first gig.” So I spent a lot of time refreshing, and got lucky last week.It was beyond my wildest expectations. Richard Ashcroft really set the tone for a magical evening with a superb set. I don’t think I’ve ever seen as many people so engaged with a support act. The atmosphere before Oasis felt like the build-up before a massive heavyweight boxing match. When they arrived, it was a beautiful moment. Liam was on fire. The set list has to go down as one of the greatest of all time.I’d seen Oasis seven times before, where there were drinks thrown and a few fights. There was none of that. It seemed like the crowd didn’t want anything to spoil it. It felt like they had never been away. The best two gigs I’ve ever been to.Nigel Wright, 44,Tongham, Surrey‘It was raw emotion’Being there on the first night, in my country, after a 30-year wait, meant the world to me. I was singing loudly to Acquiesce with a bunch of strangers, never saying a word to each other but all knowing what the other was feeling. Back in the 90s, music was very tribal, but this crowd was full of different people, young and old.The band sounded great. Liam and Noel sang like no time had passed since the 1990s. Friday night took me back to 1996, when it felt like I could tell 13-year-old me that things are going to get dark, but they will get better. I know others will criticise the band for ripping off the Beatles – who hasn’t? – and for the Gallaghers having questionable opinions and means of expressing them in a non-musical setting. But it was raw emotion for me. While the Gallaghers can be right bellends, their music means so much more. They aremybellends, and will always be.Paul Hunt, 42,Abercynon, WalesExplore more on these topicsOasisBritpopPop and rockLiam GallagherNoel GallagherRichard AshcroftCardifffeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s also selfie addicts, anonymous fetishists and a pharmacist taking pictures of his customers without their consentCharlotte JansenThu 10 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTShareArtists have always been fascinated with imagining the invisible – but few have taken it quite as far as Musuk Nolte. The 37-year-old Mexican photographer has spent a decade working with the Indigenous peoples of the Peruvian Amazon region – and found inspiration there by taking ayahuasca with a shaman called Julio.Nolte tells me he first took ayahuasca when he was five years old – with his mum, an anthropologist who studied the psychedelic brew. The powerful hallucinogenic visions he experienced while with the Shawi community in their ancestral homeland, the Paranapura basin, have been translated into a series of images titled The Belongings of the Air, presented as small suspended light boxes, glowing like fireflies in a darkened room. They are unconventional documents, not showing the Shawi directly but reflecting the Shawi cosmovision. Pulsating with flashes of bright white light, the images have an allegorical tenor: we move with quickened breath from the intimate to the epic, from a woman and child washing clothes in a river to a closeup of a man’s ear, to the blazing eyes of a big cat, to a dazzling constellation of blurry silver flecks. This latter image was created by photographing rows of candles lit for forcibly displaced relatives whose whereabouts remain unknown. The feeling it stirs is one of the universe melting.View image in fullscreenDressed as a deity … Octavio Aguilar’s Tajëëw, the Snake.Photograph: Enrique Macias Martinez/Octavio AguilarThe Belongings of the Air is among the highlights of this year’s Les Rencontres d’Arles, the world’s oldest and most prestigious photography festival. There are dozens of exhibitions here, taking over the ancient, crumbling cloisters, churches and crypts of the Roman city until October. Nolte’s trippy, illusory work is also included in An Assembly of Sceptics, the shortlist exhibition for the 2025 Discovery award Louis Roederer Foundation that includes seven projects by artists using photography to conjure alternate versions of reality and destabilise the status quo.Bolivian-Algerian artist Daniel Mebarek presents portraits taken in a free mobile photo studio he set up in the huge open-air market in El Alto, Bolivia. The photographs reflect an eagerness, particularly of middle-aged men, to be seen. He recounts a story of an inebriated man who later returned to thank the photographer with a bag of pears, and another of a man who kissed his photograph in elation. There are also the fraught, time-bending, cryptic collages of Cairo by Heba Khalifa, who uses family photographs and photomontage techniques in part to help her confront and heal after an abusive childhood. The spellbinding photographs by Octavio Aguilar also travel through time to the artist’s Ayuuk ancestors, a heritage conjured through images of his friends dressed as deities important in Ayuuk mythology who influence nature. Aguilar, like Nolte, offers another way of interacting with the environment based on Indigenous knowledge and ways of seeing. As wildfires raged nearby in Marseille, less than an hour from Arles, the urgency of this message loomed large.An Assembly of Sceptics reflects this year’s strong Latin American focus, centred on several big exhibitions diving into the past, present and future of photography in Brazil – part of the programme of the Brazil-France cultural year.The story of Brazilian photography at Arles begins in São Paulo in 1939, when 18 amateur photographers founded the Foto-Cine Clube Bandeirante (FCCB). The FCCB’s headquarters in São Paulo’s first skyscraper emphasised the intertwining of photography and architecture as the vehicles of modernism. The early works of the FCCB photographers, in the 1940s and 1950s, reflected modernist ideals with a cool, graphic poise – pristine documents, sometimes verging on abstraction, of urban construction, cables, wires and the clean, curvilinear forms of São Paulo’s new modernist landmarks by the likes of Oscar Niemeyer. Human figures, when they appear, are puny against the might of progress. Later, though, several photographers started to unravel this modernist utopia, revealing those cast out, excluded from the benefits of this supposed social progress. Alice Brill was one of the rebels, who was ejected from the FCCB after less than a year. Her images move away from the exaltation of modernism to a darker picture of the human cost of development. Her photos of poverty and the poor living conditions of communities on the city’s outskirts, of cluttered streets littered with rubbish, São Paulo’s proud skyscrapers distant in the background, are a far cry from the untainted, uncrowded visions that followed the FCCB’s guidelines at the time. They act as reminders that progress rarely benefits all.View image in fullscreenDazzling …. Musuk Nolte’s The Belongings of the Air.Photograph: Musuk NolteAt cultural space La Croisière you are propelled into the rhythm and colour of one of Brazil’s largest favelas, the sprawling Aglomerado da Serra located in the hills of Belo Horizonte. A dual exhibition, Portraitists of the Hilldraws from the archives of Serra residents João Mendes and Afonso Pimenta. Mendes and Pimenta collaborated to document their local communities for more than 50 years, but this show focuses on the first two decades of their work there, between 1970 and 1990.Though Serra was established out of a lack of proper housing for Belo Horizonte’s swelling population, Mendes and Pimenta show the autonomy of an energetic, stylish community who they photographed with obvious affection and warmth. Here are images of irrepressible joy and happiness, beautiful and chaotic. They record the lively tempo of children’s birthday parties, the shining primary school graduates at a local state school and the agile moves of those trained in the martial art capoeira. But they also pay homage to quieter domestic moments, families in their living rooms and around kitchen tables. The exhibition pays particular attention to the duo’s images of fathers, grandfathers and men holding children – in one image, a local shopkeeper proudly holds a neighbour’s newborn baby up to the camera. A man in his underwear in his living room puts his arm around his smiling wife. A father props baby twins on his knees, a balancing act belied by his composure as he looks directly at the camera. The pictures shift ideas about the caring roles of men in a patriarchal society, as if conscious too of the legacy of these pictures, and their potential to shape how the children in them might look back and remember.Activist and artist Claudia Andujar, who has lived in São Paulo since 1955, is best known and widely celebrated for her work with the Yanomami Indigenous people of Amazonia. Her decades-long activism contributed to the recognition of Yanomami territory in 1992. Yet while this acclaimed work continues to be relevant given the struggles of Indigenous peoples in Brazil and beyond, it has perhaps skewed the understanding of Andujar as an artist. In the Place of the Other at Maison des Peintres redresses that, the first exhibition to home in exclusively on Andujar’s early, less known works, made in Brazil soon after she arrived in the country in the 1960s and 1970s, and before she began to work with the Yanomami.View image in fullscreenCryptic collages … Heba Khalifa’s Tiger’s Eye.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistIt’s a small but utterly enthralling show, bringing to light several series originally produced and published by Realidade (Reality), a groundbreaking Brazilian magazine published between 1966 and 1976 that combined reportage and experimental design. The images are astonishing – Andujar’s fearless, extraordinarily direct gaze is emphasised by these large-scale reproductions. For a 1967 story about the work of traditional midwife Dona Odila, Andujar captured, with an unflinching eye, the climatic moments of a child being born. These photographs of a woman labouring at home led to the magazine being confiscated by the police. Other works soar with cinematic beauty, such as a series of pictures following a controversial medium known as Zé Arigó, who was later imprisoned for his 60-second “psychic surgeries”. One excruciating image immortalises the surreal moment he inserts the flat blade of a knife into a patient’s eye.This exhibition draws out Andujar’s unique combination of empathy and audacity, and her deep interest in the human psyche. Her first experiments with colour filters applied to the camera evoke an apparent interest in “aura”, the things felt but not seen. Her photographs of drug addicts and of a psychodrama session take photojournalism into a daring, bold new terrain and have more in common with Dario Argento and Quentin Tarantino than Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank, who Andujar exhibited alongside at MoMA in the 1960s. The exhibition culminates in A Sônia, a series of nudes of Andujar’s one time muse, an aspiring model from Bahia. Andjuar met Sônia, and never saw her again after the three hour shoot. A Sônia presents another completely different facet to Andujar. She wasn’t happy with the original slide film portraits she took and so rephotographed them through coloured photographs – the resulting nudes look like X-rays, ethereal and strange. On the face of it this intimate exchange (and more classical subject matter) seems disconnected from Andujar’s other works – but it is ultimately about one person trying to understand another, from the outside in. Just as her photojournalism in Brazil began as a way of understanding her adopted homeland, here Andujar writes that “perhaps I was seeking an idealised reflective identification with what I do not know about my own body”.View image in fullscreenEthereal … Claudia Andujar’s In the Place of the Other.Photograph: Claudia Andujar/Courtesy of the artist/Instituto Moreira SallesLatin America dominates, but Australia too has an important landmark moment at Arles this year – the first ever big exhibition of Australian photography to be held at the festival. On Country is an expansive, encompassing survey featuring about 20 artists in the huge Eglise Sainte-Anne. As a result of its ambition and diversity, it is varied in quality, with some repetitive moments. The exhibition centres on connections to Australian terrains and topographies, taking inspiration from the First Peoples’ definition of “country” as a broad way to describe a spiritual and cultural connection to the land. Adam Ferguson’s brooding, dramatic photographs of the Australian outback, made over the course of a decade, ruminate on the devastating impact of environmental crisis on rural life in these scorched, vast landscapes. Ying Ang’s evocative, architectonic installation, with intersecting images and vinyls, explores the overdevelopment of the Gold Coast, now Australia’s crime capital. The best works, though, were the large-scale, weirdly wonderful performances of Michael Cook, a Bidjara peoples artist who photographs himself as an alter ego, dressed in a suit, in places of colonial power, multiplied until he fills the space.If one show truly blew me away this year, it was the mind-boggling In Praise of AnonymousPhotography. Marion and Philippe Jacquier ran the recently closed Lumière des Roses gallery, a home for the nearly 10,000 photographs they’d collected over 20 years by unknown and amateur photographers. This exhibition brings together images from the collection in various categories – there’s some of the 120 Cindy Sherman-esque self-portraits by a photographer the collectors name “Zorro”, posing with whips, aviation masks and thigh-high boots. There are Mr Roussel’s carnivalesque portraits of a wife, her features altered, sometimes grotesquely, by painting applied to the photograph. There are the pictures a Parisian pharmacist took of his customers without consent via a secret camera installed behind his counter – only one child seems to have spotted what was going on. Why the pharmacist did this, we will never know. There is also a tranche of the self-portraits of Lucette, the hero, in my mind, of Arles this year. Born in 1908, she travelled solo to France, Greece, Egypt, Syria and Scandinavia between 1954 and 1977. On her trips, she took 850 pictures – and the sole subject of them all is herself.

But is that the real him? Far from it, he saysThu 10 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 03.17 EDTShareAt the Hot WaterComedyClub in Liverpool, Paul Smith’s standup double-header feels like a pop star’s homecoming. Women are wearing his tour T-shirts as dresses and the bar is half a dozen deep with fans hoping to get roasted by the local comic famous for his audience takedowns. There are first-daters, girls’ night outs, lads’ night outs, tourists, locals, couples, mothers and their grownup sons clamouring for a spot on the front row.On stage, as on social media where his viral show clips from this venue led to international, sell-out-arena fame, Smith is as sweary as they come. During his 75-minute, banter-dense sets, little is out of bounds.So when I sit across from him backstage before the gig, in a room named in his honour, it’s a surprise to find a quiet family man who, beyond the moments he relays jokes to me, barely utters a swear word. “People get really disappointed when they meet me in real life,” says the 42-year-old. “I’m really quiet. I’m never the biggest personality in a group.”Superficially, his path to comedy appears to have mirrored a modern road to music stardom: from YouTube fame to arena-size deals. In reality, however, he spent 12 years grafting before his first clips went viral on Facebook in 2017. He specialises in crowd work, which is particularly well-suited to bite-size online videos.He had been working in an office when he first entertained the idea of telling jokes on stage. “I was working as a graphic designer and got a comedy club email saying, ‘Do you think you’re funny?’” Intrigued, he signed up for the course. “Until then, I don’t think I had the self-esteem to believe I could do it, but I always wanted to.”He became interested in comedy after seeing his first standup, the Irish comicJason Byrne. “I couldn’t wrap my head around how he just got on stage and seemingly made up the whole hour of standup on the spot and brought the crowd into it,” says Smith. “I found it fascinating.”Smith also loved Raw, a live recording of one of Eddie Murphy’s standup shows, as a kid – “Dead naughty” – which was passed round school. But it was laconic Irish comedian Dave Allen’s laid-back, stretched-out storytelling and outrageous, controversial humour that sparked inspiration. “When you come to a full show and see my longer-form material, it’s a bit slower, like Dave Allen kind of stuff.”View image in fullscreenCrowd control … Smith performing at the Hot Water Comedy Club in Liverpool.Photograph: Hot Water Comedy ClubWhen I sit down later at his packed show, Smith will use front-row interactions with a mixed martial artist to tell the story of his 76-second total knockout delivered by reality TV’s Jake Quickenden in a2023 charity fight(“The walkout was longer than the fucking fight … I was button bashing in real life”), and a pregnant woman to describe the birth of his two kids (“Midwives, they’re all shoulder”). His rapid and outrageous one-liners – he responds to a doctor’s receptionist with “I’m surprised you fucking answered me then” – generate the biggest laughs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’m not nasty enoughDoes he consider himself offensive? When it comes to swearing, Smith says: “It’s just intonation for your brain. I think it’s something to do with the sound,fuck,especially in my accent. Those words are so versatile and useful.” As for content: “I really care about people. I’m never that bad to the point where they’re not enjoying it. I’m not nasty enough.“There must be a line somewhere,” Smith continues. The best example of navigating the line lies “with a guy called Ade. It’squite a famous clip,” he says of a moment from a 2021 Birmingham show (which has 840,000 YouTube views) in which he called an audience member lazy for not working, only for the man to reveal he had cancer. “I went with it, I said: ‘You fucking selfish cunt, bringing that up,’ and he was pissing himself. Afterwards, I thought: I don’t know if that was too far. His daughter messaged, and said: ‘That’s the first time I’ve seen him laugh in a year.’” Ade is now a regular at Smith’s shows.Crowd work is the hottest thing in standup comedy – and not everybody is laughing | Brian LoganRead moreAn early experience ofnottackling a taboo came in 2011, when he discovered that a man he called “rude” for ignoring his banter was, in fact, blind. Smith had tried directing his usual crowd work at him, and took his lack of recognition as an unwillingness to play ball. When he told Smith that he couldn’t see, the comedian “just didn’t know how to deal with it. I flapped. I panicked in case he was offended.” The audience member saved it. “He said: ‘Can you do audio description on that?’ That taught me a lot. It took a while for me to lean into this stuff.”Smith often makes light of his experiences parenting his 12-year-old disabled son, who is autistic and nonverbal: “It makes it a bit more relatable when someone brings stuff like that up. One of thefirst clips I put up about himwas how people feel sorry for him but he gets everything he wants. If you don’t give him a biscuit, he just screams. Imagine if I tried that – my wife won’t give me a blowjob so I just start screaming; it’s not gonna work out.“I got a bit of backlash onlineand I was like: should I be talking about this? Then I thought: hang on, no; I’m talking aboutmyexperience with disability, from a genuine place. I don’t think anyone can have a problem with that.” If his son were the butt of someone else’s joke, he would feel differently. “This is why I won’t do roast battles,” he says. “Comedians make dark jokes; one of them will make a joke about my son and I will lose my temper. I know I would react badly.”View image in fullscreenFront row heat … Paul Smith.Photograph: Duncan Elliott/The GuardianHe can handle jokes aimed at him, though, and like many comedians, being the target of his own comedy was a natural place to start. He opened his first sets with ginger jokes: “I’m the G word – gorgeous.”Smith’s heavily ad-libbed shows vary nightly. He concedes: “I’m not technically the funniest comedian, I’ve not technically got the best material. I’m just good for morale.”How viral ‘crowd work’ clips are remaking standup for the social media ageRead moreHis 1.2 million Instagram followers testify to the formula – and the power of morale – as does the scale of his year-long Pablotour, which includes two sold-out shows at OVO arena Wembley, Sydney’s 8,000-seater ICC and London’s O2, this November. He finds fame “mad”, often leaving his “more extrovert” wife and fellow comedian Lori Smith to buffer approaches. “I got stopped in Disney World by a 55-year-old sheriff. How does he even understand what I’m saying?”He is still finding hard to get his head around playing arenas. “As the shows get bigger, you can’t see but you can feel 15,000 people,” he says. “You can feel a crowd pull away and you can feel a crowd come back to you. If there’s a fight in the room, you can feel where it is. It runs through you.” After his first tour, this emotional overload left him feeling depressed. “Now I realise you’re taking all their energy, washing it and giving it back to them. You can’t have that up without that corresponding down.”On home turf, the Liverpool crowd is as lively as they come. He could not fail to make them laugh. “Have you ever been on an OK date?” he says before we part. “There are crowds where it’s like: ‘That was fine, I was fine, you were fine, but we’re never gonna call each other again.’ What you want is: ‘We’re getting breakfast together tomorrow.’ That’s the crowd you want.” And as his crowd head back into the bar – the first daters, the girls, the lads and the tourists – they all look set to stay for the morning after.Paul Smith: Pablo is touring the UK and Ireland, with its final show at theO2, London, on 13 November.Explore more on these topicsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Structured month by month in rows, it is parma violet, coral pink and butter yellow, and huge – a good metre long, almost the size of the table beneath it.I bought mine online after a friend, who keeps hers Blu-Tacked by her front door, told me half-jokingly: “It’s the only thing between me and a divorce.” Ours is not quite so important. Still, as I wield my felt-tip pen, marking up school plays and holidays with our weird, inscrutable code, I do feel calmer. As if I’m scooping out my brain and smearing it all over the paper, leaving me free to track down more stuff to fill it with.The annual wall planner is not new. Most offices have one, albeit in fiscal reds and blacks. But judging by my neighbours’ walls, these giant, brightly coloured versions are becoming something of a domestic endemic. Ryman has launched a colourful vertical version for a fiver that is presumably for the backs of doors, while Butler & Hill offers a wipe-clean “perpetual wall planner” that can be used year after year. It’s hard to know if they are more popular now than before, but on a recent trawl of Etsy, home of the cute-packaged-as-commerce, I lost track after scrolling through more than 200 versions.View image in fullscreenSarah Jaffe: ‘Just how many ways can we find to overschedule ourselves?’Photograph: Amanda JaffeMichele Ferron started Good Tuesday, which is where I bought my planner, from her home in Cornwall in 2020 during the pandemic. Inspired by theverjaardagskalender, or Dutch birthday calendars traditionally kept in the toilet, she initially printed 10 and sold seven overnight via Etsy. “Then, in 2021, it went wild.”The mother of three now ships thousands to more than 30 countries every year. Customers have told her the calendars have helped their “time blindness” (difficulty in perceiving the passage of time while completing tasks), “executive functioning” (the ability to juggle tasks), and “productivity”. Others even talk about their usefulness in neurodivergent households. Ferron relies on hers for the big stuff rather than the basics: travel, trade shows, festivals. She has ADHD, and says: “It brings calm among the digital overload. When otherwise everything is twirling around, it helps to anchor it all.”There’s too much scheduling. Busyness is too valued in society. All this hyper-productivity isn’t healthyDr Martha Deiros Collado, a psychologist specialising in parenting, and author of the forthcoming book The Smartphone Solution, has two: a weekly planner for her and her husband “which is for art club or PE or any changes to a week” – and a big annual one “for essentials only”, which the children can read (her eldest is six). “It’s a way to ground their anxiety – or their excitement. She [my daughter] can count down how many days until someone’s birthday without asking us every five minutes.”On the one hand, I love my planner. It’s the easiest way for us to navigate the hellscape of the summer holidays – and one damn thing that I haven’t outsourced to my phone. On the other, it can be … well, overwhelming. In February, the weeks stretched out with raw possibility. Yes, I had a root canal, but look at all that recovery time. Four months later, it resembles a magic eye – dizzying and unreadable, except to those fluent in our code. Ours is simple: our initials O and M, which indicate who is working at home, and who is in the office; AS for afterschool – and ASC for clubs (which are somehow different); din for dinner, bday for birthdays (though we rarely specify whose) and long black lines for holidays. But I’ve also heard stories of people marking their family planners by the hour, or adding menstrual cycles (red crosses) and ovulation dates (O, in pink), so the family knows to avoid Mum, or stay out of the bedroom.Sometimes, looking at this record of my family’s life while I eat my Weetabix, I wonder how helpful planners actually are.View image in fullscreenThe Good Tuesday wall planner, which some users say has helped their ‘time blindness’.“There is too much scheduling,” says Collado. “Busyness is too valued in society. All this hyper-productivity – however positive some of it is – over just being present isn’t healthy, particularly for children. We need to protect small moments in life.” Indeed, the moral panic around keeping children occupied with extracurriculars is real; seeing your life writ large like that also has the adverse effect of showing you a Tuesday afternoon woefully unfilled.But so too is the adult equivalent. As I’ve learned, it’s never enough simply to be too busy. Whether you’re posting on social media, or staying late in the office, everyone needs to know how full your life is, otherwise what’s the point?Sarah Jaffe is an American labour journalist and author of the very quotable Work Won’t Love You Back. She thinks the overemphasis on planning started with Covid, which forced parents “to manage the schedule of everyone in the home, whether they were working or not” – though the same could be said for anyone trying (and failing) to have a spontaneous post-work pint or swim in the local pool. Post-pandemic, some aspects of life have returned to normal. But others, such as working from home or hybrid working, have stuck around. “With hybrid working, every day has a new configuration,” says Jaffe. All in all, it’s a toxic combination when it comes to planning your week, let alone year.“Even if you have an unscheduled evening, you still feel the need to fill that,” says Jaffe, who has recently taken up knitting as a way to stop doomscrolling – but even that has become another deadline with which to beat herself. “We are now far more aware of the limit of our free time, which has in a way led us to optimising that too. It’s like, just how many ways can we find to overschedule ourselves?”Jaffe thinks these wall planners have become popular at an interesting time. “We have two things going on concurrently. The fight for the four-day-week, or working less more generally, and the continued emphasis on hustle culture.”In theory, the calendar has skin in both games, she says. One movement is about more free time, the other about time as a shorthand for money/work. Except, she says, just as intimate labour such as childcare and so onblurs the line between what we think should be done for love and what we think should be done for money, “the same blurring of work and home has led us to feel the need to manage and schedule every part of our lives”. There’s an argument that they’re even a little “class-coded”. Obviously, we need to plan things. But a lot of people’s lives and work don’t fall into that same rhythm, she says, such as delivery and Uber drivers and those on zero-hours contracts. “Planning is privileged.”View image in fullscreenWall planners for sale on Etsy.Photograph: EtsyIt’s even, she argues, gender-coded: “Those bright colourful calendars – who are they really for?” Ferron thinks they are simply an extension of interior design. “We tend to curate everything in our homes now, in our lives even, so why not calendars?” she says. But Collado agrees that this stuff tends to fall to the woman, and that’s probably why these calendars are skewed aesthetically towards them. They’re still preferable to anything digital, she says: “Google calendar is fine, but the responsibility of checking it lies with me. Once it’s out in the open, it becomes everyone’s problem. I don’t want to have to carry the load of the family plan.”None of this feels particularly healthy, though. When my partner, who is freelance, looks at it, he can virtually tot up his bank balance. For me, whose work life is more structured, the type is so small I need glasses to read it – and I barely need glasses. No week goes unmarked and however helpful it is to know what lies ahead, when you’ve been up since the crack of dawn ticking things off, the colours can swim.Ultimately, if your calendar is too full, it’s probably because you’re working too much, or struggling for time outside work on account of capitalism exploiting you or, at the very least, as Jaffe puts it, “encouraging a culture which values productivity, in whatever form it takes, over everything else”. She thinks sometimes planners and calendars can “become a sort of metric for business and productivity.” And where productivity can be tracked with increasing accuracy, so too can failure.One friend has a homemade wall planner for just the summer months, which he calls “the 2025 Summer Logistical Nightmare” written in a slasher-film font. Using Post-it notes and pencil, so he can move things round, it reminds me of that insidious practice of decluttering. The more stuff we can remove – or check off – the more in control we feel.Unsurprisingly, Jaffe does not have a wall planner, preferring the relatively old-school combination of a to-do list and Google calendar. “I wish I didn’t [use the latter] but it transfers easily and I have less to pack when I’m travelling,” she says. “In some ways, outsourcing this stuff to Google or planners or whatever, it’s all the same thing.” It’s about streamlining your life so you can be more productive, “usually at work”.Not-planning for us involves rest, pottering about, sitting in pyjamas. Which is why a lot of my calendar is deliberately whiteSo what’s the answer? Collado suggests “planning not planning”. “I plan to not-plan things across the year. Using tape, we will block one weekend a month.” If someone asks them to go for lunch or out that weekend, she simply says that they have plans. “Not-planning for us involves rest, pottering about, sitting in pyjamas. Which is why, when you look at my calendar, a lot is deliberately white.” In this way, the wall planner can be a helpful bouncer-like presence, gatekeeping rare and precious genuinely “free” time. Collado implemented not-planning after the birth of her second child. “My time is more stretched, and if you don’t protect it, before you know it, it’s gone and you become resentful.”You could think of these non-planned moments as fallow time, essential to recovery and long-term health. We all struggle with a work/life balance, and often planning is an essential part of our lives. But so too is having unstructured free time. It may be the only way – at least for parents – to salvage something organic, something spontaneous. We should be more deliberate with our time, not least because I think it would negate our tendency towards cancelling plans – the best-laid plans are usually the first to fall.Sometimes I wonder if it’s all just plain economics, and these planners are barometers of inflation (as they get bigger, the days seem to shrink). If nothing else, seeing ours loom over the family every morning, it reminds us why we chose our work/life/family/everything in the first place. It also serves as a reminder of that old truism about life in early middle age: the days are long but the years, even when they are colour-coded, fly by.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFamilyCoronavirusPsychologyHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That might have been OK when I was a baby, but now I’m 21 I think it’s weird.Mum has this thing about washing and the environment. She has been trying to wash clothes less, and uses these washing bags that capture microplastic fibres to prevent them from going out into the water supply. I support this, but not at the expense of my personal hygiene.She wants our family to only use one or two towels a week, which means the four of us sharing them – my younger brother, Lewis, who is five, my parents and me. I think this is totally gross. Mum says “towels dry, it’s fine” but that’s not true. Bacteria thrives on towels and the idea that a towel is clean just because it has dried misses a crucial point: moisture breeds bacteria, especially in damp, warm environments like bathrooms.I don’t want everyone else’s germs on my body. A towel that’s been used even once can carry a lot of bacteria. Lewis is a messy child. Sharing a towel with him will increase my risk of fungal infections, as he towels after his swimming club. The idea of using his towel is disgusting to me.Mum thinks I’m being a diva, but everyone having their own towel isn’t an indulgence – it keeps us all cleanLike most young women, I have firm boundaries around hygiene. Growing up, I didn’t think much about my mum making us share towels, but I began to notice it when I got older. At 16 I said I didn’t want to do it any more and started using a fresh towel every time I showered – and got told off for it.I then compromised and started using the same towel for a week, thinking it was just for me. But what I didn’t know was that Mum was using the same towel to dry herself and Lewis. When I found out, I freaked out. Now I’ve started hiding my towel in my room so no one else uses it.Mum thinks I’m being a diva, but everyone having their own towel isn’t an indulgence – it keeps us all clean. Using someone else’s dirty towel, even if they are family, is gross.The defence: LynseyI always shared towels with my family growing up – older generations don’t worry about this stuffFrom a mother’s perspective, insisting everyone use a different towel every single day is wasteful. It means more laundry, more water, more electricity, and more mental load. When you’re juggling work, meals, school runs and everything else, having the kids share a clean, dry towel is a simple way to reduce the chaos.It’s not unhygienic if the towel is used on clean, just-showered bodies and hung up to dry between uses. Ava wanted a new towel after every single shower and I told her that was contributing to the destruction of the planet, and not good for my mental health. She said she would wash her own towels but I have yet to see that happen. She always just adds her laundry to my pile and then hopes I won’t notice.Teaching kids to share and not get precious over tiny things builds resilience and cooperationAva’s obsession with personal space is relatively new. She has become more demanding since returning home from university a month ago. I think she’s ready to move out. She’s taken to hiding her towel, but I just think we should share them. If one starts to smell or look questionable I’d wash it sooner, but if it’s dry and clean, it’s fine. I do a regular weekly wash of the towels.I always shared towels with my family growing up. Older generations didn’t think about this stuff – we didn’t have time. There was often only one or two towels to go round, and nobody keeled over from it. My husband and I were sharing towels with Lewis and Ava until she was old enough to start protesting. Teaching kids to share and not get precious over tiny things builds resilience and cooperation. It instills the idea that comfort doesn’t always have to come with individual ownership.Ava isn’t a germaphobe with other things, like sharing my headphones or cleaning up after herself, so I find it funny she has become so obsessive about sharing towels. She needs to remember there’s a difference between good hygiene and becoming germ-obsessed over things that pose little risk.The jury of Guardian readersShould Lynsey give Ava her own towel?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The guilt‑tripping about the planet and mental health seems a bit excessive over this one item.Sofia, 32It’s completely reasonable to ask for a towel for sole use. I understand washing can get overwhelming, but an additional towel for the sake of Ava feeling comfortable and clean is really not a problem.Sam, 30It’s perfectly reasonable for Ava to draw the line at towel-sharing. After all, they don’t just dry you off, they double as exfoliators for dead skin – hardly something you’d want to inherit from anyone, even family. Lynsey should respect that boundary, and, in return, Ava could help with the washing.Matthew, 50I am absolutely with Ava on this one. You dry intimate areas with a towel, the last thing I would want to do is share it with anyone else – even family. I sympathise with Lynsey’s environmental concerns, but surely Ava can have one towel a week for her own personal use.Anna, 45I am an acknowledged towel thief in my family. I think it’s fine to save the environment and the water bill by sharing towels – you’re already clean when you use one, after all.

To me, however, even a whiff of a pornstar martini takes me right back to my waitressing days in the Midlands, and to sticky hands and broken glass after I dropped a tray of four of the damned things. I don’t needa drinks marketing reportto tell me it was the most popular cocktail in 2018; I lived it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The pornstar martini feels like a seedy, hedonistic concoction dreamed up in the 1980s by way of Miami’s South Beach, but it was in fact devised in London, by legendary Ghanaian mixologistDouglas Ankrah, who honed his skills at the Hard Rock Cafe before setting up the fabledLondon Academy of Bartending, or Lab bar, in 1996 (this later led to the launch of Lab Bar on Old Compton Street and later Townhouse in Knightsbridge).Ankrah invented the pornstar martini in 2003, although it was originally called the maverick martini, after a favourite gentleman’s club in Cape Town. His explanation for how he came up with the idea drips with the understatement of a true icon: “I created [it] in 15 minutes or less,”,he once recalled. “Like how Mick and Keith wrote (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction in 10 minutes.” Brilliant!There are myriad rumours as to how the drink got its original name, but Ankrah once divulged in an interview with The Buyer that it was simply his interpretation of what he thought a porn star might like to drink. Give “pornstar martini” a search in your preferred search engine, however, and you’re unlikely to be presented with any of the supermarket offerings; in fact, I can’t be held responsible for what you will come across. These days, however, the drink goes by the rather coyer name “passion fruit martini”.I grumbleda month or so ago about this change of name (if you’re old enough to drink, you’re probably old enough to know what a porn star is, after all) and asked what the reason might be. Turns out, I should have popped my query in the search bar of this very website: in 2019, Marks & Spencer had to rename its bestselling pre-batch cocktail following the upholding of acomplaintby the Portman Group, the UK’s alcohol watchdog. The complaint claimed an association between alcohol and sexual activity or sexual success, a breach of section 3.2d of its code of practice. Fair enough: the association of intoxication with sexual success is a sticky one, let alone a realistic one (am I right, ladies?), but it feels a bit of a shame to erase the well-meaning work of Ankrah, as well as the oldest industry in the world.Four premix passion fruit martinis that are worth a goAll Shook Up Passion Fruit Martini£1.50 (250ml)Tesco, 3.4%.

They have a range of eight to 10 flavours, but the two that dominate are mint andorzata, luminous green and cloudy white syrups respectively, that need diluting with fizzy water and maybe topping up with ice. I have mentioned orzata herebefore, how popular it is in Italy and how the name means a drink made from orzo (barley), and also how at some point the barley was replaced by almonds; then, at another point, the almonds were replaced by deacidified benzoin, which is a balsamic resin obtained from trees of the genusStyraxfrom south-east Asia. Deacidified benzoin is actually delicious and I become dependent on orzata at this time of year, and the sound of the ice clanking against the side of the glass as I walk my cold, cloudy drink back to my hot desk is the sound of summer.However, I have always wondered what orzata made with orzo is like. And finally an opportunity presented itself when, having lifted cooked barley out of the pan with a slotted spoon, I was left with a pan of cloudy water at the back of the stove. I would have thrown it away, if I hadn’t had a glass of orzata on the go. Straight from the pan, the barley water tasted like milk diluted with water, thin porridge and a mouthful of soapy bath water. Undeterred, I consulted Mrs Beeton, who has it inher cooking for invalidssection and suggests adding just lemon zest. Then I looked atthe ancient Roman guide Apicius, who suggests boiling it with prosciutto and adding pepper. I found my answer on an Italian website calledAgrodolceand drained the water, strained it, sweetened it with caster sugar, added a strip of lemon zest, then, for an aesthetic transformation, poured the whole, cloudy lot into an Ikea glass bottle with a stopper. A few hours later, I mixed 50% barley water with 50% fizzy water and added ice and, I have to say, it was fantastic. Yes, ever so slightly soapy still and reminiscent of porridge, but above all like barley, barley sugar and lemon drops, soft, cold and clinking.The thing about making Roddy orzata is that, as a result, you will have 400g cooked barley to deal with – you can use pearl (hulled) or pot. My suggestion is to mix it with roast vegetables: red pepper, tomatoes, onion and aubergine, a few cooked green beans and lots of herbs.While this salad is more than substantial just as it is, it can be bolstered by a tin of chickpeas, white beans or tuna, a few snipped anchovies and a handful of olives. It is also lovely with crumbled cheese (feta or salted ricotta), grilled halloumi or chopped hard-boiled eggs. It is also a patient dish that will sit around at room temperature until you are ready to serve. Just add a little more olive oil, a teaspoon extra of vinegar and toss again before you serve, with an optional glass of orzata on the side.Roast summer vegetable, herb and pearl barley saladServes42 red onions, peeled and sliced into chunky moons1 large red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh cut into short, chunky strips1 aubergine, cut into 2 cm cubes300g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped, or halved cherry tomatoesOlive oilSalt250g pearl barley200g cooked green beans, chopped into little bits (optional)1 big handful fresh mint, basil, parsley, oregano, dill1 tsp red-wine vinegar1 tsp honey vinegar, or other sweet vinegar (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the onion, pepper, aubergine and tomatoes on a baking tray, spoon over four tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle with salt and toss well so all the vegetables glisten. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the vegetables are very soft and golden at the edges; if they are also a bit mushy, that is fine, too.Meanwhile, boil the pearl barley in plenty of salted water for 15-20 minutes, or until al dente, then drain and spread on a plate to cool slightly.Mince the herbs and put them in a large bowl with the lemon zest, three tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspoon of red-wine vinegar and, if you wish, a teaspoon of honey vinegar or other sweet vinegar. Add the pearl barley, roast veg and green beans, if using, and toss well.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkSaladCereals and grainsVegetablesSummer food and drinkSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Three years after we married my wife told me that sex was out of the question as she had married me for companionship not lust. We have two daughters from that first three years. It was her choice to have children. I love my wife and daughters dearly. Since then we have had no intercourse, in fact, no sex play of any type whatsoever. She told me she has no interest and despite years of asking and years of suggesting counselling, she has not accepted either. I am totally destroyed by all of this but can see no course of action. What can I do?Eleanor says:Three options for how sex appears in the rest of your life: you and your wife have sex; you have sex with someone who isn’t your wife; you have no sex ever again. There are no options besides these.How can I stop fixating on my appearance? | Leading questionsRead moreWhat a position to be in! It’s not just about missing out on sex. It’s about feeling as though your wellbeing doesn’t matter very much. It’s about being told you can’t have something valuable to you and then feeling lascivious or base for even valuing it. No wonder you feel destroyed, without something that can make us feel so vital and free, without acknowledgement of how much this affects you.You mentioned asking, and suggesting, counselling. What about – I’m sorry to be bold – straight-ahead curiosity about what she likes?Often when we try to explain a straight woman’s disinterest in sex, we go to slightly pathologised explanations such as body image, trauma, hormones or pelvic issues. Surprisingly low on the list is the hypothesis that so far, sex hasn’t felt good. A variety of bummers conspire to make a great deal of heterosexual sex unenjoyable. A variety of additional bummers conspire to make it hard to say so. Consequently lots of women who have no barriers to enjoying sex nonetheless find they never want it, because “sex” has come to mean“an unenjoyable experience in which I feel alienated from my body and under politeness-pressure to pretend”. Hard to explain what a wretched feeling this is. Really imagine pretending to be turned on by penetration you’re not enjoying. Imagine the invitation to do so again.Of course, I have no idea whether this is happening for your wife. Even if it is, that doesn’t mean you’re a bad or negligent lover or you’ve done anything wrong. Part of the tragedy is thateven witha maximally attentive partner, lots of women don’t have the knowledge or self-authorisation to saywhat might feel good. You can’t share what you can’t even articulate to yourself. Our collective sexual landscape isso mean and negligent to straight womenthat it can end up feeling easier to say “no touching” to your monogamous spouse of decades than to wonder what kind of touch might actually feel enjoyable. Talk about perverse.I want a relationship, not out of love or passion, but out of fear of the future. Is this selfish? | Leading questionsRead moreIf –big if – this plays a role for your wife, things will only change if she gets reason to hope sex might be different. A person who never wants to do something again is a person completely confident of what that activity will feel like.There are greatbooksandpodcastsandapps, if counselling feels too remote. But the very first step might be changing the goal. It can’t feel like “sex” is the goal. She has decided she doesn’t want sex, so if every conversation feels like a bid to get there, she has no reason to join in. The goal could just be understanding. “I want us to really hear each other, whatever we decide to do.” She might not understand all that sex is to you, besides “lust” – a longing many of us are raised to view as a vice. For you sex might be a way of saying I feel safe with you, I want you, I trust you – but you might not understand what sex is to her either. This gap in understanding might be why it has come to seem hopeless. Bridging this gap can be its own form of intimacy.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsRelationshipsSexMarriagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The opening of Austria’sSemmering railwayin 1854, the Mont Cenis route (also known as Fréjus) between France and Italy in 1871 and Switzerland’s Gotthard tunnel in 1882 defined the broad contours of Alpine railway geography in the late 19th century. But Habsburg planners were keen to secure better links with Adriatic ports, so in 1901 they sketched out a bold plan for the Neue Alpenbahnen (new Alpine railways), of which Austria’s Tauern railway was the most important. It opened in 1909. When it closed for rebuilding in November 2024, it was a sharp reminder of how much passengers and freight rely on a handful of key Alpine rail routes. Lose one key Alpine link and the effects of that closure are felt across Europe.View image in fullscreenEmperor Franz Joseph of Austria at the inauguration of the Tauern electrified mountain line in 1909.Photograph: Photo 12/Photo12/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe last couple of years have been tough for Alpine rail operators. Landslides, floods and derailment have played havoc on the lines. So three cheers for the more recent good news stories. The important Mont Cenis route reopened this spring, having been shut after a landslide in August 2023 (though there was a wobble last week when another landslide briefly interrupted services). That closure necessitated the cancellation of all high-speed trains between France and Italy. These links have now been restored, allowing travellers this summer to speed from Paris to Turin in just 5hrs 40mins, or from Lyon to Milan in under five hours.New services on classic railwaysOther major Alpine routes welcomed new long-distance trains this summer. On the Brenner route from Austria into Italy, a new seasonal Railjet service now runs from Munich right through to the Adriatic port of Ancona. Since late June, the famous Semmering railway has seen new direct trains from Warsaw to Rijeka which slip by dead of night through the Austrian Alps – 20 hours from the Polish capital to the Croatian coast. Last month also saw the celebrated Gotthard route hosting a new daytime train from Zürich to Pisa, an eight-hour journey that takes in not merely the Alps but also some glorious Ligurian coastal scenery along the way.View image in fullscreenThe Adriatic port of Ancona, Italy, where tourists can disembark courtesy of a new rail service from Munich.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesBut the best is yet to come. The Tauern railway will reopen on 14 July. The return of this major rail axis through the Austrian Alps has had a transformative effect on European rail timetables, as many key trans-Alpine train services are restored. Overnight services from Stuttgart andSalzburgto Venice, suspended since last year with the Tauern closure, return from 14 July. So does the Nightjet from Munich to Rome.It is remarkable how the loss of one key rail link can reshape European geography. During the Tauern closure, journeys from Switzerland and southern Germany to Slovenia have been slower. Within Austria, Salzburg andCarinthiawill be happily reconnected with the reopening of the railway. Trains will again glide from Salzburg to the lovely Carinthian city of Villach in just 2hrs 32mins, from where there are good onward connections to Slovenia and Italy.View image in fullscreenThe Austrian Alps overlooking the Carinthian city of Villach.Photograph: Ewa Olek/Getty ImagesThe Tauern railway is an old-style main line carrying a mixture of freight and passenger services. It was never designed for high speed and the scenery is too good to rush. So the fact that even the fastest trains average under 50mph is a blessing.Salzburg to VillachThe debut southbound passenger train through the restored Tauern tunnel is an Intercity scheduled to leave Salzburg at 06.12 on 14 July. And here’s hoping for good (but not too hot) weather on that Monday, as the Tauern railway is at its best on a sunny summer morning. The railway cuts up the Salzach valley from Salzburg, the scenery initially revealing little of the drama that lies ahead. It is only beyond Schwarzach that the hills close in and the railway presses south, with the great wall of the Tauern Alps ahead. The last stop before the Tauern tunnel isBad Gastein, a remarkable Habsburg-era spa town with belle epoque charm. It is a great spot to break the journey and enjoy the mountain air, or the town’s radon-rich spa tradition.View image in fullscreen‘A great spot to break the journey’ … the Habsburg-era spa town of Bad Gastein.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesContinuing beyond Bad Gastein, the railway plunges into the Tauern tunnel. This is one of the shortest of the great Alpine rail tunnels and there is just seven minutes of darkness before the train emerges into Carinthian sunshine, with the landscape now hinting at a more southern demeanour. I love this stretch, as the railway drops down towards the Möll valley, following the latter down towards the River Drau, which is crossed just after stopping at Spittal. After bridging the Drau, sit on the right for great views of the river, as the railway parallels it downstream to Villach.Here the Drau is just in its infancy; but further down its long course it becomes the Drava and flows east to join the Danube, on the border between Croatia and Serbia. It is a river which has shaped European history, just as the Tauern railway has shaped travel patterns through the Alps.View image in fullscreenThe construction site for a high-speed line between Lyon and Turin, in Avrieux, France in 2023.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesBjörn Bender, CEO ofRail Europe, captures the huge sense of relief across the wider European rail industry when he says: “The Tauern tunnel reopening is so important, as it’s a key route for trains from Bavaria to Slovenia. It is also used by travellers heading through the Alps to north-east Italy. The Austrian province of Carinthia becomes so much more accessible again. And the Tauern reopening on 14 July is just the prelude of more good things to come. In December the new Koralm tunnel opens, cutting journey times between Vienna and Klagenfurt, the provincial capital of Carinthia.”Tickets from Salzburg to Villach via the Tauernrailway cost from £9 oneway (increasing to £13.50 or £18 once £9 tickets are sold out) fromRail Europe.

But the sprawling murder scene in the hills and fields around Srebrenica continues to cough up its bones.In the town of Bratunac, 6 miles (10km) north of Srebrenica town, a group burial was performed recently of victims’ remains that had been identified over the course of the preceding year. Imams gathered from across the country to pray before a line of six coffins draped in the blue and gold Bosnian flag.A crowd of about a thousand Bosnian Muslims gathered in the surrounding graveyard, where a backhoe had carved out six new holes, one of them just a small trench to accommodate the body of a one-year-old, Almera Paraganlija, killed alongside her mother, Zineta, by Bosnian Serb gunmen when they rampaged through the village of Joševa.View image in fullscreenBosnian Muslims gather for a funeral in Bratunac of six people killed.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianHajrudin Paraganlija, husband to Zineta and father to Almera, stood at the graveside to see them buried finally, more than 30 years after he last held them in his arms.“It is a kind of peace to at least know where they are,” he said, though his sunken cheeks and unfocused stare did not look like those of a man at peace; rather one hollowed out by grief. His mother and brother’s bodies have yet to be found.He lingered by the graves before following the rest of the crowd down a narrow road that leads from the Muslim cemetery to Bratunac’s main road. Serb police kept the traffic moving but otherwise there was no interaction with the mourners as they boarded buses to leave town. Local Serbs went about their business without making eye contact. It was as if the mourners, having buried their dead, had themselves become invisible as ghosts.Most of the Serb population came to Bratunac from elsewhere in Bosnia after the town’s Muslim population was killed or driven out. Many of them occupy the homes of the dead. The genocide is not a subject of conversation, though the town and the whole valley leading up to Srebrenica has an infamous place in the history books.More than 8,000 men and boys (almost all Bosniaks – Bosnian Muslims) were killed here within a few days following 11 July 1995, when Bosnian Serb forces seized control of the area, supposedly a UN-protected haven. Many thousands of Bosniaks had been murdered over the preceding three years of war in this part of the north-eastern corner of the country, but the scale and speed of the Srebrenica slaughter finally shocked the world into decisive action to end the conflict.View image in fullscreenWomen pray at the collective funeral for those whose remains have finally been identified.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianBratunac and Srebrenica now lie within the boundary of a Bosnian Serb statelet, Republika Srpska, created by theDayton peace agreement, which ended the war in November 1995. The Republika Srpska runs the local police and flies Serb flags across the region. Its leaders do not just deny the genocide, they glorify the killers.“The complete silence that came after the war has evolved into literally celebrating genocide,” said Hariz Halilovich, a Srebrenica-born author, anthropologist and professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. “And it’s not some kind of isolated hate speech that happens here and there. It has gradually become completely mainstream.”Last year, Halilovich published a study of all the popular Serb songs that celebrate the genocide. One calls for the Srebrenica massacre to be “three times repeated” and includes the couplet: “Sleep peacefully, Fato, everyone of yours has been slaughtered / Only Mujo is not, he is hanging by the gate”, using diminutives of common Muslim names to taunt the survivors.View image in fullscreenAlmera Paraganlija, an infant killed in 1992, is buried at the memorial centre.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The Guardian“What is shocking is how these triumphalist songs are performed at christenings, weddings and birthday parties – not at some remote, closed off place by hardcore nationalists,” Halilovich said.The Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has called the genocide an “arranged tragedy”, claiming that many of the dead were in reality still alive.At the Bratunac funerals in May, the survivor who gave the oration focused on the environment of denial as an existential threat, a potential second genocide.“The voices of our dead have not faded away. They are still with us, and they are asking us not to stay silent while the crime of denial is everywhere in institutions around us,” she said.The speaker was Almasa Salihović, whose elder brother Abdulah was killed in the 1995 Srebrenica atrocities. The family have had to bury him twice, as different parts of his body have been found.View image in fullscreenThe Srebrenica Memorial Centre, where thousands of Bosnian Muslims killed in the genocide are buried.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianView image in fullscreenSome of the exhibits at the Srebrenica Memorial Centre.Photograph: Julian Borger/The GuardianIn their initial effort to cover up the 1995 genocide, Serb forces dug up one set of mass graves and moved the remains to others. They did it in a hurry with hulking mechanical diggers that cut through bodies and jumbled up the bones, making theprocess of finding and identifying victimsendlessly complex and agonising.Mass killings came to this north-eastern corner of Bosnia in two main waves. The first was in 1992 in the form of a rapid series of coordinated surprise attacks on Muslim villages and towns, as the dictator in Belgrade, Slobodan Milošević, tried to carve out a Greater Serbia. The Paraganlija family, buried 33 years later in Bratunac, were among the victims.The survivors of those massacres took shelter in Srebrenica, an old silver-mining town, which was declared a UN-protected “safe area” in April 1993.Almasa Salihović was six when her family walked through forests at night to reach Srebrenica.View image in fullscreenAlmasa Salihović, whose elder brother Abdulah was killed in the 1995 Srebrenica atrocities.Photograph: Handout“I remember my sister pulling me along because you had to go uphill a lot so my arms were hurting so much,” she said. What she recalls most of the two years under the watch of blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers was the hunger. The area was surrounded by Serb forces and food arrived erratically, mostly by airdrop.At 3am on 6 July 1995, the second wave of killings arrived. The illusion of UN protection crumbled when the Bosnian Serb army under GenRatko Mladićbegan an attack on the Srebrenica “safe area”. The Dutch UN battalion guarding the zone gave up its outposts in the face of the offensive, while many of the Muslim men of the area fled into the woods. The civilians left behind in the outlying villages fled to Srebrenica town and ultimately to the Dutch UN headquarters, a battery factory in a place called Potočari, farther north on the road to Bratunac.Almasa’s elder brother and sister, Abdulah and Fatima, managed to cling to the side of UN trucks as they withdrew to Potočari. They were among the local population allowed inside. Almasa, her mother and her other two siblings followed by foot. By the time they arrived late on 11 July, the gates of the battery factory were closed and they had to camp outside.View image in fullscreenThe coffins of the six latest victims to be identified are carried at their long-awaited funeral.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianSerb forces took control of Potočari the next day, walking through the crowd, pulling away for interrogation men and teenage boys who never returned. Women, young children and elderly people were put on buses to territory controlled by the Bosnian army.On Thursday 13 July, it was the turn of those inside the battery factory. The Serbs ordered them to walk out in pairs, and the Dutch soldiers gave them up and allowed them to be seized. Abdulah and Fatima walked out together, but 18-year-old Abdulah was grabbed and made to stand with other men and boys. He was later killed in one of the execution sites near the border town of Zvornik.The battery factory at Potočari is now the Srebrenica Memorial Centre, where artefacts have been placed in cavernous halls, next to the carcasses of socialist-era heavy machinery. Traces of the Dutch peacekeeper presence have been preserved including vicious graffiti about Bosnian girls left by soldiers who were supposed to protect them.Occasionally, Dutch veterans revisit the site of one of the most shameful chapters in their country’s military history. One recently pointed out a macabre remnant that had not been noticed before: ropes on an elevated level of one of the factory halls, with which some local girls had tried to hang themselves rather than surrender themselves to the waiting Serbs.View image in fullscreenSurvivors and relatives touch the grave of their loved one.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianTheSrebrenica Memorial Centrestands like a small rocky island in a sea of denials, constantly buffeted by hostile waves. It was forced to close down in March afterDodik threatened to drive out Bosnian state authoritiesand force through secession.The centre reopened after the immediate threat of a coup passed, but in the surrounding area, evidence of the genocide is being rubbed away. One of the execution sites, an oldagricultural warehouse in Kravica, has been refurbished, the pockmarks from the machine guns plastered over. It is now inaccessible behind locked gates, and a chained dog barks at anyone who tries to approach.Last October, there was even an attempt to erase the centre’s existence online, when it was identified on Google Maps as “Ratko Mladić Park” for several days before the hack was discovered.In such a hostile environment, the act of remembrance is a struggle. DNA analysis has been used on an unprecedented scale, identifying each body part as it is found.In an expanded exhibit covering 4,300 sq metres in preparation to mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide on 11 July, the focus is on the personal effects unearthed among the bones, and the stories they tell about the dead.View image in fullscreenSrebrenica now lies within Republika Srpska.Photograph: Damir Šagolj/The GuardianA watch, a belt, a pair of glasses, a notebook, a favourite football shirt and an identity card are some of the glass-case exhibits, each suspended from wires in front of white curtain imprinted with images of their owners. In a next-door room video screens show surviving relatives explain the significance of each object and what it says about their murdered loved one.In Abdulah Salihović’s case, the chosen object is a still from a video of him as a schoolboy, giving a presentation to his class. The linked testimony is from his sister Fatima, who walked with him out of the battery factory on that day in July 1995, which they both knew would be the last time they would see each other. At the very last moment of that, she could no longer bear the strain.‘We know what is happening, we cannot walk away’: how the Guardian bore witness to horror in former Yugoslavia – podcastRead more“I walked with him all the time, and then asked my friend Nihada … to walk with him behind me. I would walk in front,” she says inthe recorded testimony, forced out through sobs. “I’ll never forgive myself for doing that.”In another hall of exhibits, there is a long parade of battered shoes which belonged to the thousands of men and boys who tried to escape through the forest in July 1995 and who were mowed down in ambushes.Their footwear and other personal effects have been collected meticulously by the Srebrenica Memorial Centre’s curators, walking through the woods and fields repeatedly with metal detectors and GPS equipment.“It’s a struggle to get these things,” Emir Suljagić, the centre’s manager, said, pointing out that many of the objects were evidence in investigations of the many crimes that constituted the overall genocide.“These artefacts, in some cases, are probably the only physical proof of someone’s existence,” Suljagić said. “They speak for life, they speak for death, they speak for everything in between.

It has been a fundamental illustration of man’s inhumanity to man, or, more precisely, it has shown just how self-serving and lacking in regard for employees senior managers have been and continue to be.Marina Hyde (Innocent subpostmasters went to jail, but now it is clear: the Post Office boss class belong there instead, 8 July) chilled my blood to the bone in describing how a postmistress made 256 calls to the helpdesk, but was still prosecuted and incarcerated, and missed her daughter’s 18th birthday while in prison. She then had to endure her daughter’s death a year later. Who on earth was so uninterested in the reason for so many calls, was so callous that they sat by while the postmistress was prosecuted?Hyde says thePost Officebosses should go to jail. This one example of their failure to question why so many employees were experiencing serious Horizon problems, their callous indifference, the industrial-scale cover-up, not to mention their collective amnesia of events during the inquiry, leads to only one conclusion – those bosses must be prosecuted and incarcerated.John RobinsonLichfieldCommentary on the Horizon scandal has focused on the shortcomings of Fujitsu and of the Post Office. I suggest the British judiciary must also take some responsibility. Something like1,000 peoplewere brought before the courts, charged with stealing huge sums of money. There was no direct evidence against them. No one could show where the money had gone; there was no sign of the accused people developing an expensive lifestyle – most could not even afford lawyers to defend them. The only evidence came from a software system that could not be cross-examined.Why did the judges allow these cases to proceed? They must, or should, have known about the hundreds of almost identical cases being prosecuted across the country. What has become of the principle of being judged guilty beyond reasonable doubt?Alan RobinsonGriffydam, LeicestershireThis debacle has ruined so many lives and the perpetrators have yet to face any meaningful sanctions beyond public ignominy. Do we really have to wait for completion of the public inquiry before criminal proceedings can be started? The government should be ashamed at dragging its feet and further punishing the victims with the snail’s pace of agreeing compensation.David FeltonWistaston, CheshireWasn’t there at least one person in the Post Office hierarchy who thought, “Hang on a minute, aren’t there a disproportionate number of people suddenly apparently stealing?” Or were they all so in thrall to new technology, and being courted byFujitsu, that common sense flew out the window?Terry StoneSouthend-on-Sea, EssexMarina Hyde’s review of the scandal was, again, upsetting. A year or so ago, I felt it necessary to email Fujitsu’s CEO, Takahito Tokita. I said his company should provide immediate and substantial compensation as a matter of honour, but primarily because it was at fault. I’m still awaiting a reply.Paul GarrodSouthsea, HampshireWhat we didn’t learn from the inquiry report – where did the money go(Post Office Horizon IT scandal: five things we learned from the report, 8 July)?Sarah Walker and Barrie de LaraNorwichHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Our local environment is challenged by fly-tipping and vandalism, with which our austerity-struck council and services cannot keep up. A high proportion of our local residents cannot afford days out, let alone holidays when they might take their children swimming in the sea.This doesn’t mean that people don’t want cleaner rivers and nature protection, but it does mean that increasing their trust in the government would need an end to the two-child benefit cap, employment rights for all, energy tariffs that favour low users, affordable housing and transport, and councils that can invest in things such as parks and street cleaning.Reed seems to be living in a different world.

Tax all UK citizens wherever they live on their global income and assets. The US and Australia already do this, so it is hardly radical. And treat all owners of UK residential property as domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. Might even bring down London house prices.Matthew AthaLiverpoolThe study that shows a link between slower cognitive decline in old age and ownership of dogs or cats (5 July) will certainly not be a surprise to most pet owners.

When I was a child, my dad spent a two-week holiday not shaving and ended up with a five o’clock shadow. By coincidence, my uncle grew a bushy forest on his face during the same period. Faced with my uncle’s success, my dad promptly shaved his own attempt off and it was never spoken of again.Years later, I was bewildered by my dad’s really quite hostile reaction when I successfully gave facial hair a go for the first time. Then I remembered.David GrayBirminghamMy late husband had a beard when we met in 1966, and I only saw him clean-shaven in old photographs. It was a full beard, befitting a geologist who had spent time in the field without a mirror. It was regarded with suspicion by Scottish farmers; one even offered to shear him with his sheep. At the time, beards were associated with artists and revolutionaries.

The policy was upheld by the Lausanne-based court of arbitration for sport in 2019, and then by a Swiss federal tribunal in 2020, leading Semenya to take her long-running battle against the regulationsto the European court.On Thursday Semenya welcomed the European court’s decision, describing it as “great for me, great for athletes” as she spoke to reporters outside the court. “We need to respect athletes, we need to put their rights first,” said the 34-year-old.Caster Semenya: ‘How would I label myself? I’m an African. I’m a woman. I’m a different woman’Read moreThe decision does not changethe rulesthat effectively ended her career after she won two Olympics and three world titles. The court said it could not uphold anearlier findingby a lower chamber that Semenya had been the victim of discrimination, deeming the complaints inadmissible as they did not fall under Switzerland’s jurisdiction.But it handed her a partial victory in finding that the case required a “rigorous judicial review” as there were serious personal rights at risk and the Swiss federal court’s review had “fallen short of that requirement”. It ordered Switzerland to pay the athlete €80,000 (£69,000) for her expenses.The decision paves the way for the case to be sent back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne for reconsideration.Between 2011 and 2015, Semenya complied with a process set out by track and field’s governing body, taking medication to lower her testosterone levels. She later likened it to being used as a “human guinea pig”, saying she had grappled with side effects such as constant sickness, panic attacks and soreness even as she continued to win titles.Track authorities have argued that the limits on testosterone levels are necessary and reasonable to maintain fairness in women’s track events. Their critics say there is a lack of scientific research to support this view.View image in fullscreenCaster Semenya won gold in the 800m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter the governing body for track and field formalised its policy on testosterone levels in 2018, Semenya refused to comply, leaving her ineligible to compete. On Thursday, the governing body, WorldAthletics, did not respond to the European court’s decision.The consequences of Semenya’s legal battle could reverberate across the sports world as it dovetails with the International Olympic Committee’sconsideration of whetherto reintroduce some means of gender testing.The link was emphasised by Semenya last month in an interview with a South African newspaper. “It’s a battle for human rights now,” she said. “It’s not about competing. It’s about putting athletes’ rights first. It’s about the protection of athletes.”In 2023, Human Rights Watchdescribed the rulesthat Semenya had been subject to as “degrading and invasive of privacy, on grounds that are scientifically contested”.The regulations were incompatible with respect for women’s rights, and the freedom to live without cruel, discriminatory and degrading treatment, it added. “International sporting bodies set regulations with scant regard for international human rights norms, as if they are exempt from human rights standards.”On Thursday, Semenya, who dominated her sport between 2009 and 2019 despite the scrutiny over her gender, vowed that her battle would continue. “The fight will never be over,” she told reporters. “As long as we have injustice, we fight till the court.”Explore more on these topicsCaster SemenyaAthleticsSouth AfricaAfricaEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

In Uganda, the 2023Anti-Homosexuality Acthas “intensified the proscription of same-sex relations”, andGhana has moved in a similar directionwith the reintroduction of legislation that would increase sentences for gay sex.The crackdown on gay rights comes as the fight against HIV/Aids has beenhit by abrupt US funding cuts, which have combined with “unprecedented” humanitarian challenges and climate crisis shocks to jeopardise hopes of ending the global epidemic this decade, UNAids said.Several groups of people, known as “key populations”, are more likely to be infected with HIV. They include sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, transgender people, and those in prisons and other enclosed settings.In 2025, only eight of 193 countries did not criminalise any of those groups or behaviours, or criminalise non-disclosure of HIV status, exposure or transmission, according to the report.The number of people infected by HIV or dying from Aids-related causes in 2024 was the lowest for more than 30 years,according to the UNAids annual report, at 1.3 million and 630,000 respectively.View image in fullscreenMosele Mothibi, an HIV-positive unemployed garment worker from Maseru, Lesotho, has had her medications reduced after cuts to USAID.Photograph: Per-Anders Pettersson/Getty ImagesProgress was uneven – ranging from a 56% fall in infections since 2010 in sub-Saharan Africa to a 94% increase in the Middle East and North Africa. But coupled with scientific advances –such as twice-yearly drugs to prevent infection– the world had the “means and momentum” to end Aids as a public health threat by 2030,an internationally agreed goal, it said.However, that has been “seriously jeopardised” in the early months of this year after sweeping US aid cuts that could undo decades of progress. In January,Donald Trump cut funding that had underpinned much of the global HIV responsealmost overnight.The report highlights HIV-prevention services as an area of concern, with many particularly reliant on donor funding. The reported number of people receiving preventive drugs inNigeriain November 2024 was approximately 43,000. By April 2025, that number had fallen to below 6,000.Activists say access to prevention will be a particular issue for key populations, who may not be able to access mainstream healthcare due to factors such as stigma or fear of prosecution, but relied on donor-funded community clinics that have now closed.UNAids chief ‘shaken and disgusted’ by US cuts that will mean millions more deathsRead moreKey populations were “always left behind”, said Dr Beatriz Grinsztejn, president of the International Aids Society (IAS).The report is being released before an IAS conference next week in Kigali, Rwanda, where researchers will share data on the impact of cuts.Modelling by Bristol University calculated that a one-year halt in US funding for preventive drugs in key populations in sub-Saharan Africa would mean roughly 700,000 people no longer used them, and lead to about10,000 extra cases of HIV over the next five years.UNAids modelling suggests that without any replacement for funding from US Pepfar (president’s emergency plan for Aids relief), an additional 4m deaths and 6m new infections could be expected globally by 2029.However,Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids, said 25 of the 60 low- and middle-income countries included in the report had found ways to increase HIV spending from domestic resources to 2026. “This is the future of the HIV response – nationally owned and led, sustainable, inclusive and multisectoral,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAids and HIVGlobal healthUnited NationsUSAIDAfricaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

These are considered critical to US security, but the global supply chains for them are dominated by China.Other nations are offering exclusive access to ports, military bases and rare earths in exchange for US support.Although Global Witness said the revolving door between governments and lobbyists was nothing new, the organisation said it was concerned by the broader, exploitative dynamics driving new deals.Stewart said: “We’re seeing a dramatic cut in aid, combined with an explicit rush for critical minerals, and willingness by theTrump administrationto secure deals in exchange for aid or military assistance.“Dealmaking needs to be transparent and fair. It is vital to recognise the role that international aid plays in making a safer world for all, and that aid should retain its distinct role away from trade.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAidUSAIDLobbyingDonald TrumpTariffsSomalianewsShareReuse this content"

The next morning he was tortured while a commanding officer filmed proceedings.He was lucky to get out alive: at least 10 people have been killed by security officials since protests began in June calling for the resignation of the small west African country’s president, Faure Gnassingbé.“From this bitter experience, it is clear that the Togolese regime is prepared to commit the worst atrocities to retain power,” said Bandiangou, a 24-year-old student union president at the University of Lomé.With the exception of a three-month period in 2005, Togo has been ruled by the Gnassingbés since 1967, when Faure Gnassingbé’s father, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, took power in a bloodless coup.In February, the government hosted a flamboyant $34m memorial service for Eyadéma, who died in 2005. Observers said the ceremony, attended by five former African presidents, served as a lavish statement of the dynasty’s enduring power.Then in May, Gnassingbé’s power was further consolidated when he was sworn in as “president of the council of ministers”, a new post that is not subject to term limits. The swearing-in was the culmination of a process that began in March last year when parliament amended the constitution, without a referendum, to do away with presidential elections – a move described by the Touche Pas à Ma Constitution coalition as “a coup against the Togolese people”.The price of dissentThough the memorial service and constitutional changes struck a nerve with young people in Togo who want political change, the spark for the recent protests was the arrest of Tchala Essowè Narcisse, a popular rapper known as Aamron, on 26 May.View image in fullscreenA still from Aamron’s video Nouveaux DossiersPhotograph: Aaamron/YoutubeAamron has built a following on TikTok, and his songs denounce corruption, economic stagnation and state neglect. His arrest followed a satirical call for a mobilisation to mark Gnassingbé’s birthday.According to Célestin Kokou Agbogan, his lawyer and the president of Togo’s Human Rights League, Aamron was arrested without a warrant and held incommunicado for 10 days. A video clip then surfaced in which, appearing disoriented, he claimed the state had labelled him mentally unstable and had detained him in a psychiatric facility in Zébé, just outside Lomé.Agbogan said no official charges had been filed. The opposition alliance Dynamics for Majority of the People condemned the arrest as “unlawful, unjustified, and driven by political motives” and has called for Aamron’s immediate and unconditional release.In the days after his disappearance, fans flooded social media with clips of his defiant lyrics. Then they took to the streets of Lomé, barricading roads, burning tyres and chanting “Libérez Aamron!” and “Togo Libre!”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators in Lomé clash with police during a protest calling for the president’s resignation.Photograph: Erick Kaglan/AP“Since Faure Gnassingbé became president, any opinion that does not praise him is seen as a crime,” Bandiangou said. “He systematically imprisons all dissenting voices. Aamron’s arrest was … one too many.”Bandiangou said his aim was to mobilise people in an attempt to end the practice of arbitrary imprisonment and allow political prisoners to regain their freedom.Protesters have paid a steep price for their dissent: more than 100 have been arrested since June, and some are still missing. Amnesty International said last week it had interviewed victims and witnesses who described a series of abuses by security forces against demonstrators, including acts of torture.On 1 July, the Economic Community of West African States urged restraint and called for dialogue. Otherwise, international reaction has been muted, drowned out by geopolitical crises elsewhere.Nevertheless, diaspora communities and human rights groups are attempting to ramp up pressure on the regime, demanding sanctions and diplomatic scrutiny.‘Our message was clear’Experts say beneath the anger at the constitutional changes lies a deeper well of frustration over corruption and nepotism that has been exacerbated by a scarce jobs market and a rise in the cost of living.View image in fullscreenTogo’s president, Faure Gnassingbé. His family has ruled Togo almost exclusively since 1967.Photograph: Lewis Joly/APProtests have erupted periodically for decades – usually over delayed elections, term extensions and heavy-handed crackdowns – but there are signs that discontent is widening.Civil society groups and opposition parties held demonstrations on three consecutive days in late June over a planned pan-Africanist conference – later cancelled – that they claimed would whitewash the latest power grab, while protests have also broken out in recent weeks over electricity price rises.“Young people are exasperated by shortsighted and aimless governance, and by being held hostage by a regime incapable of providing the population with the basic necessities of life,” said Bandiangou. “Our message is clear: we no longer want a regime that imprisons our dreams and has terrorised an entire people for nearly six decades.”Explore more on these topicsTogoAfricaProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.“This Trial should not be taking place,” Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social on Wednesday. “It is a witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”He said the 50% tariffs on Brazil would be “separate from all sectoral tariffs”.After the news, Brazil’s real currency added to earlier losses to fall more than 2% against the dollar.Brazil’s president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, rejected Trump’s demand that legal proceedings against Bolsonaro be dropped and his claim that a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports was necessary to close a trade deficit that does not, in fact, exist.Ina statementposted on social media and his government’s website, the Brazilian president responded, point by point, to the claims made by Trump in a letter addressed to him earlier on Wednesday.“Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,” Lula began.He then pointed out that the charges against Bolsonaro, for allegedly plotting to remain in power after losing his bid for re-election, “fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil’s judicial branch and, as such, are not subject to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national institutions”.Trump also objected to Brazil’s supreme court fining of social media companies such as Twitter/X, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to “SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders”. Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to US companies.Lula also rejected Trump’s claim that Brazil’s efforts to regulate the operations of US social media platforms on its territory in accordance with its own laws are a form of censorship.“Brazilian society rejects hateful content, racism, child pornography, scams, fraud, and speeches against human rights and democratic freedom” Lula wrote. “In Brazil, freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practices. All companies – whether domestic or foreign – must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.”The US president had beenscheduled to hike tariffson dozens of countries on Wednesday. Earlier this week he announced a fresh three-week delay, to 1 August, but started announcing new rates that countries would face unless they strike a deal with the White House.After announcing plans on Monday forUS tariffs of up to 40%on goods imported from 14 countries, including Bangladesh, Japan and South Korea, Trump wrote to the leaders of more countries on Wednesday, and published each letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A string of delays and rate changes have frustrated businesses in the US and around the world.On Tuesday, Trump vowed to introduce US tariffs of up to 200% on foreign drugs and 50% on copper,propelling US prices of the latterto record highs.But appearing alongside the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House on Wednesday, the president indicated that the five African nations were unlikely to face US tariffs as they intended to lower their own tariffs on US exports.The US president’s latest threats have heightened fears that his erratic trade strategy risks exacerbating inflation across the US, having repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to bring down prices rapidly.Trump appears aware of this apprehension. “I brought down costs more than any President in recorded history,” he wrote on social media late on Tuesday. “The Crooked Democrats are using the opposite narrative, even though they know it is a total LIE.”Analysis by Oxford Economics indicated that the US effective tariff rate on imports from overseas would rise to about 20% after the latest tariff letters. “That is up from 17% but less than our recession threshold of 25%-28%,” said Michael Pearce, its deputy US economist at Oxford Economics.“Our assumption is that most countries will secure a deal or extension to avoid tariff increases,” said Pearce. “However, the risks are skewed toward higher rates.”While Trump and his allies have sought to pressure the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, the central bank’s top officials – led by its chair, Jerome Powell – have so far refused, as they wait to see the impact of his tariffs on the economy.Minutes taken from the Fed’s latest rate-setting meeting, released on Wednesday, disclosed that only “a couple” of its officials said they felt interest rates could fall as soon as its next meeting, later this month.“Most participants” at the Fed meeting – at which rates werekept on hold last month– anticipated rate cuts later this year, according to the minutes, with any price shock caused by Trump’s tariffs expected to be “temporary or modest”.Robert Mackey contributed reportingThis article was amended on 10 July 2025. An earlier version said that section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 applied to companies with trade practices that are deemed unfair to US companies; that should have said countries.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvanewsShareReuse this content"

She has been living with her son since.On Thursday, she was told she had failed a visa character check and was taken to Bankstown police station and then transferred to Villawood detention centre, Mohammed said.Maha Almassri, 61, was woken by 15 police officers at her son’s home at about 5.30am on Thursday, her cousin says.In a document seen by Guardian Australia, Almassri was told her visa had been cancelled “personally” by the assistant minister for citizenship and cultural affairs and that the minister “reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test” and was “satisfied that the cancellation was in the national interest”.According to the Migration Act, a person does not pass the character test if they have been assessed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) to be a direct or indirect risk to security.A separate document seen by the Guardian suggested Almassri was granted a bridging visa in June last year after applying for a protection visa.The grandmother has more than 100 Australian relatives living across the country, Mohammed said. His Australianchildren were evacuated from Rafahin March last year.He said security checks were made on her by both Australian and Israeli authorities before she was granted a visa and cleared to leave Gaza, and that her age made her an unlikely threat to Australian national security.“She’s an old lady, what can she do?” he said. “What’s the reason? They have to let us know why this has happened. There is no country, no house, nothing [to go back to in Gaza].”He said his cousin was in poor health and frightened.“She was sleeping [when the raid happened]. She couldn’t walk, she was so scared.”He said he tried to talk over the phone to Maha in Villawood on Thursday afternoon but she was unable to speak through tears.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Battisson questioned where a Palestinian from Gaza would return to if forced to leave Australia.“It’s a Palestinian grandma.

Warnings were made via a prior suicide or suicide attempt, advice from their own staff or recommendations from coroners and other independent bodies.Guardian Australia also logged how many of the 57 inmates were deemed at risk of self-harm or had attempted suicide before they were sent into cells with known hanging points.In adherence with best practice in reporting on this topic, Guardian Australia has avoided detailed descriptions of suicide. In some instances, so that the full ramifications of coronial recommendations can be understood, we have made the decision to identify types and locations of ligature points. We have done this only in instances where we feel the public interest in this information being available to readers is high.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The federal attorney general, Michelle Rowland, said the ongoing death toll from known hanging pointswas unacceptable and “deeply concerning”, and pledged to take up the issue with her state counterparts. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy,urged the states and territories, who have responsibility for correctional facilities, to act.But records since released to the Guardian by coroners in Victoria and New South Wales have exposed yet more deaths from known ligature points, increasing the death toll.In New South Wales, new information provided by the coroner shows a further three hangings from two commonly used hanging points at Long Bay prison complex – window bars and window grilles in cells.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThose hanging points have been used in suicides for decades. Some have been removed in that time but not all. Guardian Australia has now identified 10 hanging deaths from those two hanging points between 1995 and 2017.8:12Prison authorities know there are hanging points in cells. Prisoners keep using them – videoA corrective services NSW spokesperson said the two hanging points in question have now been addressed in “several wings at Long Bay” by the installation of mesh screens.“This continues the extensive work that has already been undertaken across several facilities as part of our coordinated statewide infrastructure program,” the spokesperson said.“The removal of obvious ligature points is ongoing, and work is prioritised based on risk assessment.”In addition, between October 1997 and March 1998, four men died using the same hanging point in their cell in Melbourne’s Port Phillip Prison – a point that prison management had been warned about before the facility opened in September 1997.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The coroner noted that both the private operator, then known as Group 4 Correction Services, and the minister for corrections had been warned about the dangers of hanging points.A legal group that visited the prison in July 1997 before it opened raised concerns with management about the hanging points later used by the men.Victoria, like all state governments, committed to remove hanging points from its jails in response to the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody.In all four deaths, the coroner found the Victorian government and Group 4 had contributed to the deaths for failing to address hanging points.“Designing out the more obvious of the hanging points in the general cells is but one of many options that should have been employed at Port Phillip in the plan to improve prisoner safety. It was not done,” the coroner wrote.“It should have been done prior to the opening of the prison. It is not a question of hindsight. It was patently clear from the outset.”In his recommendations, the coroner said “it may be considered necessary to prioritise the removal of any ‘obvious’ hanging points in all prison general (or mainstream) cells”.Port Phillip prison, which is now privately run by G4S Australia,is scheduled to closein December. People in custody will be progressively transferred out of custody from July, with most to be moved to the new Western Plains correctional centre in Lara.G4S declined to comment.Corrective Services NSW said it had spent $3.9m to remove hanging points and dangerous furniture from Long Bay correctional complex. It said its extensive program to remove obvious ligature points was ongoing and prioritised based on risk assessments.“The NSW government has invested $16m to make our prisons safer across the corrective services network by installing anti-ligature toilets, basins, tap wear, shower heads and beds in cells, as well as covering smoke detectors with covers and replacing sprinkler systems,” a spokesperson said.“In addition to ligature removal and refurbishments, Corrective Services NSW has well-established policies and procedures for the care and management of inmates identified as being at risk of self-harm or suicide.”In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

It is highly probably that the certainty of return toFrancewould quickly break the business model of the smugglers.”On Thursday, his advice was heeded, but by Keir Starmer rather than the prime minister Jenrick served. Byagreeing a migrant returns dealwith France – albeit a limited pilot on an uncertain timescale – this prime minister has achieved something successive Conservative ministers attempted but failed.Starmer said on Thursday: “It’s no wonder that for years, previous governments have been trying to secure a deal, a returns agreement like this, because all governments have realised just how important it is.”Under the deal announced by both leaders from the military headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, British officers will detain a reported 50 people a week and send them back to parts of France away from the northern coast.Their biometric data will be taken at that point and should they return again by small boat to the UK, they will be on record and will be returned again, officials said.Though officials said it was possible that human rights appeals could be made, the Home Office said it was confident it would win any challenge, given the safety of France.Those in France wanting to take advantage of the new safe and legal route the government has just opened up can do so by applying via an online platform, which officials say has already been developed and tested by the Home Office.It will involve a visa application process with security checks before being admitted to the UK, where people will be allowed to claim asylum legally.Many questions remain about the scheme, however, not least when it will start.Macron and Starmer said they expected it to begin “within weeks”, but the French president added that he wanted to secure the agreement of other European nations first. That could prove tricky given concerns in Mediterranean countries that people being returned to France could then make their way back south.Nor is the scale certain. Neither leader denied reports that the pilot would aim to send back 50 people a week – just one in 17 of the total number who make the crossing on average. British advisers say they hope it will increase in scope if it is shown to help bring down numbers.Officials are also unable to say how they will choose which asylum seekers they will return to France or allow to enter Britain. UK officials say they will prioritise nationalities that are most vulnerable to people-smuggling and those most likely to have successful claims to asylum and links to the UK.Children are not detained when they cross on small boats, so officials said they would not be part of the process.The two parties say Britain will not make any extra payments to support French policing as a direct result of this deal. But Paris has been asking for increased funding for equipment such as drones and extra officers, and Macron bristled at suggestions that the money had not been used well.“I wouldn’t want there to be an idea that we are not doing our job or wasting UK money,” he said. “We have cut off the land route, the rail route, and sharply reduced that of the small boats. These smugglers are adapting – we must adapt.”Even with these uncertainties, Labour advisers are delighted they have struck a deal where their predecessors failed.They say a combination of factors helped get it over the line in recent days, including British commitments to do more to tackle illegal working in the UK and the trust that has been fostered between the two men.The Conservatives described it a “migrant surrender deal”, with the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, calling it a “green light to people-smugglers”.Jenrick, a politician normally expert at capturing media attention, was uncharacteristically quiet.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronMigrationRefugeesRobert JenrickFranceanalysisShareReuse this content"

Photographs byEd RamThu 10 Jul 2025 14.29 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 16.07 EDTShareIt is 5.45am, the dawn light strengthening. A large inflatable dinghy carrying 20 or more people has come discreetly to the east end of the beach at Gravelines. Though it looks packed from the shore, it is perhaps only two-thirds full, according to regular observers. Each person on it wears a fluorescent lifejacket, soon to embark on a risky crossing fromFranceto the UK.For a few minutes the boat halts several metres from shore, probably waiting for others to run from the scrubland behind the beach, where some have been hiding all night to try to get on. But the only people waiting are a small group of journalists. Once it becomes clear there is nobody else to pick up, the boat’s engine fires up, heading north-west to England, while one person onboard waves back with the sign of peace.In London, where France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is visiting, further proposals are being discussed to stem the number of people coming to the UK in small boats. But on Thursday morning in northern France, the more significant variables are the strength of the wind and the height of the waves. It is calm, ideal for crossing after days of higher winds.As the dinghy sets off, it becomes clear that a small number of French police officers have been watching from the dunes, about a kilometre or so away. It is estimated that 1,800 officers patrol the coast, a security effort partly funded by Britain, which is paying France about £480m under a three-year deal ending in 2026. But the size of the beaches and the length of the coastline used by migrants and refugees – roughly 70 miles – makes stopping all the boats impossible.View image in fullscreenPolice on Sangatte beach near Calais on Wednesday.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianEven so, leaving is not simple. Another dinghy got stuck in the mud as a group tried to embark from the canal that runs through the centre of Gravelines at about 5am. Though the people onboard were rescued by the fire brigade, according to aid workers at Utopia 56 the police used teargas to break up a group that had collected. Others then tried to restart the boat’s engine but, with the tide going out, the effort failed and for a time they were stuck in the thick canal mud before being rescued.Starmer says ‘one in, one out’ deal will allow UK to return small-boat migrants to FranceRead moreThe most significant factor, though, is the determination of people to arrive – the human spirit, so often driven by necessity, which overpowers the relentless political and security initiatives during 20 years of efforts to half irregular flows of people to the UK. It is an obvious point but, in debates about migrant numbers, essential to repeat.Two days earlier, in the makeshift camp near Grande-Synthe, west of Dunkirk, where people typically have originally come from troublespots and war zones in Asia and Africa, Khaled, an Afghan, suggests that the Guardian search on ChatGPT on a mobile phone. This is unexpected, but he wants to show that his wife is a noted human rights activist – a picture produced in a search looks exactly like her.“Please don’t identify us,” adds Khaled (not his real name). “It is dangerous for my parents back home. We don’t want the Taliban to know we have left the country.” The couple and their boy, now five, have been travelling overland for a year after initially fleeing to Iran, but such is his nervousness that he does not want their faces to be photographed as he talks, his son playing around him.View image in fullscreenAn abandoned boat next to a canal that leads to the sea in Gravelines.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianPeople have made lengthy, dangerous journeys to get this far. One, Bashir, says he has already travelled “nine days in a boat from Senegal from Spain” – and so the prospect of crossing the Channel does not appear to unduly worry him, though 19 people have been reported to have died or disappeared trying to make the crossing so far this year. Like several others, he says French police slashed a dinghy he had got into with a knife, making it sink before it left shallow water, a tactic exposing refugees and migrants to more danger and trauma. “I will try again,” he says simply.The squalor in the camp remains profound and in many respects little has changed in the two-and-a-half years since this reporterpreviously visited. There is no sanitation, though one charity, Roots, provides basic showers. Charities distribute food and provide electricity for phone charging. People cook on open fires – and offer visiting reporters tea.View image in fullscreenPeople cook in a makeshift camp near Loon-Plage, Dunkirk, on Tuesday.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianThough it feels safe to walk around with a photographer and talk to the those at the camp, there are dangers. There were two non-fatal shootings on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, the police presence was nervy and the Guardian arrived just as the victim, who had been shot in the leg three times, was evacuated by ambulance. Two migrants were killed in separate incidents last month. Aid groups such as Utopia 56 argue that if the camps were “more dignified”, there would be less violence.This time, however, there is a growing minority of women and children. Next to the Afghans are camped a group of Somalis. Five women fleeing the violent, unstable country gather around to talk. Yasmiin says she tried and failed to obtain asylum in the Netherlands, and says because the UK is outside the EU’s system she has a second chance in the UK. She playfully suggests marriage. “No, not you. Do you have a brother?” she asks.Katie Sweetingham, a coordinator with Care4Calais, a charity that works with refugees and migrants, providing clothes, tents and other non-food items, says there has been a huge increase in families and that at a recent clothes distribution in Dunkirk “we had about 100 women and about 30 children” turn up. For comparison, the charity budgets for handing out clothes or other items for up to 700 men, though it also admits that stockpiles of clothes and tents are not as high as it would like.View image in fullscreenCare4Calais volunteers fold blankets in a warehouse in Calais.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianAid workers are not sure why the numbers of women and children have gone up but there is tentative evidence that the cause may be the people smugglers’ new taxi boat model, where a large dinghy waits near the edge of a beach, allowing as many people as possible to pile on, creating a dangerous shallow-water scramble that is particularly difficult for children and family groups to navigate.Asmaan, 13, who is nominated by her mother as the family spokesperson because she speaks some English, says she and her family, from Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan, were unable to get on a small boat five days earlier. “We could not get on together, it was too difficult,” though the effort was moot because, she says, the boat was slashed by the French police.View image in fullscreenA family in a tent in a makeshift migrant camp near Loon-Plage.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianEven allowing for the new emphasis on disabling the taxi boats, so far this year as of 6 July at least 21,117 people have made the crossing by a small boat, up 56% compared with the same period in 2024. The asylum claims made by those coming to the UK via small boats aresuccessful 53% of the time. But people coming from certain countries have avery high rate of asylum claims accepted, such as 97% for Afghanistan.Organisations working with refugees and migrants estimate there are perhaps 2,500 in and around Calais and Dunkirk at the moment. Every two days, French police, partly funded by British taxpayers, clear out informal camps in Calais, taking or slashing tents and removing any possessions if their owners are not present. Afterwards, Care4Calais distributes replacements and the cycle repeats.View image in fullscreenPolice clear an area near a food and assistance distribution point near Loon-Plage.Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianIn the rough, wooded open ground near Dunkirk, the clearouts typically take place on Wednesday mornings. However, this week the effort did not take place, prompting some charities to assume it was to avoid negative publicity while Macron was in London and while journalists were likely to be about.Instead, according to Thomas Gilbert, the founder of the refugee support charity Roots, French refuse workers quickly cleared away “three or four skiploads of rubbish” on Wednesday morning that had been collected by volunteers.“It’s just really frustrating, especially today: it took us probably five or six days for three different groups to collect the rubbish, and they can just show up because of what is happening in the UK,” he says. A more humane approach to the migration crisis is possible, he argues, but it is not the path politicians choose.Names of refugees and migrants have been changedExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceEuropeRefugeesMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It is also the first time the government has increased the number of safe routes through which asylum seekers are able to reach Britain.Speaking in a joint press conference, Starmer said: “There is no silver bullet here, but with a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent, we can finally turn the tables.“For the very first time, migrants arriving via small boat will be detained and returned to France in short order.”Macron also welcomed the scheme, while blaming Brexit on various occasions for the number of people crossing the Channel illegally.“Many people explained that Brexit would make it more possible to fight effectively against illegal migration,” he said. “But since Brexit the UK has no illegal migration agreement with the EU … That creates an incentive to make the crossing, the precise opposite of what Brexit promised.“The British people were sold a lie, which was that [migration] was a problem withEurope. With your government, we’re pragmatic, and for the first time in nine years we are providing a response.”The pilot is expected to begin in the coming weeks and will include a safe and controlled route “only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, the prime minister said.Those who have crossed the Channel will have biometrics collected at Manston immigration centre, and those who have been identified as suitable to be part of the pilot agreement will be detained.Starmer refused to say how people would be chosen for return to France, but those who are deemed to qualify will be told their claim is inadmissible in the UK because they have arrived from a safe country. People will have the ability to claim any exceptional circumstances that may mean that they are not suitable for return.Those in France who wish to travel to the UK will be allowed to apply via an online platform and if successful will be allowed to claim asylum in the UK.According to a report in Le Monde earlier this week, the pilot scheme would lead to the return of only 50 people a week, a fraction of the number who cross. Starmer did not deny that report, but declined to say how many people would be returned under the pilot.Macron declined to say whether the scheme would expand as British officials have promised. He said: “I’m totally committed to make it work, because this is clearly our willingness and our common interest. And in this pilot project, I wanted to insist on one point – that there is a deterrent effect.“What we want to do is precisely to have this deterrent effect so that all these smugglers … sense the message that we are efficient and they have no more interest to try.”He added that he wanted to secure the agreement of other European countries before implementing the deal, with Spain, Italy, Greece, Malta and Cyprus all having expressed concerns.Starmer said: “This will show others trying to make the same journey that it will be in vain, and the jobs they have been promised in the UK will no longer exist because of the nationwide crackdown we’re delivering on illegal working, which is on a completely unprecedented scale.”He also defended the concept of safe routes of asylum despite objections from the populist right. “We accept genuine asylum seekers because it is right that we offer a haven to those in most dire need,” he said.UK government backs French police immobilising small boats, minister saysRead more“But there is also something else, something more practical, which is that we simply cannot solve a challenge like stopping the boats by acting alone and telling our allies that we won’t play ball.“That is why today’s agreement is so important, because we will solve this, like so many of our problems, by working together.”The two leaders also agreed to cooperate more closely on using their nuclear deterrent – something Macron called historic and that could involve the two countries using their weapons in tandem should Europe come under attack.Macron also challenged Starmer to recognise the state of Palestine, something France has pushed the UK to do for months.Both men were effusive in their praise of each other and the relationship they have forged during Starmer’s first year in power.Macron also had some words of electoral advice for his fellow beleaguered centrist. “Never cede to the temptation of populism, which is the denial of science or a travesty of the facts,” he said.“Populists sold you a response which is through nationalist withdrawal. Budgetary, immigration, growth problems from nine years ago. Were they solved by Brexit? No.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronRefugeesFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Project Hope, which runs the facility, said operations at the clinic had been suspended until further notice.“This morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open. This is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law,” said Rabih Torbay, the NGO’s chief executive.The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas terrorist who had participated in the 7 October 2023 attack, but “regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals” and that the incident was under review.‘They’re skin and bones’: doctors in Gaza warn babies at risk of death from lack of formulaRead more“What was our fault? What was the fault of the children?” asked 35-year-old Mohammed Abu Ouda, who had been waiting for supplies when the strike happened. “I saw a mother hugging her child on the ground, both motionless – they were killed instantly.”Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 67 other people across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian health ministry, including 15 people in five separate strikes in Gaza City.On Wednesday, Hamas agreed to release 10 hostages in exchange for a ceasefire and the US president, Donald Trump, expressed optimism for a ceasefire deal, saying there was a “very good chance” of a deal being reached this week or next.Qatar, which is helping to mediate the indirect ceasefire talks, cautioned that a deal could take time, as there are still key stumbling blocks. Israel is demanding that it be allowed to resume military activity in Gaza after the ceasefire, while Hamas wants assurances that Israel will not restart fighting.On Thursday afternoon in Washington, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said if the two sides reach agreements on the US 60-day truce plan, Israel will begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. He reiterated Israel’s terms for ending the war, including Hamas disarming and no longer ruling Gaza.A previous ceasefire broke down in March after Israel decided to renew fighting instead of progressing to a second stage of the deal that could have led to a permanent end to the conflict. Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas and its departure from Gaza, something the militant group has refused.Residents on Thursday reported Israeli tanks and bulldozers advancing towards encampments hosting displaced people south-west of Khan Younis, with Israeli soldiers opening fire and throwing teargas at the encampments. People began to flee the area amid the attacks, carrying mattresses and whatever belongings they could take with them amid scorching heat.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, one of the last functioning hospitals in southern Gaza, reported a large influx of wounded people over the past 24 hours. A picture sent by a member of the medical staff showed Israeli tanks stationed on the edge of tent encampments surrounding the hospital.The staff member sent a video of a piece of twisted shrapnel that flew into the window of the intensive care unit from a nearby strike, which they said was still hot to the touch.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians flee Khan Younis amid an Israeli ground offensive.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersOn Tuesday, Hamas killed five Israeli soldiers, a rare deadly incident, after the militants targeted them with explosive devices in northern Gaza.The war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people on 7 October 2023, prompting retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Israeli military operations have killed more than 57,000 people in Gaza and created famine-like conditions as the country restricts humanitarian aid into the territory.More than 500 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli forces while trying to access food distribution sites run by the US- and Israeli-backed logistics group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Israel backed the GHF after accusing Hamas of stealing aid under the UN aid system, something for which humanitarians say there is little evidence.Aid groups have condemned the GHF, saying it could be complicit in war crimes and that it violates core principles of humanitarianism. The GHF said it had provided more than 69m meals and that other organisations “stand by helplessly as their aid is looted”.At least three people were killed by Israeli gunfire while trying to access a distribution centre in Rafah, a civil defence official told AFP.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Eleven people were still missing, six of whom are believed to have been kidnapped by theHouthis, maritime security sources told Reuters.“We remain deeply concerned for the welfare of the crew members in the custody of the Houthis, as well as for those currently unaccounted for,” said Ellie Shafik, the head of intelligence at the UK-based maritime risk management company Vanguard Tech. “Their safety and swift release must be a priority for all involved.”The Eternity C was the second ship sunk by the Houthis this week, breaking aMay ceasefire with the USthat was predicated on an end to attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. Houthi forces also sank the Greek-owned Magic Seas on Sunday, but all the crew were rescued.The last time the Houthis attacked a merchant ship was last December, coinciding with a Gaza ceasefire.Hans Grundberg, the UN special envoy toYemen, said: “We are now with grave concern seeing an escalation in the Red Sea, with attacks on two commercial ships, with civilian loss of life and casualties, as well as the potential for environmental damage.”The US mission in Yemen accused the Houthis of kidnapping crew members and called for their release.The Houthis first attacked the Eternity C on Monday with bombs, sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speedboats. Footage released by the Houthis showed a surface-to-surface missile being fired to screams of “death to Israel” and a large cloud of black smoke billowing from the Eternity C.The ship was attacked again on Tuesday night, forcing the crew to jump into the water as Houthi skiffs circled the vessel.View image in fullscreenThe Eternity C sinking after the attackPhotograph: Houthi handout/EPAOn Wednesday, the Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said its navy had rescued members of the ship’s crew, given them medical care and taken them to a “safe location”. The Houthis previously held the crew of another ship they attacked, the Galaxy Leader, for more than a year.The Houthis have said their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians and a means of putting pressure on Israel to stop the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 57,000 people over the past 21 months.The Houthi militia leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, said on Thursday that no company could be permitted to transport goods related to Israel through designated areas at sea.He reiterated that a Houthi ban on navigation that the group sees as associated with Israel through the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea would remain in place.The Houthis have also regularly launched ballistic missiles at Israel, the vast majority of which have been intercepted by Israel’s missile defence system.Early on Thursday morning, the Houthis said they had attempted to hit Ben Gurion airport in Israel with a ballistic missile, which the Israeli military said it had intercepted.Trump’s Yemen bombings killed nearly as many civilians as 23 previous years of US attacks, analysis showsRead moreThe Houthis had threatened to resume maritime attacks on any Israeli-owned ships as the US considered firing missiles at Iran, which it eventually did on 22 June, striking three Iranian nuclear sites. The Iran-backed group then followed through on its threat by sinking the Magic Seas on Sunday and the Eternity C, neither of which were linked to Israel but which the Houthis claimed were heading to ports in the country.It was unclear how the US would respond to this week’s attacks in the Red Sea, which not only interrupted months of calm in the area but were also the first time that the Houthis had killed seafarers in more than a year.The Red Sea is a vital shipping route, carrying about a third of the world’s total container traffic. By the end of 2024, traffic through the Red Sea had declined by about 75%, according to the World Bank, a result of theHouthi attacks on shipping vesselsstarting in November 2023.The resumption of attacks has caused anxiety among maritime merchants, with at least one Hong Kong-flagged ship, Blossom Glory, listing its destination as “NO ISRAEL US EU LINK” as it passed by Yemen on Tuesday. Other ships listed similar destination ports.Explore more on these topicsHouthisYemenMiddle East and north AfricaShipping industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It warns that the UK’s petrochemical utilities and finance sectors remain vulnerable to an Iranian attack.The committee’s two years of evidence-taking ended in August 2023 so predates the arrest of five Iranians in May suspected of preparing a terrorist incident. The rapid rise in threats to Iranian dissidents living in the UK, many working for Persian TV channels beaming into Iran, coincided with the full coverage of the anti-government protests prompted by the death of Mahsa Amini in Iranian police custody in September 2022, the Home Office told the committee. There has also been an increase in threats against Jewish and Israeli interests in the UK.”British intelligence officials have told the committee that agents affiliated with Tehran have shown their readiness to “carry out assassinations within the UK and kidnap people from the country”.The report does not cover the impact within the UK of the Israeli attacks on Iranian installations, or the Hamas assault on Israel in October 2023. A perennial feature of the reports from the ISC is the long delay between the completion of reports and their publication following discussion with the government.In these discussions, the prime minister confirms there is no information that would be damaging to national security but he cannot change the report itself.But the report will feed into the full government response to the review conducted by Jonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, into a new proscription mechanism surrounding state-sponsored terrorism. The Cabinet Office welcomed the reportThe Iranian embassy in London said: “The suggestion that Iran engages in or supports acts of physical violence, espionage, or cyber-aggression on British soil or against British interests abroad, is wholly rejected.“Such accusations are not only defamatory but also dangerous, fuelling unnecessary tensions and undermining diplomatic norms.”In March, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, announced that Iran, including the whole of the Iranian state – covering Iran’s intelligence services, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and ministry of intelligence – was being placed on the enhanced tier of the new foreign influence registration scheme, meaning those who are directed by Iran to conduct activities in the UK including criminal proxies – must register that activity, whatever it is, or face five years in prison.The ISC, a group of senior parliamentarians given unique access to the top echelons of the intelligence services and secret documents, criticises government policy on Iran as “one of crisis management driven by concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme to the exclusion of other issues”.Firefighting, it says, “has prevented the government from carrying out longer-term thinking”. The committee cites evidence of over-bureaucratic structures within Whitehall and a lack of expertise. One witness told the committee: “If you have people running policy in the Foreign Office who don’t speak a word of Persian then that is a fat lot of good to be honest.”The committee found the government was paralysed on the issue of legal and practical difficulties around proscription of a state organisation such as the IRGC. It says “given that membership of an organisation proscribed in the UK could lead to the arrest and prosecution, and custodial sentence which would apply to around a quarter if the Iranian cabinet”.The committee portrays Iran as a pragmatic actor focused on regime survival, driven more by opportunism than ideology. Seeking to avoid full-scale war, it has focused on development of asymmetric capabilities and a network of aligned militant and terrorist organisations across the Middle East to spread influence and deter potential aggressors.The director general of MI5 recently stated that since the start of 2022 the UK had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots, presenting potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents.In his March statement, Jarvis said: “The Iranian regime is targeting dissidents and media organisations and journalists reporting on the violent oppression of the regime.“It is also no secret that there is a longstanding pattern of targeting Jewish and Israeli people internationally by the Iranian intelligence services. It is clear that these plots are a conscious strategy of the Iranian regime to stifle criticism through intimidation and fear.”Kevan Jones, who is also known as Lord Beamish and is chair of the ISC, said Iran posed a “wide-ranging, persistent and unpredictable threat to the UK, UK nationals, and UK interests”, adding: “Iran has a high appetite for risk when conducting offensive activity and its intelligence services are ferociously well-resourced.“It supplements this with its use of proxy groups – including criminal networks, militant and terrorist organisations, and private cyber actors – to provide it with a deniable means of attacking its adversaries with minimal risk of retaliation.”Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyEspionageIranCyberwarMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She remains in hiding in neighbouring India and has ignored formal requests for her to return.Bangladeshi prosecutors have spent months gathering evidence to bring Hasina to trial for alleged crimes committed during her 15 years in power, including themass killing of studentswho rose up against her authoritarian regime in July last year.Muhammad Yunus on picking up the pieces in Bangladesh after ‘monumental’ damage by Sheikh Hasina’s ruleRead moreThe panel, called the international crimes tribunal, indicted Hasina, her former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan and the former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah al-Mamun on five charges, including crimes against humanity.Prosecutors allege that Hasina was the “mastermind, conductor and superior commander” of the targeted violence against student-led protests that erupted acrossBangladeshand eventually led to the fall of her government.As widely documented by human rights groups, the police fired live ammunition at protesters across the country, leading to mass casualties, and arbitrarily arrested tens of thousands of civilians in an attempt to crush the uprising.Lawyers have argued that orders for the killings came directly from Hasina, citing leaked audio files and other documents left behind when she fled the country in a helicopter.Hasina’s Awami League party condemned the indictment and described the tribunal as a kangaroo court, despite Hasina having established it in 2009 to investigate crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh war of independence.“We condemn in strongest term the indictment against our party president and other leaders as we assert that this step marks another testament to the ongoing witch hunt against our party,” the party wrote on X.The tribunal has already issued three arrest warrants for Hasina. It also sentenced her to six months in jail earlier this month for contempt of court after a leaked audio recording emerged of her saying: “There are 227 cases against me, so I now have a licence to kill 227 people.”Hasina’s trial for crimes against humanity charges will begin on 3 August. Prosecutors said al-Mamun had already pleaded guilty and had agreed to testify as a state witness against his accomplices.It remains unclear whether Hasina will be forcibly brought back to Bangladesh to face the mounting accusations against her, including widespread corruption. The interim government, led Mohammad Yunus, confirmed it hadsent India several extradition requests, but that they had so far been ignored.Yunus’s government has expressed repeated frustration at India for continuing to give Hasina – who was closely allied to Delhi while in power – a safe haven and allowing her to make “false statements” intended to destabilise the country.Yunus has pledged that Bangladesh will have its first election since Hasina’s fall by April 2026, but the Awami League has been banned from taking part.Explore more on these topicsSheikh HasinaBangladeshSouth and central AsiaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

However, these deals have long been controversial, and not have always been seen to provide value for money to taxpayers.More than 650 public sector organisations have their buildings, IT and essential infrastructure managed by a private consortium under a PFI deal, and state bodies are set to pay £136bn in unitary charges for these contracts until 2052-3.Half of the contracts – covering hospitals, schools and transport – are set to expire during the next decade. The PAC report called on ministers to ensure such contracts were carefully managed so that private sector firms complied with their contractual obligations and “only quality assets are handed back” to government.Last year a report by the Association of Infrastructure Investors in Public Private Partnerships warned that schools and hospitals that depend on PFI contractswere in danger of “severe disruption”unless they could find a way to cope once those contracts expire.MPs on the PAC are also calling for a more comprehensive framework for how risk is shared between the public and private sector when they work in partnership, particularly after the high-profile collapse of the outsourcing companyCarillion, whichhalted work on new hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham.The government also needs to provide detailed information on the pipeline of future projects in order to attract new investors, according to the PAC, amid a current lack of data about the past performance of projects or when future ones will be delivered.“Our scrutiny has found a woefully obscured picture for any seeking to invest in big infrastructure projects in the UK, with a corresponding drain of skills overseas,” said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the PAC.“Without a long-term, consistent pipeline giving an idea of what to expect in years to come, UK infrastructure risks becoming stony ground for any investor.”The PAC is calling on the Treasury to identify which financing models it would support for money for different types of projects, such as energy, transport or communication, to attract investors and drive competition.A central database covering private finance for infrastructure investment should be published, according to the report, to help the Treasury to deliver value for money, given the huge amounts of money involved in such projects, such as the£14.2bn pledged by the governmentfor the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.Explore more on these topicsPrivate finance initiativePublic financeEconomic policyLabourConstruction industrynewsShareReuse this content"

But the data indicates present-day discrimination is also playing a role. We heard reports of really overt racism from private landlords – refusing to house people because they’re black, particularly if they’re refugees, or imposing rules or restrictions on them that they don’t impose on other tenants.”The team from the university’s Institute for Social Policy,Housingand Equalities Research analysed 750,000 household outcome records from official homelessness data from 2019-20 to 2021-22 and found that 10% of black families in the statutory homelessness system gained access to social housing, compared with 24% of white families.They also found 11% of migrant-headed households accessed social housing, compared with 17% of all households. Analysis of English Housing Survey data found that Pakistani-Bangladeshi households were more than seven times more likely and black households six times more likely to be overcrowded than white households.Data obtained via freedom of information requests by Shelter found black-headed households were more likely to be stuck in temporary accommodation (TA) for long periods of time. They found 43% of black-headed households in TA had been there for more than two years, compared with 25% of white-headed households. Almost a fifth (18%) of black-headed households in TA had been there for more than five years, compared with 8% of white-headed households.Mairi MacRae, the director of campaigns and policy at the charity, said inequality “remains hardwired into our housing system”.She said: “The evidence is clear – devastatingly, Black people are more likely to become homeless and less likely to have a safe and secure home. Racial stereotyping, culturally insensitive communication and unjust treatment from housing officers, as well as excessive questioning around eligibility in the application process, leave Black people feeling unheard, neglected and dehumanised.”Shelter’s separate report, My Colour Speaks Before Me, describes people’s experiences of stereotyping, judgment and stigma, and facing an “uneven burden of proof”, with excessive questioning and heightened scrutiny when applying for social housing.Black social housing applicants reported being treated more poorly than white applicants, facing longer delays and receiving support that was not culturally aware.View image in fullscreenUchenna Eneke spent 15 years living in a one-bedroom flat with her two children while bidding for a social home in east London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianOne of the report’s 16 peer researchers, Uchenna Eneke, 43, spent 15 years living in a one-bedroom flat with her children while bidding for a social home in east London, and struggled to get basic maintenance repairs or speak to housing officers.“It makes you question everything – is it because I’m black? Is it because I’m a woman? Is it because I’m a single mum? I was seeing people getting rehoused around me, and I came before them,” she said. “Especially with a name like mine. Sometimes I had to change my name to an English name – I used to call myself Gillian – just to get through to speak to someone.”Her children, now 17 and 10, spent most of their childhoods sharing a room with their mother, and one developed chronic rhinitis due to persistent mould in the property.“I tried asking for help but nothing happened. You just keep to yourself, keep your head down, don’t get your kids taken off you. I ended up having a bit of a nervous breakdown,” she said.She now volunteers with Shelter and advocates on behalf of other people struggling with housing. “We need the laws to change because people are going crazy. People are losing their lives, losing their families, losing their jobs,” she said. “Imagine someone being homeless but still having a job at the same time. That’s not normal.”Fitzpatrick said their research was designed to “fill a longstanding gap in knowledge about race and homelessness in the UK”, particularly after the widely condemnedSewell report on racial disparityin 2021, which made little reference to housing.She said their recommendations included using the private rented sector landlord ombudsman proposed in the renter’s rights bill to tackle racism by landlords, and rejecting ethnicity-blind approaches in housing departments.“It’s really unacceptable that people who are already in a crisis situation are sometimes traumatised by their treatment at the hands of local authority homelessness officers that are there to assist them,” Fitzpatrick said. “If you’ve got people coming into a system with structural disadvantage, you have to be aware of that.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessSocial housingHousingRaceInequalityCommunitiesSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Social media companies are not just neutral platforms but actively curate what you see online, and they must be held accountable.”Neither misinformation nor disinformation are harms that firms need to address under the OSA, which only received royal assent less than two years ago. State-sponsored disinformation can amount to an offence of foreign interference.The report examines the role of platforms including X,Facebookand TikTok, and comes after this week’s opening of a public inquiry into missed opportunities to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, on 29 July last year.Just over two hours after the first call to the emergency services, a post onXclaimed the suspect was a “Muslim immigrant”, and within five hours a false name, “Ali al-Shakati”, was circulating on the same platform, the MPs found. Within a day, these two posts had received more than 5m views. In fact, the attacker was Axel Rudakubana, a British citizen born in Cardiff.Another X post that evening calling for violence towards asylum hostels received more than 300,000 views, and the next day the false name was on X’s “Trending in the UK” list.TikTok suggested to users under its “others searched for” function the words “Ali al-Shakti arrested in Southport”, and by the end of the day after the attack social media posts with the false name had accrued 27m impressions and violence had broken out outside Southport mosque. On 3 and 4 August a Facebook post called for violence against the Britannia hotel in Leeds, where many occupants were asylum seekers.The committee called for fines of at least £18m if platforms do not set out how they will tackle significant harms that derive from content promoted by their recommendation systems even if it is not illegal.It concluded: “The act fails to keep UK citizens safe from a core and pervasive online harm.”It called on the government to make social media platforms “identify and algorithmically deprioritise factchecked misleading content, or content that cites unreliable sources, where it has the potential to cause significant harm.” But it stressed: “It is vital that these measures do not censor legal free expression.”The MPs called on ministers to extend regulatory powers to tackle social media advertising systems that allow “the monetisation of harmful and misleading content”, with penalties rising depending on severity and the proceeds used to support victims of online harms.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has been approached for comment.Ofcom said it held platforms to account over illegal content but stressed that the scope of laws requiring platforms to tackle legal but harmful content was a matter for the government and parliament.A spokesperson said: “Technology and online harms are constantly evolving, so we’re always looking for ways to make life online safer. We’re proposing stronger protections including asking platforms to do more on recommender systems and to have clear protocols for responding to surges in illegal content during crises.”TikTok said its community guidelines prohibited inaccurate, misleading or false content that may cause significant harm and it worked with factcheckers and made any content that could not be verified as accurate ineligible for its “for you” feed.X and Meta were approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaSouthport attackXFacebookTikTokInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

Their mortality rate was 1,336 deaths per 26,022 admissions, compared with a rate of 4,960 deaths per 154,041 admissions for white children, who had the lowest mortality rate overall.Children living in areas with high levels of child poverty had a 13% increased likelihood of dying while in a PICU compared with children from more affluent backgrounds, at a rate of 2,432 deaths per 58,110 admissions.Dr Hannah Mitchell, the lead author of the study from the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College London, said the reasons behind this disparity were complex and could be due to structural factors such as discrimination and language barriers.Prof Padmanabhan Ramnarayan, the senior author of the study, said: “These children may face discrimination, both within and outside healthcare, which can lead to hesitancy seeking help or delays accessing urgent care. Language barriers may further complicate access.“Children from some ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of complex or life-limiting conditions, making them more vulnerable. Children living in poverty are more likely to develop serious illnesses such as asthma or traumatic injuries, and may struggle to access timely care due to difficulties getting help from GPs or A&E.”He added that further research to fully understand the reasons behind this disparity was needed.The study also found that children from minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to have a longer stay in PICUs, an average of 66 hours compared with their white counterparts who had an average stay of 52 hours.Minority ethnic children were also found to have an increased likelihood of an unplanned readmission to a PICU within 60 days of discharge, at 9%, compared with their white counterparts who had a readmission rate of 6.8%.Ramnarayan said: “It shouldn’t be the case that a child’s ethnicity or postcode determines their outcomes in PICU.“Our findings show the urgent need for improved access to urgent care, reducing barriers to healthcare access, earlier recognition of serious illness in children, and more coordination between hospitals and community care teams to improve PICU outcomes across the UK.”Explore more on these topicsHealthChildrenPovertyNHSHealth policyRaceSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House has not commented on the report.Trump and Starmersigned a trade deallast month on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada that formally lowered some US tariffs on imports from Britain.The deal came after the prime minister visited the White House in February, presenting Trump with an invitation from King Charles for a future state visit, which Trump accepted.The US president is expected to visit his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire golf courses and is set to officially open a new 18-hole golf course at his resort on the North Sea coast at Menie, north of Aberdeen, named in honour of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. He is not expected to visit London during the trip.Trump has made numerous visits to his golf course in Aberdeenshire, which he bought as a small country estate and opened in 2012, and several trips to his more prestigious resort at Turnberry in Ayrshire.His mother was born in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, and Trump has frequently claimed that has given him a close bond to Scotland. He has visited Lewis once and spent little more than a minute in her former home.Scottish police said on Wednesday they werepreparing for a possible visitby the US president to Scotland, which would mark his first visit to Britain since the US election last November.The assistant chief constable, Emma Bond, said: “Planning is under way for a potential visit to Scotland later this month by the president of the United States. While official confirmation has not yet been made, it is important that we prepare in advance for what would be a significant policing operation.”The long-rumoured visit is not expected to include a meeting with King Charles, despite earlier suggestions the US leader could meet the monarch at either Balmoral or Dumfries House in Ayrshire.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerDonald TrumpScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Officials say the cuts will align their mission withDonald Trump’s vision of America first.The layoffs, which are commonly called reductions in force (or RIFs), along with voluntary redundancies, will affect nearly 15% of the state department’s domestic staff. A senior state department official said that was close to 1,800 people. The restructuring will also see several hundred bureaus merged or eliminated entirely. The department advises the president and leads the US in foreign policy issues.The state department went forward with the layoffs, which were long expected, after thesupreme court sidedthis week with theTrump administrationagainst a federal judge’s hold on plans for mass government firings that could affect hundreds of thousands of federal employees.“In the coming days, the department will be communicating to individuals affected by the reduction in force. First and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States,” read a memo attributed to Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary for management and resources, announcing the layoffs.State department officials said they wanted to eliminate redundant positions and agencies, noting that there were three offices at the state department managing sanctions policy, and that other offices had “proliferated” under Bill Clinton during the post-cold war era.“It was looking at what are the functions that are redundant, are overlapping or are no longer aligned with the president’s foreign policy priorities in a post-cold war world,” said a senior state department official who briefed reporters on the restructuring. “In an era of great power competition, what should a state department look like?”The changes will empower regional bureaus by creating a simpler chain of command, the officials said. That is also likely to empower political appointees, making the unwieldy state department bureaucracy easier for theTrump administrationto manage.“A lot of this covers redundant offices and takes some of these cross-cutting functions and moves them to the regional bureaus and to our embassies overseas, to the people who are closest to where diplomacy is happening,” the official said.Some bureaus focusing on immigration and democracy promotion will see their missions significantly altered under a Trump administration that has been skeptical of traditional American diplomacy abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Department stores – which rely on a variety of imported goods and materials, from shoes to t-shirts – have particularly been scrambling to deal with the flux in prices.At Macy’s, signs advertising sales of as much as 60% off original prices were sprinkled around the store – even next to diamond-encrusted necklaces locked inside display cases in the jewelry department. But for some customers, the prices are still too high.Nydia Olvera, 61, said that shopping at Macy’s is typically out of her budget, but she still makes trips to the store to check out the clearance section. “I remember they used to have these t-shirts for three dollars. Now, no more,” Olvera said. “Now I pay $7 to $9 for a t-shirt.”A recentstudyfrom analytics firm DataWeave showed that the prices of footwear, apparel and bags increased significantly from January to June. Footwear has gone up as much as 4% and apparel by nearly 2% in the last six months.And it’s unclear how much more prices could rise. The White House is still in the midst ofnegotiationswith dozens of countries that could face new tariffs as high as 40%. These proposed tariffs are set to go into effect 1 August, after Trump pushed back an initial negotiations deadline of 9 July.Last week, theTrump administrationannounced a deal had been made with Vietnam, which is the second largest manufacturer for apparel, footwear and accessories – the bulk of what is sold at department stores – after China.According to thedeal, exports from Vietnam will face 20% tariffs – half of the proposed levy of 46% Trump announced in April. Goods made in other countries, such as China, that are shipped from Vietnam will face a 40% tariff.While retail executives havesaidthe deal is better than the initial tariffs that were announced, it will still increase costs for retailers. Macy’s recently adjusted down its earnings forecast, citing uncertainty around tariffs. The company’s stock price is down 25% this year.Macy’s CEO Tony Spring toldCNBC, the financial news network, in May that some prices will stay the same but others are going to be more expensive, meaning the company will have to pass on some of the levies to customers. Other executives, including leaders from Nike, Target, Best Buy and Walmart have similarlysaidthat they will have to pass on costs.But retailers are also absorbing costs. Macy’s chief financial officer Adrian Mitchell said during the company’s earnings call in May that, while the company has been able to gain some vendor discounts, “we’re absorbing some of that price as well”.Retailers must decide how much of the increased costs it can pass onto consumers, without losing loyal customers.It is a tough environment particularly for department stores, which have lost customers to online retailers over the years.Salesat department stores made up just 2.6% of retail sales in 2023, compared to 14.1% in 1993, before the rise of online shopping.At Queens Center, some Macy’s customers said they have yet to notice any price increases, especially when using coupons the company typically issues.“The difference isn’t big; a little bit higher,” said Raphaelina Garcia, 33, who was shopping for a dress to wear at an upcoming wedding. “When you have the coupon, it’s the same price [as before].”Explore more on these topicsBusinessTariffsTrump tariffsTrump administrationDonald TrumpNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted anantisemitic tweetthat drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference – which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger:“Go fuck yourselves.”Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said. “Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”In the two years since, Yaccarino has had to contend with the unpredictability of Musk, ongoing content moderation and hate speech issues on the platform, increasingly strained relationships with advertisers and widespread backlash her boss received for his role in Donald Trump’s administration. Her response in some cases was to remain silent; in others, shechose to defend the company.Through it all, however, experts say it was clear Yaccarino was the chief executive in title only.Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Elon Musk’s XRead more“The reality is that Elon Musk is and always has been at the helm of X,” saidMike Proulx, research director at Forrester VP. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive. Her background and actual authority positioned her more as the company’s chief advertising officer, rather than its CEO.”Even in her de facto role as a chief advertising officer, Musk’s incessant posting, impulsive decision making and obsession withXand other platforms becoming too “woke” posed huge obstacles for Yaccarino.“The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Proulx.This week alone, Grok, the AI chatbot integrated with X, posted several antisemitic remarks, including some praising Hitler, after the company included new guidelines for the chatbot. In guidelines xAI published, Grok had beeninstructednot to “shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated”. xAI removed that guideline from its code on Tuesday evening.Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO of X was not only bookended with antisemitism scandals – Musk’s and Grok’s offensive tweets – but was also punctuated with several accusations of antisemitism against her boss throughout her short stint. In 2023, the non-profit watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate published a report on the prevalence of hate speech, both antisemitic and otherwise, on X as well as the lack of moderation. The company’s response was to sue the organization; the suit was ultimately dismissed. Similarly, the non-profit Media Matters for America highlighted the appearance of pro-Nazi tweets alongside branded advertisements in a report that preceded a mass advertiser exodus from the social network. X sued Media Matters.Most notably, Musk was accused of doingback-to-back Nazi salutesat a Trump inauguration rally at the start of 2025. Musk brushed aside the allegations that it was a Nazi salute and posted several Nazi puns on X. At the time, Yaccarino provided no additional comment, but posted a laughing face emoji in response toMusk’s jokes.Musk’s salute and the ensuing backlash was one of several moments that solidified the overall rightward shift of the social network as droves of users began to flock to alternative platforms like Bluesky, and even Reddit communitiesbegan banning X links.Promises of an X revitalizationWhen Yaccarino joined X, she set about courting celebrities and partnerships to reinvigorate the social network’s brand and repair relationships that Musk’s contentious takeover had damaged. Musk had long talked of making X into an “everything app” that would integrate payments, AI, messaging, livestreaming and other new features alongside the social network’s public posting, another task given to Yaccarino.Yaccarino led a delegation of executives, including Musk himself, to meet with industry leaders at the Cannes Lions festival in 2023, and began seeking media figures who could feature on the platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOne of Yaccarino’s moves toward making the platform into what she described as a “global town square” was reaching out to the former CNN host Don Lemon to start a show on X, much as the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson had agreed to put his content on site. Lemon’s first interview for the platform was with Musk, in what was intended to be a showcase of how X was shifting and bringing in big-name creators. The plan backfired after Lemon’s interview with Musk grew heated over questions about the billionaire’s drug use, which was quickly followed byMusk telling Lemon’s agentthat his contract was canceled. Future shows with big-name creators never materialized.In the ensuing two years, rather than become a destination for mainstream talent, a streaming powerhouse or the “everything app” that Yaccarino promoted, X has largely become a megaphone for Musk to air his grievances, boost and then feud with Trump, and promote his companies. Far-right influencers,porn spambotsand meme accounts proliferate, while many media outlets have deprioritized the platform or left it altogether. Misinformation and extremism are rampant, sometimes coming from Musk himself.The day before Yaccarino resigned, X became involved in a scandal that epitomized much of what the platform has become. Musk had recently posted that he would be reconfiguring xAI’s chatbot, Grok, because he did not agree with the responses it was generating. On Tuesday, users noticed that the chatbot had begun toreply to queries with blatantly antisemitic postspraising Nazi ideology. A flood of users began posting more screenshots of Grok posting rape fantasies, identifying itself as “MechaHitler” and promoting conspiracies before the company removed the posts.Incidents like Grok’s foray into Nazism are some of the many reasons Yaccarino’s goal of revitalizing X has sputtered. Although she succeeded in courting a number of major companies to begin advertising again last year, at a time when Musk’s connections to the White House were strongest, the platform’s ad revenues have never reached anywhere near their pre-Musk levels, accordingto the research firm Emarketer. The platform also resorted to threats of lawsuits against major companies such as Verizon if they did not buy advertising on the site, according toa Wall Street Journal reportthat Yaccarino has denied.After more than two years of Yaccarino running damage control for her boss and the platform’s myriad issues, Musk issued only a brief statement acknowledging she was stepping down.“Thank you for your contributions,” Musk responded to Yaccarino’s post announcing her resignation. Minutes later, he began sending replies to other posts about SpaceX, artificial intelligence and how his chatbot became a Nazi.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shares of the cereal maker were up 30% at $22.70 in pre-market trading on Thursday.US shoppers feel the heat of Trump’s trade war: ‘the prices are going up’Read moreThe deal, which is Ferrero’s biggest acquisition in recent years, brings legacy brands such as Nutella, Kinder, Tic Tac, Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops and Special K under one roof.Late on Wednesday, a source told Reuters that the candy maker behind Nutella was nearing a deal to buy WK Kellogg.At the time, Jefferies analysts said that the magnitude of the premium was a surprise and would make it hard to envision another bidder coming forward or a deal rejection.WK Kellogg was spun off from Kellanova and holds the North American cereal business of Kellogg, the original parent. Meanwhile, the Cheez-It maker Kellanova is in the process of being acquired by candy giant Mars in a nearly $36bn deal.WK Kellogg and other packaged food companies have flagged subdued demand due to cautious consumer spending in the US following consistent price increases by firms trying to navigate higher input costs.Packaged food makers are also under pressure from the health hecretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s “Make America healthy again” commission to eliminate the use of synthetic dyes.The maker of Nutella hazelnut spread, Ferrero, has turned into a global group, boosted by the aggressive acquisition campaign launched by its executive chair Giovanni Ferrero.In 2018, Ferrero bought Nestlé’s US confectionery business for $2.8bn. The group reported a turnover of €18.4bn ($19.2bn) in the financial year ending on 31 August and said it had increased its investments to boost manufacturing capabilities and expand across categories.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.Explore more on these topicsBusinessFood & drink industryChocolateCereals and grainsMergers and acquisitionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The system isn’t perfect, but it gets a lot of things rightThu 10 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 04.07 EDTShareWhen it comes to best-practice examples in the housing debate, Vienna is a common reference. Indeed, the Austrian capital features prominently in narratives about successful housing policies. Anarticle in the Observerconcluded that Vienna shows “decent homes for all” is not an impossible dream. And the New York Times even declared it “a renters’ utopia”.A considerable part of the attraction of Vienna relates to its large social-housing stock. It accounts forsome 43%of the roughly 1m housing units in the city. About half of it is municipally owned council housing. The other half is provided and administered by limited-profit housing associations – an Austrian version of social housing providers that are permitted to make a small profit to finance their operations. Social housing is not just for those on low incomes, but also caters to middle- and even some upper-middle-class households.The positive impacts are directly measurable. Rent levels in the social-housing sector are significantly lower than in the private rental market: newly rented units in the limited-profit and council housing sectors costabout 30% less. Housing quality, meanwhile, is often higher, particularly in the limited-profit housing stock. Moreover, the availability of social housing also dampens rent levels in the private rental market, as arecent studyshowed.The sector has not grown overnight. It originated in the municipal socialism of “Red Vienna” in the 1920s, when the Social Democratic Workers’ party set up far-reaching social policies to improve the living conditions of the working class. Financed through progressive taxes, housing played a large role. Today, the Social Democrats are still in power and social housing provision continues, albeit in a different form. Council housing construction has waned since the 1980s, and limited-profit housing has increased. A considerable amount of the financing comes from a 1% levy on the salaries of every employee in Vienna.Graph showing how rental prices vary in EuropeA particularly striking feature of Vienna’s social housing sector is its remarkable stability. Whereas privatisation has left large dents in the sector in cities such as London, Berlin and other large cities in Europe, in Vienna, the impact has been much more moderate. In the early 2000s, the Austrian conservative/rightwing coalition government sold federally owned housing associations to financial investors, which affected the stock in Vienna. Meanwhile, in the 1990s, a right to buy was introduced by the federal government for tenants in the limited-profit housing stock.So far, the impact of the programme in Vienna has remained moderate. Many tenants decided to continue renting instead. Along with new construction, this means that social housing has not declined in relative terms, but has retained a stable share of the housing market since the 1990s.The social housing secret: how Vienna became the world’s most livable cityRead moreNot all is as gloriousas these points may suggest. One issue relates to the accessibility of social housing. In a system where such a large part of housing is distributed through bureaucratic means rather than through the market, allocation is a delicate matter. Applicants can sign up for a waiting list that factors in their housing need and living situation as well as income. Housing associations allocate parts of their stock through their own channel, which makes the system additionally complicated. Moreover, parts of the housing-association stock require tenant down-payments, which can be a financial barrier. Overall, the system is complex, and tends to prioritise those who know how to navigate it and those who have been living in the city for longer.Newcomers to the housing market can rent privately instead. This sector has, however,changed substantiallyover the past three decades. Formerly, commentators have referred to it as an “integration machine”, offering low-quality yet strictly regulated and therefore relatively inexpensive housing to those unable to access social housing. In the 1980s, the deterioration of the stock was considered increasingly problematic and the government deregulated the Tenancy Act to make letting more profitable. Rent-setting was made more flexible, temporary rental contracts were introduced and landlords were allowed to charge higher rents in areas with higher land prices. While the stock has since been upgraded substantially, inexpensive housing has been lost, to the disadvantage of housing newcomers who rely on it.One simple takeaway from the Vienna case may be that policy matters. Through long-term commitment to social housing and limited privatisation, housing can be made better and more affordable. An even more fruitful takeaway, perhaps, may be that Vienna, through political choices, has managed to set up a regime of housing provision that prioritises housing as a basic need to a greater extent than other European cities. This regime not only includes policymakers from local to federal level, but also planning authorities, developers, landlords, housing associations, banks and construction companies among others. Understanding how this regime came into being, how it works and how it deals with challenges may be the most useful point to study for cities that want to learn from Vienna.Justin Kadi is Assistant Professor in Planning andHousingat the Department of Land Economy, University of CambridgeExplore more on these topicsAustriaThe housing crisis in EuropeHousingCommunitiesEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

At the same time, the hospitality sector has called on ministers to tackle “eye-watering” costs.The BritishBeerand Pub Association (BBPA), which represents more than 20,000 pubs in the UK, said it expects 378 to close this year in England, Scotland and Wales, at a cost of 5,600 jobs.This would mark an increase on last year’s 350 closures, continuing a long-term trend that has made more than 15,000 pubs call last orders once and for all since 2000.How will alcohol duty changes affect the price of drinks?Read moreThe BBPA singled out business rates as one of the hardest costs for the industry to bear, but said that it was “not too late” for the government to reform the tax.Business rates are based on a property’s “rateable value”, an estimate by the Valuation Office Agency of how much it would cost to rent the premises.Pubs’ business rates tend to be disproportionately high in relation to their financial viability because pubs often occupy high-value buildings, while being run on very tight profit margins.The BBPA also highlighted other costs affecting the UK’s 45,000 pubs, including beer duty and VAT, which it said meant £1 in every £4 spent on beer went directly to the Treasury.Establishments have also been hit by the government’s decision to increase employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs), and new waste disposal rules that the BBPA says effectively double-charge pubs for glass bottle recycling.These extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations cost the sector an additional £60m a year, according to BBPA estimates.Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the BBPA, said: “Pubs are trading well but most of the money that goes into the till goes straight back out in bills and taxes. For many it’s impossible to make a profit, which all too often leads to pubs turning off the lights for the last time.“However, it’s not too late to change this sad state of affairs.

Despite the delay, however, the Belarusian was still outspoken in her assessment of the match.Anisimova stuns world No 1 Sabalenka in three-set thriller to reach Wimbledon finalRead more“Losing sucks, you know?” she said. “You always feel like you want to die, you don’t want to exist any more, and this is the end of your life. Every time you compete at that tournament, and you get to the last stages, you think that you’re getting close to your dream. Then you lose the match, and you feel like, OK, this is the end.”Asked if she thought she could use this setback to inspire her to success here, the 27-year-old said: “It’s tough to think about that, but I really hope so. I lost three semis, three tough ones. Then I was banned from playing [in 2022]. Then I was injured. So I have really more of a hate relationship right now withWimbledon, but I hope that one day I will turn it around and have [that] love relationship.”Sabalenka commended her opponent for her “aggressive” play on the day and said Anisimova was a deserving winner. But she also said she was “pissed off” with the American for having apparently celebrated a point in the second set before the ball had passed Sabalenka’s racket.“She was already celebrating it. I was, like, that’s a bit too early”, Sabalenka said. “Then she pissed me off saying that’s what she does all the time. I was grateful she actually said that because it’s actually helping me to keep fighting. So I came back because I got really angry in that moment.”Anisimova later said she had not been celebrating and that any noise heard was a “long grunt”. Sabalenka also criticised her a second time, however, for not apologising after winning a point from a net cord. “I was like: you don’t want to say sorry? She just wanted, I guess, badly, to win this match. It’s on her. If she doesn’t feel like saying sorry, like she barely got that point and she didn’t feel like saying sorry for that tricky situation, that’s on her.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Aryna SabalenkaWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The opportunistic Education EasyPost rider used all the aerodynamic advantages available to him to ride on his own to the biggest win of his career.Tour de France 2025: Ben Healy wins stage six, Van der Poel pips Pogacar to yellow jersey – as it happenedRead more“I don’t push the most power out of everyone, but I just try and be as efficient as I possibly can,” he said. “I had full time-trial tyres, a waxed chain, a time-trial skinsuit, and just maximised absolutely everything.”A baking Normandy afternoon did not calm the pace of the peloton, despite the presence of six categorised climbs on the 201km stage, the second longest of the race. In the relentless ebb and flow both Pogacar’s and Jonas Vingegaard’s teammates were active on the front, until eventually thedecisive move came, but only after 100km.The eight-man breakaway was brimming with quality riders, including Giro d’Italia champion Simon Yates, American national champion Quinn Simmons, Van der Poel and Paris-Nice and Vuelta a España stage winner Michael Storer.But it was Healy who eventually took the initiative, riding clear with 44km left. Although Storer and Simmons gave chase, the 24-year-old soon opened a two-minute gap on his pursuers and forged ahead to win.“It was a very strong group of riders and I didn’t believe in just attacking purely by legs,” he said. “I was waiting for the moment to try and find some speed and take them by surprise.”View image in fullscreenTeammates of Jonas Vingegaard (right) and Tadej Pogacar (centre) battled on the front of the peloton before deciding not to chase the breakaways.Photograph: Tim de Waele/Getty ImagesBehind the break, Pogacar opted not to put his team to the chase and to instead relinquish the overall race lead to Van der Poel, even if the eventual margin was much closer than the Slovenian had expected.The morning after Wednesday’s individual time trial opened up a significant gap between Pogacar and Vingegaard, there was a general acknowledgment of the defending champion’s supremacy. “We remain combative and believe in Jonas,” Vingegaard’s sports director, Grischa Niermann, said.But Rolf Aldag, sports director at the Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe team, was not alone in thinking tthat Vingegaard and the rest of he peloton might have been victims of Pogacar’s cunning plan.Aldag was one of those who had high hopes for his team leader, Primoz Roglic, in the Tour’s first time trial, largely based on Pogacar’s lacklustre performance a month earlier in the Critérium du Dauphiné’s “race of truth”, whenhe lost 28 seconds to Vingegaard in 17km.“The question was how would the time trial result in the Dauphiné affect Pogacar? Because that result raised a lot of hope within the peloton that actually he was beatable,” Aldag said.“Yesterday Pogacar was better than people thought he would be, including us. So did they really fix his problems – how aerodynamic he was or what different equipment he needed – in such a short time, because that would have been difficult. Or maybe, was he playing games in Dauphiné?“We just don’t know, but I think with Pogacar everything is possible. Maybe he thought, ‘I’ll take it easy, leave things open and then destroy them in the Tour’.”As Healy celebrated his stage win, half of the peloton was still riding wearily through the Normandy countryside to the hilltop finish in Vire. Nearly 80 riders finished more than 15 minutes behind Healy, with some others losing almost half an hour.Friday’s stage seven of the race finishes on the 15% slopes of the Mûr de Bretagne, whereVan der Poel won his first stage in 2021. It also passes through Yffiniac, birthplace of Bernard Hinault, the last Frenchman to win the Tour, 40 years ago, in 1985.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The policy was upheld by the Lausanne-based court of arbitration for sport in 2019, and then by a Swiss federal tribunal in 2020, leading Semenya to take her long-running battle against the regulationsto the European court.On Thursday Semenya welcomed the European court’s decision, describing it as “great for me, great for athletes” as she spoke to reporters outside the court. “We need to respect athletes, we need to put their rights first,” said the 34-year-old.Caster Semenya: ‘How would I label myself? I’m an African. I’m a woman. I’m a different woman’Read moreThe decision does not changethe rulesthat effectively ended her career after she won two Olympics and three world titles. The court said it could not uphold anearlier findingby a lower chamber that Semenya had been the victim of discrimination, deeming the complaints inadmissible as they did not fall under Switzerland’s jurisdiction.But it handed her a partial victory in finding that the case required a “rigorous judicial review” as there were serious personal rights at risk and the Swiss federal court’s review had “fallen short of that requirement”. It ordered Switzerland to pay the athlete €80,000 (£69,000) for her expenses.The decision paves the way for the case to be sent back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne for reconsideration.Between 2011 and 2015, Semenya complied with a process set out by track and field’s governing body, taking medication to lower her testosterone levels. She later likened it to being used as a “human guinea pig”, saying she had grappled with side effects such as constant sickness, panic attacks and soreness even as she continued to win titles.Track authorities have argued that the limits on testosterone levels are necessary and reasonable to maintain fairness in women’s track events. Their critics say there is a lack of scientific research to support this view.View image in fullscreenCaster Semenya won gold in the 800m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAfter the governing body for track and field formalised its policy on testosterone levels in 2018, Semenya refused to comply, leaving her ineligible to compete. On Thursday, the governing body, WorldAthletics, did not respond to the European court’s decision.The consequences of Semenya’s legal battle could reverberate across the sports world as it dovetails with the International Olympic Committee’sconsideration of whetherto reintroduce some means of gender testing.The link was emphasised by Semenya last month in an interview with a South African newspaper. “It’s a battle for human rights now,” she said. “It’s not about competing. It’s about putting athletes’ rights first. It’s about the protection of athletes.”In 2023, Human Rights Watchdescribed the rulesthat Semenya had been subject to as “degrading and invasive of privacy, on grounds that are scientifically contested”.The regulations were incompatible with respect for women’s rights, and the freedom to live without cruel, discriminatory and degrading treatment, it added. “International sporting bodies set regulations with scant regard for international human rights norms, as if they are exempt from human rights standards.”On Thursday, Semenya, who dominated her sport between 2009 and 2019 despite the scrutiny over her gender, vowed that her battle would continue. “The fight will never be over,” she told reporters. “As long as we have injustice, we fight till the court.”Explore more on these topicsCaster SemenyaAthleticsSouth AfricaAfricaEuropean court of human rightsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Horner’s removal a price the parent company was willing to pay.Horner’s Red Bull exit: the end of an era that will be felt across Formula One grid | Giles RichardsRead moreThat Red Bull GmbH finally moveddecisively against Hornerafter almost two years of internecine strife appears to have met the goal of the Verstappen camp, led by the driver’s father Jos, who made little secret of his desire to be rid of this turbulent team principal.This did not appear a likely outcome when the furore overallegations against Hornerof inappropriate behaviour toward a female employee died down after he was exonerated by an independent investigation. Yet while that had perhaps been the spark, what really stoked the fire and probably provoked decisive action at Red Bull GmbH was the downturn in results and the problems that led to that point. If the power struggle is over, the fundamental issues remain.This position was pointedly noted by Verstappen’s manager Raymond Vermeulen after Horner’s removal. “We are looking for more performance so that we can return to the top,” he said. “In that respect nothing will change.”The position is stark:Red Bullwon 21 of 22 races in 2023, as dominant as any season in F1 history, but last year Verstappen managed to just claw out the title and now trails the championship leader Oscar Piastri by 69 points. Red Bull are fourth in the constructors’ championship and then only because of Verstappen. He has scored 165 points this year, the team’s second drivers’ just seven.Central to this downturn has been the performance of their car, about which Verstappen has been blunt in his condemnation. Yet for all their efforts, it shows no sign of improving. Since Red Bull lost their designer Adrian Newey to Aston Martin in 2024, the balance problems that plagued it in the second half of that season have continued into 2025 and been further exposed as other teams have improved.This cannot be absolutely attributed to Newey’s absence but it must be a factor, and that the current Red Bull design team, under technical director Pierre Waché, has been unable to solve the problems will concern Verstappen. The car Newey designed for the 2022 regulations was built to suit Verstappen and for two years they were completely dominant.However, when the other teams began catching up and Red Bull had to develop, the negative traits of the car and its increasingly narrow performance window only became more and more severe. The pursuit of extreme performance at the expense of drivability was based on Verstappen’s capability to manage it but it has reached the point where even the Dutchman is barely managing and his teammates are adrift.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen, who finished fifth at the British Grand Prix, wants a competitive Red Bull car so he can compete for a fifth world title.Photograph: Jay Hirano/ShutterstockAll of this may well cast doubt in his mind as to how they will fare for the major regulation change of 2026, towards which he is now looking and which is the motivation behind himopening talks with Mercedes.Moreover there has been the loss of other key staff alongside Newey in the past two years. Horner was always bullish that the team had strength in depth but equally they were pillars of the stability Verstappen craves. Especially noticeable was the departure of personnel in key roles, such as Rob Marshall, the chief engineering officer, Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director and Will Courtenay, the head of strategy.Then there is the elephant in the room, anxiously hopped-up on energy drink, in the form of Red Bull building their own engines for the first time next season.Mercedes is believed to already be leading the field and have form in this regard as their mastery of the 2024 regulations – a similarly engine-focussed formula – proved. Emerging in 2026 with a dominance similar to the one they enjoyed that year would make their car the most desirable seat on the grid.Red Bull’s project is an enormous and daunting step into the unknown and one where notably even manufacturers with a proven track record in building engines have struggled, as Honda’s most recent travails with McLaren attest.Verstappen will probably have a good idea where the Red Bull engine programme is and Mercedes may well have given him an indication of where they are, if they are to tempt him on board. Performance-led factors are likely to carry more weight with Verstappen than personality or politics and they remain as pertinent now as they were on the day before Horner was dismissed.For the moment, then, it would seem the Verstappens have their way, certainly Jos, in Horner’s removal. For his son, however, who wants calm and focus, throwing in a new team principal halfway through developing a car for new regulations does not appear to be a recipe for a serene succession into a successful future. Certainly in comparison to the stability at Mercedes.Indeed the 48-year-old Frenchman Laurent Mekies faces a similarly intimidating task to the one Horner addressed when he began building Red Bull from the ashes of Jaguar in 2005. Whether Verstappen is there to see it through with him remains to be seen, Horner or no Horner.Explore more on these topicsRed BullChristian HornerMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Real Madrid, the best thing that could be said about their last game of the 2024-2025 season was that it was their last game of the 2024-2025 season. So in the makeshift marquee set up by the MetLife Stadium, Xabi Alonso said exactly that, and repeatedly. He had watched his team, who aren’t entirely his team yet, betaken apart by Paris Saint-Germain; now he wanted to get home and “reset”, forget about it. Well, not forget exactly: the hurt might help, lessons learned. “I want this to have an impact but not drag us down,” he said. “In August we start 2025-26, which will be different.”The way they fell was familiar, back to their recent past, their reality. “We suffered the way others have suffered against them,” Alonso said, and that was true, but it is not only PSG; it is Madrid too. This was their 68th game of the season and their 15th loss.They won only the Uefa Super Cup, a world away now, andthe Intercontinental Cup against Pachuca in Qatar. In the league, Barcelona beat them twice, scoring four each time. In the cup, Barcelona put three past them;in the Super Cup,five.Arsenal scored three in the Champions League.PSG stopped at fourbecause they didn’t need more.Mbappé gets stuck in Dembélé’s shadow in Real Madrid’s shapeless shambles | Jacob SteinbergRead moreTheClub World Cupwas a tournament and a testing ground. Alonso hadn’t been keen to take over in the US, but once it was made clear that he must, he described it as an opportunity to accelerate the processes he had planned, implement ideas early. The demand is always to win, exposed before the eyes of the world, but at least to begin with games were analysed as much through what was new, what was coming, as whether they lifted the trophy. The discourse from the new coach was recurring, all about collectivity, spirit, a structure. Every time he was asked about an individual, he turned to the group. Everyone must work, without exception.There were details too, something developing: a shifting attitude and new formation that sometimes featured three at the back, Aurélien Tchouaméni playing what Alonso called a “hybrid” role, stepping in and out of the defence. Gonzalo García was a revelation. Dean Huijsen can really play. Fran García was good. Fede Valverde was released. Arda Guler may be a deep playmaker, occupying the position for which Madrid had no one else. The spaces between them narrowed. They were actually pressing sometimes.They reached the semi-finals. Yes, they might have expected that. And no, they hadn’t beaten truly great teams. ButJuventusand Borussia Dortmund are decent tests and, apart from amad last 10 minutes in the latter game, were eliminated with an authority not seen for too long. Madrid had a manager. It was startling, and pretty grubby, how quickly Carlo Ancelotti – the coach who won it all – was condemned and the team considered fixed.View image in fullscreenOusmané Dembélé scored in PSG’s victory over Real Madrid as the Spanish team were exposed at the back time and again.Photograph: Aurélien Meunier/PSG/Getty ImagesAnd then came PSG, and it all fell apart. That’s not pressing;thisis pressing. Can you really say that a goal was coming, overdue even, when it is scored inside six minutes? You can when it is like this: by the time Fabián Ruiz scored the first, it was PSG’sfourthclear chance. Madrid couldn’t get to the ball or PSG’s players. “We didn’t manage to apply the manager’s plan,” Thibaut Courtois said. “We couldn’t press like them; from my point of view, we always arrived a little late, everyone out of position and that’s how they beat you. We weren’t close to them.”The mistakes that led to the opening two goals were truly absurd from Raúl Asencio and Toni Rüdiger. There were other conditioning factors: Trent Alexander-Arnold and Huijsen were missing, one injured, one suspended. Valverde had to play at right-back. The formation was changed. And Kylian Mbappé was back. Now, it would be far too easy to say that Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started but: Madrid lost the first time that Mbappé started. No, it wasn’t about him. But, yes, it kind of was. Which is the way it has been all season, his first in Spain. There’s something quite bizarre about wondering if a striker who scored 44 goals, the best debut campaign a Madrid player has ever had, was a success, but it’s not an entirely illegitimate question. “I came to win trophies,” he said, and he hasn’t.Mbappé came to a team who malfunctioned in multiple ways and his significance is always magnified, distorted, for good and bad. Against PSG, the team that went and won it all as soon as he left, all the more so. Here it hit everyone, hard. There’s a symbolism that goes beyond his actual performance, but that doesn’t make it purely symbolic and there is something systemic there, too. Madrid hadn’t found a fit for him and Vinícius Júnior, whose form has not been the same and collapsed almost completelysince he didn’t win the Ballon d’Or. Defeat in New York brought that, and other flaws, back to the surface.“Today is ahostiathat could help us learn, correct things and keep improving,” Courtois said. Thehostiais the consecrated bread; in this context, it is a kick in the teeth, a massive blow. In its clarity, in how much it hurt, it could be helpful, no place to hide. Lessons came from both teams on the pitch, from what Madrid are and what, looking at PSG, they aspire to be. That this was no one-off but cruel confirmation of what has been seen all season may help. It cannot be ignored. No, things are not fixed so fast; they have to be dealt with properly, not patched over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you keep tripping on the same mistake, it’s not intelligent,” Alonso said. And if he was already given an authority not always conferred on coaches, his ideas engaged with, so far at least, this was a reminder to keep listening. Often it is an excuse to turn on a coach but not here, not yet: only six of the 68 matches this season are his, after all. “He hasn’t had time to do anything,” Luis Enrique said in his defence.“This is the last game of 2024-25, not the first of 2025-26,” Alonso said, and it was a recurring line. There might have been some self-preservation in saying so but there was also a message, a reminder of where they are coming from and how far they have to go, that there can be a new beginning, that failure can be left behind. If it’s not forgotten entirely. A reminder that there must be changes: in culture, dressing-room dynamics. At board level, the word “ego” is being discussed, an easy excuse perhaps, a handy distraction from failures higher up, but not insignificant. Alonso talked about wanting to “build a team that plays with unity, all together, that has feeling and spirit”.He also talked for the first time about changes in personnel too, if briefly. Some will depart – Luka Modric, Lucas Vázquez, almost certainly Rodrygo – and additions must be made. Some positions are not adequately occupied while others are overbooked. Asked about signings, Alonso replied: “We haven’t talked much about the composition of the squad during the World Cup but now we are always open to talking about making improvements and there is space for that.“Our new era is just beginning, there is still a lot of margin, lots of things we have to do better. Today hurts, we have to be self-critical, but this shows us things. We will take things from this match and from this World Cup. We leave here a better team, even if it is hard to say that right now. It can be a starting point for us, a way of beginning next season better. Today is the end of this season, not the start of next. This competition has told me a lot of things about what we are and what we have to improve. I leave here with many certainties. We will start from zero in August, when 2025-26 begins. Not from the 95th minute of today, but from zero.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridClub World Cup 2025Club World CupParis Saint-GermainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Any pretensions of lakeside refinement were blasted into the sky when Riola Xhemaili, brought on as a late throw of the dice, showed the instinct Switzerland had been missing all night. They had only needed a point to continue local interest at Euro 2025 but found themselves trailing to a gutsy Finland as the match entered its second minute of added time.Then the tireless Geraldine Reuteler skewed a cross-shot into the six-yard box; Xhemaili was placed to capitalise and host nation politesse was the last thing on anybody’s minds from thereon.Finland 1-1 Switzerland: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreThe stands pulsated and perhaps this was the moment a country that has taken a friendly, generous interest in its home tournament catapults itself into a full-on embrace. Maybe a hugely likable, manifestly flawed Swiss team has finally made its point and the anticipation will surely ramp up to fever pitch in the eight days until their first ever quarter-final. Never mind that their opponents will almost certainly be Spain: an evening of such magnitude deserves bathing in a while longer.It even made an impression on Pia Sundhage, who may have thought she had seen it all during her 50 years in football but has never enjoyed a more satisfying draw than this. “It was the most exciting,” she said. “These kinds of moment make you think ‘I can go on for ever and ever’. It’s inspiring to be around these players and staff members.”Sundhage’s young side are a scintillating proposition in full flow but for long periods it seemed familiar failings, evident in their opening-nightdefeat against Norway, would scupper them. They had raced out of the blocks, roared on by the most vibrant and partisan atmosphere this summer has mustered so far.Viola Calligaris should have paved the way for a smooth ride but miscued an 11th-minute bicycle kick in front of goal. The Barcelona prodigy Sydney Schertenleib tested Anna Koivunen but by half-time the early fire had been dampened.View image in fullscreenRiola Xhemaili turns home Switzerland’s equaliser in the second minute of stoppage time.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersHad their goalkeeper, Livia Peng, not made a brilliant stop from Eva Nyström’s deflection then Finland would have gone in ahead. Marko Saloranta’s players had worked their way into the game, presumably thinking the chance they needed would come. Oona Siren began to call the shots in midfield and there was a sense Switzerland could drift into trouble.They stepped up the pace with help from the substitute Leila Wandeler, one of three teenaged forwards who began the second half. Nobody could doubt Sundhage’s desire to open up the throttle even though risks were not obligatory. Wandeler shot over and created a half chance for Smilla Vallotto; a sense of abandon had returned but the sting that followed resembled a story as old as time.A silent scream reverberated when Calligaris hacked down Emma Koivisto, who had profited from strong work by Sanni Franssi near the right byline.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Calligaris had, at that point, embodied Switzerland’s weaknesses at both ends but those concerns were soon to be banished.Xhemaili’s smart finish capped an old-fashioned kitchen sink job, the crowd recovering from its shock to suck the ball towards Koivunen’s goal. It left some of Finland’s players, who had lacked the fluency of their own narrow reverse against the Norwegians, in tears. “It’s such an empty and painful feeling,” said an exhausted-looking Saloranta.By contrast, Switzerland’s hearts are full. “We showed the whole world what Swiss people can do,” a beaming Xhemaili said.

She netted just under a third of the team’s league goals during the campaign.The young forward, who can play as a winger as well as in a central striker role, joined Liverpool for a club-record fee believed to be just over £200,000 in July 2024 from the Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon, and is believed to have multiple years remaining on her contract at Liverpool, but Arsenal have been prepared to pay a sizeable sum to secure her services.It is understood Liverpool initially rejected several offers from numerous clubs for Smith, but with the agreement with the north London club, the Merseysiders are ready to receive five times what they paid for Smith 12 months ago.Arsenal are seeking to strengthen and continue their momentum after winning the Women’s Champions League. They have already added Chloe Kelly on a free transfer from Manchester City and have signed the left-back Taylor Hinds on another free, after Hinds’ Liverpool contract expired, but their move for Smith represents a far more sizeable financial investment.Before Girma’s move to Chelsea, the Zambia international Racheal Kundananji’s move to Bay FC from Madrid CFF for a reported $860,000 in 2024 had been the world’s biggest fee for a women’s player.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenLiverpool FC WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The England head coach was responding to the news that Jess Fishlock had justscored Wales’s first goalat a major women’s international tournament, but given the mood in the press conference room, she could easily also have been referring to her own team’s performance after they steamrolled the Netherlands.The tone and the atmosphere of the post-match exchanges was wholly contrasting to the scene in the same media room four days earlier, after the Lionesses had beensecond-best against France. This time, here was a proud Wiegman, a coach whose players had carried out her gameplan to perfection, and a coach who – while admitting she had felt “a little tension” before kick-off – clearly had always had conviction that her teamwould deliver under pressure. The back-to-back Euros winners made some big decisions for this pivotal match and they all paid off.Moving Lauren James to the right wingWiegman’s sole change in personnel in her starting lineup was Ella Toone replacing Beth Mead and, in tandem with that switch, Lauren James moved out to the right wing where she had the freedom to show the world exactly how lethal she is. The Chelsea forward caused misery for the Dutch backline, especially their left-back Esmee Brugts, who had no reply to James’s immaculate close control, balance and strength.James also found success cutting inside, exemplified by her powerful strike into the corner with her left foot for England’s opening goal, and occasionally she dropped deeper to collect the ball and dribble her way through a crowd of three Dutch midfielders, just because she can. Predominantly seeing her wide on the right, though, undeniably gave England a better balance, and in the No 10 role instead was a hard-working Toone, whose runs and off-the-ball tracking fully vindicated Wiegman’s selections.Swapping Jess Carter and Alex Greenwood’s positionsView image in fullscreenThe switch to centre-back for Jess Carter helped England neutralise the Netherlands forward line.Photograph: Harriet Lander/The FA/Getty ImagesThe other positional adjustment of note was Wiegman’s decision to switch Jess Carter to centre-back, where she most commonly plays for her club, and to move Alex Greenwood out to the left-back position, in a straight swap. Both players seem to look most at home in the centre of defence but Greenwood coped better, as a natural left-footer, than Carter had done against France, while equally Carter produced an outstanding performance on Wednesday, barely giving Vivianne Miedema a sniff of a chance.Asked why she had made that change, Wiegman explained: “That had to do with a couple of things: the pace that the Netherlands have, and we expected that in the centre, where they wanted a lot of runs in behind. They also had pace now with Chasity Grant on our [left-hand] side, and with Alex, her left foot, on the left side, in possession we hoped we would distribute more going forward.”Playing long balls over the topVery noticeable about England’s tactics on Wednesday was how frequently they sought to get behind the Dutch defence by playing well-weighted balls over the top for Alessia Russo to run on to, and it worked to excellent effect. Russo’s tireless movement and intelligent runs into channels was combined with inch-perfect long-range passing, most impressively from the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.The Chelsea shot-stopper’s defence-splitting pass that led to England’s opening goal, in particular, has deservedly been praised, as she somehow picked out Russo’s run while placing her pass through the eye of a needle to avoid every Dutch player running between the two of them. The 24-year-old’s distribution is a weapon England can add to their attacking options and Wiegman’s decision to back her as her new No 1 paid off in this regard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her goal, struck first-time into the bottom corner from range with real venom, epitomised the quality of her all-round performance and reminded everybody watching why she is such an integral part of the team.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway repaid her manager’s faith with a fine performance and wonderful goal against the Dutch.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesNot panickingStanway’s press conference on Monday had also set the tone for England to bounce back, as they once again demonstrated their ability to problem-solve. After the loss to France, the Lionesses and Wiegman faced plenty of tough questions but, instead of ripping up the strategy book, dropping four or five players or triggering fallouts between personnel in the group, the Lionesses found a togetherness, and that largely comes from Wiegman’s calm approach.Her response to wins is never too delirious and similarly her response to defeats is never too negative, and she backed her players to deliver. They, in turn, looked at themselves to address their form, rather than infighting. There is still a long way to go until the final in Basel, and England – who have alternated between wins and losses for the past seven matches – do need to work on their consistency, but they have found the blueprint now for how they can succeed in Switzerland.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen’s Euro 2025Women's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

The proposal moves European football into uncharted territory after previous requests to stage domestic league matches abroad were knocked back by authorities.The venue switch has been triggered by Winter Olympic Games logistics, with Milan’s San Siro stadium hosting the opening ceremony for the 2026 Games on 6 February – the weekend that the game is scheduled to take place.“The federal council gave a positive opinion to the Lega Serie A request to play Milan-Como in Perth,” the FIGC said in a statement. “This brings closer what would be a historic trip abroad for a Serie A match.”The FIGC cautioned that the “complex authorisation procedure” still requires formal approval from a number of governing bodies.

Textor also owns the Brazilian side Botafogo, who defeated Paris Saint-Germain during the group stages of the Club World Cup last month, but he revealed that he did not even consider placing his shares in Palace into a blind trust before Uefa’s 1 March deadline because it was clear he was not in day-to-day control at Selhurst Park.“Why should I put my interest in a trust back before March when the rule says you only have to do it if you have decisive influence? I don’t,” he told TalkSport on Thursday.“If I had a decisive influence, then those Brazilian players that just beat PSG in the Club World Cup, half of them would be coming to Crystal Palace next year. But you don’t see one single player from our network of clubs that’s made its way on to the Palace roster, which is the source of my frustration with the lack of collaboration that we’ve been able to have with Crystal Palace. I am dumb enough and successful enough to not predict in advance what a governing body is going to say.”Textor said he had documented proof that he could not make “management decisions” at Palace and that Uefa “have seen that document”. Asked what his influence was at Palace, he added: “I helped etc etc: I helped. I helped a lot. I showed up during Covid. I paid off the Covid debt. I helped finish the academy. The capital, I’m sitting there on the board with four other guys. [Chairman Steve] Parish is making decisions. He’s bringing us players. He involves us, but he doesn’t really listen to us. He does, but a suggestion from time to time is not the same as decisive influence.”Textor also rejected reports that he had told the CFCB that he had been instrumental in the decision to hire Oliver Glasner as Palace’s manager last year.“I tried to hire him in Lyon. And if [former Palace sporting director] Dougie Freedman notices and he goes to visit him in Salzburg just the way I did and he ends up at Crystal Palace, is there a connection there? I don’t know. Steve’s not going to be told who to hire as a coach,” he said.“It’s incredibly untrue. We sat in front of the Uefa panel and were extremely consistent on the lack of decisive influence. I don’t even know if I suggested him to Dougie but Dougie recruited him.”Textor confirmed that he attempted to take full control of Palace two weeks before the FA Cup final against Manchester City. But he claimed Parish had been given a “stay of execution” after he failed to agree a deal to buy the 36% stake owned by fellow Americans Josh Harris and David Blitzer, with the threat of being banned from theEuropa Leaguehaving forced him to sell his shares to Johnson.“This obviously strengthened him in that position,” he said of Parish. “I think his ambition every year is to avoid relegation. Our ambition is to climb the table.”Asked whether his hopes of taking over Palace had been scuppered by Uefa’s rules on multi-club ownership, Textor added: “I never want to be the man. Ask the guy that drives the red Ferrari that. But I’m not that guy.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceEuropa LeagueUefanewsShareReuse this content"

It was a first mixed slam title for Siniakova and her 11th in all while Verbeek picked up his maiden major.Aryna Sabalenka admits to ‘hate relationship’ with Wimbledon after semi-final lossRead moreBut as the celebrations and commiserations began, thoughts turned quickly to the US Open, where, unless there are some late changes to the rules, none of the four finalists will even be in the field. For the first time, themixed doubles will be played over two days in the week beforethe main draws begin in New York, the week usually reserved for qualifying. With $1m on offer to the winners and just 16 pairs, the top eight pairs by combined singles rankings will gain acceptance and the remaining eight pairs will be determined by wildcards.View image in fullscreenSem Verbeek celebrates with partner Katerina Siniakova as they win the mixed doubles final on Centre Court.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBut with the likes of Nick Kyrgios and Naomi Osaka, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, andCarlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanualready on the list, there is very little room for regular doubles players, with the Italians Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the reigning champions, currently the only recognised mixed doubles pair in the lineup. “I think it’s disappointing, obviously, that we won’t be able to play,” Salisbury said. “It’s a shame they don’t have the full event during the two weeks of the main draw. I think they could have both that and the regular format.”Salisbury, meanwhile, must be wondering what he needs to do to win a Wimbledon title. Six times a grand slam champion elsewhere, the Briton’s hopes of becoming the eighth home winner of the mixed doubles title ended in two tie-breaks, the crack pairing of Siniakova and Verbeek coming out on top with some scintillating play.“It’s always tough to lose a final but they played amazing,” Salisbury said. “They were too good in the tie-breaks today. Thank you to Luisa. You’ve been amazing and thanks for texting me two days before the sign-in to ask to play with me. It has been a pleasure and hopefully we can do it again.”Siniakova is world No 1 in women’s doubles but relished her first mixed doubles crown. “It’s very special, it means a lot. We had a lot of fun on the court and I really enjoyed it, it was a really amazing time here,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s a lot of good players and it’s up to the coaches to decide, but it was good to play today and show what I can do,” she said. “It was incredible and something I’ll remember for the rest of my life, so it’s very big.”ReutersShare"

There are no plans to send him for scans, the hope being that he will recover overnight and, alongside Joe Root – who is unbeaten on 99 – “really kick on and make it a score north of 400, towards 500”.Joe Root unbeaten on 99 as England dig in against India but Stokes injury a concernRead more“Fingers crossed it’s nothing too serious, but we’ve got a big test over the next four days and a big day two coming up as well, so it is important to try and manage him,” said Pope, who scored a scratchy 44 before being dismissed by Ravindra Jadeja with the first ball after tea.“But it is one of my roles to make sure that he doesn’t push himself to a ridiculous place with whatever he’s dealing with at the moment. I’m sure the physios and medics will work with him to lay out a plan, and then I’ll help push him in the right direction.”At 3.02 runs per over, England’s innings currently ranks as theirthird slowestunder Stokes’s permanent captaincy, as the nature of the pitch and the accuracy of India’s bowlers forced them to rein in their attacking instincts.“It’s not necessarily the way we’re used to going about it but I think it’s a pretty good score,” Pope said. “Of course we’d have liked to be 400 for four, but the surface didn’t allow that at all, and the Indian attack did bowl well.It’s something we’re trying to keep developing as a team … it’s something I’m working on in my game as well, not just scoring runs in quick style, it’s also when the time is right to absorb some pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The win sets the stage for the former world No 1’s sixth grand slam final, having won her previous five. She will face America’s Amanda Anisimova, whodefeated the current world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, earlier in the day.“I played great and I felt like I could put pressure on Belinda from the beginning,” said Swiatek. “I felt just good and in the zone. I was focused from the beginning till the end. So it was a really solid performance.”Iga Swiatek holds off Samsonova to reach Wimbledon semi-finals for first timeRead moreFor the Pole, 2025 has been a year of unexpected challenges. In the Australian Open semi-finals, she had a match point before losing to Madison Keys. In the spring, she failed to defend her Madrid and Italian Open titles, and – most notably – lost to Sabalenka in the last four at the French Open, ending her 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros.However, a grass-court training camp in Mallorca, focused on honing her serve, returns and movement on her least favoured surface, has clearly paid dividends.Since Paris, Swiatek has an impressive nine victories on grass, the most in her career in one summer, showcasing a newfound proactivity on the surface.“Every slam final has been totally different,” said Swiatek. “It’s hard to compare these journeys. For now I am enjoying this new feeling of being a bit more comfortable on grass.“There is no place to overthink here. You kind of have to follow your instincts. If that is going well, you can rely on them to feel comfortable, so this is kind of fun. And it is different than on other surfaces where you have more time to build the rally.”Across the net, Bencic’s return to the Tour after maternity leave has been nothing short of inspiring. Ranked world No 489 at the start of the year, the Swiss has played with a serene poise and had the most time on court of any woman player atWimbledonthis year, logging over 10 hours. But the extra minutes in her legs seemed to take their toll early against Swiatek.The Pole, opting to serve first, began with characteristic authority, cruising to a 40-0 lead before Bencic responded with a forehand winner but Swiatek quickly sealed the opening game with a forehand winner of her own. An early break followed swiftly, as Swiatek dictated play from the baseline, forcing Bencic into a nasty slip while chasing a forehand. The perfect start continued for the former world No 1, who extended her lead to 3-0 with a powerful ace.A brief nine-minute halt due to a spectator incident related to the heat allowed Bencic a moment to regroup and she eventually got on the scoreboard after a long return. Swiatek’s relentless pressure soon yielded another break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Bencic failed to capitalise on the break points and Swiatek steadied herself to hold serve. The Pole quickly regained control, securing another early break after a commanding rally culminated in a backhand winner.While the Swiss was not performing at the level seen in her previous rounds, it was clear that even her best might not have been enough against a truly hungry Swiatek. The one-way traffic continued as she stormed through two more holds and breaks, bagelling her opponent with a backhand winner down the line to seal her place in the final after just 74 minutes.It was ultimately one of the year’s best performances from the 24-year-old, who had almost as many winners (26) as Bencic had points (32).Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Iga SwiatekWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

On the 15th hole at the Renaissance Club, the Northern Irishman was in trouble; his fairway bunker shot had rolled back towards his feet. McIlroy’s ball sat in the mark created by his first attempt. “It served me right for trying to hit a nine-iron with the lip two feet in front of me,” he said later.‘It would mean a little bit more’: McIlroy returns to Europe with eyes on Open tiltRead moreThe response was notable. The world No 2 pitched out sideways, holed from 21ft – and the fringe of the green – for a bogey and rattled off three birdies in a row over the closing holes.A 68 to start at the tournament which precedes McIlroy’s Open Championship tilt at Portrush was hugely impressive in context. He sits only four shots from the lead.“It was a great finish,” McIlroy said. “The round was a bit stop-start, there was a little bit of rust in there after taking a couple of weeks off. I felt like I found my rhythm and started hitting better shots on the way in. It is the sort of course and these are conditions where the field will be pretty bunched so to be only four behind, feeling like I still have my best stuff ahead of me, is good.” The winner of five majors has the chance to make further impact from his early start on Friday.McIlroy’s finish involved converted putts of 26ft on the 17th and 19ft at the last. His birdie at 16 was a straightforward one, the par five having been comfortably reached in two. He regards his game as 80% towards where it needs to be for Portrush. “I’m ready to play,” he added. “A change of scenery has been nice, getting back over here has sort of renewed my excitement and enthusiasm for the rest of the season.”View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler felt he put in a decent score on his first day.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockColombia’s Nico Echavarría, Sepp Straka, Victor Perez and Jake Knapp head proceedings at six under. Marcel Siem is among those at minus five. The German, now 44, admitted he has toned down the heavy partying that sat alongside his golfing pomp. “I am not getting any younger,” said Siem. “I have to look after my body more now. I know I can stand on the range and hit golf balls, I’ve done it my whole life. But it’s more about recovery, sleeping well and not drinking.“I think those days of drinking and playing golf are over unfortunately. There is a time and place for it. It’s nice to enjoy a few pints after a good result, for example. The problem is I’m not in training any more. Two years ago, if I have one or two beers for dinner, it’s fine. But I can’t do it any more. On Monday this week, I had two pints of Guinness and felt horrible the next day. I think I am getting too old to be drinking and playing golf.” Siem is hoping to earn an Open berth with a strong performance in East Lothian.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The world No 1, Scottie Scheffler, looked puzzled by the greens at various points but still produced a 67. “I wish I would have played a little bit better,” said theUS PGA champion. “But overall, I felt like I did some good things out there and hung in there nicely and put up a decent score.

A lot of things in Fifa just require patience.”Cas said the parties, which include English club Queens Park Rangers, have a period of time to request the text of the decision remain confidential and that if they do not it will be published.The US national team lost regional superiority, but gained some World Cup hopeRead more“I feel completely vindicated as well as QPR,” he said. “I’ve had to stay silent about this for a long time.

Portugal’s arbitration commission in July 2023 decided he had the right to terminate the contract.He terminated the agreement in June 2023, citing unpaid wages, and signed a four-year contract with QPR that September for salaries ranging from 180,000 pounds (then $220,000) for 2023-24 to 725,000 pounds (currently $685,000) for 2026-27.Boavista claimed breach of contract and told QPR in December 2023 it was owed 2,107,425 euros (then $2.27m). The Portuguese club filed a complaint with Fifa and Cannon filed a counterclaim.A three-person Fifa Dispute Resolution Chamber panel of Frans de Weger, Mario Flores Chemor and Roy Vermeer ruled in June 2024 that Cannon was owed 88,000 euros (then $94,000) by Boavista plus interest and that QPR owed Boavista 1,287,000 euros (then $1.37m).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That may be about to change. On Friday, the 27-year-old American will face Carlos Alcaraz in theWimbledonsemi-finals, his biggest match on grass to date and a chance to take down the two-time defending champion.It promises an attractive clash of styles: Fritz, the power-serving baseliner ranked No 5 in the world, who has sent down 95 aces, the second-most in the tournament. Alcaraz, the all-court magician from Spain riding a 23-match win streak (including 19 in a row at the All England Club), has returned superbly all fortnight, winning 31% of his return games and landing 71% of returns in play. But if tennis were that simple and form and numbers alone determined outcomes, Centre Court wouldn’t offer up the theatre it so consistently does.Taylor Fritz: ‘My happiness revolves around results – I’d think about it forever if I don’t win a slam’Read moreThe third career meeting between Fritz and Alcaraz – the Spaniard has won the previous two – will hinge on more than serve speeds or spin rates. Both men have grown into the tournament mentally as much as physically. Alcaraz began with a shaky serve but rediscovered his rhythm in thefourth round against Andrey Rublev. Fritz, who twice survived elimination during a pair of late-night five-setters on No 1 Court in the opening two rounds, has quietly found his best level just as the stakes have risen.The laconic Californian has never looked better than he did in the opening two setsof Tuesday’s quarter-final winover Karen Khachanov. He eventually needed a fourth-set tie-break to finish the job, but the resilience he showed, in losing the momentum and then reclaiming it, is what separates this version of Fritz from past ones. “I’m proud of how I mentally got through these matches,” he said. “I knew my draw was absolutely brutal … I’m just happy with how I’ve handled that and stayed in the moment.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz plays a shot during his victory over Karen Khachanov.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianFritz has now reached the last four at Wimbledon for the first time and second time overall at a major, havingmade the US Open finallast September. But the grass might be his true calling. Five of his 10 career titles have come on the surface, including two in the past month in Stuttgart and Eastbourne.For years, Fritz has hovered on the edge of something bigger: flashes of brilliance undone by untimely lapses or tricky draws. That included a pair of crushing five-set defeats in Wimbledon quarter-finals: toRafael Nadal in 2022andLorenzo Musetti last year. This fortnight, he appears to have grown into the player he always hinted at becoming. “Other years that I was in the quarter-finals here, it felt like a really big deal for me,” he said on Tuesday after his latest last-eight tie. “Going into the match today, I was much more calm and relaxed. I think right now I’m playing at a much higher level than I was even two years ago.”There’s been help along the way. Fritz credits his girlfriend, influencer Morgan Riddle, for bringing stability to his career and focus to his off-court life. “There’s an obvious correlation between my results and ranking and the time we’ve been together,” he said. “Having someone who cares and just pushes you to do better, to be healthier … almost like kind of just mother me in a way, with like, the diet and going to sleep on time …”He laughed. “Yeah, that maybe wasn’t the best choice of words.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz during the US Open final in 2024.Photograph: Sarah Stier/Getty ImagesStill, it’s working. Fritz’s serve has sharpened with each round, as crisp as the white kit he wears. A well-documented foot issue – really just a taping-related irritation, not an injury – hasn’t slowed him down. And with the self-belief that grass gives him, a real shot against Alcaraz is genuine. “It can be an equalizer,” he said. “So I trust in how I’m playing. I truly know the way that I played the first two sets today [against Khachanov], there’s not much any opponent on the other side can do.”Alcaraz, of course, is not just any opponent. The 22-year-old from Spain’s southeastern coast is aiming to win a third consecutive Wimbledon title. Afterwinning at Roland Garroslast month, he arrived in London short on grass-court matches but long on confidence. His serve was shaky at first – he cited his ball toss as the problem – but by the fourth round it was humming again. That, in turn, has unlocked the rest of his game.“Feeling great in the serve gave me a lot of calm,” Alcaraz saidafter beating Cameron Norrieon Tuesday. “Then I’m playing great tennis from the baseline.”If Fritz prides himself on his mental growth, Alcaraz’s mindset is built around joy. “Once I started to enjoy the match, enjoy the moment, I think my good level showed up,” he said. “Playing a quarter-final at Wimbledon is a gift.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz on the stretch during his win over Karen Khachanov.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIndeed Friday’s semi-final will be a test of contrasts. Fritz is methodical, restrained, phlegmatic. Alcaraz is jubilant, playful, irrepressible. One slouches toward greatness; the other dances freely with it. But both know what’s at stake. And both are capable of tipping the match on a moment’s notice. The stats indicate that Alcaraz is the better returner and the more complete player. They say Fritz is serving bigger, with less margin for error. But tennis, especially on grass, is won or lost in the space between the numbers: a half-step here, a hesitation there. One player holding his nerve while the other blinks. Closing that gap could prove Fritz’s final hurdle to joining the sport’s top tier once and for all.“It gives me a lot of confidence that I’ve been here before,” Fritz said, recalling the pressure of playing Frances Tiafoe for a spot in the US Open final. “I don’t think anything’s going to get more stressful than that.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But just weeks after she became CEO, Musk posted anantisemitic tweetthat drove away major brands such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros Discovery to pause their advertising on the platform. Musk delivered an apology for the tweet later at a conference – which he called the worst post he’s ever done – but it came with a message to advertisers, specifically the Disney CEO Bob Iger:“Go fuck yourselves.”Yaccarino was in the audience of the conference.“I don’t want them to advertise,” he said. “If someone is going to blackmail me with advertising or money, go fuck yourself. Go. Fuck. Yourself,” he said. “Is that clear? Hey Bob, if you’re in the audience, that’s how I feel.”In the two years since, Yaccarino has had to contend with the unpredictability of Musk, ongoing content moderation and hate speech issues on the platform, increasingly strained relationships with advertisers and widespread backlash her boss received for his role in Donald Trump’s administration. Her response in some cases was to remain silent; in others, shechose to defend the company.Through it all, however, experts say it was clear Yaccarino was the chief executive in title only.Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Elon Musk’s XRead more“The reality is that Elon Musk is and always has been at the helm of X,” saidMike Proulx, research director at Forrester VP. “It was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company’s chief executive. Her background and actual authority positioned her more as the company’s chief advertising officer, rather than its CEO.”Even in her de facto role as a chief advertising officer, Musk’s incessant posting, impulsive decision making and obsession withXand other platforms becoming too “woke” posed huge obstacles for Yaccarino.“The only thing that’s surprising about Linda Yaccarino’s resignation is that it didn’t come sooner,” said Proulx.This week alone, Grok, the AI chatbot integrated with X, posted several antisemitic remarks, including some praising Hitler, after the company included new guidelines for the chatbot. In guidelines xAI published, Grok had beeninstructednot to “shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated”. xAI removed that guideline from its code on Tuesday evening.Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO of X was not only bookended with antisemitism scandals – Musk’s and Grok’s offensive tweets – but was also punctuated with several accusations of antisemitism against her boss throughout her short stint. In 2023, the non-profit watchdog Center for Countering Digital Hate published a report on the prevalence of hate speech, both antisemitic and otherwise, on X as well as the lack of moderation. The company’s response was to sue the organization; the suit was ultimately dismissed. Similarly, the non-profit Media Matters for America highlighted the appearance of pro-Nazi tweets alongside branded advertisements in a report that preceded a mass advertiser exodus from the social network. X sued Media Matters.Most notably, Musk was accused of doingback-to-back Nazi salutesat a Trump inauguration rally at the start of 2025. Musk brushed aside the allegations that it was a Nazi salute and posted several Nazi puns on X. At the time, Yaccarino provided no additional comment, but posted a laughing face emoji in response toMusk’s jokes.Musk’s salute and the ensuing backlash was one of several moments that solidified the overall rightward shift of the social network as droves of users began to flock to alternative platforms like Bluesky, and even Reddit communitiesbegan banning X links.Promises of an X revitalizationWhen Yaccarino joined X, she set about courting celebrities and partnerships to reinvigorate the social network’s brand and repair relationships that Musk’s contentious takeover had damaged. Musk had long talked of making X into an “everything app” that would integrate payments, AI, messaging, livestreaming and other new features alongside the social network’s public posting, another task given to Yaccarino.Yaccarino led a delegation of executives, including Musk himself, to meet with industry leaders at the Cannes Lions festival in 2023, and began seeking media figures who could feature on the platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOne of Yaccarino’s moves toward making the platform into what she described as a “global town square” was reaching out to the former CNN host Don Lemon to start a show on X, much as the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson had agreed to put his content on site. Lemon’s first interview for the platform was with Musk, in what was intended to be a showcase of how X was shifting and bringing in big-name creators. The plan backfired after Lemon’s interview with Musk grew heated over questions about the billionaire’s drug use, which was quickly followed byMusk telling Lemon’s agentthat his contract was canceled. Future shows with big-name creators never materialized.In the ensuing two years, rather than become a destination for mainstream talent, a streaming powerhouse or the “everything app” that Yaccarino promoted, X has largely become a megaphone for Musk to air his grievances, boost and then feud with Trump, and promote his companies. Far-right influencers,porn spambotsand meme accounts proliferate, while many media outlets have deprioritized the platform or left it altogether. Misinformation and extremism are rampant, sometimes coming from Musk himself.The day before Yaccarino resigned, X became involved in a scandal that epitomized much of what the platform has become. Musk had recently posted that he would be reconfiguring xAI’s chatbot, Grok, because he did not agree with the responses it was generating. On Tuesday, users noticed that the chatbot had begun toreply to queries with blatantly antisemitic postspraising Nazi ideology. A flood of users began posting more screenshots of Grok posting rape fantasies, identifying itself as “MechaHitler” and promoting conspiracies before the company removed the posts.Incidents like Grok’s foray into Nazism are some of the many reasons Yaccarino’s goal of revitalizing X has sputtered. Although she succeeded in courting a number of major companies to begin advertising again last year, at a time when Musk’s connections to the White House were strongest, the platform’s ad revenues have never reached anywhere near their pre-Musk levels, accordingto the research firm Emarketer. The platform also resorted to threats of lawsuits against major companies such as Verizon if they did not buy advertising on the site, according toa Wall Street Journal reportthat Yaccarino has denied.After more than two years of Yaccarino running damage control for her boss and the platform’s myriad issues, Musk issued only a brief statement acknowledging she was stepping down.“Thank you for your contributions,” Musk responded to Yaccarino’s post announcing her resignation. Minutes later, he began sending replies to other posts about SpaceX, artificial intelligence and how his chatbot became a Nazi.Explore more on these topicsXElon MuskInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lots of money is going into it, so unfortunately there is a lot of choice for perpetrators,” said one IWF analyst.The videos were found as part of a 400% increase in URLs featuring AI-made child sexual abuse in the first six months of 2025. The IWF received reports of 210 such URLs, compared with 42 last year, with each webpage featuring hundreds of images, including the surge in video content.The IWF saw one post on a dark web forum where a paedophile referred to the speed of improvements in AI, saying how they had mastered one AI tool only for “something new and better to come along”.IWF analysts said the images appeared to have been created by taking a freely available basic AI model and “fine-tuning” it with CSAM in order to produce realistic videos. In some cases these models had been fine-tuned with a handful of CSAM videos, the IWF said.The most realistic AI abuse videos seen this year were based on real-life victims, the watchdog said.Derek Ray-Hill, the IWF’s interim chief executive, said the growth in capability of AI models, their wide availability and the ability to adapt them for criminal purposes could lead to an explosion of AI-made CSAM online.“There is an incredible risk of AI-generated CSAM leading to an absolute explosion that overwhelms the clear web,” he said, adding that a growth in such content could fuel criminal activity linked to child trafficking, child sexual abuse and modern slavery.The use of existing victims of sexual abuse in AI-generated images meant that paedophiles were significantly expanding the volume of CSAM online without having to rely on new victims, he added.The UK government is cracking down on AI-generated CSAM bymaking it illegalto possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create abuse content. People found to have breached the new law will face up to five years in jail.Ministers are also outlawing possession of manuals that teach potential offenders how to use AI tools to either make abusive imagery or to help them abuse children. Offenders could face a prison sentence of up to three years.Announcing the changes in February, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said it was vital that “we tackle child sexual abuse online as well as offline”.AI-generated CSAM is illegal under the Protection ofChildrenAct 1978, which criminalises the taking, distribution and possession of an “indecent photograph or pseudo photograph” of a child.Explore more on these topicsInternetArtificial intelligence (AI)ChildrenChild protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m sure they’re talking to each other about what works for them and figuring out the way ahead.”Daisy Greenwell, the co-founder of Smartphone Free Childhood, said she was increasingly speaking to young people who were “questioning the idea that growing up online is inevitable”.She said: “We regularly hear from teenagers who are exhausted by the pressure of being permanently connected and who are choosing to step back for their own mental health.“Many of them are waking up to the fact that these platforms aren’t neutral. They’re designed to manipulate attention … They are realising that their time, focus and self-esteem are being monetised by some of the world’s biggest companies. Taking a break has become an act of rebellion.”This is reflected in Ofcom research. Areport from 2024found thata third (33%) of eight- to 17-year-olds who are online think their screen time is too high, whileanother found that47% of 16- to 24-year-olds who use social media deactivate notifications and used “do not disturb” mode, an increase from 40% in 2023, and compared with 28% of older adult users.Thirty-four per cent of younger people were more likely to take a deliberate break from social media (compared with 23% who said they would not do this), 29% would delete apps because they spend too much time on them (compared with 19% who would not), and 24% would delete apps for their mental health (compared with 13% who would not).David Ellis, a professor of behavioural science at the University of Bath, noted that teenagers may have discovered the features that let people control their time on social media and smartphones more quickly than their parents – though evidence that these features change behaviour in the long term was mixed, he said.Ellis said: “If someone is going to spend less time sitting in front of a screen and instead increase their levels of physical activity, then most people would probably view that as a net positive. On the other hand, that time could be replaced by something else less beneficial.”‘I don’t think my brain should have gone through that’: five young people on their experience of smartphones as teensRead moreYoung people aged 18 to 25who spoke to the Guardianpreviously said they felt their “parent’s generation didn’t have a clue” and had granted them too much access to smartphones too young, while several said they would restrict access for their own children until their late teens.A recent poll found thatalmost half of young peoplewould rather live in a world where the internet did not exist and a similar proportion would support a digital curfew, while more than three-quarters felt worse about themselves after using social media.TheGWI researchalso found that social media addiction ranked among parents’ top three fears for their children from a list that included climate change, war and the cost of housing, while 8% said they had become tougher about screen-time limits after watching the hit Netflix showAdolescenceabout the dangers of online misogyny.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChildrenYoung peopleMental healthMobile phonesHealthParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

And if you were a young adult at that time, well, there’s also a high chance that you played Japanese role-playing games as a teenager – whether that was Chrono Trigger on an SNES or Final Fantasy on a PlayStation. Purity Ring’s new singleMany Livesis an attempt to recapture the feeling of the RPG that you discovered as a 12-year-old and immediately made into your whole personality. Inspired by games such as Skies of Arcadia, Phantasy Star Online and Secret of Mana, it is poised to tug on the heartstrings of fans of a certain vintage.This is a bold decision for a band who have previously collaborated withDeftonesand coveredEurodance classics, but members Megan James and Corin Roddick have the gaming expertise to pull it off. “We’re huge fans of the JRPG genre,” they say, naming Nier: Automata and Final Fantasy X as major influences on the sonic atmosphere of their latest work. “And we’re both currently playing Metaphor: ReFantazio – it’s an incredible fantasy take on the Persona formula.”Five years after their last studio album and with more than a decade of remixes under their belt, Purity Ring are now fully independent and working under their own imprint, The Fellowship. Their next album, out in September, is described as “the soundtrack to an imagined RPG… the record tells the story of two hapless characters - embodiments of mj and Corin - on a journey to build a kinder world amid the ruins of a broken one.”The album didn’t start out as an imagined video game soundtrack, but during production they quickly realised where the idea could lead: “There was a sense of traversing an RPG world, of a journey unfolding that felt deeply tied to the sound,” they say. With this concept identified, Many Lives and its b-side, Part II, were born. “Many Lives is the doorway into this imagined world, and its centre – sort of like the place in the beginning of most JRPG games, where the character begins their story.”The video for Many Lives, with its cel-shaded graphics, was directed by Mike Sunday.The story here centres around Purity Ring’s real-life experiences during production, as well as “memories and places of terror and comfort” from the duo’s past. “This albumis an extension of the dreaming it takes to make actual change,” they say; it explores how games can offer a journey that leads to creative rebirth.On first listen, what stands out in Many Lives is the haunting voices of the choir, reminiscent of Kenji Kawai’s iconic Ghost in the Shell soundtrack. This eerie intro is accompanied by a high-tempo breakbeat, culminating in a track that feels like watching classic anime while playing Jet Set Radio. Purity Ring aren’t shy about their love for this era. “The Ghost in the Shell soundtrack is such a striking combination with the visuals … it was very memorable to experience that as a kid.” Having revisited the anime for this project, the duo decided to create their new music in its image, citing it alongside the Japanese cult classic game Nier: Automata as an example of music that makes you feel part of the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Purity Ring aren’t afraid to turn to non-traditional instruments for ideas, claiming they aren’t big gearheads and rarely use hardware synths. “The Legend of Zeldaseries has always been a major inspiration for us,” they say. “Especially the ocarina music from the N64 titles.” You’ll hear echoes of 1998’s Ocarina of Time in the melody threading through both tracks, like a half-remembered song you’ve not heard for some time.If the nostalgic vocals and retro Casiotone MT-240 sounds aren’t enough to make you long for the golden age of games, the accompanying video’s cel-shaded graphics emphasise the duo’s love for all things RPG. Directed by Mike Sunday, the video is a GameCube daydream, inspired by “a time that felt like game developers were really embracing style over realism”. It’s Shinjuku meets Hyrule, reminiscent of the opening maps of JRPGs, places that are always beautiful and yet rarely revisited. Purity Ring are fondest of the PS2 and GameCube era, but they pay tribute to thePlayStationPortable too; the UI for their imagined RPG would look at home on several of the handheld’s bestsellers.For me, Many Lives sounds like afternoons spent playing Baten Kaitos (I’m still hoping for a sequel). For Purity Ring, the tracks “evoke a feeling of past, present and future – a nostalgia for something you’ve never experienced, but somehow still remember”. They’re keen to position this forthcoming album as a new chapter for them, capturing the sound of an era – and chasing the feeling of playing a life-changing game for the first time.Purity Ring will release their self-titled 4th album on 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesElectronic musicPlayStationNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will they unleash a darker side?Non-violent games about cooking, farming or tidying now rival the more traditional video game pursuits of shooting and fighting in popularity. So what will the #cozy genre tackle next?Nicole CarpenterThu 10 Jul 2025 06.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 11.38 EDTShareIn 2017, a game design thinktank called Project Horseshoe gathered a group of developers together to define the concept of cosiness in video games.Games, of course, have had non-violent elements since the medium was invented. Early life simulators such as 1985’s Little Computer People, a low-stakes game in which the player interacts with a man living his unremarkable life in a house, could fit the bill; then there was the proliferation of social farming simulations after 1996’s chibi-adorable Harvest Moon.But the resulting report,Coziness in Games: An Exploration of Safety, Softness, and Satisfied Needs, is probably the first organised effort to define a then-emerging genre. The group zeroed in on three core things: safety, abundance, and softness. Cosy games (cozy in US spelling) don’t have high-risk scenarios: “There is no impending loss of threat,” they wrote. They must have a sense of abundance: “Nothing is lacking, pressing or imminent.” And a soft aesthetic wraps everything up like a warm hug.View image in fullscreenPuzzle game … a room in Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamTake developer Witch Beam’s puzzle game Unpacking, for example, which tells a story as the player takes things out of boxes and puts them into different houses. There are limitations to where you can put things: it’s a puzzle game, after all. But there’s no timer, no scoring system, no punishments for placing something wrong. And colorful pixel art brings it all together.Project Horseshoe’s definition came alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017, a handheld console designed to be cosied up with on the couch, and at that time the genre was experiencing huge growth. By 2019, indie game designer Matthew Taylor had started a Twitter account – called Wholesome Games – to highlight games that fitted the definition. Eventually, Wholesome Games (led by Taylor and partners Jenny Windom, James Tillman and Victoria Tran) grew into a community that hosted showcases full of cute and non-threatening games, and it has now become a company that publishes them.The success of Wholesome Games mirrors the immense growth of the genre as a whole. The first Wholesome Direct was broadcast in 2020, as the cosy genre began to explode during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns (thanks in no small part to Nintendo’s chill island escapeAnimal Crossing: New Horizons), and had 25,000 viewers, Tillman claims. The most recent Wholesome Direct, which debuted in June, reached 5 million people.View image in fullscreenComfort in grief … Spiritfarer.Photograph: Thunder Lotus GamesYou can see this trend on Steam, where more and more games are tagged with the “cozy” moniker. In 2020, just 15 games on Steam were released with the cozy tag attached,according to SteamDB. That number more than doubled in 2021, with 39 games, then doubled again in 2022, with 85. And then, the explosion: 373 games were tagged cozy in 2024 – more than one released per day on Steam. Every time the genre seems to have reached its peak, it rises higher. There are massive commercial hits, too: Animal Crossing sold nearly 50m, more than any game in the Call of Duty military shooter series. Famous farming gameStardew Valley, meanwhile, has sold 41m.Kelly Boudreau, associate professor of game studies and design programme lead at Harrisburg University, says that cosy games aren’t just a genre, but an “ideological shift in game design – something that can be powerful in order to express different themes and play experiences.” You can see this in the diversity of experiences that cosy games offer.A Little to the Leftand Unpacking are wildly different games about organising household items;A Short Hikeis about a summer vacation stroll up a mountain; Spiritfarer is a comforting management simulator about death and grief, andVenbais an emotional story about nostalgia and cooking Tamil cuisine.View image in fullscreenDarker themes … Strange Horticulture.Photograph: Bad VikingMore recently, darker games have also been considered cosy:Strange Horticulturehas the player running a shop selling – sometimes – poisonous plants, whileDredgeadds a horror narrative on top of traditionally low-stakes fishing and sailing. “At the core of it, these games are joyful, hopeful, and compassionate,” says Wholesome Games partner Windom. “When people play them, we want them to feel a sense of warmth and a sense of safety. But that definition has expanded to include games that, perhaps, deal with uncomfortable or uncosy topics, but within the realm of safety.”Rhea Gupte and Prateek Saxena of India-based imissmyfriends.studio did not set out to make a cosy game, but their debut, Fishbowl, is certainly one. Fishbowl stars Alo, a 21-year-old woman who’s just moved to a new city for a job as a video editor. Then the pandemic lockdowns begin, as she grieves the death of her grandmother. Despite the weighty topics, you can see the cosy everywhere in Fishbowl – in the meticulously designed colour palette, the intricate and detailed pixel art, and the soft, comforting sound design.View image in fullscreenPlenty of cosy … Fishbowl.Photograph: imissmyfriends.studio“We started off with the themes and the story and what we wanted to express,” writer and art director Gupte says. “Thinking about the design and overall feel of the game, it felt as if it needed a comforting atmosphere, otherwise it was going to become super heavy and difficult to play through. We wanted to have that sort of melancholy yet levity in the game.”Cosy as a genre is evolving, and part of that is an understanding that cosy feels different for everyone. Still, not every non-violent game can be called cosy, Boudreau stresses: “It’s not valuable to stick that tag on everything, because it becomes meaningless.”View image in fullscreenRural pursuits … Stardew Valley.Photograph: ConcernedApeFishbowl is not a cosy game in the way thatStardew Valleyis, where players dream of an idyllic life on a farm. Gupte and Saxena spoke about the distance between how farming and agriculture are portrayed in games and what they are like in reality: “In India, agriculture is a very scary part of people’s lives,” Saxena said. “There’s a game from India called The Palace on the Hill, where the main character has to do farming to repay their debt. It’s a reverse cosy game. But in a different world, [farming] is considered a more laid-back life.”Toem, a contemplative photography game released in 2021 by developer Something We Made, is another extension of the genre. Though it’s unequivocally a cosy game, it’s lacking something the genre is known for: a colour palette. Toem is rendered entirely in black and white. Monochrome can look harsh, Toem developer Lucas Gullbo says. But Toemisn’tharsh; the use of gradients and a soft aesthetic keeps the game from having “the emotional feeling of being black and white.”View image in fullscreenCulinary nostalgia … Venba.Photograph: Visai GamesWhere does cosy go from here? Over the past year, idle games have emerged as a subsector of the genre: low-stakes affairs such as Cornerpond, in which you fish from your desktop; Ropuka’s Idle Island, where you chill with a frog; and Bao Bao’s Cozy Laundromat, where you build a launderette. These games have many of the traditional trappings of cosy – the abundance of farming and resource collection paired with cute, colourful graphics – but crucially, you barely have to do much. There’s stuff youcando, such as decorating or small mini-games, but nothing youhaveto do. The game can – and will – go on without you, and this is a big part of the appeal. Is there something inherently cosy about idleness? As the genre grows, there’s much to explore.“In the cosy, wholesome realm – but just in games in general – it’s such a young medium that we’re still discovering genres and mechanics,” Windom says. “And it’s rare when we do see something really novel come up. It felt to a lot of people, when wholesome games and cosy games emerged, that it was something they had never considered before. Instead of shooting in first-person, why don’t we take a photograph? These shifts happen. We’re still discovering what we can do with games.”Explore more on these topicsGamesGame culturePuzzle gamesStrategy gamesAdventure gamesSteamDesignfeaturesShareReuse this content"

European solidarity must remain strong tooThu 10 Jul 2025 14.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 14.03 EDTShareEuropean leaders gathered in Rome on Thursday for a conference on Ukrainian recovery, but endurance remains the priority. Russia has intensified its assault withpunishing strikesfar beyond the frontline – including a record 728 drones and 13 missiles one day before the conference. The UN said thatcivilian casualtieslast month were at their highest for three years, with at least 232 people killed and 1,343 injured.Russia’s brutal offensive aims to break Ukraine’s spirit and European solidarity. Even Donald Trumpappears to be realising, withencouragement, that Moscow is not interested in peace. For Mr Trump, maximalism is a negotiating tactic; he does not recognise that for Vladimir Putin it reflects a fixation. Yet this week he acknowledged: “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin … He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”War is exhausting. Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, reminded the conference that Ukrainians are living in a chronic state of stress and emotional pain. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of the gap between those fighting on the frontline and those making decisions in Kyiv – even if the latter have repeatedly rushed for shelters this week.But Ukraine is fighting to remain a viable, independent state; Russia to ensure that it does not. The finding by the European court of human rightsof Russian abuses “on a massive scale”in Ukrainefrom 2014 onwards, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and forced labour, is a potent encapsulation of why resolve endures.No one should count on Mr Trump remaining aggrieved by Russia for long, still less on that producing significant action. Though the US has resumedweapons shipmentsafter a pause, the deliveries authorised by Joe Biden will soon reach their end and the US no longer sees this as its war. The long-awaited bipartisan sanctions bill promoted by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham appears to befinally making progress. But the president will not approve it unless it gives him plenty of wiggle room on actually imposing measures.European obeisanceto “Daddy”may be emetic, but aims to ensure that allies can buy the arms that Ukraine needs, and that the US keeps supplying intelligence. The future lies in European self-reliance. For now, the hope is not of decisively defeating Moscow but preventing it from winning. If victory is measured by the metre, Russia continues to grind out an advance – but slowly and at growing cost. And as Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman, the military strategy expert,wrote recently: “The question to ask is not whether Russia can keep going but whether it can meet its political objectives … For the foreseeable future, it can’t.”Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister,has suggestedthat Kyiv should pursue “strategic neutralisation”. It would seek to prevent Russia achieving its military goals, shifting “from a contest of exhaustion to a contest of operational irrelevance in which Russia may still fight, but cannot win”. This would require sharp focus and continued military innovation and should help to preserve personnel. Mr Zagorodnyuk cited Ukraine’s success in the Black Sea; it did not destroy the Russian fleet, but ensured that shipping could resume. This more limited approach may not be an inspiring prospect for a battered nation. But, with Moscow intent on subjugation and the US keeping its distance, it may be a pragmatic one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it’s 100% real news: the Israeli prime minister who has been indicted by the international criminal court for allegedwar crimes in Gazahas proposed the US president, his largest weapons supplier and strongest political backer, as a candidate for the world’s top peacemaking prize.It’s absurd, akin to nominating one’s drug dealer for the Nobel prize in medicine. But there’s a cynical logic behindNetanyahu’s publicity stunt: he is exploitingTrump’s need for flattery to prolongIsrael’s brutal war on Gazaand to continue attacking other countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Lebanon and Yemen. Before Netanyahu showed up for dinner at the White House on Monday with a copy of his Nobel nomination letter, Trump was eager to announce aceasefire dealbetween Israel and Hamas this week.Taken aback by Netanyahu’s gesture, Trump backed off on pressuring the Israeli leader to reach an agreement with Hamas. And Netanyahu wins yet again by playing for time, as he has done since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023. The prime minister has repeatedlysabotaged negotiationsto stay in power. He wants to keep his extremist government coalition intact so he can avoid early parliamentary elections, which his Likud party is likely to lose, and to blockan independent investigationinto his administration’s security failures that led up to the Hamas attack. But most of all, Netanyahu wants to save himself: he’s clinging to power to avoid a bribery andcorruption trialthat is rooted in one of his earlier stints as premier.Seeking bulldozer drivers to demolish Gaza: how a genocide is being outsourced | Arwa MahdawiRead moreNetanyahu,often dubbed“the great survivor” of Israeli politics, is an astute tactician who figured out what makes Trump tick: extreme flattery and distraction. The prime minister knows that he can’t compete with wealthy Arab petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which can provide Trump’s family business with billions of dollars in real estate and golf deals, or lavish gifts like a$400m luxury jetto be used as Air Force One. But Netanyahu correctly presumed that he can appeal to Trump’s desire to be recognized as a global peacemaker.That’s exactly what Netanyahu did when he walked into the White House this week and tapped into Trump’s sense of grievance over being passed over for the Nobel peace prize. For years, Trump insisted that he deserves the prize for his efforts during his first term as president to broker a series ofdiplomatic deals, known as the Abraham accords, between Israel and several Arab states. The agreements, which were negotiated in 2020 by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser at the time, included the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. But Trump and Kushner could not convince the most important Arab state, Saudi Arabia, to sign on to a normalization deal with Israel.The Abraham accords were built on a delusion: that Washington could solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by ignoring the reality of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, and an Israeliblockade of Gazaat the time. Trump and Kushner, who both approach political dealmaking through the prism of real estate transactions, decided to avoid the Palestinians and their concerns altogether, and negotiate directly with autocratic Arab regimes that wanted to formalize their existing secret relations with Israel into more open diplomacy. In other words, the Trump administration treated the Palestinians as real estate holdouts who were refusing to accept a glitzy deal that would ignore their rights while others reaped the benefits.The problem, of course, is that if Trump truly wants a shot at winning the Nobel prize, he would first need to stop the bloodshed in GazaIt’s no surprise that Netanyahu used the flawed Abraham accords as the basis for his recommendation of Trump for the Nobel prize. “President Trump has demonstrated steadfast and exceptional dedication to promoting peace, security and stability around the world,” the prime minister wrote in hisnomination letter, dated 1 July and addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the annual winner. Netanyahu sent his letter a mere 10 days after Trump orderedUS warplanes to bombmajor nuclear facilities in Iran, briefly joining a war started by Netanyahu in mid-June, when Israel launched a surprise attack against dozens of targets across Iran.At their White House meeting, Netanyahu piled on his fawning over Trump. “I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people,” Netanyahu said as he presented Trump with his nomination letter. “You deserve it,” the prime minister added, reinforcing Trump’s belief that he has been unfairly denied the prize.Trump was clearly pleased with Netanyahu’s gesture and sycophancy. “This I didn’t know. Wow. Thank you very much,”the president said, feigning surprise. “Coming from you in particular, this is very meaningful.”Netanyahu also appealed to Trump’s desire to be a strong man who imposes peace through strength, ashis advisersare fond of saying. And the Israeli leader knows how to make Trump feel like a winner, who has basked in the reflected glory of Israel’s military achievements against Iran and its allies in the region. Trump loves winners – and he hates to be associated with “losers” or any kind of failure, as he never tires of reminding everyone.The problem, of course, is that if Trump truly wants a shot at winning the Nobel prize, he would first need to stop the bloodshed in Gaza. And that means using American leverage –billions of dollarsin US weapons and unwavering diplomatic support for Israel at the UN and other international bodies – to pressure Netanyahu to end the war. So far, Trump has refused to use that influence over Israel, much like his predecessor Joe Biden, who provided Netanyahu with a virtually unlimited supply of arms, only to be rewarded with the Israeli leader’s scorn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Israeli militarydropped hundredsof these 2,000lb bombs in the first month of its war on Gaza – an intensity of aerial bombardment that had not been seen since the Vietnam war.Trump also dreams of securing his Nobel prize by negotiating a diplomatic deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an expansion of the Abraham accords that the Biden administration failed to achieve. But the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, who is Trump’s favorite Arab leader, has vowed not to sign a deal with Israel until it commits to theestablishment of a Palestinian state. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is Netanyahu, who has bragged that he spent most of his political career obstructing just that. “Everyone knows that I am the one who for decades blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger our existence,”he saidin February 2024.While Netanyahu was wooing Trump with his Nobel nomination letter in Washington, other Israeli officials were brazen in describing their plans for the forced mass displacement of civilians in Gaza. The defense minister, Israel Katz, described a proposal to concentrate Palestinians in the territoryinto an internment campon the ruins of the southern city of Rafah.As Netanyahu fawned over Trump, the Israeli leader’s allies were laying out a blueprint for committing new war crimes.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsNobel peace prizeOpinionDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Democrats must speak upThu 10 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 17.45 EDTShareIn mid-March 2025, I sat quietly in the back of a small, crowded room at the Asian Refugees United center in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, surrounded by members of theBhutanesediaspora. The silence was heavy, thick with fear and uncertainty. This modest office, once a vibrant hub for refugee youth, cultural celebrations, and literary competitions, had become an impromptu crisis center, where community leaders scrambled to make sense of theTrump administration’s escalatingimmigration crackdown onBhutanese refugeesacross the country.Robin Gurung, the organization’s executive director, briefly outlined our legal rights. Another organizer then read aloud the names of those detained, awaiting deportation – or worse, already deported toBhutan, the very country that once expelled them.As their names echoed through the room, an elderly man, a former student activist who had protested Bhutan’s repressive monarchy decades ago, stood. His voice trembled as he asked: “Where are we supposed to go?”This question of belonging has haunted my entire life. I was born stateless in a refugee camp in easternNepalafter Bhutan forcibly expelled more than 100,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese citizens in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Our language was banned, our citizenship revoked, and our books burned in an ethnic cleansing campaign Bhutan still denies. Nepal refused us citizenship, asserting children born behind barbed wire weren’t its responsibility. Even now, Bhutan maintains its pristine global image, recently praised by60 Minutesfor “zero-carbon cities”, with no mention of the atrocities that cleared land for these “mindfulness cities”.My childhood unfolded behind fences and military checkpoints, in a hut occasionally set on fire by local mobs who viewed refugees as threats to their livelihood. I was a child no country wanted. For years, I lived in limbo – stateless, invisible, expendable. I believed I had finally found a home in 2011, when, after rigorous vetting, my family was resettled in a small town in Idaho.‘A second exile’: Nepal moves to expel refugees already deported by the USRead moreSince then, I’ve navigated the complexities of belonging as a former refugee turned new American. My work at the non-profitRefugee Civic Actionnow focuses on empowering former refugees through civic education and engagement, echoing Frederick Douglass’s belief that voting rights carry an obligation to build an inclusive democracy for “unborn and unnumbered generations”.Yet no moment revealed the fragility of American citizenship more starkly than thefirst 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency. What unfolded was not merely a shift in policy, but the emergence of a constitutional crisis – one in which due process, equal protection, and the rule of law became contingent upon a person’s immigration status, background or national origin.Refugee communities, legal immigrants and even naturalized citizens suddenly found their rightsprecarious and their sense of belonging under threat.This crisis, while alarming, is hardly unprecedented. It echoes America’s historical pattern – visible in thefailure of Reconstructionafter the American civil war, when the nation struggled over defining citizenship, often through violence and exclusion. It is the same logic that incarceratedJapanese Americansduring the second world war, denied Black Americans civil rights for generations, and justified thesurveillance of Muslim communitiesafter September 11. Today, cloaked in the language of national security, that same impulse returns, driven bypoliticsintent on reshaping US identity through exclusion rather than constitutional principles.For my Bhutanese community, these recent crackdowns on legal residents have felt like ahaunting repetition of history. Trauma we thought we had left behind in Bhutan now replays inHarrisburg,Cincinnati, Rochester and so many other towns, including relatively quiet suburbs of Boise, Idaho. Ice raids targeting legally resettled Bhutanese refugees have rekindled deep, collective fear. More thantwo dozen refugeeshave been deported back to Bhutan, the very country that violently expelled us. While some deportees had minor offenses from years ago, their punishments – exile to a regime that once tortured them – are grotesquely disproportionate. Raids have reopened wounds we spent decades healing. These are legal residents, thoroughly vetted through one of the world’s strictest refugee resettlement programs. Yet their deportation has shattered the fragile sense of safety we once believed America guaranteed.America is not Bhutan; their histories, cultures and institutions differ profoundly. Yet I see troubling echoes emerging here. In Bhutan, exclusion began subtly with slogans promoting national unity – “One nation, one language, one people” – initially appearing patriotic, even benign. Soon, our Nepali language was banned, books burned and cultural practices outlawed. Families like minewere categorized arbitrarily to divide and destabilize. People were disappeared, tortured and jailed. Citizenshipbecame conditional, a prize easily revoked. I see shadows of this pattern now emerging in the US as the president erodes checks and balances, attacks public institutions, and scapegoats vulnerable immigrant communities.But when it comes to Bhutanese refugees, Democratic leaders have remained troublingly silent.America’s moral and constitutional credibility hinges on defending not just those who command headlines or electoral power but precisely those who do notWhile Pennsylvania’s senator John Fetterman andgovernor Josh Shapirohave acknowledged the concerns of Bhutanese refugees through public statements and tweets, their engagement has fallen short. What’s needed now is not just words, but action: oversight, hearings and direct intervention. Democrats must speak up for the likes ofSantosh Darji, a Bhutanese refugee quietly deported to a regime that once tried to erase him. Failing to do so risks eroding public trust in the party’s moral commitments.The Republican party, once a vocal supporter of refugee resettlement, has largely aligned itself with Trumpism – a politics rooted in fear, exclusion and racial hierarchy. During Trump’s first term, a fewRepublican governorsresisted efforts to suspend refugee admissions by calling for more legal refugees. Today, that resistance is utterly gone; no single Republican governor resists nor demands that the president reverse his decision on refugee admission. The party that once embracedRonald Reaganand George Bush can no longer credibly claim their legacies. Those presidents, whatever their flaws, understood that America’s greatness was built on itsopenness to refugees and immigrants.The Trump administration’s actions aren’t merely cruel; they may violate international law. Deporting refugees back to the country that ethnically cleansed them breaches the principle ofnon-refoulement– enshrined in the1951 Refugee Convention– which prohibits returning refugees to countries where their lives or freedoms are threatened. Now, some deportees find themselves stateless once again, rejected by Bhutan,detained by Nepal policeand trapped in legal limbo.America’s moral and constitutional credibility hinges on defending not just those who command headlines or electoral power but precisely those who do not. If legal refugees can be quietly deported to countries from which they fled persecution, America’s claim as a beacon of freedom is dangerously hollow. The haunting question “Where are we supposed to go?” must be answered by American institutions, unequivocally affirming that due process and human dignity apply universally.Lok Darjee is a former refugee, columnist and founder of Refugee Civic Action, who writes on immigration, identity and democracyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionBhutanNepalUS immigrationUS politicsSouth and central AsiaRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Try this big, beautiful quizLawrence DouglasThe legislation may be the most regressive tax measure in US history – but at least Ice should be happyThu 10 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 06.02 EDTShare1.In making permanent the Trump tax cuts of 2017, which had been set to expire later this year, the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" is perhaps the most regressive tax measure in American history, transferring huge sums of money from the poorest Americans to the richest. On average, Americans in the top 0.1% of earners stand to receive a $300,000 annual tax break, while the poorest 20% stand to lose about $560 per year. Making these cuts permanent will blow a hole in the federal deficit but fiscally makes sense because:As Trump noted: “After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically.”While economists have shown that the tax cuts championed by every Republican president beginning with Ronald Reagan have never contributed to wage growth or a sustained boom in investment, that’s only because the cuts were never quite massive enough.The price of super-yachts has gone up a lot in the last couple of years.The redistributive welfare schemes of Marxist freaks like presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden had permitted the bottom 40% of American households to gain control of a whopping 0.4% of total household net worth.Reveal2.During the Biden administration, Republican “fiscal hawks” – including senators Mike Lee (Utah), Rick Scott (Florida) and Ted Cruz (Texas), and representatives Chip Roy (Texas), Andy Biggs (Arizona), and Ralph Norman (South Carolina) – were prepared to let the US default on its national debt rather than raise the debt ceiling by even a single dollar unless congressional Democrats were prepared to accept draconian budget cuts. These same GOP lawmakers voted in support of Trump's big bill that raises the debt ceiling by an astonishing $5tn and promises to add some $3.4tn to the federal deficit. They did so because:Having recently attended a seminar on liberal Keynesian economics held at Harvard University, they claim to have now come to appreciate the wisdom in deficit spending.They blamed congressional Democrats for hiding the increase in the bill’s fine print.They said they confused trillions with billions, with one lawmaker saying: “Who can keep track of all those zeroes?”They have mastered the art of suppressing the normal human shame that comes from acting in a transparently hypocritical fashion.Reveal3.A largely overlooked feature of Trump's bill is its elimination of the longstanding tax on the purchase of:Textbooks and other necessary school supplies.Feminine hygiene products.Firearm silencers.Insulin pumps, medical thermometers and hearing aids.Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.Reveal4.In making 4m acres of federal land available for coal leasing and in eliminating virtually all the clean energy tax incentives passed during the Biden administration, Trump's bill will, according to experts, reap the greatest economic benefit for which country?The United StatesGuinea-BissauChadChinaSeychellesReveal5.Although Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) had previously drastically slashed the staffing of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), canceling at least 1,200 grants meant to support cultural and academic projects, Trump's bill provides $40m to the NEH to be spent on commissioning statutes for one of the president’s pet projects, a “Garden of Heroes”. The following pair of great American heroes are all candidates for Trump’s planned garden except:Cy Young and Kobe BryantJohn Wayne and Alex TrebekEarl Warren and WEB Du BoisSam Walton and Vince LombardiAntonin Scalia and William F Buckley JrReveal6.While stripping Medicaid of $1tn in financing with the likely result that over 11 million Americans will lose access to health insurance, Trump's bill appropriates an astonishing $170bn for immigration enforcement. This exceeds the annual defense spending of which nation?RussiaGermanyIndiaThe United KingdomAll of the aboveReveal7.The $30bn specifically targeted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) will triple its current budget.  This will give Ice a budget larger than which federal law enforcement agency?FBIBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and ExplosivesUS Marshals ServiceBureau of PrisonsAll of the above combinedReveal8.Included in the Trump bill's $170bn for immigration enforcement, about $45bn is earmarked for building and maintaining new Ice detention facilities. This would more than double Ice’s detention capacity, permitting the agency to detain about 120,000 people at any given moment. This expansion is desperately needed because, of the 56,000 people presently in Ice detention:the overwhelming number are, as Stephen Miller declared: “the most heinous of the most heinous” –convicted murderers, serial rapists and known terrorists.the great majority, though perhaps not super dangerous, nonetheless are copiously tattooed, though perhaps not as copiously as Pete Hegseth.70%  have never been charged with a crime, a fact that suggests these folks are experts at deviously avoiding detection by law enforcement.fewer than 10% have ever been charged with a serious crime, a fact that suggests there is no need for this radical expansion – unless Miller’s underlying agenda is to unleash masked shock troops on the streets of America who will throw a “whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people”, as George W Bush described them, into a network of detention centers.Reveal9.Confronted with polling that shows that Americans disapprove of the \"big, beautiful bill\" by nearly a two-to-one margin, Trump insisted:“It’s the most popular bill ever signed.”“If you see anything negative. . .it’s all a con job.”The negative numbers are the work of Democrats “because they hate Trump. But I hate them, too. You know that? I really do, I hate them … because I really believe they hate our country.”All of the aboveReveal10.Democrats are confident that the unpopularity of Trump's bill will permit them to recapture Congress in 2026.  This hope seems clearly warranted because:American voters have a long political memory and a demonstrated capacity to connect cause with effect.Even diehard Maga supporters will be able to see that their beloved leader has sold them a bill of goods.Pushing through tax breaks for billionaires while sticking it to poorer Americans has always cost Republicans at the polls.Really, what else do they have?RevealExplore more on these topicsUS CongressOpinionTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

It’s also never been particularly important to me that he likes soccer, that he likes what I like. Our sons will be their own men, come what may.But the sport has brought me untold joy, not to mention paid a good chunk of our mortgage. So I have tried to gently expose him to it here and there. He played a single season of low-stakes rec soccer. I must confess that I lightly bribed him into that by letting him pick out his own cleats – he chose neon green ones, for his favorite color then, even though I warned he wouldn’t be able to see his own feet in the grass. He made a gamely effort every week. On the drive home after the final session, he announced his retirement as a player. Literally. “Mama, Papa, I’m retired from soccer.” Oh well.Lukie, who turns nine in two weeks, is kind, social and bright. He possesses a soaring curiosity and creativity. He is neurodivergent, too – ADHD. When he was younger, loud noises spooked him. A train pulling into a station. A solid round of applause. Loud music. Thunder. But he seemed to have grown out of that, although he still hates hand dryers in public bathrooms.I’d been toying with the idea of taking my family to a Club World Cup game. I am on the record withmy skepticism of this steroidal, money-munching monstrosity, while I have also acknowledged that the soccer on show – and the fans, perhaps more pertinently –have been redeeming.But there was nonetheless an appeal in the chance to see some of the world’s biggest clubs playing for something competitive, and so close to home. So I looked for tickets and discovered that the dynamic prices for Tuesday’s semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminensehad utterly collapsedfrom nearly $500 a few days earlier, just to get into New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, to as little as $13. At those prices, who could resist?I snagged three tickets in the lower bowl for a comical $40 apiece for Lukie, myself and my wife. Lukie was excited about going to see a high-stakes game in good seats at the big stadium. We’d go right after he finished his morning robotics camp. We were entrusting Lukie’s maiden experience of the sport at the highest level to Fifa president Gianni Infantino and his fever dream for whathethinks soccer should be.João Pedro leaves it to Chelsea fans to celebrate after double against old side | Sid LoweRead moreOn the drive down, I expounded on the virtues of soccer, on the magic of not knowing whether the theater you had bought a ticket to would give you nine goals or none. There was no plot; certainly no script.“Oh, listen to Mr. Soccer Man,” Lukie said, teasing me. “Bragging about soccer.” Then he put on his headphones and streamed a dino show on his Kindle. (Lukie, who has read and approved this column, wants you to know he is “deeply into dinosaurs right now.”)We paid the extortionate parking fee of $65, which was apparently not prone to market fluctuations and, in fact, has risen by $5 for each subsequent round ofClub World Cupgames held at MetLife. I checked my phone. 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36C).Feels like 98.Lukie was charmed by the competing music and scents of grilling meats around the parking lot, as other children doused themselves with water. He stood and watched the dancing and singing Fluminense fans for a while. We weaved through the various human funnels of the security checks and exclusion zones.Once inside, he got to feel the child’s awe at walking into a mega stadium for the first time, laying eyes on the colossal rings of stands framing the verdant field. His mouth fell open.After that, it was just too much of everything. A DJ blasted the same old stadium tunes, suggesting there was no need for a DJ at all (Except to occasionally shout “FifaClub World Cup 2025, here we gooo!”) Michael Buffer, better known as the “let’s-get-ready-to-ruuumbleee” guy from boxing, was there doing his thing for some reason. Flames burst skyward, sparks shot into the air, fireworks boomed. Players ambled into the broiling heat amid overcooked introductions. Explosions of smoke in the clubs’ colors wafted through the air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his seat, he tucked his legs into his chest and covered his ears. João Pedro’s first Chelsea goal, and the ensuing roar from the crowd, finally fried his circuits. He burst into tears.My wife took him out on to the concourse for an $11 ice cream and found MetLife Stadium staff. Peter and Christine, American heroes both, convinced Lukie to give the game another try, handing him noise-canceling headphones, some sunglasses, and all of us new seats up on a platform in a quieter and roomier area for people with disabilities.These MetLife Stadium workers spoke to a child with empathy and enthusiasm, even as madness swirled all about them. Among the 70,556 fans – the ticket price dump had evidently worked – they managed to make one scared boy feel seen and heard. Humanity shone through in amid the artifice and the avarice.When João Pedro scored again, sealing Chelsea’s place in the Club World Cup final against PSG on Sunday, Lukie saw it clearly. But the goal entered his consciousness without the same noise or brightness. His brain got a chance to process what it had seen, without getting drowned out by sound and sight. He cracked a smile.Soccer, in the end, was still not for him. That’s OK. He got to try it, on his terms.To me, someone who tends to observe the sport from up in the press box, away from the maelstrom of the masses, it was a helpful reminder of what soccer feels like on the ground level. And that for all the commercialism and corporatism we rightly cover and criticize in the media, even sport at the highest level is still played by people, attended by people and put on by people who are trying their best.Leander Schaerlaeckens is at work on a book about the United States men’s national soccer team, out in 2026.

How do we short-circuit the re-run of this pitiful, shameful cycle?Thu 10 Jul 2025 19.18 EDTShareToday will be a hard day for Sydneysider Mirela Muratovic, a survivor of the only recognised genocide in Europe since the end of the second world war: Srebrenica.During the 1990s Bosnian war Srebrenica was designated a United Nations-protected “safe area” – a label that came to mean nothing.Thirty years ago, in the days after 11 July 1995,more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were rounded up and killed. Mirela was five years old at the time. Her dad, Munib, was one of those victims.‘The voices of our dead have not faded away’: the fight for the memory of genocide in SrebrenicaRead moreIf that wasn’t enough for such a young mind to deal with, it came just two years after her mother, Dzeva, failed to return home after leaving to find food with her cousins, presumed kidnapped and killed. A peace of sorts came as a result of Australia accepting Mirela and her remaining family members as refugees in 2002.In 2010, Mirela’s family was informed a “part” of her father had been DNA identified. The Muratovic family pooled savings to help send relatives over to Bosnia to hold a funeral for Munib.What remains difficult for Mirela and her four siblings is that they’ve never been able to achieve the same closure with their mother, whose remains have never been found.Like so many who have experienced that trauma, other world events trigger deep memories and powerful emotions.“Just this morning,” she tells me, “I was in tears watching a report out ofGaza. I sat there crying because of the suffering of others, thinking surely someone else was crying the same way about us 30 years ago. We must speak out, these things shouldn’t keep happening.”The precursor to today’s international criminal court was theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia(ICTY). The ICTY was set up no doubt as an attempt of sorts to create a rational response to rein in and hold to account those responsible for the spectacularly brutal irrationality of the time.It took almost a decade but the appeals court of the ICTY eventually ruled that what happened at Srebrenica was genocide. In the years since, some of the worst perpetrators have been captured and tried. A modest sense of justice has been experienced in the minds of the survivors, a closure of sorts.Over the years, on every 11 July, funerals committing to earth the remains of the dead have been held at Potočari, Bosnia. When Mirela’s father was buried, 99 other funerals were also held.The day will be for ever remembered after the UN resolved 11 July would be an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica.Thirty years after the genocide, the peace of Srebrenica hides deep scars | Alixandra FazzinaRead moreRightly, Australia joined with others to support this. Just as we as a nation rightly opened our doors to refugees such as Mirela and her relatives who had witnessed and endured the unspeakable.And we can be proud of the role we played in helping them write a new chapter in their lives, also welcoming their contributions to our country as Australian citizens.When it comes to the horrors of genocide we say “never again” with an ironic frequency.Last year marked 30 years since the savagery of Rwanda: 800,000 killed in just 100 days.Journalists such as Philip Gourevitch covered these episodesand walked away painfully affected. He wrote powerfully about the events of Rwanda.After accidentally walking on a human skull in the course of visiting a Rwandan massacre memorial, he wrote: “This is what fascinates me most in existence: the peculiar necessity of imagining what is, in fact, real.”In the late 90s, as Gourevitch was talking about his work at a podium in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum audience members noticed escalating emotion in his voice, as he spoke of the West’s “active, willed, non-action in Rwanda”.When do we short-circuit the re-run of this pitiful, shameful, painful cycle? We witness the innocent unimaginably suffer, the unaffected sit as inert spectators only to act after thousands have been killed, the legal system takes time to officially recognise a genocide and we ultimately declare “never again”.Never again, the Holocaust. Never again, Rwanda. Never again, Srebrenica. How much longer before we declare: Never again, Gaza?Ed Husic is the federal Labor MP for Chifley in western SydneyExplore more on these topicsBosnia and HerzegovinaOpinionGazaRwandacommentShareReuse this content"

If not now, when?Thu 10 Jul 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 14.01 EDTShareIt was only a handful of “middle-class women of a certain age”. That’s how the MasterChef host Gregg Wallace originally dismissed his accusers, when allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour first surfaced. Just a few humourless posh birds, in other words, who couldn’t take a joke from the self-styled “cheeky greengrocer” and star of a cookery show enjoyed by – well, lots of other middle-class women of a certain age, for starters.But those jokes were apparently sexualised enough that the former Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark, no shrinking violet,raised concerns privatelywith producers after appearing as a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef. Meanwhile, her fellow broadcaster Kirstie Allsopp, whorecalled Wallaceallegedly describing a sex act with his partner within an hour of meeting her at work, succinctly described all the reasons women mostly didn’t say anything at the time: “Because you feel, in no particular order, embarrassed, a prude, shocked, waiting for a male colleague to call him out, not wanting to ‘rock the boat’, thinking it’s better to plough on with the day, assuming you misheard/misunderstood or just don’t get the joke.”Or, of course, because you’re frightened that if you complain you won’t get hired again – which is precisely why it’s often those pesky older women, financially secure and senior enough not to be easily brushed off, who end up making a fuss on behalf of those who can’t.We now know thatmore than 50 people, in addition to the 13 who originally complained to BBC News, have come forward after an inquiry into Wallace’s conduct set up by Banijay, the production company behind MasterChef. Many were said to be young women on precarious freelance contracts, scared of losing work in a ridiculously competitive industry.One was in her 20s when she claims Wallace pushed her on to the sofa in his dressing room and dropped his trousers; when she reported the alleged incident to senior staff, she was allegedly informed that she was over 16, so “you’re not being Jimmy Saviled”. Another alleged that Wallace put his hand on her groin under the table at a dinner ahead of filming the cookery show Saturday Kitchen, asking if she liked it. (Wallace, for his part, insists the most serious allegations against him have been dismissed; at the time of writing, the report is still unpublished.)So far, so familiar, from all the other stories of big shots behaving badly that women are sick and tired of hearing but from which some institutions still can’t seem to learn. It’s happening fromTVtopolitics, banking to and sport. For the avoidance of any doubt, the take-home lesson from this parade of the gropey, the sleazy and the justifiably cancelled has never been thatgreat men – for it’s usually men – just come with baggage, like tortured latter-day artistic geniuses. More banally, it’s that people mostly do what they can get away with, and those who make a fortune for their employers or shareholders are often allowed to get away with way too much. But this particular iteration of the story comes with an unexpected twist, namely Gregg Wallace’s apparently unswerving belief that the real victim here is Gregg Wallace.He was hired, he protested on Instagram, to be “a real person with warmth, character, rough edges and all”, and for 21 years that was the brand; only now, “in a sanitised world”, have the rough edges suddenly become a problem. (Though isn’t the point of creative industries that they move constantly with the times? How many brands wouldn’t need a refresh after two decades?) But crucially, Wallace went on to add that he was recently diagnosed as autistic, after years of speculation that he might be neurodivergent: while he admits his language was sometimes inappropriate, he is angry that the BBC apparently did nothing “to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment”. (Dangerous for him, presumably, rather than the women, though I do see why you might be confused.) Friends of the presenter, meanwhile, blamed his reported habit of not wearing underpants – a recurrent theme of the allegations – on “hypersensitivity to labels and tight clothing”.As it happens, this week I read a moving interview with the England footballer Lucy Bronze, also diagnosed with autism as an adult. She spent her 20s struggling desperately to fit in, making herself “feel uncomfortable so that others felt more comfortable”, she told Women’s Health magazine: she would watch and copy her team-mate Jill Scott, teaching herself to make eye contact like the other players did even though it felt unnatural. (Even now, she finds hugging people difficult.)Let’s just say Bronze’s story will probably resonate a lot more than Wallace’s with the many, many autistic people quietly exhausting themselves trying to decipher and comply with all the unspoken etiquette of office life – the things most people just absorb without even thinking about it – who have nonetheless managednotto be accused of sexual harassment. No autistic person needs the added stigma of being associated with trouser-dropping.But even taking at face value Wallace’s argument that theBBCshould have done more to protect him from himself, what helps most autistic people (and actually many neurotypical people) thrive at work is setting very clear rules, spelling out exactly what is and isn’t done in your organisation. As luck would have it, that kind of clarity would be an absolute godsend for the prospective victims of sexual harassment, too.TV freelancers fearful of speaking up, union leader says after firing of Gregg WallaceRead moreThis week, the government announced that it will implement a form of Zelda’s law – named after Zelda Perkins, former PA to the rapist Harvey Weinstein – banning employers fromusing non-disclosure agreementsto silence victims of sexual harassment. It’s a nice change from the days when the Labour partystood accusedof asking its own staff to sign them, and an important step towards transparency. But for most women, it’s not a formal gagging order so much as fear of professional repercussions or a fumbled investigation that stops them speaking up.Ultimately, there’s no substitute for managers or board members actually managing: drawing red lines around what is acceptable, and then enforcing it from top to bottom, so that everyone – no matter how senior or junior, how good or bad at reading a room – knows where they stand. Of course, it’s embarrassing having to tell someone that their smutty jokes aren’t safe for work, that their manner is terrifying, that they can’t carry on like it’s the 1980s. But it’s even more embarrassing, as theMasterChefsaga illustrates, for everyone to end up this publicly in the soup.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I worked Friday nights and Saturday mornings and was paid $2.50 an hour. I was 14 and yearned for something more glamorous than slicing salami and cutting cheese – although I do remember my workmate and I regularly enjoying sharing the inch-thick end piece of chicken loaf that was too small to slice. I wore a blue shapeless uniform and was supposed to wear a hairnet but never did. There was an apron of sorts that we’d wipe our hands down after each customer had left, smearing meat stains and olive brine in patterns on the thick cotton.The two men who owned the stall were generous with their teenage staff, never minding if we scraped in a few minutes late for a shift or rearranged our hours because of some upcoming party. And at Christmas they’d always tuck an extra $20 note into our pay as a bonus. The day I forgot to put the guard down on the slicer and watched in shock as the front half of my finger dropped into the 100gram order of ham off the bone, they cleaned me up, bandaged my hand and sent me straight to the doctor for stitches.I must have been more of a liability than an asset.From there I graduated to a news agency in a major train station hub. Again, I had a blue uniform dress but this one had a Pilot Pen patch sewn on to the lapel. I worked with two other teenagers on Friday nights and we became fast friends, gossiping and chatting in between serving customers. We lived for the weekly piles of unsold magazines because we could rip off the covers to send back for a refund and take the rest home to read. This was how I kept up with all the latest from Hollywood, learned what hairstyles were in and studied pages of fashion that I could never afford to buy.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningMy third part-time job as a teenager was in a bakery near my parents’ house I rode my bike to on weekends. The shop was always warm by the time I arrived because the baker started early. At the end of each day, the unsold cakes and bread would be divvied up among the staff, and my favourite was the boston bun with the fake white icing. My boss drove a panel van and told vaguely inappropriate jokes but he was as kind in his own way as the owners of the deli, spending hours educating me about the lyrical genius of AC/DC’s Angus Young.I was always working weekends as a teenager. Trying to save for something or other. A new coat. A pair of skinny jeans. A boom box that still plays. When I wasn’t out with my school friends, I was sweeping floors, scrubbing meat slicers and learning how to count change.

It’s partly set in a suburban fish and chip shop where Tess and the shop owner’s nephew Sonny work. Together they cry as they slice onions, argue about the correct salting of chips and learn to navigate all those awkward and exciting feelings of your first crush.Unfortunately, my teenage working years were not so romantically blessed. Instead of meeting cute boys, I had to be content with slicing off my finger, becoming an ardent AC/DC fan and learning which magazine featured the best star sign prediction for a Virgo. I did serve Guy Pearce – fresh from his role in Neighbours – once, prompting my friend and I to giggle so much it took both of us to bag the loaf of bread. The beauty of writing Sonny & Tess is that I could finally invent the sort of gentle romance I longed for when I was 14 – complete with chicken salt, potato cakes and a generous serve of minimum chips.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

But where’s the next wave of working-class rock stars?Dan CaveAgeing music legends are thriving, but we are making it too hard for young talent to break throughThu 10 Jul 2025 10.08 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 10.11 EDTShareBritain, this summer at least, is going ballistic for the biggest bands from back in the day. The jubilance for the coming-back-together of Oasis andBlack Sabbathis understandable. These acts are legends born from Britain’s working class.The reunion of Noel and Liam Gallagher has caused most excitement. Ever since the Britpop brothers announced themselves with their1994 debut Definitely Maybe, their anthemic sounds have become part of the UK music canon. Wonderwall is an unofficial national anthem of sorts, one belted out after rounds of beers. With the Manchester indie rockers’ first shows in 16 years, more than 1 million fans will feel justified insplashing out about £766 on average(tickets, travel, hotels) in a total projected tocrest £1bn.The prime minister has even joined in with the celebration,promising to tackle ticket-pricing problems. For those who were priced out or who couldn’t get tickets, the culture industry has sagely transformed into Nostaliga Inc around the gigs. There’s anOasis photo exhibition in Manchester, while Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery iscelebrating Ozzy Osbourne all summer long, aligning with the Prince of Darkness’sfarewell gig at Villa Park. The city centre pub where the heavy metal pioneers learned to gig has been trussed up with Sabbath photos. A local brewery has even created a Sabbath beer.But look a bit closer and thepub covered in Sabbath images, the Crown, remains functionally derelict, owned by developers. In 2023,125 grassroots gig venues closed. Last year,43.8% reported an operating loss. Just11 of the 34 venues that Oasis played on their first tour exist today. Moneyspinning stadium concerts are in rude health, sure, but other venues?Yet the UK has thethird-largest domestic music market in the world– so how did we get here? Landlords and developers play a central role. Rents are rising, venues are being served with eviction notices, and developers are refusing to use historic cultural assets for their intended purposes. Noise complaints against venues are also rising as apartments shoot up around them. Lack of public money, too, plays a part. The Crown was, at one stage, in line for a Birmingham council loan to help put it back into use, but the authority is broke and withdrew.Elsewhere, Night Time Industries Association data shows the rising cost of living isstopping punters going out. Increasingly, we spend on one-off big events, such as this summer’s legends’ gigs. Live Nation Entertainment, which owns Ticketmaster, sells tickets for such gigs andmade $22.7bn in 2023.It’s not inevitable that musical dinosaurs dominate the charts. Here’s how we rescue pop in Britain | Eamonn FordeRead moreWithout the smaller venues and gigs, where will we discover the next great acts? And just as importantly, where will they earn a living? In an era dominated by streaming, which pays out less than a penny per play, diversified income is a must. Touring, important for name-making and earning, is increasingly unaffordable for those who come from the same class backgrounds as Ozzy and the Gallaghers. A musicians’ census in 2023 found thatalmost half earned under £14,000 a year. Working-class representation in the arts as a whole hashalved since Sabbath’s heyday. Noel Gallagher has questioned where the next working-class rock stars will come from.They can’t afford guitars, he says.Thegovernment admits, at least, there are serious issues, not least with equitable class access. But arts funding is largely static,despite discussion of a levy on arena and stadium gigsto keep breathing life into the smaller venues that help all artists starting out. In a topsy-turvy manner, the ageing legends part of the ecosystem is in rude health while younger talent ails.Leftwing critic Mark Fisher would say that this is exactly where capitalism would lead us: the cancellation of anything new. The system doesn’t care, it just needs to sell us more things: dynamically priced gig tickets, pop-up shop merch or our own nostalgia. But this represents a cultural cul-de-sac, with new talent unable to make its way into the mainstream. Not if it’s working class, anyway.This summer, regardless, more than a millionOasisfans will belt out the lyrics to songs such as Live Forever. Memories will be made that will last a lifetime. Just maybe, the gigs will inspire another generation to make music, and maybe – but hopefully definitely – we’ll be able to hear it.Dan Cave is a freelance journalist and writerExplore more on these topicsPop and rockOpinionOasisBlack SabbathIndieMetalClass issuesInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

Erecting walls won’t bring us peace and prosperityLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the president of BrazilThu 10 Jul 2025 08.47 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 08.58 EDTShareThe year 2025 should be a time of celebration, marking eight decades of theUnited Nations’ existence. But it risks going down in history as the year when the international order built since 1945 collapsed.The cracks had long been visible. Since the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, the intervention in Libya and the war in Ukraine, some permanent members of the security council have trivialised the illegal use of force. The failure to act vis-a-vis the genocide in Gaza represents a denial of the most basic values of humanity. The inability to overcome differences is fuelling a new escalation of violence in the Middle East, the latest chapter of whichincludestheattack on Iran.The law of the strongest also threatens the multilateral trading system. Sweeping tariffs disrupt value chains and push the global economy into a spiral of high prices and stagnation. The World Trade Organization has been hollowed out, and no one remembers theDoha development round.The 2008 financial collapse exposed the failure of neoliberal globalisation, but the world remained locked into the austerity playbook. The choice to bail out the ultra-wealthy and major corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens and small businesses has deepened inequality. In the past 10 years, the$33.9tn (£25tn) accumulated by the world’s richest 1%is equivalent to 22 times the resources needed to eradicate global poverty, according to a report by Oxfam.The ‘new world order’ of the past 35 years is being demolished before our eyes. This is how we must proceed | Gordon BrownRead moreThe stranglehold on the state’s capacity for action has led to public distrust in institutions. Discontent has become fertile ground for extremist narratives that threaten democracy and promote hate as a political project.Many countries have cut cooperation programmes instead of redoubling efforts to implement the sustainable development goals by 2030. The available resources are insufficient, the costs are high, access is bureaucratic, and the conditions imposed often fail to respect local realities.This is not about charity, but about addressing disparities rooted in centuries of exploitation, interference and violence against the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. In a world with a combinedGDP of over $100tn, it is unacceptable that more than700 million people still suffer from hungerand live without electricityor water.The richest countries bear the greatest historical responsibility for carbon emissions, yet it is the poorest who will suffer the most from the climate crisis. Theyear 2024 was the hottest in history, showing that reality is moving faster thanthe Paris agreement. The binding obligations of theKyoto protocolwere replaced by voluntary commitments, and the financing pledgesmade at COP 15 in Copenhagenin 2009 – promising $100bn annually – never materialised. The recent increase in Nato’s military spending makes that possibility even more remote.Attacks on international institutions ignore the concrete benefits the multilateral system has brought to people’s lives. If smallpox has been eradicated, the ozone layer preserved and labour rights still protected in much of the world, it is thanks to the efforts of these institutions.In times of growing polarisation, terms such as “deglobalisation” have become commonplace. But it is impossible to “deplanetise” our shared existence. No wall is high enough to preserve islands of peace and prosperity surrounded by violence and misery.Today’s world is vastly different from that of 1945. New forces have emerged, and new challenges have arisen. If international organisations seem ineffective, it is because their structure no longer reflects the current reality. Unilateral and exclusionary actions are worsened by the absence of collective leadership. The solution to the multilateralism crisis is not to abandon it, but to rebuild it on fairer and more inclusive foundations.This is the understanding that Brazil – whose vocation has always been to foster collaboration among nations – demonstrated during itsG20 presidency last yearand continues to demonstrate through its presidencies of the Brics andCop 30this year: that it is possible to find common ground even in adverse scenarios.There is an urgent need to recommit to diplomacy and rebuild the foundations of true multilateralism – one capable of answering the outcry of a humanity fearful for its future. Only then can we stop passively watching the rise of inequality, the senselessness of war and the destruction of our own planet.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is the president of BrazilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But it has to start within the industry – and with workersGeorge Hibberd appears alongside fellow pilot Todd Smith in theGuardian documentary Guilt TripThu 10 Jul 2025 05.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 08.40 EDTShareIlove flying. I’ve wanted to be a pilot since I was young. I grew up in Chichester, West Sussex, under a flight path used by Gatwick airport planes, and used to watch as they traversed the sky. In 2019, once I had qualified as an airline pilot, I began working for easyJet. Aviation connected me to my extended family in Canada, exposed me to different cultures and gave me an unforgettable career. But in November 2022, I handed over my airport ID card for the last time. I had grown increasingly anxious about the effect that our industry was having on the planet and, deep down, I knew that my concern for the climate crisis meant being an airline pilot was damaging my mental health.Despite no longer working in the industry, my love of aviation has driven me to protect our ability to fly for future generations. It inspires me to address the uncomfortable realities and decisions our industry now faces. Everyone knows that aviation has a gigantic emissions problem. In 2022, the UK’s domestic and international flights produced 29.6m tonnes of CO2equivalent emissions, accounting for about 7% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. This is projected to increase to11% by 2030, because while other sectors are decarbonising, aviation emissions will remain stable or even increase.But the emissions problem stems from an even bigger problem.One reportlooked at emissions reduction and efficiency targets set by individual aviation companies over the past 25 years; all but one were missed and quietly abandoned. The industry knows that it’s a big contributor to the climate crisis, but decisions are made within power structures and processes that have failed to address these problems.View image in fullscreenA still from the Guardian documentary Guilt Trip.Composite: The GuardianAirlines fight to outcompete each other on profit. They lobby governments to avoid the measures that we need to reduce emissions and protect the industry long-term. Meanwhile, governments have done little to regulate this aspect of the industry. This same short-term thinking is reflected in unions that support airport expansion in a bid to protect jobs and livelihoods. Unions have historically done a very good job at challenging employers over pay deals and terms and conditions. But in the aviation industry, unions are guilty of the same short-term thinking as employers.Aviation industry is ‘failing dramatically’ on climate, insiders sayRead moreThere are plenty of ideas for how we create an aviation industry that’s fit for the future, starting with a non-negotiable emissions budget that would set limits on the total amount of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide aviation can produce. We will also need aviation to pay its fair share in tax (currently, jet fuel is tax free). The government could introduce a frequent flyer levy, so those who use aviation the most (ie the very wealthy) would pay a tax to help fund the research and development of low-carbon technologies, which in turn could help to create more skilled jobs. In the future, a long-haul journey might comprise multiple, slower hops in a low-carbon hybrid electric aircraft, while shorter, essential flights, such as those to and from Scottish islands, could be taken in small electric aircraft.The problem isn’t a lack of options. The industry is full of highly skilled and motivated people who want to do good in the world. It’s that the industry suffers from a crisis of imagination. There are two prevailing visions for the future of aviation, neither of which are compelling. Industry leaders want eternal growth, relying on speculative technologies andunproven carbon capture. Climate activists and advocates want an immediate reduction in air travel. While aviation workers can often see right through the former vision, the latter is hardly inspiring.15:44Guilt Trip: pilots torn between flight and the fight for the planet - documentaryI was determined to do something about this, so in the spring of 2020 I joined Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers who want the industry to do better for the climate. We have been runningworkers’ assembliesthat invite aviation workers to grapple with these issues which have been mostly neglected by politics. We want these to serve as an example to the government and also unions, which could commission their own assemblies to give workers a voice in how our industry will have to change. One of the most damaging ways to tackle the climate crisis is by forcing policies on people. Workers’ assemblies can bridge social divides, give people agency and control over their lives, and rebuild trust in politics.There are so many ideas for how we could improve the future of flying. But first, we need to get to the heart of the power problem and start making decisions differently, both as an industry and as a country. Workers’ assemblies have to be part of the answer.George Hibberd is a former airline pilot and now works with aviation workers in Safe Landing to run workers’ assemblies.

For me this big, life-transforming event might have felt intensely personal, but the shared connection with other new parents, who were also learning on the job, not to mention the books – Your Baby Week By Week, The Wonder Weeks – can trick you into thinking that the path is a predictable one.From hourly feeds and wake-ups to sleeping through the night, breast- and bottle-feeding to solids, crawling to walking, maternity leave to nursery to school, the journey may have slightly different scenery, but the impression given is that ultimately it ends up in the same place.I knew, though, from my own family experience that for some parents the path begins to deviate. For some this happens in pregnancy or at birth. For others it might be in the early weeks or months, and for others still, far later. But there’s always a moment when the parent of an ill or disabled child realises that, suddenly, they are “parenting on another plane”.That’s what the former Guardian stafferMina Hollandcalls it. Her bookLifeblood, about her daughter Vida – who, before she was six months old, was diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia syndrome (DBAS), a rare genetic blood disorder for which there is no cure – has just been published. In it Holland tells of herdiscovery that her baby was seriously unwelland would need regular blood transfusions to stay alive, followed by the conception and birth of a son, Gabriel, who would turn out to be a match for a bone marrow transplant.In my thinking about parenting, and throughout the writing of this column, I have made every effort to not exclude parents of children who are disabled or unwell, or have health needs; babies and children who aren’t meeting their milestones or who require extra support or, as in Vida’s case, hospital treatment. What I hadn’t done before, though, is interrogate how it feels to have a baby or a child in hospital when every other parent you know continues on the typical trajectory that most people simply regard as “normal”. It is something that everyone would do better to understand. When parenting, we are not all in the same boat after all.For parents in this situation, it can sometimes be really hard to have open conversations about this with friends and family. On one side there is often a squeamishness or discomfort when it comes to disability and illness. On the other there’s a parent who is working through feelings of grief, anger and, as a friend put it, “the sheer fucking unfairness” of their circumstances.“I definitely did have moments of bitterness and really resenting other people’s healthy kids,” Holland tells me. “Some friends came over with their babies who were the same age and one of them was in Vida’s bouncer just bouncing up and down, gurgling, just pink and bonny, and I remember feeling furious.” She wants to emphasise that people could be thoughtless, but they weren’t bad or cruel. But being witness to, say, a WhatsApp conversation in which your NCT group is all talking about how traumatic the first set of immunisations has been when your baby has already been subjected to hundreds of needle pricks and other medical interventions? That is going to hurt. And for parents on the other side of the equation, it’s a difficult tension to think that by living your life as usual you might be making someone else’s day worse.The boy who came back: the near-death, and changed life, of my son MaxRead moreParents of seriously unwell or disabled children receive daily triggers reminding them of their difference. Parents on a more typical journey of course want to show off their children’s achievements, without realising that those first steps, or the drawing a child has done of their mum, proudly posted, has the potential to make their friend feel as if their heart is breaking. For months, Vida had a Hickman line, which meant she couldn’t swim or go in the bath. You can understand how seeing a picture of another child at the beach might make a mother of a child with a serious disease feel. It’s not about people feeling they can’t share – it’s more about understanding how isolated parents in these circumstances might feel and, while trying not to be tactless and crass, recognising that if you unwittingly make others bristle, that doesn’t mean it will last.Several years later, Holland says she no longer begrudges the mothers who were distressed by their babies’ immunisations: “Over time, I’ve grown more compassionate about the vulnerability of new mothers under even the smoothest of circumstances.” It was, she says, a time when she was quite difficult to help. Other people’s positivity was annoying, even though hope and positivity was something that she also needed. As Archie Bland put it in his recent essay about his son Max, whose near-death in infancy resulted in cerebral palsy: “The truth is that it was veryhard to say the right thing to melast year.”‘We need hope, not platitudes’: what I’ve learned as the parent of an ill childRead moreIt’s not surprising that the parents of children who are very unwell often find solace in communities of those going through similar experiences, who understand the nuances. Disconnecting from social media, as Holland did, and focusing on those shared experiences instead helped her on the path to acceptance. If you’re close to the parent of a child with a serious disease or a disability, it can simply be a case of being present. And also of recognising that some of the difficult feelings they are experiencing are totally natural.Accepting a radically different version of parenthood from the one you expected is a painful process. “No one could catalyse my acceptance of it, but they could simply be there, showing they were thinking of us – which they did,” says Holland. Anger is part of the process, but it doesn’t mean that any parent caring for an ill or disabled child loves them any less. My own mother has always said of my brother’s complex needs, which include autism and epilepsy: “I have never wanted any other child but my own.” Holland says the same – because Vida’s genetic mutation is intrinsic to her: “If she didn’t have it, she wouldn’t be her.”Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.

It would offer voters  a radical alternative to LabourAdam Ramsay is a Scottish journalist and Green party memberThu 10 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTShareThe Green party leadership election – by far the highest-profile in the party’s history – has largely been seen through the traditional lens of left and centre. On the one hand isZack Polanski, the deputy leader and London assembly member whose insurgent campaign has attracted a surge of former Corbynites to the party. He’s seen as the left candidate. The incumbent,Adrian Ramsay(no relation to me), and his new running-mate,Ellie Chowns– both rural MPs – have been described aseco-centrists.While there is some truth to that, it’s not quite so simple: after all, Ramsay and Chowns, like Polanski, have called for awealth taxandrenationalisations, and havedenouncedIsraeli genocide in Gaza. This is hardly Starmerite centrism. To think about the real distinction, it might be an idea to go to Lancaster in 2007.At the time, the party was holding a tense annual conference that was split between two currents whose differences help make sense of what’s happening today. I was one of the “realos” (realists). We wore suits, hoping any passing journalist would take us seriously. The other side were known as the “fundis” (fundamentalists), and they seemed to have exaggerated their hippy garb. I remember two people in druid gowns – perhaps because of genuine pagan beliefs, but probably also because they were trolling us.The realo v fundi terminology originated in disputes within the German Greens in the 1980sover whether to enter coalition governments.In the party in England and Wales, the stakes were lower: in 2007, we were holding a referendum on whether the party should have a leader, replacing the then system of having two “principal speakers”.For realos, this change was a statement of intent: it was about becoming serious. For fundis, there was, as the realoNatalie Bennett, who joined in 2006, put it to me, “a great deal of concern that this would be a major change in the culture of the party”. We won the referendum, but the leadership role it produced is highly limited. The leader gets the title, a desk, a salary if they don’t have one, press office time and one vote on the party executive. They can advocate, but can’t change policy, choose spokespeople or direct strategy. And they’re easily replaced: elections are every two years.Many older Greens remain queasy at the idea of a leader – certainly a “strong” leader. Both this queasiness and the limited power have shaped the party ever since, and meant that leadership contests have tended to focus on organisation-building strategy or presentational emphasis and style, not policy. In the first one, in 2008, the realo MEP Caroline Lucas and permanently besuited 26-year-old Norwich councillor Adrian Ramsay were elected leader and deputy virtually unopposed; they advocated that resources be focused on the two target constituencies in which they were the candidates – leading to Lucas becoming the first Green MP in 2010.Afterwards, though, she was busy in Westminster, unable to tour the country building the party on the back of this progress and, despite the thriving anti-austerity movement, in which many of us were active, party membership stagnated.Our generation of (then) Young Greens developed a broadly shared understanding that the party was held back by two main things: the perception that we were just about the environment (rather than a party for the millions of leftwing voters abandoned by New Labour); and a fear of conflict. I had a mantra: “Greens can either be controversial, or ignored. Too often, the party chooses the latter.”In 2012, Lucas and Ramsay stood down, and Bennett won the election – largely because she presented a serious plan for membership growth. She toured the country and cheerfully adopted leftist language. In her first leader’s speech, she said: “Ask not what the trade unions can do for us. Ask what we can do for the trade unions.” By 2014, membership had more than doubled toalmost 28,000. In 2015, itsurged past 60,000… until Jeremy Corbyn ran for Labour leader, and thousands left to join that project instead.Many, though, didn’t leave, and the legacy of that membership surge remained, both in party income and in hundreds of activists getting themselves elected as councillors (a phenomenon the MP and 2018-2021 co-leader Siân Berry describes to me as “Natalie’s legacy”). Since the end of Corbynism, space has opened up again on the left, and this, combined with effective mobilisation of resources, led to hundreds more Green councillors and four MPs in 2024.But the last year has felt stagnant. With Starmer lurching right, there’s an obvious space in British politics that the Greens are struggling to take. The average score in the past 10 polls for a Westminster election – about 11% – is better than ever. But sluggish compared with Reform UK.In April, Adrian Ramsay was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme whether he agreed with the party’s policy that “trans men are men, and trans women are women”, and failed to answer five times – triggeringcondemnation from the Young Greens. Two weeks later, his co-leader, Carla Denyer, announced that she wouldn’t seek re-election and, in May, Polanski launched an energetic campaign with the slogan “We need bold leadership. Now.”Ramsay and Chowns’ campaign is, instead, focused on their parliamentary roles –being “in the room where it happens”. This seems to me a mistake: historically, Greens have thrived when the leader isn’t stuck in Westminster. For some longstanding members, Corbynites joining to “back Zack” is scary. Some fear Polanski’s mooted ecopopulism, worrying it will attract people who “aren’t really Green”. Much of this fear isn’t about policy difference, but culture. Older fundi-types who liked Corbyn’s socialism but feared that the movement behind his leadership was a “cult of personality” now have similar worries about Polanski. Chowns and Ramsay, on the other hand, exude the kind of gentle, conflict-averse, consensual leadership style that the fundis used to advocate (sitting uncomfortably with their hyper-realo insistence on the centrality of Westminster). In other words, the Green party division isn’t really so much about left and centre as it is about differing ideas about political power and how to wield it.I would make the Green party a force at the heart of British politics. That’s why I’m running to be co-leader | Ellie ChownsRead moreFor me, Polanski takes the realo acceptance of the need for charismatic leadership and blends it with the fundis’ belief in extraparliamentary organising and social movements. His position – that the party should be bolder in articulating its positions, that it shouldn’t be embarrassed by opinions that the Daily Mail considers scandalous (but are shared with much of the population), that it should lead the left – isn’t a new, un-Green one. It’s one that our generation of members has been making for two decades. Indeed, it was the approach that delivered the vast membership surge in 2013-2015, which made the subsequent electoral successes possible. And it’s the approach that will be needed to stop the recent membership surge directing their energies to Zarah Sultana’s new project.British politics is in a moment of flux. The two-party system is clearly breaking down. Huge numbers of people fundamentally distrust our whole system, and large numbers of seats, particularly left-leaning urban constituencies, are actively looking for a proudly progressive alternative to Labour. Polanski’s bolder platform offers Greens a chance to step up. I hope the party takes it.Adam Ramsay is a journalist and Green party member.

But should finding out something is a cheap dupe really make us enjoy it less?Nell StevensThu 10 Jul 2025 11.25 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 11.38 EDTShareMany years ago, I met a man in a pub in Bloomsbury who said he worked at theBritish Museum. He told me that every single item on display in the museum was a replica, and that all the original artefacts were locked away in storage for preservation.I was shocked and challenged him. It surely could not be the case that millions of annual visitors to the British Museum were encountering and experiencing not tangible, concrete treasures of human history, but the shallow simulacra of replicas. I may have even used the term “fraud”.Yet on my way home that night, I began to question my own experiences at the British Museum. I wondered what it meant if the Greek water jar I had been so moved by, depicting a woman who may have been Sappho bent over a scroll, had in fact been a worthless copy. Did that make the experience any less real?Later, Googling, I discovered that none of what the man had told me was true. The artefacts in the British Museumareoriginal, unless otherwise explicitly stated. It was the man who claimed to work there who was a fake.View image in fullscreenAre the brushstrokes too rough, the colours too unusual? … visitors admire Samson and Delilah by Peter Paul Rubens at the National Gallery in London.Photograph: Guy Bell/AlamySo began my years-long fascination with the question of fakes, and the way we feel in their presence. If that Greek water jarhadbeen a fake, I could never have known just by looking with an inexpert but appreciative eye. Would it devalue my overwhelming sense of connection to the past in the moment I saw it? This is one of the questions that led me to write my new novel, The Original, about fakes and the people who fall for them. Following a female art forger at the end of the 19th century, the book is about making and believing in fake art, fake stories, and fake people. I wanted to think, in the story, about the experience of being duped, because we live in a world that feels, at times, increasingly fake.Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum ofArtin New York, has suggested that about 40% of artworks for sale are fake. Yan Walther, chief of the Fine Arts Expert Institute, puts the figure at 50%.That muscular back! Those fleshy breasts! The National Gallery’s ‘fake’ Rubens looks very real to meRead moreLast month, debate over the authenticityof Rubens’ Samson and Delilah, bought by the National Gallery for £2.5m in 1980, reignited. The painting, dating from 1609 or 1610, was lost for centuries, and since arriving at the National Gallery has been subject to repeated controversies surrounding its authenticity. Are the brushstrokes too rough, the colours too unusual? Is the composition too different to copies of the original that were made at the time it was painted? Speaking to the Guardian, the former National Gallery curator Christopher Brown, who oversaw its original acquisition, appeared to suggest that the gallery itself had been responsible for replacing the painting’s backing board, so destroying evidence about the painting’s real age and provenance (he later went back on this statement) which sparked suspicion the Gallery may have covered up a fake for decades. The National Gallery responded by saying: “Samson and Delilah has long been accepted as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. Not one single Rubens specialist has doubted that the picture is by Rubens. A full discussion of the panel was published by Joyce Plesters and David Bomford in the Gallery’s Technical Bulletin in 1983, when Christopher Brown was the Gallery’s curator responsible for the picture. Their findings remain valid, including their unequivocal statement that the panel was attached to a support before the picture was acquired by the National Gallery.”View image in fullscreenCo-owner of the Vienna Museum of Art Fakes Diana Grobe with a Tom Keating work painted after the French impressionist Jean Puy.Photograph: Alex Halada/AFP/Getty ImagesThis latest controversy follows a study conducted a few years earlier, during which an AI analysis of its brushstroke patterns found there was a 90% probability the painting was fake. I visited the painting after that story broke, having by then developed a slight obsession with questions of authenticity. It was the autumn of 2021 and we were all still adjusting to existing in the world beyond lockdowns. Seeing a painting in the flesh felt novel; the colours vivid: Delilah’s illuminated neck, Samson’s gleaming muscles, the shadowed scissors at the moment his hair is cut. The texture of those questionable brushstrokes was exhilarating. I stood in front of the painting and I wanted it to be real because I liked it so much.A 2014 study published in the journal Leonardo tested how the belief in authenticity of art shapes our perception of it. Participants were shown paintings labelled either originals or, erroneously, copies, then asked to rate their experience. Paintings that were labelled as copies were consistently rated as less moving, less well-made, less well-composed and the work of less talented artists. It’s a stark example of the extent to which our experience of art is moulded by the story we are told about it: the value we place on authenticity trumps reason, perception, our own eyes. A copy is automatically worse, even when it’s not really a copy.View image in fullscreenWoman Reading Music, 1935-1940, by Han van Meegeren.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThis same quirk of human impulse comes up in all sorts of other contexts. There are those expert sommeliers who are unable, under study conditions, to tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine. So-called “dupes” of high-end fashion items are a part of the clothing industry’s ecosystem; the internet is full of videos of vox pops in which people fail to identify, when faced with two near-identical outfits, which one cost tens and which thousands of pounds. Human beings are pretty inept at understanding our world without context, without story.As you wander through the Museum of Art Fakes in Vienna, an institution dedicated to showcasing the art of forgery, what strikes you most is how unconvincing it all is, how hazy and dilapidated the fakes look. The colours look wrong. The materials look cheap. The brushstrokes look lazy and the way the paint adheres to the canvases seems insubstantial. But then, how could these pieces look otherwise, housed as they are in the Museum of Art Fakes? Removed from this cheapening context,Han van Meegeren’s Vermeers, once pronounced “the finest gems of the master’s oeuvre”, appear lovely, almost otherworldly. To emerge from the Museum of Art Fakes and head straight into Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum to view works by Vermeer and Rubens is an upending experience: you feel so certain, looking at those paintings, that you’re in the presence of originals. Then you think about how they might appear if they were displayed in the unassuming basement gallery of the Museum of Art Fakes, and that certainty begins to fade.It’s striking that we have turned to AI to help us solve our authenticity questions (where humans err, artificial intelligence can distil brushstroke patterns to mere data points) when AI is simultaneously creating fakes at a rate previously unimaginable. Our online world is littered with photographs of people who don’t exist, articles recommending books that have never been written, videos of imaginary places. Even as we learn to spot the tell-tale glitches of an AI-generated image (too many fingers, those terrifying misaligned teeth, an Escher-like impossible quality to the structure of buildings, furniture, bodies), AI improves and outpaces us again. It’s embarrassing to admit to having felt a rush of interest or pleasure at a video of, say, a lamp-lit hillside village in the rain, only to realise it’s a nonsense, empty fantasy, and worse: twee. To realise you have fallen for an AI-generated image, song or essay, untouched by a human mind, is to feel at once less human and horribly, vulnerably human: foolish and naive.View image in fullscreenMaster forger Tom Keating in 1977.Photograph: John Dee/ShutterstockHuman fakes, when contrasted with the emptiness of AI, start to seem quite affecting: the mischief of them, the skill and the audacity of the endeavour. Even the art market, on occasion, agrees: the works of prolific forger Tom Keating, who produced thousands of fakes in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, are now collector’s items in their own right, to the extent thatfakes of Tom Keating fakes began to appear too. Perhaps it’s no wonder that such forgeries can move us, designed as they are to do just that, to be paintings of paintings and at the same time, blank canvases upon which we project all the things we want to care about and experience when we look at art.When I think back to my conversation with the man in the pub years ago, it strikes me that there is something wonderful in having believed him. Perhaps there is beauty in embracing the lessons taught by fakes, that what we bring to art is our human selves: subjective, easily bamboozled, ready to be moved. The man who entertained himself one winter’s night by telling a silly lie to a credulous stranger, inadvertently led me instead to something true.The Original by Nell Stevens is published by Scribner (£16.99).

Nanny McPhee (2005)Emma Thompson’s Mary-Poppins-with-warts is a dog’s dinner of a movie, but Celia Imrie amuses herself (and occasionally us) with a broader-than-usual turn as the widowed Mrs Quickly, who is pursuing a father of seven (Colin Firth) forced by his aunt to marry within 30 days or face penury. Imrie cites this as one of her favourite roles, despite having a live tarantula on her head in one scene and a wriggling worm in her mouth in another.19. House of Whipcord (1974)Among Imrie’s earliest credits was this exploitation horror about a secret, sadistic correctional institute for young women. Barely glimpsed amid the frenzy of whipping, she tries to alert the outside world by throwing a Bible from a window. “Whenever I am in one of those awful out-of-the-frying-pan situations where you escape only to end up back where you started, I still use the phrase: ‘How House of Whipcord!’” she recalled in her 2012 autobiography, The Happy Hoofer.18. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)View image in fullscreenAll guns blazing … in The Phantom Menace.Photograph: LucasfilmA casting director spotted Imrie opposite Harold Pinter in his play The Hothouse and recommended her to George Lucas for the tiny role of the fighter pilot Bravo 5. She wore rust-coloured jodhpurs, but, on Lucas’s orders and to her chagrin, no lipstick: “I did my bit and fired my guns, but I haven’t a notion what side I was on, who I was firing the guns at, who I was hitting and whether or not we won.”17. Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001)Nothing very much for Imrie to do as Una, the best chum of Bridget’s mother, beyond presiding over the barbecue and offering to sieve the gravy, but she gets the occasional faux pas and adds generally to the impression of a high-calibre cast free of dead wood. She returned for extra helpings in the sequels.16. Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie (2016)View image in fullscreenRivals … Imrie with Jennifer Saunders(right)and Jane Horrocks in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie.Photograph: David Appleby/Fox Searchlight/AllstarFeeling more like a victory lap than a fully fledged movie, this allows Imrie to reprise her sitcom role as Claudia Bing, the PR rival to Jennifer Saunders’ Edina Monsoon. It is Claudia who blows the whistle after Edina apparently kills Kate Moss by knocking her into the Thames, and Claudia who prevents Jon Hamm from rushing valiantly to the model’s aid.15. Highlander (1986)View image in fullscreen‘Full rustic wench costume’ … in Highlander.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyImrie was kitted out in “full rustic wench costume” for this time-travelling folkloric fantasy, butChristopher Lambertwas too weedy to lift her on to his horse for the intended goodbye kiss. Instead, she simply grabs his calf and jogs beside him “while delivering the dialogue that I should have been doing as we galloped along together”. There was more drama for her off-screen than on: she was briefly snatched from her hotel by a man who declared himself intent on continuing the Pictish tradition of kidnapping women.14. Revelation (2001)This The-Omen-meets-The-Da-Vinci-Code potboiler stars James D’Arcy as the cryptographer uncovering a plot to revive the antichrist. Po-facedTerence Stampand Udo Kier have considerably less fun than Derek Jacobi, seen fleetingly as a librarian who brandishes a pair of cotton gloves and promises to check Isaac Newton’s papers “for stains and so on”. Imrie is the hero’s mother, burnt to a crisp in only her second scene and squeezing out her final words in a high-pitched squeak.13. Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again! (2018)Razzle-dazzle … watch Imrie swap her mortar board and gown for a feather boa.Most of the razzle-dazzle in this part prequel, part sequel comes courtesy of Cher, who makes her entrance by helicopter. But Imrie lets her hair down as the vice-chancellor of Oxford university on graduation day. Once Lily James, as the young version of Meryl Streep’s character, Donna, has warbled her share of When I Kissed the Teacher and zoomed off across the quad, Imrie leaps from the stage trailing a canary-yellow feather boa and trilling: “What a mad day!”12. Imagine Me and You (2005)View image in fullscreenNuanced delights … with Anthony Head and Piper Perabo in Imagine Me and You.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyIn this London-set lesbian romcom, the newlywed Piper Perabo leaves her husband for the florist (Lena Headey) who supplied their wedding bouquets. As the bride’s mother, Imrie nails the character in her haughty opening lines: “Darling, tell your father he can’t wear that suit … I’ve seen better dressed crab.” But there are nuanced delights to come, including the thawing of relations between Imrie and her husband (Anthony Head) during the sort of last-minute race through traffic that was compulsory in Britcoms of theRichard Curtisera.11. A Cure for Wellness (2016)If there were ever a movie star in dire need of a spell at a Swiss spa resort, it’s the sickly looking Dane DeHaan. In this horror inspired by Magic Mountain and Shutter Island, he is the executive sent to retrieve a colleague, only to find madness and murder afoot. Imrie, first seen doing a crossword with her fellow bathrobed guests, dispenses gobbets of backstory about the institute’s sinister origins. With prim lips and loaded stares, she delivers her portentous dialogue with aplomb. “There is a terrible darkness here,” she warns DeHaan. Next stop: the morgue.10. Year By the Sea (2016)View image in fullscreenManic pixie dream aunt … in Year By the Sea.Photograph: Montabela Productions/Kobal/ShutterstockEmerging from the Cape Cod fog like a mermaid, Imrie plays one of the wacky catalysts for a disillusioned writer’s journey of self-discovery, offering a slogan for every occasion: “Who wants the burden of control?” “If we can’t show our feelings, we might as well be men!” She has a fine rapport with the film’s lead, Karen Allen (of Raiders of the Lost Ark), but her character is essentially a manic pixie dream aunt who twirls coloured scarves, whoops among the waves and impishly ignores the “Do Not Enter” signs around the lighthouse. ImagineFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, but served as a side, not a main.9. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011)View image in fullscreenPastures new … Imrie and Judi Dench in The Best Exotic Marigold.Photograph: Fox Searchlight Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarWith Maggie Smith, Judi Dench,Bill Nighyand Tom Wilkinson, this Brits-in-India getaway is the Avengers Assemble of older British character actors. Imrie gets the slimmest pickings plot-wise, as the grandmother who opts for Jaipur rather than an eternity of babysitting. She packs her shrewd smirk and that reliable libido (on securing an airline upgrade: “I had to flirt so hard with the travel agent it was practically phone sex”) and gets several other choice lines, complaining about getting old (“I don’t want to be the first person they let off the plane in a hostage crisis”) and offering terse advice on how the unhappily married Nighy could celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary (“Perhaps a minute’s silence?”). A 2015 sequel offered her character a glimmer of romance.8. What We Did on Our Holiday (2014)Or Outnumbered: The Movie. The writer-directors Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin preserve the partly improvised nature of their kids-say-the-darnedest-things sitcom while replacing its stars, Hugh Dennis and Claire Skinner, with David Tennant and Rosamund Pike. The “sit” in this “com” is the birthday party of their dying grandpa (Billy Connolly). After he expires on the beach in the company of the children, Imrie is called in from the child welfare unit. Reacting with understated incredulity to the kids’ tales of Viking funerals and the Norse god Odin, she rounds up their crayon drawings as evidence.7. The Borrowers (1997)View image in fullscreenDelightful … with Jim Broadbent in The Borrowers.Photograph: Working Title Films/AllstarMary Norton’s adventure novel about a tiny resourceful family who live in the skirting boards and hide from “human beans” has been the source of numerous adaptations, including Studio Ghibli’s Arrietty in 2010. This inventive British version, with Imrie andJim Broadbentdelightful as the parents and John Goodman in full panto mode as the hissable developer threatening their home, is a charmer. Gemma Jackson’s production design is a special highlight. “It was fabulous walking around the gigantic chair and table legs and sitting on huge cotton reels,” said Imrie.6. Hilary and Jackie (1998)View image in fullscreenTenacious mother … with Charles Dance in Hilary and Jackie.Photograph: Moviestore/ShutterstockIn a structurally daring biopic scripted by Frank Cottrell Boyce and carved into two contrasting perspectives, Imrie plays the tenacious mother of the cellist Jacqueline du Pré (Emily Watson), encouraging competition with her sister Hilary (Rachel Griffiths). “If you want to be together, you’ve got to be as good as each other,” she insists, establishing a pattern of rivalry that splashes over into their love lives.5. Love Sarah (2020)In her early scenes as the grieving mother Mimi, Imrie makes you realise that, with the help of some heavyweight roles, she could have approached the gravitas of her pal Glenda Jackson (she was Goneril to Jackson’s Lear in 2016). Just look at her deep grooves of experience and regret, her instant access to purse-lipped froideur. That dissipates as Mimi helps to launch the west London patisserie her late daughter never got the chance to open and tensions vanish beneath a dusting of feelgood whimsy thicker than several inches of icing sugar. But Imrie is highly watchable in her flirtations with the neighbourhood inventor (Bill Paterson), whom she invites up for coffee. If it isn’t decaf, he says, he’ll be “up all night”. Cue the naughty Imrie twinkle: “Lucky me.”4. Malevolent (2018)This haunted-house horror stars Florence Pugh and Ben Lloyd-Hughes as bogus ghostbusters hired to rid a country mansion of the screams of the wee poppets who were murdered there. Imrie was their foster mother, her son the killer, so it’s no surprise when she announces that the brats had it coming. Whatisstriking is how she maintains her cool, and keeps the volume down, even once she turns torture-porn-style aggressor. “It’s quiet time now,” she whispers, approaching her victim’s mouth with a needle and thread. It all goes a bit wild after she whips the hacksaw out.3. Calendar Girls (2003)View image in fullscreenCherry on the cake … in Calendar Girls.Photograph: AlamyTime has been kind to this factually inspired Britcom about the Women’s Institute members – played by stars including Helen Mirren, Julie Walters and Linda Bassett – who strip for a charity calendar, ruffling feathers but raising enough to fund an entire leukaemia ward at their local hospital. Eventually, they end up in Hollywood, hob-nobbing with Jay Leno and the thrash metal band Anthrax, of all people. Imrie gives lots of comic side-eye as she works out with a hot young trainer in preparation for the big shoot; she is the only one to express disappointment that her breasts will be tastefully concealed in the final product. “Yours good, are they?” asks Mirren, to which she coolly replies: “They’retremendous.” Accept no Imrie-tations.2. Finding Your Feet (2017)View image in fullscreenFree spirit … with Imelda Staunton in Finding your Feet.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyImelda Staunton is the hoity-toity snob (“Lady Nevershit”, as she is referred to) who flees her cheating husband and moves in with her wild-swimming, dope-smoking, bisexual sister, Bif (Imrie), in the latter’s council flat, as well as joining her and classmates Timothy Spall and Joanna Lumley at the local dance group. Imrie is in free spirit mode again, but more complex here than in Year By the Sea – although, weirdly, both films show her boogieing to the Big Bopper’s Chantilly Lace. Until cancer puts paid to her Extinction Rebellion vim, she exudes sexual swagger. “Thirty minutes and I’ll be good to go,” says her date, waggling a blister pack of Viagra. “I’ll get you there in 10,” she grins.1. Blue Black Permanent (1992)View image in fullscreenFaintly formidable … in Blue Black Permanent.Photograph: BFIThe only feature to be directed by the Orkney-based poet and film-maker Margaret Tait gave Imrie an early dramatic lead. She plays Barbara, a discontented photographer puzzling over the life and death of her mother, who drowned years earlier. Was it sleepwalking or suicide? Sifting episodes from her own and her mother’s childhood, Barbara dreams of flying, wrestles with guilt (“I should have been able to stop her, or save her”) and spars with her own lover, played by the perpetually sanguine Jack Shepherd. This gives Imrie room to exhibit her brittle, indignant intelligence and to sigh an awful lot. With her faintly formidable air, it’s easy to imagine she could have become the next Charlotte Rampling.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedCelia ImrieBill NighyEmma ThompsonAbsolutely Fabulous: The MovieTerence StampDerek JacobifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her great-grandmother was related toCharles Darwin. And now she works in the courthouse where the “trial of the century” – in which a high school teacher was accused of illegally teaching evolution – began exactly a century ago on Thursday.From the archive, 11 July 1925: Evolution trial begunRead moreNo one has a perspective on the “Scopes monkey trial” quite like Pat Guffey, a former high school biology teacher in Dayton, Tennessee. As the city prepares to mark the centenary with a week-long festival including a dramatic re-enactment of the court battle, she is aware how its legacy proved both a blessing and a curse.“So many people have the idea that we are uneducated, we can’t speak correctly, we can’t write a sentence correctly, we walk down the street barefoot with tattered clothes,” says Guffey, now 79 and the Rhea county historian. “We are hillbillies, maybe, we have a hickey accent, maybe, but still, everybody talks their own way.”Guffey was a teenager when Dayton hosted the premiere of Stanley Kramer’s 1960 filmInherit the Wind, a classic Hollywood account of the trial that immortalised the town as “the buckle of the Bible belt”. She recalls: “That was the biggest blunder. Oh, mercy! That was horrible.”One hundred years later the jurists, journalists and onlookers who crowded into the courtroom on sweltering summer days have passed into history. But the Scopes monkey trial continues to rhyme with the book bans, Christian fundamentalism and challenges to scientific expertise amid today’s cultural and religious divides.Brenda Wineapple, author ofKeeping the Faith: God, Democracy and the Trial That Riveted a Nation, says the trial touches “everything from the constitutional issues to civil liberties issues but also even civil rights issues about what you can read or think or censor. What should be taught in schools? Who should decide that? And even beyond that, the kind of anxiety that just the word science seems to trigger in people”.It was March 1925 when theTennesseestate legislature passed a law that made it illegal to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals”.TheAmerican Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) in New York decided to challenge its violation of the separation of church and state as unconstitutional. The ACLU took out an advert in the Chattanooga Daily Times newspaper offering to defend any teacher prosecuted under the law.Business leaders in Dayton, then a town of just 1,800 people located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, scented a PR coup. They recruited 24-year-old John Scopes, a local sports coach and first-year teacher, to stand as defendant in the test case, even though he said he did not remember teaching Darwin’s theory. He was arrested on 7 May 1925 and charged with teaching the theory of evolution.The plan worked and the media circus came to town. Dayton had to build a new airstrip to deal with the influx of 200 reporters and a new telegraph office for the more than 2m words they would transmit. It would be the first trial broadcast live on radio, presaging OJ Simpson, Oscar Pistorius and all the blockbuster cases that would follow.The defence was led byClarence Darrow, 68, a nationally renowned lawyer who argued that the Tennessee law was unconstitutional because it made the Bible, a religious document, the standard of truth in a public institution. The prosecution was led byWilliam Jennings Bryan, 65, a former secretary of state and presidential candidate who was the most famous fundamentalist Christian spokesperson in the country.The acerbic journalist HL Mencken, who dubbed it the “monkey trial”,wrote of Bryan: “He has these hillbillies locked up in his pen and he knows it. His brand is on them. He is at home among them. Since his earliest days, indeed, his chief strength has been among the folk of remote hills and forlorn and lonely farms.“Now with his political aspirations all gone to pot, he turns to them for religious consolations. They understand his peculiar imbecilities. His nonsense is their ideal of sense. When he deluges them with his theologic bilge they rejoice like pilgrims disporting in the river Jordan.”This was the Jim Crow era and Tennessee was the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. The Chicago Defender, a Black newspaper,wrotethat if Darwin was right about evolution, white people would “have to admit that there is no fundamental difference between themselves and the race they pretend to despise”.But the judge excluded testimony from scientific experts. Darrow fought back by calling Bryan himself to testify as an expert on the Bible, posing questions such as where did Cain get his wife, how many people were on Earth 3,000 years ago and how many languages are there? As tempers frayed, the judge intervened and called an adjournment for the day.The outcome of the trial was a foregone conclusion, however. The jury deliberated for nine minutes before finding Scopes guilty. He wasfined $100. In January 1927 the Tennessee supreme court overturned the conviction because the judge – not the jury – had set the fine, though the court also upheld the law’s constitutionality.View image in fullscreenWilliam Jennings Bryan, leaning over the table at left, speaking with Clarence Darrow, seated, in the crowded courtroom in 1925.Photograph: Bryan College Archives and Rhea County Historical Society.Bryan was still in town when he died five days after the trial ended. A nextdoor neighbour called Mr Andrews went to fetch Guffey’s great-grandfather, Dr Walter Thomason, in an effort to revive him. She says: “He was already dead at the time, before they had gotten there even. He had died in his sleep. My great-grandfather signed the death certificate.”She adds: “Mr Andrews liked what they called a hot toddy and so he told my great grandfather, ‘Doc, do you think it would be good to give him a hot toddy?’ My grandfather said, ‘No, he’s already dead.’ But Mrs Bryan heard that and said, ‘No liquor has ever touched his lips; nor will any do so now.’”Guffey also points out that Thomason’s wife, her great-grandmother, was a Darwin. “We have traced our our lineage back to Charles Darwin. It’s not real close but it is traced back to him.”The state law against teaching evolution remained on the books until 1967. Guffey, who went to school in Dayton, recalls: “It was just gone over, like you turn a page and nothing was said about it. Most of the biology teachers then were coaches so they were very interested in doing football plays and giving us worksheets. We did do some dissection but very little, so there wasn’t a whole lot going on.”When Guffey became a biology teacher herself, working from 1983 to 2011, the religion versus science debate that played out in court still cast a shadow. “I always tried to give my students both points of view and tell them what both meant but some of them didn’t want to get into that. They didn’t want to explain evolution because they didn’t even want to talk about it.”Guffey now works at theRhea County Historical Society, which is based in the original courthouse, a designated national historic landmark that includes a museum. The court offices moved to a new building a few years ago.Dayton will mark the centenary from 11 to 19 July witha festivalthat includes a symposium on the trial and activities on the courthouse lawn and around town. The star attraction is the long-running play Destiny in Dayton, adapted in 1988 from the transcript of the trial and performed in the original courtroom.Tom Davis, 74, one of the festival organisers, says: “We have people of all persuasions in the cast. It’s not that you have to be a creationist or an evolutionist to be in this. We’re just looking for actors who are willing to do a sincere job. I’m not in the production itself but I know the cast regularly gets together after rehearsals, go over to one of the local restaurants and sit and talk about all sorts of stuff, including these issues.”Destiny in Dayton the city’s quiet way of pushing back at the mythology of Inherit the Wind, a play that continues to be regularly revived – anew productionopens at Washington’s Arena Stage next year. Co-authors Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee changed the name of Dayton to Hillsboro and intended their work, like Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, to make a coded critique of McCarthyism.The movie version continues to endure with indelible performances by Spencer Tracy and Fredric March as the duelling lawyers. Gene Kelly plays a cynical big city newsman, inspired by Mencken,who remarks: “I may be rancid butter, but I’m on your side of the bread.”View image in fullscreenLarry Jones as William Jennings Bryan; Tony McCuiston as Tom Stewart; Dwight Henry as attorney Ben McKenzie, in the 2024 production of Destiny in Dayton.Photograph: Rhea County Historical SocietyDavis reflects: “Hillsboro was full of bigots and ignoramuses like Mencken described: people who were afraid of education. That wasn’t Dayton. In 1927, two years after the trial, some of the same folk who planned or participated in the trial opened the first public school. A bunch of the same people worked to establishBryan College. It’s not that people were against education.”Davis, who moved to Dayton in 1976, is vice-president ofRhea Heritage Preservation Foundationand finds the trial is still relevant to America in the present. “When you look at various public outcries, so many of them have a tie to the trial,” he explains.“Public education – you can hardly pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV without seeing some reference to parents are upset about this or want to do that in public schools and fighting with school boards and so on. That was at the heart of the trial. Who has the right to set the agenda for public schools? Is it the professionals or is it the parents who pay for them?”He adds: “You look at the idea of majority and minority rights. Who sets the agenda for what happens in America these days? Is it the majority? We claim to be a democracy. To most people, democracy means he who gets the most votes wins. That’s all well and good but where does that leave the folk in the minority? Do they have any rights? All of this is critical to where we are as a nation.”Opponents of evolution have adapted their strategies over time, seeking to bypass legal challenges by reframing their arguments. “Scientific creationism” in the 1970s and early 1980s aimed to secure equal time in public schools for what they presented as a scientific alternative to evolution.“Intelligent design” in 1990s and early 2000s also sought to present itself as a scientific theory challenging evolution. But judges ruled that these anti-evolutionary concepts were religious, not scientific, and therefore their inclusion in science classrooms violated the establishment clause of the first amendment.Nothing, however, has matched the Scopes trial for drama, spectacle and legend.Edward Larson, a professor of history and law at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, and author of Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America’s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion, says: “The trial survives but it survives as a myth and under the myth both sides are victims.“Science, universities, culture, education is a victim of the mob; the people, religion, culture are a victim of the elites. We see that playing out today even in the battles over the universities and the battles over science that are happening in America. But it’s not just the United States.”Explore more on these topicsCultureTennesseeFestivalsCreationismCharles DarwinReligionEvolutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And if you were a young adult at that time, well, there’s also a high chance that you played Japanese role-playing games as a teenager – whether that was Chrono Trigger on an SNES or Final Fantasy on a PlayStation. Purity Ring’s new singleMany Livesis an attempt to recapture the feeling of the RPG that you discovered as a 12-year-old and immediately made into your whole personality. Inspired by games such as Skies of Arcadia, Phantasy Star Online and Secret of Mana, it is poised to tug on the heartstrings of fans of a certain vintage.This is a bold decision for a band who have previously collaborated withDeftonesand coveredEurodance classics, but members Megan James and Corin Roddick have the gaming expertise to pull it off. “We’re huge fans of the JRPG genre,” they say, naming Nier: Automata and Final Fantasy X as major influences on the sonic atmosphere of their latest work. “And we’re both currently playing Metaphor: ReFantazio – it’s an incredible fantasy take on the Persona formula.”Five years after their last studio album and with more than a decade of remixes under their belt, Purity Ring are now fully independent and working under their own imprint, The Fellowship. Their next album, out in September, is described as “the soundtrack to an imagined RPG… the record tells the story of two hapless characters - embodiments of mj and Corin - on a journey to build a kinder world amid the ruins of a broken one.”The album didn’t start out as an imagined video game soundtrack, but during production they quickly realised where the idea could lead: “There was a sense of traversing an RPG world, of a journey unfolding that felt deeply tied to the sound,” they say. With this concept identified, Many Lives and its b-side, Part II, were born. “Many Lives is the doorway into this imagined world, and its centre – sort of like the place in the beginning of most JRPG games, where the character begins their story.”The video for Many Lives, with its cel-shaded graphics, was directed by Mike Sunday.The story here centres around Purity Ring’s real-life experiences during production, as well as “memories and places of terror and comfort” from the duo’s past. “This albumis an extension of the dreaming it takes to make actual change,” they say; it explores how games can offer a journey that leads to creative rebirth.On first listen, what stands out in Many Lives is the haunting voices of the choir, reminiscent of Kenji Kawai’s iconic Ghost in the Shell soundtrack. This eerie intro is accompanied by a high-tempo breakbeat, culminating in a track that feels like watching classic anime while playing Jet Set Radio. Purity Ring aren’t shy about their love for this era. “The Ghost in the Shell soundtrack is such a striking combination with the visuals … it was very memorable to experience that as a kid.” Having revisited the anime for this project, the duo decided to create their new music in its image, citing it alongside the Japanese cult classic game Nier: Automata as an example of music that makes you feel part of the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Purity Ring aren’t afraid to turn to non-traditional instruments for ideas, claiming they aren’t big gearheads and rarely use hardware synths. “The Legend of Zeldaseries has always been a major inspiration for us,” they say. “Especially the ocarina music from the N64 titles.” You’ll hear echoes of 1998’s Ocarina of Time in the melody threading through both tracks, like a half-remembered song you’ve not heard for some time.If the nostalgic vocals and retro Casiotone MT-240 sounds aren’t enough to make you long for the golden age of games, the accompanying video’s cel-shaded graphics emphasise the duo’s love for all things RPG. Directed by Mike Sunday, the video is a GameCube daydream, inspired by “a time that felt like game developers were really embracing style over realism”. It’s Shinjuku meets Hyrule, reminiscent of the opening maps of JRPGs, places that are always beautiful and yet rarely revisited. Purity Ring are fondest of the PS2 and GameCube era, but they pay tribute to thePlayStationPortable too; the UI for their imagined RPG would look at home on several of the handheld’s bestsellers.For me, Many Lives sounds like afternoons spent playing Baten Kaitos (I’m still hoping for a sequel). For Purity Ring, the tracks “evoke a feeling of past, present and future – a nostalgia for something you’ve never experienced, but somehow still remember”. They’re keen to position this forthcoming album as a new chapter for them, capturing the sound of an era – and chasing the feeling of playing a life-changing game for the first time.Purity Ring will release their self-titled 4th album on 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesElectronic musicPlayStationNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for Laing, nothing beats giving back to her community – starting with a huge hometown festivalThu 10 Jul 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTShareIn the centre of a dancefloor in aDundeepark, a group of athleisure-clad teens are dancing to a Crazy Frog remix with a middle-aged couple wearing head-to-toe smiley face print. They’re in a re-creation of the Highlander, a Scottish bar in Ibiza, complete with Saltire flags and Buckfast cocktails. Across the park, a crowd of thousands are hanging on for the drop in Ultrabeat’s Pretty Green Eyes as played by trance icon Judge Jules. It may be late afternoon in Dundee, but the vibe is pure late-night riviera hedonism.This is last weekend’s Doof in the Park festival, curated by Hannah Laing in her home town. From Manchester to Ibiza, Amsterdam to Tokyo, the Scottish DJ and producer has brought her sets of hard house, trance and techno to every big club scene in the world, but the festival “had to be at home”, she says two days before it begins, fresh off a plane from Ibiza. “InScotland, we’re lucky to have crazy crowds. The atmosphere here always hits different.”While hard dance is often derided or ignored in the media and polite society, Laing’s music – insistent, almost aggressively euphoric – has a large and committed following: 2.7 million people listen to her each month on Spotify and Doof in the Park sold out its 15,000 tickets within a week. Across the festival site there are hundreds of fans in merch from her Doof record label, as well as bootleg efforts including handmade Doof earrings and customised Uniqlo crossbody bags; one man has “Doof” shaved into the side of his head.Laing wryly describes her rise as “10 years of overnight success”. Even after landing her first Ibiza residency in 2014, she was juggling DJing with her day job as a dental nurse. “I was playing at the weekend then going straight to work on a Monday,” she remembers. “There came a point when I was doing interviews with the BBC in my surgery. I was getting a lot of gigs but still doing lots for free, and I never thought I could make a living from it.” She eventually quit her job in 2022, after a breakthrough set at Creamfields. “I was on first on Sunday at 2pm and didn’t know if anyone would show up, but there were over 10,000 people there and tons of Scottish flags,” she says. “I’d been building up this reputation in Scotland, and when I got that big opportunity, everyone came out to support me.”“She’s one of us,” says Lisa, who has travelled to the Doof in the Park from Aberdeen with her friend Shona. Like Laing, Lisa is in her early 30s and grew up going to raves. “She’s been brought up like us. She’s a normal girl who’s done well for herself.”In 2024, Laing launched her label, named after the “doof doof” rhythm of her music. This summer, she’s playing a residency at one of Ibiza’s most sought-after clubs, Hï, and releasing her techno-influenced Into the Bounce EP.She credits her taste – “hard house, trance, music that really makes me feel something” – to her parents, 90s ravers whose generation make up a significant part of her audience. “It’s a great feeling when people who properly know their stuff come and say: ‘You got me out of retirement!’” she says. “Also when my mum comes to see me, she doesn’t feel old.”This is very much the case at Doof in the Park. “I’m 53 and I thought I’d be the oldest here, but I’m not,” says Claire from Johnstone, accompanied by her 20-year-old daughter. “I’m 51 and I’ve been doing this for years,” adds Natalie from Aberdeen. “There’s such a mix of ages and everyone’s so friendly.” Natalie’s niece Carla has been following Laing for years, and emphasises the inclusive community she is building, which extends to the access support at the festival. “Sometimes, if you’re sick like me, you can’t go to stuff, but the accessibility team have been fantastic,” she says. “They gave me a direct phone number if I needed anything on the day. It’s all been thought out.”View image in fullscreenOpening Doof in the Park, with suitably Scottish musical accompaniment.Photograph: Eddy Hubble‘Seeing climate change like this, it changes you’: dance duo Bicep on making a new project in GreenlandRead moreAs well as hard dance legends such as Armin van Buuren and Lisa Lashes, Laing booked local DJs for the Highlander tent, styled after “the bar in Ibiza where I had my first residency, which I wanted to pay homage to. For most of the DJs, it’s their first ever festival.” Laing’s support of the local scene will continue with the in-construction Doof Studios, a DJ workshop in Dundee that she recently crowdfunded with non-profitTurn the Tables. It’s set to be a resource for up-and-coming DJs in the area, as well as people affected by homelessness, addiction and ill health. “It’s going to have loads of benefits,” she says, “not just for people who want to DJ full-time, but for people who just need that focus.”Whether it’s building a community studio or creating music for intergenerational revelling, all of Laing’s work has genuine care for people at its heart: “Being able to give back, there’s no better feeling.”Into the Bounce is out now on WUGD/Polydor. Hannah Laing plays every Monday at Hï in Ibiza until 29 September, andtours Europe this summer, playing the Emerge festival, Belfast, on 23-24 August, and the Cause, London, on 19 September.Explore more on these topicsDance musicElectronic musicClub cultureDundeeFestivalsScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it a dadaist farce, scathing political satire or just empty surrealism? One thing’s for sure, it is completely Marmite, met with both whoops and walkouts on this London debut. Nature Theater of Oklahoma are in fact an experimental theatre company from New York, and No President, originally made in 2018 (when a certain president was in his first term), involves the following: a pair of security guards protecting a mysterious curtain and whatever is behind it, a love triangle (actually a pentagon), a rival security company in tutus, an insecure man rising to be a Trump-ish despot, and a lot, lot more.It’s staged as a “ballet” inasmuch as the score is Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker and the performers wear ballet flats and unitards (with cutesy knitted genitals stuck on top) while dancing their way through the show’s two hours, sometimes a bouncy jog, occasionally fouettés. Untrained dancers, like this cast, can bring many qualities to the stage – vulnerability, striving, humanity, joy – but here (at least until the very end) the mode is just lightly comic.The physicality reads like a silent movie, but one with boners, Cheetos, cannibalism and copulating wildlife. It’s a mime act accompanied by unceasing narration, a barrage of text delivered at constant pitch and overegged volume, crammed with wordiness (“afflatus”, “feculent”, “kakistocracy”) plus some pleasing details (the devil disappearing in a puff of smoke “that smells like cheddar cheese”), with the result that it’s often indigestible.View image in fullscreenA mime act accompanied by unceasing narration … No President.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt’s clever, sure, packed with a multilayered plot and lots of ideas expressed in cartoonish fashion, whether what drives people to tyranny, or the vagaries of the artist’s ego, musing on “The B-word [boring], the worst insult to any performing artist”, and wondering if “there was no purpose for the drama that’s taken place”. Very meta.The onslaught makes it too easy to switch off. Is that the point? That Donald Trump’s torrent of nonsense – “braggadocious verbiage” to quote from the script – ever more outrageous policies, and the hyper-stimulation of wall-to-wall media, has led a society to lose grip on its critical faculties. If so, it’s an eccentric way to make it.No President is a wild ride, and a marathon feat for the admirably committed performers.

Remember the first Dexter finale 12 years ago? It climaxed with Morgan sailing his boat into an unsurvivable storm, a sure sign that our favourite serial-killing blood spatter analyst had finally met his end. But then the show lost its nerve and he somehow ended up in a postscript with a new job (lumberjack) and a new beard (unconvincing).Next came 2021’sDexter: New Blood, a series that was conceived as a definitive full stop for the character. That run ended with – spoiler alert – Dexter being shot dead by his son Harrison. However, now Morgan finds himself back yet again in Dexter: Resurrection, in which we quickly learn that this apparently fatal injury was merely a flesh wound.“Well, you know, he didn’t get shot in the head,” shrugsMichael C Hall, who plays the titular character. Hall is attempting to explain Dexter’s latest miraculous comeback to me over Zoom – and if he’s getting tired of people like me telling him that they thought he was dead, he’s doing a pretty good job of hiding it.View image in fullscreenMichael C Hall, Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine, Jill Marie Lawrence and Sharon Hope in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeThis might be because it was his idea to bringDexterback. “The conversation started as a result of my saying, ‘What if he didn’t die?’” he says breezily. “I can’t take credit for the whole scope of what we’re up to, but it was a notion that I casually floated. What if the end of New Blood was something that enabled Dexter to relinquish some burden that he’d been carrying for a long time?”What changed his mind? “Time passing, perspective shifting, recognising what a wonderful thing it is to collaborate with this family,” he says. “And realising that how New Blood seemingly ended could be a way to move the character into a place he hadn’t quite earned until then.”How well the character moves into that place remains to be seen. As we speak, the show is still in production, and only the first episode has been made available to view. Its early scenes might creak with tortured exposition – hardly surprising, given the near-impossible task of bringing someone back from the dead – but happily, the old Dexter magic is still present. There are callbacks and cameos and grisly scenes of dismemberment. Better yet, the season promises all kinds of warped bonding between Dexter (a serial killer) and Harrison (his son and, until quite recently, murderer).“Harrison has been through a lot, and has a sense of maturity that he didn’t have when we first met him in New Blood,” says Hall. “Dexter initially is very much compelled to check in on his son, but is also daunted by the proposition of making contact, because he’s afraid his son will reject him, or won’t want him, or will wish he’d stayed dead. But I think finding themselves on the other side of this traumatic event will result in both Dexter and his son growing up a little bit.”View image in fullscreenUma Thurman as Charley in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeWe also have a new fleet of faces to look forward to. Peter Dinklage and Uma Thurman are there, respectively playing a billionaire venture capitalist and his head of security, plus Neil Patrick Harris, Eric Stonestreet, Krysten Ritter and David Dastmalchian will all appear as villains invited to what sounds an awful lot like an international murder convention. “Dexter sort of trips into a literal and figurative invitation to a gathering of unsavoury …” teases Hall of this year’s plot, before trailing off for fear of spoiling anything. “Actually, I’m not sure how much I can say. But it’s really validating and gratifying, the fact that the show remains compelling to the kinds of actors who’ve agreed to join us.”Perhaps another reason for Hall’s willingness to return was this year’s Dexter: Original Sin. A prequel series that took the form of Dexter’s life flashing before his eyes post-shooting, Original Sin didn’t star Hall (although he provided the voiceover), instead casting Shadow and Bone’s Patrick Gibson as Morgan.I had wondered if the simple envy of seeing someone else do his job drove Hall back to Dexter, but apparently this wasn’t the case. “I thought it was interesting, once all those blanks had been filled in, to find the character on the other side of it,” he says. “But it was weird to see Patrick embody some of what had evolved as Dexter’s characteristic ways of being. Yes, it’s very strange. In fact, at one point I was like, when I go back to work, I gotta make sure I’m not just doing a Patrick Gibson impression.”View image in fullscreenPeter Dinklage in Dexter: Resurrection.Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Paramount+ with ShowtimeThere will be more Original Sin (a second season was greenlit this spring): another sign of what looks like an ever-expanding Dexterverse. There’s likely to be continued Resurrection – more about that shortly – plus there are rumours of a spin-off focused on John Lithgow’s Trinity Killer. All of which perhaps underlines how much better television as a whole was in Dexter’s heyday.The original Dexter came out in 2006 at the height of the golden age of TV, with its focus on anguished male antiheroes. Much has been made lately of the demons that plagued James Gandolfini before his death, some attributed to the burden of having to play a character as dark as Tony Soprano for so many years. As Dexter, though, Hall played a serial killer who had to murder and dismember countless people. Did the darkness of the role ever get to him?View image in fullscreenMichael C Hall on satellite radio station Sirius XM in New York this week.Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM“I think Dexter exists in a world that is, to some degree, dialled away from reality,” he explains. “It’s fantastic in its way and, because of that fantastical element, maybe it doesn’t play the same trick on me that it might otherwise. And you know, as intense as it might be to convey someone who’s wrestling with such formidable darkness, it’s maybe therapeutic. You can endow these victims with whatever it is you’d like to do away with in your own world. Maybe I’m a healthier person for having done all this.”There is also the question of how comfortable Hall is with returning to the same character over and over again. After all, Dexter aside, his stock in trade is playing a dizzying breadth of characters – he was JFK in The Crown, the Emcee in Cabaret, the lead in David Bowie’s Lazarus musical, a professional bowler in a Tim Robinson-written episode of Documentary Now!. Yet he keeps being drawn back to Dexter. Surely he must be aware that this will be the first line of his obituary.“I mean, what are you going to do?” he shrugs. “That’s the way it’s unfolded. Whether I were to do more of this or not, I think that would remain the case, and it’s OK. None of it fundamentally matters anyway. But it’s been really fun. Being able to work as an actor feels like getting away with something. Being able to work as an actor while playing a character like Dexter feels exponentially so. I feel very lucky to have gotten away with this.”A knottier question to bring up is the internet. As well as the initial finale routinely being brought up as one of the worst in television history, aHollywood Reporter interview with showrunner Clyde Phillipslast year suggested that fans weren’t exactly happy with how New Blood ended, either. “The internet hated it,” Phillips said bluntly. With this in mind, I ask Hall if he keeps up with the ins and outs of reactions to the show.“No, that would make me crazy,” he replies. “But some fans found the notion of Dexter surviving more plausible than him dying. There’s something about the character that people just don’t want to see him die. They don’t want to see his agency extinguished.”Watch a trailer for Dexter: ResurrectionMichael C Hall on death, dogs, depravity and Dexter: ‘It was fantastic to be ethically unbound’Read moreThe good news for these fans is that Dexter: Resurrection is intended to be a long-running affair. The introduction of so many guest stars this season is designed to trickle out across several years, or, as Phillips put it to USA Today, the duration of the comeback is “up to Michael”.“Well, I guess it’s hard for Dexter to happen if I’m not there,” Hall sighs when I mention this to him. Does this mean he would like Resurrection to run and run? Is there a world where it could end up rivalling the length of the original series? “That sounds insane,” he laughs. “All I can say is that I don’t think we resolve things at the end of this season, and we’ve done it with the reasonable expectation that there will be more to come.”So you don’t get shot at the end of this one? “We still have two and a half weeks left of filming, and I suppose someone could present some new pages to me,” he smiles. But what would be the point? After all, Dexter Morgan cannot die. And we should all be thankful for that.Dexter: Resurrection is on Paramount+ on 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsDexterMichael C HallTelevisionTV crime dramaDramaUS televisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But how does it happen? And should readers really feel betrayed?Lucy KnightThu 10 Jul 2025 06.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 07.51 EDTShare“The Salt Path is an unflinchingly honest, inspiring and life-affirming true story,” reads the description of Raynor Winn’s bestselling memoir on its publisher Penguin Random House’s website.View image in fullscreenWhich is unfortunate wording if accusations made at the weekend turn out to be true: aninvestigation by the Observeralleged that the 2018 book – which has recently been adapted intoa film starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs– is not all that it seems. Winn writes in The Salt Path that she and her husband, Moth, had their home repossessed due to an investment in a friend’s company that went on to fail. With nowhere to live, as she tells it, the couple decided to walk the length of the South West Coast Path, wild camping along the way and relying on the kindness of strangers. The Observer piece suggests Winn’s account of becoming homeless is untruthful, and reports that she took £64,000 from her former employer. It also questions the legitimacy of Moth’s diagnosis with the neurological condition corticobasal degeneration (CBD), a core part of the memoir.Winn’s immediate response called the article “highly misleading”, adding: “We are taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time.” She stood by her book being “the true story of our journey”. Still, after the report, PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and formerly worked with Winn and her husband,terminated its relationshipwith the couple.On Wednesday, Winn published a moredetailed statement, defending her book’s truthfulness and giving more detail about the events that led to the couple losing their home. She also provided medical letters addressed to her husband in defence of allegations relating to his illness.This is not the first time a much-hyped memoir has come up against accusations of lying.Belgium-born Misha Defonseca’s 1997 bookabout how she was raised by wolves during the second world war turned out to be completely fabricated.Love and Consequences by Margaret B Jones, which was sold on release in 2008 as the true story of the author’s experience growing up as a mixed-race foster child in South Central Los Angeles, turned out to have been written by Margaret Seltzer, a white, privately educated woman who grew up with her biological family.View image in fullscreenJames Frey at the Union Chapel, London, in 2011.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPerhaps the most famous instance isJames Frey’s A Million Little Pieces, a 2003 memoir of drug addiction and alcoholism that, after being championed by Oprah Winfrey in 2005, shot to the top of the New York Times bestseller list and remained there for 15 weeks. It was billed as “brutally honest”, but later it came to light that chunks of the book had been made up. Winfrey in particular was furious with Frey, telling him it was difficult to talk to him when he came on her TV show to explain himself in 2006. “I feel duped,” she said. “But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers.”“How could they lie?” is a question many readers ask when a memoir they love is proved to be untrue. But there’s another question that needs to be answered, too: how could the authorget awaywith it? How did they manage to get their lies past an agent and multiple editors, all the way into a published book labelled as a true story?The short answer is that if someone is lying about their own life, it is often very difficult for others to tell. Dr Pragya Agarwal, the author of books including the2021 memoir (M)otherhoodand a teacher of memoir writing, says that a big part of writing nonfiction “is about trust between the writer and the reader. I am not really sure how someone’s life story can be factchecked in its entirety.”Others say it is not the publisher’s role to investigate whether an author is telling the truth or not. Grace Pengelly is a freelance writer and editor who formerly worked as a nonfiction commissioning editor at HarperCollins. An editor’s role “is to help the author craft their story as compellingly and accurately as possible”, she says, and that requires believing in the writer. “Without a certain degree of trust from the outset, it is difficult for an editor and author to work with each other effectively.”That doesn’t mean that memoirs are not fact-checked. “Prior to acquiring a memoir, a publisher would look into the background of the author and their story to see if it checks out,” says Pengelly. Any “question marks around the veracity of an author’s story would definitely be a reason why a publisher wouldn’t offer on a book”. But the research undertaken at this stage wouldn’t tend to involve checking whether someone was actually incarcerated for as long as they said they were (one of the major falsities in A Million Little Pieces), or whether a couple who claimed to be homeless actually owned a property in the south of France, as was alleged by the Observer regarding Winn and her husband (a property Winn has since described as an “uninhabitable ruin”).View image in fullscreenRaynor and Moth Winn.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFinding out that kind of information might be possible only if publishers had specific teams dedicated to it. The publishing consultant and editor Katy Loftus, who previously worked for Penguin Random House, says she isn’t aware of any publishing houses with a factchecking department. “Other than top executive salaries, publishing is run on a shoestring. Books make much less money than people think,” she says. The big publishers have legal departments, “who will give an opinion on something flagged up to them by a commissioning editor, and occasionally do a complete legal read if requested”, she adds. But the main factchecking responsibility tends to fall to the commissioning editors, who are “responsible for hundreds of tasks” – from briefing book cover designers, to negotiating deals with authors, to managing teams of people. The editing itself “is often at the bottom of the list, and factchecking is only part of the editing process.”Even when it comes to legal checks, the main concern is that a book doesn’t contain anything that might lead to the publisher being sued, rather than actually analysing the factual content, says Ian Bloom, a media lawyer who has worked in publishing. “To some extent, nobody much cares if they’ve got dates wrong and facts wrong, as long as there’s no legal implications.”Bloom suspects that a number of celebrity memoirs in particular contain omissions or embellishments. “There’s no real harm done if they gloss over certain things in their lives,” he says, as long as it’s not defamatory to anyone else.Aside from rare exceptions – such as when a group of readerssuccessfully sued Frey’s publisher, claiming they were defrauded as they bought his book under the impression that it was true, and were refunded the cover price – publishers do not face serious material repercussions for lies told in memoirs. Reputational damage, meanwhile, is usually put on the author. “When an author signs a contract with a publisher, there are usually author covenants that include clauses about the truthfulness and integrity of the material to the best of the author’s knowledge and belief,” Bloom says. The publisher is then entitled to cancel that author’s contract, should a book’s veracity be called into question.Of course, authors can get around this by writing “autobiographical fiction” rather than memoir: books such as the actor Carrie Fisher’s Postcards From the Edge, based on her own life but categorised as a novel, or the Booker-winning autofictional novelShuggie Bainby Douglas Stuart, don’t come under fire for being made up, because we all know that’s what fiction is. So why didn’t authors like Frey turn their stories into novels? Perhaps the books wouldn’t have done as well marketed in that way – in a true-crime-obsessed world, we’re all familiar with the strength of desire for real stories.“Autofiction isn’t as well-established a genre as memoir,” Pengelly says. “So marketing teams face discrete challenges in framing and taking these stories to the public. A ‘true story’ has historically proved easier to build a campaign around.”Once a book is out in the world, any inaccuracies tend to be spotted by journalists or academics – there is no regulator of the publishing industry equivalent to the Independent Press Standards Organisationand Ofcom for the media in the UK. Withapproximately 200,000 books publishedannually in the UK alone, “There’s no regulator on Earth who can read them all … it’s impossible,” Bloom says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In light of the Salt Path allegations, Pengelly is sure publishers will be considering ways to avoid such a scenario coming up again. “If a narrative arc seems too neat and tidy to be true, perhaps it’s worth considering why, and employing a freelance factchecker to investigate,” she says.View image in fullscreenWinn on her travels in south-west England.The trouble is, neat and tidy narrative arcs are often exactly what many readers – and viewers of film adaptations – want. A memoir Pengelly worked on,Zig-Zag Boy by Tanya Frank, is about a mother coming to terms with her son’s experiences of psychosis. That book was a more modest commercial success than The Salt Path, but could it have been more of a hit if Frank had ended it with her son being “healed”, rather than with her accepting his altered state? Quite possibly. Triumph in the face of medical adversity is a seductive concept, as readers of Winn’s books will know from their stories of Moth’s ability to overcome the symptoms of his illness and undertake long walks.Nic Wilson, whose memoir Land Beneath the Waves is about how the natural world helped her to navigate and accept her chronic illness, is disparaging of the “nature cure” trope we often see in popular books about health. It creates an unrealistic expectation that the order of events should be “diagnosis, illness, recovery. And I think readers come to expect that,” she says.Clearly, authors may have something to gain by bowing to such expectations and embellishing or omitting certain facts of their life stories. But they also have the most to lose if lies in their books are exposed: they could have their publishing deal dropped, which might mean having to pay back their advance, and they risk no publisher wanting to be associated with them again.Frey’s publisher, Nan Talese, was particularly aggrieved by the way her author’s reputation was attacked. Winfrey displayed “fiercely bad manners – you don’t stone someone in public, which is just what she did”, shetold the Dallas Morning Newsat the time.If a narrative arc seems too neat and tidy to be true, perhaps it’s worth considering why“Scandal has stalked memoir since the genre was invented,” Loftus says – an early example being the 1836 memoir Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, a 20-year-old woman’s story of life in a Montreal convent, which was vilified as a hoax. “In practice the publicity rarely does more harm than good to the publisher, whereas an author’s life can be left in tatters.”That’s not to say that they won’t continue to make money: A Million Little Pieces kept selling even in its second iteration, which had passages rewritten and contained a “note to the reader” addressing its inaccuracies. And whatever happens after the allegations made against Winn, having already sold more than 2m copies of The Salt Path, she has been made rich by this book and its sequels, and will continue to receive royalties for as long as people keep buying them.The fact that there is money to be made – with very few legal repercussions – by telling the most marketable version of a story, rather than the true one, makes it difficult to believe that this controversy will be the last of its kind. After all, no memoir can be completely true. “Memories are fallible and selective; we always remember half-truths, and the story an author chooses to tell is only ever one story of a particular situation,” Agarwal says. “But what any reader wants to believe is that the story they have put their faith in is closest to the writer’s truth, that they have not been deliberately misled, that they have not been manipulated. This is essential.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some fanspaid more than £350for tickets with a face value of £150.The watchdog said Ticketmaster had failed since then to provide any undertakings that it found acceptable to resolve the issue of the way it sold the tickets.Oasis have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsOasisNews agenciesNewspapers & magazinesNewspapersMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the only place that’s not surrounded by fences.”The five Oasis dates at Heaton Park are the only UK shows not in a stadium, with the others held at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium, Wembley in London and Murrayfield in Edinburgh.Thousands of people are expected to head to the park to listen to the concerts from outside the gates, despite warnings from the council and the promoter for ticketless fans to stay away.View image in fullscreenSome of the infrastructure as it was taking shape ready for the Oasis concerts at Heaton Park.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe 600-acre park in north Manchester was the venue for Oasis’s last performance in the city, on 7 June 2009, and hosts the yearly Parklife festival.Oasis are due to play five sold-out shows there between 11-20 July, with about 80,000 people attending each gig.Don’t roll with it: the ticket scams targeting Oasis fans and other gig-goersRead moreLast year,Greater Manchesterpolice (GMP) imposed a dispersal order across the festival site during Parklife to try to crack down on ticketless fans gaining entry. The force did not respond to a request for comment on whether similar measures would be imposed during the Oasis gigs.One Manchester hospitality boss said he feared Friday’s concert could be called off if thousands of ticketless fans managed to get into the venue. “I think Friday will be feral. With the weather and all the kids jumping over the fences – there might even be a chance they could call it off.“All the young lads that I’ve spoken to, none of them have got tickets [but] they’re all having a go.

It was like a fucking tea party compared to what ours will be like.”The concert’s promoter said 2,000 stewards, as well as a “significant number” of police officers, would be patrolling the boundary to prevent ticketless fans from gaining entry.“We have been working for more than a year alongside the various councils and emergency services to ensure these Oasis shows in Heaton Park are safe for all ticket holders. Anyone without a ticket should not travel to Heaton Park,” said Rob Ballantine, the director of SJM Concerts.“We are aware of the TikTok videos but what they don’t show is the 2,000 stewards, plus a significant number of police who will be patrolling the area, and the double fence line around the entire site with mobile security in between the fences.”GMP said officers all over the site would be “working with event security staff to prevent crime and disorder”.

We have worked closely with event organisers and partners to make sure the event is safe and enjoyable for those attending, while minimising any crime or antisocial behaviour impacts on local residents,” said Matt Boyle, an assistant chief constable.“We will have a large and highly visible policing operation in place in Heaton Park, the city centre and on routes into and out of the venue to help people enjoy the event.”He added: “Our advice to fans attending is to enjoy yourselves but to remain vigilant. Keep your belongings safe and report anything suspicious to police or security staff so we can act on it.”The videos posted by TikTokers have been condemned by Manchester city council, which runs the park, with the advice condemned as “irresponsible”.“It’s concerning and irresponsible of individuals to be encouraging this kind of reckless behaviour in others, and also encouraging people to put their safety at risk in this way,” said John Hacking, a councillor and executive member for skills, employment and leisure.“Ticketless fans shouldn’t travel to Heaton Park. They should get themselves to the city centre instead where they’re going to find a brilliant atmosphere and loads of things happening on gig days to get involved in and enjoy.”Explore more on these topicsOasisManchesterTikTokGreater ManchesterNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Why are they going to change these characters [to] exist for the times?”Cain was responding tocomments by Gunn published on Friday in the Times, in which the director said: “Superman is the story of America … An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”Cain added: “We knowSupermanis an immigrant – he’s a freaking alien … The ‘American way’ is immigrant friendly, tremendously immigrant friendly. But there are rules … You can’t come in saying: ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America, because I want it to be more like Somalia.’ Well that doesn’t work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here ... There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody, society will fail. So there have to be limits.”Superman has become the focus of criticism from some rightwing commentators, includingFox News’ host Jesse Watters, who suggested that Superman “fights for truth, justice, and your preferred pronouns” and that gang moniker MS-13 was “superimposed” on his cape.Superman review – is it a bust?

We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants.

Bob Vylan issued a statement last week claiming they were being “targeted for speaking up”.It came before the Belfast trio Kneecap’s appearance on the same stage. Both bands are being investigated by Avon and Somerset police over remarks made during their concerts.At Bob Vylan’s intimate concert at the 100 Club on Wednesday night, some fans started to repeat the Glastonbury chant of “death, death to the IDF”.Robinson-Foster responded by saying “you are going to get me in trouble, apparently every other chant is fine but yous [sic] will get me in trouble” before leading the crowd in chants of “Free, free Palestine”.The duo ended the gig by holding up the Palestinian flag as Robinson-Foster said: “We are a loving band, we love you lot for being here with us. We love the Palestinian people.”Who are Bob Vylan?

Death to the IDF.”Since then they have reportedly been dropped by their agency, United Talent Agency (UTA), which appears to have removed the group from their website, and have also been pulled from a number of concerts – including their US tour after having their visas revoked.Despite the criticism the group have re-entered the charts, with their album, Humble as the Sun, climbing to No 1 in the UK hip-hop and R&B album charts. The group are expected to perform at the Boardmasters surfing and music festival in Newquay, Cornwall, in August.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlastonbury 2025Israel-Gaza warProtestFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

You expect far betterLucy ManganThu 10 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 10 Jul 2025 12.34 EDTShareIt takes a lot of talent to make something as singular asGirls. Then 26-year-old Lena Dunham created, starred in and executive-produced the show. She frequently directed, and she wrote or co-wrote 41 of the extraordinarily raw, realistic (Girls’ sex scenes reduced most screen and polite conventions to rubble), brutally funny and occasionally simply brutal 62 episodes that comprised its six seasons between 2012 and 2017. Girls’ impeccably witty script and sublime characterisations meant it pulled off a near-impossible feat. It made the story of four solipsistic, privileged twentysomethings navigating their lives one sexual/professional/ youthful/contraceptive mistake at a time in New York City compelling, funny and meaningful. As Dunham’s character and semi-alter ego Hannah Horvath said of herself – she may not have beenthevoice of a generation, but she was definitelyavoice of her generation.Since then, the output of a woman for whom the word “wunderkind” seemed woefully underpowered has itself been underwhelming. Dunham’smuch-hyped first bookdid not deliver a fraction of the humour or insight Girls proved she was capable of – although certain passages did garner much publicity and controversy, a tradition she then continued with various ill-advised (or wilfully misinterpreted) comments on the#MeToo movement, writing out of imagination rather than lived experience and other hot button issues of the past decade or so. Her US remake ofJulia Davis’s Campingwas widely considered to have lost its originator’s bleak genius in translation, and Dunham’s adaptation of the beloved and brilliant children’s bookCatherine Called Birdy, was an inoffensive bagatelle that did not detain critics or commerce long.But now, at last, we have a new, original project from Dunham (with contribution from her now husband, indie musician Luis Felber). A television series, no less. Too Much follows the adventures of early-thirtysomething Jessica (Hacks’formidableMegan Stalter) who flees to London from Brooklyn after a bad break-up. She remains obsessed with her ex, Zev (Michael Zegen), and with the woman he left her for, Instagram star and influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). She records emotional addresses to Wendy on her phone, privately, as self-therapy but of course this is the modern equivalent of Chekhov’s gun on the mantelpiece, and duly goes off in act three.View image in fullscreen‘You’re so alive!’ Megan Stalter as Jessica and Will Sharpe as Felix in Too Much.Photograph: PABefore then, however, she has embarked on a relationship with – oh, the eternal mysteries of creation – indie musician Felix (White Lotus’s Will Sharpe, in another good-guy part that gives him nothing to get his teeth into and leaves him looking very flat indeed beside Stalter’s full-blooded role and performance). He is the antithesis of Zev – patient, laid-back, appreciative of her and never finding her “too much” as her ex, from very early in their relationship which somehow staggered on for eight years, contemptuously and contemptibly did.There is a laboured joke in the first episode, about the difference between the English estate of Jessica’s period drama-informed imagination and the council flat she ends up in. This should serve as a warning to us all to lower our expectations drastically and save ourselves from as much of the quickly deepening disappointment as possible.After Jessica’s inaugural encounter with a British pub loo (you can, in fact, feel a very lived experience of Dunham here), the narrative landscape becomes an increasingly desolate place. Jessica sets fire to her nightdress and goes to hospital. Felix shows up with flowers and takes her home. Flashbacks to her life with Zev and an abortive date with a lying footballer show us how much better a bet the new guy is. They have a lot of sex and Dunham aims for her trademark realism – but without Girls’ inherent bleakness it just makes things tonally jarring for the viewer. It abandons any thoughts of innovation and hits cliche after cliche (how “the ick” can suddenly arrive and put you off your beloved for ever, for example – a well worn trope of the kind that would never have passed muster in Dunham’s earlier work). At one point, Felix even tells Jessica admiringly, “You’re so alive!” Not too much, you see! Alive! This guy is great.There are a few good lines (“I want to make the world a better place for the children I don’t want and may never be ready for”) and insightful moments (Jessica using television programmes about people with lives even messier than hers to soothe herself to sleep) but the irreducible fact remains that Too Much would not be enough from anyone. From Dunham, it is way, way too little.Too Much is onNetflixnowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewLena DunhamNetflixGirlsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Harvey is more interested in the tasks undertaken to keep themselves healthy and their lodgings shipshape. Simultaneously expansive and intimate, Orbital reveals how the usual routines of eating, sleeping and exercising are fraught with challenges when you are weightless: toothpaste foam must be swallowed rather than spat out and cutlery adhered to the table using magnets.Harvey is also alert to the isolation of the astronauts, even though they can’t get away from one another: “They are so together, and so alone, that even their thoughts, their internal mythologies, at times convene.” Yet their capsule proves a utopia of sorts where earthbound quarrels and borders cease to exist. Cooperation is vital as they go about their work while breathing the same recycled air.Actor Sarah Naudi is the narrator, providing a lyrical and hypnotic reading that is in keeping with the otherworldly setting. As the team hurtles through space, orbiting the Earth 16 times a day, they debate the existence of God and reflect on the wonder and fragility of human life.

Makes it all the harder to understand why they get everything wrong.” An exaggeration, of course, but one with a degree of truth to it. Why has an organisation with huge amounts of money at its disposal, a record of recruiting the brightest and the best, and the widest of remits, failed to notch up a better record? It’s true that we may not know about many of the CIA’s successes. But we know about a lot of its failures, and some of them have marked US history ineradicably.In The Mission,Tim Weiner, whose reporting on the CIA in the New York Times was always essential reading, and whose subsequent books on the US intelligence community have a place on the shelves of anyone interested in international affairs, provides a variety of answers to this essential question. As he showed nearly 20 years ago in Legacy of Ashes, his history of the CIA from its founding in 1947 to the end of the 20th century, the agency’s position by the end of the 90s was pretty desperate. It was starved of cash and bleeding talent. A high-flyer who had been station chief in Bucharest was revealed to be working for the Russians, handing them the names of large numbers of agents and employees. But the new US administration that came in at the start of 2001 wasn’t too worried. In March that year,Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, told the joint chiefs of staff: “For the first time in decades, the country faces no strategic challenge.” Six months later came 9/11. The CIA had tried to convince the feckless George W Bush about the looming threat of Islamic ultra-fundamentalism, but no one in the administration listened. The agency was regarded as broken.Presidents from Truman onwards have wanted the agency to be a secret armyPeople in British intelligence are often snarky about the CIA, as poor relations tend to be. Nevertheless, some of the private criticisms made by SIS – better known as MI6 – are well observed. (Weiner’s sources inside and around the CIA are impressive and absolutely impeccable, yet he seems to have no great interest in other western intelligence agencies; apart from a few scattered references to SIS and GCHQ in The Mission, only Dutch intelligence gets much of a mention.) SIS has tended to believe that a fault line of naivety runs through the CIA: witness the way that Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence led the agency by the nose in Afghanistan, persuading it to lavish funds on anti-western warlords whom the ISI supported for its own political purposes. The CIA’s eyes were only finally opened when, by good old-fashioned detective work, its agents discovered thatOsama bin Ladenwas living alongside Pakistani top military brass in Abbottabad.But there’s a more fundamental criticism that SIS and other intelligence aficionados level at the CIA: that it has never been allowed to be just an intelligence-gathering agency. US presidents from Truman onwards also wanted it to be a secret army, a point Weiner makes again and again.Long before the shameful Iran-Contra affair in the 1980s, when Reagan’s officials sold weapons to Iran then funded the CIA’s illegal guerrilla war in Nicaragua with the proceeds, presidents used the agency for their shady schemes despite any ethical qualms its operatives, and sometimes its topmost officers, might have had. The CIA accepted Bush’s edict, based on the highly questionable advice he received from the relatively junior White House lawyer John Yoo, that waterboarding, lengthy sleep deprivation and hanging prisoners by their arms for hours on end did not constitute torture. Perhaps, as a government agency, it had no real alternative, but its employees certainly obeyed, sometimes enthusiastically and even sadistically. Weiner is clear in his condemnation of this, but inclined to give the CIA the benefit of the doubt: “The CIA, with rare exceptions, was not a rogue elephant. When people were trampled, it wasn’t the elephant’s fault. It was the fault of the mahout – the elephant driver. And the mahout was the president of the United States.”Well, perhaps. But it’s hard to find excuses for Gina Haspel, for instance, who attended and oversaw one of the agency’s black-site prisons before rising to become the first female director of the CIA.View image in fullscreenPresidents Putin and Trump attend the 2019 G20 summit in Osaka.Photograph: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty ImagesWeiner’s sources,which are excellent,seem not to have included Haspel herself. But they do encompass several senior CIA figures from the period under discussion. These people opened up to him, and as a result the book contains many essential new details. Weiner’s account of Donald Trump’s links toVladimir Putinin 2016 is clearly based on information from inside the agency, and it leads him to assert openly that Trump was Putin’spoleznyidiot –his useful idiot. There are all sorts of other important and fascinating revelations in The Mission, but it’s the book of a journalist at the top of his game, not an academic. Some of it is written in white-hot anger at the thought of what Trump is doing to the US, and to the CIA in particular. Weiner is clearly channelling CIA opinion when he writes scathingly about the ludicrous John L Ratcliffe, who was given the job of director by Trump. Ratcliffe unhesitatingly complied with Trump’s extraordinary demand that the CIA should send the White House the first names and initials of every recent CIA recruit by non-secure email.There is little doubt that Trump has damaged the CIA, but he may not have helped Putin as much as seemed likely when Weiner was writing his book. Whatever the Russian president thought he might get from a second Trump term, he has in fact been damaged quite badly so far. He has lost his puppet and his bases in Syria, partly through the CIA’s efforts, and his ally Iran, after a shocking onslaught from Israel, now looks increasingly like a paper tiger. Ukraine – and Weiner is particularly good about the CIA’s involvement in trying to stop the invasion in 2022 – hasn’t, as many people expected, folded in the face of Putin’s assault, and it’s become harder for Trump simply to brush that war aside. Whether or not Putin indeed won the presidency for Trump in 2016 (Weiner quotes Russian government cybercriminals who he says swung the election as shouting “We made America great again!”) he is no longer pulling the strings to such good effect.As I say, thisis a journalist’s book, and bears the marks of it. But no one has opened up the CIA to us like Weiner has, and The Missiondeserves to win Weiner a second Pulitzer. Given the intense unpopularity of Trump in the upper echelons of American journalism, he may well get it.John Simpson is the BBC’s world affairs editor.

Having got into a chaotic affray at a pompous posh restaurant – filmed like a deleted scene from Richard Lester’s The Three Musketeers – Modigliani has to lie low from the police and dreams of quitting Paris, to the bewilderment of his quaintly imagined artist comrades Maurice Utrillo (Bruno Gouery) and Chaïm Soutine (Ryan McParland), and his lover (and subject) Beatrice Hastings (Antonia Desplat).But according to his longsuffering dealer Léopold Zborowski (Stephen Graham) he has to wait three days for a certain wealthy collector to hit town – a collector that Zborowski assures Modigliani is interested in his work; this is Maurice Gangnat, played in cameo by Al Pacino. So Modigliani must go to ground, restlessly haunting the streets and the lowlife nightspots pursued by his own demons.This lavishly produced and costumed European co-production is handsomely cast – but the range of talent here feels wasted on what is a fundamentally dated and stereotypical drama, whose Bohemian passion is diluted. Scamarcio does his best and he is arguably the best actor for the job, but there is something rather shallow here.Modigliani – Three Days on the Wing of Madness is in UK cinemas from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsAl PacinoJohnny DeppPaintingPeriod and historical filmsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is confidence trickery perpetrated on the victim in parallel to narrative trickery perpetrated on the audience, who are invited to assume that however hard the fictional characters on screen are falling, the rug under their own feet is perfectly secure. Four years later, Hollywood paid this excellent film the traditional compliment of a well-meaning but inferior (and now forgotten) remake, pedantically renamed Criminal, starring John C Reilly and Diego Luna.Now restored and rereleased, the original looks sharper than ever: a drama of squalid fraud which is a tale of human greed, but also a specific, prophetic jab at Argentina’s financial shady dealers in a deregulated banking system that crashed soon after the film came out. Ricardo Darín made an international name for himself in one of the tough-guy everyman roles that was to become his brand. He plays Marcos, a hard-bitten conman browsing in a convenience store one evening, and amused to notice fresh-faced wannabe trickster Juan (Gastón Pauls) incompetently trying to pull off a petty scam whereby the cashier is bamboozled into giving him too much change. (It’s a cheap trick to compare with that of Tatum O’Neal in Peter Bogdanovich’s Paper Moon or John Cusack in Stephen Frears’ The Grifters.)Marcos saves the hapless young chump from the authorities by frogmarching him out pretending to be a cop and offers to make him his partner in a few deals he’s trying to pull off; Juan agrees, having perhaps rashly told Marcos he has saved $50,000 towards a bribe he intends to pay to a judge to save his career-criminal dad from a lengthy prison sentence. Marcos has a long and elaborate tale to tell of his own dispute with siblings over a family inheritance, and then somehow they get the chance at making a staggering fortune by selling an ultra-rare set of stamps from Weimar Germany called the “Nine Queens” to a crooked businessman with a passion for philately. Juan is saucer-eyed at the thought of so much easy money. But what’s the catch?The Nine Queens could be a subtextual comment on a certain type of secret postwar expatriate in Argentina, lurking in a concealed network of hush money, resentment and shame. The story has a little of George Roy Hill’s The Sting, but more of the double-dealing bad faith of David Mamet movies such as House of Games; it plays on a particular kind of hard-won cynicism that seems like the truth, but might not be. A fool and his money are soon parted, of course, and if something seems too good to be true, then that’s probably just what it is. But what if the Nine Queens and their promise of an instant jackpot are real, like the once-in-a-lifetime rare buffalo nickel in Mamet’s American Buffalo? What if you passed up your one opportunity of getting rich? Is your cynicism just another kind of self-destructive fakery, an admission that, in your heart, you don’t believe you deserve luck?This is an outstanding film with an amusing payoff over the final credits – and it is very sad thatBielinsky died of a heart attack just a few years after it came out, having just completed another thriller with Darín called The Aura. A potentially great career cut short.Nine Queens is in UK cinemas from 11 July, and on Blu-ray from 11 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsArgentinaAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a rapid sequel to a popular hit, even featuring, in the style of Superman and Harry Potter, the name of the marquee hero in the title: it was initially performed as Sir John Falstaff and the Merry Wives of Windsor, granting a franchise to the obese, beery, leering knight previously seen as the mentor to Henry IV.However, in another aspect, The Merry Wives of Windsor, as it now identifies, chafes against contemporary sensitivities. The main sources of comedy are fat-shaming – whether Sir John’s belly, dimensions and contents widely analysed, will fit confined spaces – and the failure of foreigners to speak and act as the Queen’s subjects did, especially the Welsh and French, nations each represented by a gross caricature. Oh, and just how many words can make an English audience see penises or vaginas.View image in fullscreenTaking charge … Emma Pallant (Mistress Page) and Danielle Phillips (Robin the Page) in The Merry Wives of Windsor.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianBut director Sean Holmes exuberantly embraces all of this, locating, in Shakespeare’s most homely comedy (his one play with an English town in the title), a template for a national strain of populist drama, driven by innuendo and xenophobia, that stretches to Carry On and ’Allo, ’Allo.Most words come twice. The devil who deceived Faust is pronounced “Mephisto-phallus.” Adam Wadsworth’s Dr Caius delivers “By Gar” (the text’s cod-Gallicism for “By God”) to sound suspiciously like “Bugger!”; the same actor quick-changing to a Slender with a Pythonesque funny walk, bow-legged and pigeon-toed.The cast, though, also bring out what is most Shakespearean about this potboiler frivolity: the fascinated ear for speech. George Fouracres’ Falstaff has Midlands tones that may echo the playwright, and impressively moves from careless gluttony and lechery to the character’s later fear and fury. As Mistress Ford and Mistress Page – the Windsor wives who Falstaff jointly targets to double his odds of sex – Katherine Pearce and Emma Pallant glory in the story’s most modern element: women taking charge. Marcus Olale has the presence to show that he in future deserves a more rewarding role than the somewhat sub-plotty Fenton and Nym.Even the admirable narrative clarity of Holmes’ staging can’t quite unravel the messy fifth act that – with tricks and faeries in a wood and Sir John lamenting that he has been turned into an ass – disconcertingly overlaps with A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which, the RSC’s favoured timeline suggests, was written in close proximity. Holmes sensibly points up these parallels with a better-known piece for this season but it is finally the play that loses a fifth star for a joyous production that is a perfect summer night’s revel for tourists and citizens alike.AtShakespeare’s Globe, London, from 13 July to 20 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreShakespeare's GlobeWilliam ShakespearereviewsShareReuse this content"

The 27 discs included the first recordings of Reich’s most recent scores,Traveler’s Prayerand Jacob’s Ladder, and now, for those who already owned the set from its previous incarnation, it has released those two works together on their own. Both pieces were composed during the Covid lockdown, and are scored for four singers and an instrumental ensemble; in both cases, too, they have Hebrew texts taken from the Old Testament.View image in fullscreenIn almost every other respect, though, the two pieces are very different. Traveler’s Prayer,first performed in 2021, is meditative and static, floating, almost ritualised. Those who associate Reich’s music with insistent rhythmic movement will find little of that here, and Reich has described the result as “closer to Josquin des Prez than Stravinsky”. The long, sinuously intertwining vocal lines for the pairs of sopranos and tenors make constant use of canons, yet harmonically the music stays rooted to the spot, without the magical shifts of tonality that give so much of Reich’s music its allure.Jacob’s Ladder, though, returns immediately to the propulsive, exuberant Reich, as the words from Genesis describing Jacob’s vision of a ladder to heaven are intoned by the vocalists over busy, insistent string and wind figures whose gently clashing dissonances add just a little edge to the textures. This buoyant music is joyously, inexhaustibly energetic; it’s hard to believe it was composed bya man who will be 90 next year.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

The most peculiar example might involve the reunion album by Virginia rap duo Clipse, AKAPusha Tand Malice. It was scheduled to be released by a subsidiary of Universal, home to both Lamar and Drake. But the label apparently demanded that the track Chains and Whips, featuring Lamar, be removed – despite the fact that, dazzling and pugilistic though his verse is (“I don’t,” he avers, “fuck with the kumbaya shit”), neither it nor the rest of the track seems to reference Drake. Years before the Drake/Lamar beef erupted, Pusha T released The Story of Adidon, a Drake diss track so brutal that one critic compared it to “bringing a gun to a knife fight”. Pusha T alleged that Universal’s “lyrics committee” deemed the very presence of Lamar on a track also featuring him was an act of provocation. As a result, Clipse wound up buying out their Universal contract: Let God Sort Em Out instead appears on Jay-Z’s Roc Nation label, with Chains and Whips present and correct.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Let God Sort Em Out.Photograph: KAWSIt’s an intriguing twist in a broader story – Drake is, after all, currently suing Universal for defamation over Lamar’s 2024 hit Not Like Us (Universal has called that case “utterly without merit”, and has not commented on theClipsesituation). And, if nothing else, the alleged existence of a shadowy committee fearful of Clipse’s lyrical power is useful publicity for the duo’s return.It’s 15 years since Pusha T’s elder brother Malice quit the duo, a conversion to Christianity sitting uncomfortably with their trademark descriptions of life in the cocaine trade: he subsequently changed his name to No Malice. “Came back for the money, that’s the devil in me,” he shrugs on POV, but whatever the reason, the No has gone and he’s rapping about his time as “the Bezos of the nasals” again, replete with an impressive array of euphemisms for his chief commodity: at one juncture, he refers to it as Lady Gaga.Still, Clipse’s return hardly needs a publicity boost. Their first two albums, in 2002 and 2006, spawned a rabid cult following that, as Pusha T once rhymed, “put the hipsters with felons and thugs”. As one half of production duo the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams helped propel Clipse to stardom, and is back on board. If Drake doesn’t warrant a mention, notice is nevertheless served that getting on the wrong side of Pusha T remains best avoided: on So Be It Pt II, rapper Travis Scott is eviscerated in no uncertain terms.It would be a shame if this headline-grabbing stuff overshadowed Let God Sort Em Out, as strong a restatement of Clipse’s skills and power as you could wish for. Said skills might be even more striking in 2025, because their stock in trade – vivid storytelling, technical brilliance made to seem effortless – has, aside from the occasional figure such as Lamar or Doechii, little purchase in current mainstream hip-hop, dominated as it is by vibe creators such as Playboi Carti or Future rather than genuine wordsmiths. Listening to the chemistry sparked by Clipse’s contrasting approaches – Pusha T’s relentlessness alongside Malice’s more measured style, his sense of reflection amplified by his time away – is a salutary reminder of what you’ve been missing. “You rappers all beneath me,” snaps Pusha T on Ace Trumpets. His brother concurs: “All of you imposter, simply just Ferrari window shoppers.”Great lines abound, from the chilling to the laugh-out-loud, while the feeling that guests including Nas and Tyler, the Creator feel obliged to step up – without ever quite stealing the show – is unavoidable. Something similar is true of the music. From the eerie minimalism of 2002’s Grindin’ to the metallic clatter of 2006’s Wamp Wamp, Clipse always seemed to bring out the best in the Neptunes, and likewise, Williams flying solo here. His focus these days may be on fashion – the album was part recorded in the Paris HQ of Louis Vuitton, where he’s creative director of menswear – but that feels like a shame given how inspired these beats are. The rhythm that underpins Ebitda sounds like an introductory fill that’s about to resolve into something more straightforward, but it never settles down, obstinately driving the track on. The horn riff of Inglorious Bastards is warped into a daring atonality; the gospel samples on So Far Ahead jar thrillingly with the dragging beat and low-rent synthesiser buzz; the Indian vocals and strings behind So Be It Pt II are enough even to distract attention from Pusha T’s forthright views on Travis Scott.The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreThe album’s one sonic misstep is opener The Birds Don’t Sing, its big John Legend-sung chorus venturing into a poppy commerciality that sits awkwardly with Clipse’s USP, but the track is redeemed by its lyrics, a depiction of the near-simultaneous deaths of the brothers’ parents that rains one emotional blow after another on the listener: “The way you missed mama, I guess I should have known / Chivalry ain’t dead, you ain’t let her go alone.” It’s new emotional territory for Clipse, who up to now didn’t really do vulnerable, and proof that Let God Sort Em Out offers far more than nostalgia: familiar but fresh, it’s one of the albums of the year.This week Alexis listened toDurand Jones and the Indications – Lovers’HolidayNot a cover of Change’s disco classic, rather a standout from recent album Flowers that floats gently but gorgeously along, as welcome as a cool breeze on a hot afternoon.Explore more on these topicsClipseAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPusha TRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The world premiere of Blackhaine’s And Now I Know What Love Is, an immersive performance blending choreography and sound, promises an “invitation to step outside of reality and into a numb world” and from the off it grabs hold of your senses.Blackhaine’s Tom Heyes is an experimental musician, rapper and choreographer – he’s worked with big rap names including Playboi Carti – who incorporates drill, drone, donk, and harsh soundscapes into his music, alongside practising the Japanese dance-theatre form butoh. He doesn’t perform himself here, instead creating a piece where there’s no stage, so dancers and audience coexist, roaming freely.View image in fullscreenBlackhaine: And Now I Know What Love Is at Manchester international festival 2025The dancers’ movements are initially totally static, then intensely slow, before some begin to twitch and retch as if they are poisoned and dying. Pummelling sub-bass floods the room and a guitarist on a balcony plays sparse melodic licks: it sounds like the Durutti Column’s Vini Reilly collaborating with drone titans Sunn O))). Then silence falls and there are more convulsions, more retching, before a more aggressive dance begins – one man runs back and forth, contorting as though he’s trying to escape his own body.Blackhaine: the bleak, brilliant Lancashire rapper-dancer hired by Kanye WestRead moreThe audience follows and swarms around the action, which makes it difficult to see at times. However, for a show void of obvious narrative, but which explores themes of isolation and desolation, there’s a pleasing symbolism in feeling left on the outskirts. The second half intensifies furiously, as an MC lets rip guttural roars that cause bits to fall from the ceiling. He then emerges on top of a shipping container, still screaming, as bright white strobes pulse with disorienting effect.Dancers shudder and jerk violently on the floor, before the two left standing fall arm-in-arm – finding comfort and connection amid desperation – and everything goes pitch black. It takes a moment to come back around from being plunged into this “numb world” but Heyes does not just deal in anaesthesia – he’s also created something arresting, transfixing, and psychedelically discombobulating.Blackhaine: And Now I Know What Love Is is atDiecast, Manchester, until 19 July.Manchester international festival 2025runs until 20 JulyExplore more on these topicsMusicDanceExperimental musicManchester international festivalFestivalslive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Superficially at least, the Sonata in A major, D959, is the most extrovert and high spirited of that final triptych, even though, in its slow movement especially, tragedy breaks through the surface. Osborne’s performance conveys an impressive sense of both the expansive scale of the four-movement work and its lyrical ebullience. He gives the opening gesture (which will return in the final moments to devastating effect) all the grandeur it needs, perfectly balanced against the delicacy of the figuration that follows, and as the performance unfolds, every detail is just as perfectly calibrated.The six Moments Musicaux, D780, are equally well thought out, although Osborne does not seem quite as commanding and definitive in these miniatures as he does in the expanses of the sonata, in which his performance is one to set alongside the finest on record, from Rudolf Serkin (on Sony Classical) and Radu Lupu (Decca).Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

The opening of Austria’sSemmering railwayin 1854, the Mont Cenis route (also known as Fréjus) between France and Italy in 1871 and Switzerland’s Gotthard tunnel in 1882 defined the broad contours of Alpine railway geography in the late 19th century. But Habsburg planners were keen to secure better links with Adriatic ports, so in 1901 they sketched out a bold plan for the Neue Alpenbahnen (new Alpine railways), of which Austria’s Tauern railway was the most important. It opened in 1909. When it closed for rebuilding in November 2024, it was a sharp reminder of how much passengers and freight rely on a handful of key Alpine rail routes. Lose one key Alpine link and the effects of that closure are felt across Europe.View image in fullscreenEmperor Franz Joseph of Austria at the inauguration of the Tauern electrified mountain line in 1909.Photograph: Photo 12/Photo12/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe last couple of years have been tough for Alpine rail operators. Landslides, floods and derailment have played havoc on the lines. So three cheers for the more recent good news stories. The important Mont Cenis route reopened this spring, having been shut after a landslide in August 2023 (though there was a wobble last week when another landslide briefly interrupted services). That closure necessitated the cancellation of all high-speed trains between France and Italy. These links have now been restored, allowing travellers this summer to speed from Paris to Turin in just 5hrs 40mins, or from Lyon to Milan in under five hours.New services on classic railwaysOther major Alpine routes welcomed new long-distance trains this summer. On the Brenner route from Austria into Italy, a new seasonal Railjet service now runs from Munich right through to the Adriatic port of Ancona. Since late June, the famous Semmering railway has seen new direct trains from Warsaw to Rijeka which slip by dead of night through the Austrian Alps – 20 hours from the Polish capital to the Croatian coast. Last month also saw the celebrated Gotthard route hosting a new daytime train from Zürich to Pisa, an eight-hour journey that takes in not merely the Alps but also some glorious Ligurian coastal scenery along the way.View image in fullscreenThe Adriatic port of Ancona, Italy, where tourists can disembark courtesy of a new rail service from Munich.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesBut the best is yet to come. The Tauern railway will reopen on 14 July. The return of this major rail axis through the Austrian Alps has had a transformative effect on European rail timetables, as many key trans-Alpine train services are restored. Overnight services from Stuttgart andSalzburgto Venice, suspended since last year with the Tauern closure, return from 14 July. So does the Nightjet from Munich to Rome.It is remarkable how the loss of one key rail link can reshape European geography. During the Tauern closure, journeys from Switzerland and southern Germany to Slovenia have been slower. Within Austria, Salzburg andCarinthiawill be happily reconnected with the reopening of the railway. Trains will again glide from Salzburg to the lovely Carinthian city of Villach in just 2hrs 32mins, from where there are good onward connections to Slovenia and Italy.View image in fullscreenThe Austrian Alps overlooking the Carinthian city of Villach.Photograph: Ewa Olek/Getty ImagesThe Tauern railway is an old-style main line carrying a mixture of freight and passenger services. It was never designed for high speed and the scenery is too good to rush. So the fact that even the fastest trains average under 50mph is a blessing.Salzburg to VillachThe debut southbound passenger train through the restored Tauern tunnel is an Intercity scheduled to leave Salzburg at 06.12 on 14 July. And here’s hoping for good (but not too hot) weather on that Monday, as the Tauern railway is at its best on a sunny summer morning. The railway cuts up the Salzach valley from Salzburg, the scenery initially revealing little of the drama that lies ahead. It is only beyond Schwarzach that the hills close in and the railway presses south, with the great wall of the Tauern Alps ahead. The last stop before the Tauern tunnel isBad Gastein, a remarkable Habsburg-era spa town with belle epoque charm. It is a great spot to break the journey and enjoy the mountain air, or the town’s radon-rich spa tradition.View image in fullscreen‘A great spot to break the journey’ … the Habsburg-era spa town of Bad Gastein.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesContinuing beyond Bad Gastein, the railway plunges into the Tauern tunnel. This is one of the shortest of the great Alpine rail tunnels and there is just seven minutes of darkness before the train emerges into Carinthian sunshine, with the landscape now hinting at a more southern demeanour. I love this stretch, as the railway drops down towards the Möll valley, following the latter down towards the River Drau, which is crossed just after stopping at Spittal. After bridging the Drau, sit on the right for great views of the river, as the railway parallels it downstream to Villach.Here the Drau is just in its infancy; but further down its long course it becomes the Drava and flows east to join the Danube, on the border between Croatia and Serbia. It is a river which has shaped European history, just as the Tauern railway has shaped travel patterns through the Alps.View image in fullscreenThe construction site for a high-speed line between Lyon and Turin, in Avrieux, France in 2023.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesBjörn Bender, CEO ofRail Europe, captures the huge sense of relief across the wider European rail industry when he says: “The Tauern tunnel reopening is so important, as it’s a key route for trains from Bavaria to Slovenia. It is also used by travellers heading through the Alps to north-east Italy. The Austrian province of Carinthia becomes so much more accessible again. And the Tauern reopening on 14 July is just the prelude of more good things to come. In December the new Koralm tunnel opens, cutting journey times between Vienna and Klagenfurt, the provincial capital of Carinthia.”Tickets from Salzburg to Villach via the Tauernrailway cost from £9 oneway (increasing to £13.50 or £18 once £9 tickets are sold out) fromRail Europe.

To me, however, even a whiff of a pornstar martini takes me right back to my waitressing days in the Midlands, and to sticky hands and broken glass after I dropped a tray of four of the damned things. I don’t needa drinks marketing reportto tell me it was the most popular cocktail in 2018; I lived it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The pornstar martini feels like a seedy, hedonistic concoction dreamed up in the 1980s by way of Miami’s South Beach, but it was in fact devised in London, by legendary Ghanaian mixologistDouglas Ankrah, who honed his skills at the Hard Rock Cafe before setting up the fabledLondon Academy of Bartending, or Lab bar, in 1996 (this later led to the launch of Lab Bar on Old Compton Street and later Townhouse in Knightsbridge).Ankrah invented the pornstar martini in 2003, although it was originally called the maverick martini, after a favourite gentleman’s club in Cape Town. His explanation for how he came up with the idea drips with the understatement of a true icon: “I created [it] in 15 minutes or less,”,he once recalled. “Like how Mick and Keith wrote (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction in 10 minutes.” Brilliant!There are myriad rumours as to how the drink got its original name, but Ankrah once divulged in an interview with The Buyer that it was simply his interpretation of what he thought a porn star might like to drink. Give “pornstar martini” a search in your preferred search engine, however, and you’re unlikely to be presented with any of the supermarket offerings; in fact, I can’t be held responsible for what you will come across. These days, however, the drink goes by the rather coyer name “passion fruit martini”.I grumbleda month or so ago about this change of name (if you’re old enough to drink, you’re probably old enough to know what a porn star is, after all) and asked what the reason might be. Turns out, I should have popped my query in the search bar of this very website: in 2019, Marks & Spencer had to rename its bestselling pre-batch cocktail following the upholding of acomplaintby the Portman Group, the UK’s alcohol watchdog. The complaint claimed an association between alcohol and sexual activity or sexual success, a breach of section 3.2d of its code of practice. Fair enough: the association of intoxication with sexual success is a sticky one, let alone a realistic one (am I right, ladies?), but it feels a bit of a shame to erase the well-meaning work of Ankrah, as well as the oldest industry in the world.Four premix passion fruit martinis that are worth a goAll Shook Up Passion Fruit Martini£1.50 (250ml)Tesco, 3.4%.

They have a range of eight to 10 flavours, but the two that dominate are mint andorzata, luminous green and cloudy white syrups respectively, that need diluting with fizzy water and maybe topping up with ice. I have mentioned orzata herebefore, how popular it is in Italy and how the name means a drink made from orzo (barley), and also how at some point the barley was replaced by almonds; then, at another point, the almonds were replaced by deacidified benzoin, which is a balsamic resin obtained from trees of the genusStyraxfrom south-east Asia. Deacidified benzoin is actually delicious and I become dependent on orzata at this time of year, and the sound of the ice clanking against the side of the glass as I walk my cold, cloudy drink back to my hot desk is the sound of summer.However, I have always wondered what orzata made with orzo is like. And finally an opportunity presented itself when, having lifted cooked barley out of the pan with a slotted spoon, I was left with a pan of cloudy water at the back of the stove. I would have thrown it away, if I hadn’t had a glass of orzata on the go. Straight from the pan, the barley water tasted like milk diluted with water, thin porridge and a mouthful of soapy bath water. Undeterred, I consulted Mrs Beeton, who has it inher cooking for invalidssection and suggests adding just lemon zest. Then I looked atthe ancient Roman guide Apicius, who suggests boiling it with prosciutto and adding pepper. I found my answer on an Italian website calledAgrodolceand drained the water, strained it, sweetened it with caster sugar, added a strip of lemon zest, then, for an aesthetic transformation, poured the whole, cloudy lot into an Ikea glass bottle with a stopper. A few hours later, I mixed 50% barley water with 50% fizzy water and added ice and, I have to say, it was fantastic. Yes, ever so slightly soapy still and reminiscent of porridge, but above all like barley, barley sugar and lemon drops, soft, cold and clinking.The thing about making Roddy orzata is that, as a result, you will have 400g cooked barley to deal with – you can use pearl (hulled) or pot. My suggestion is to mix it with roast vegetables: red pepper, tomatoes, onion and aubergine, a few cooked green beans and lots of herbs.While this salad is more than substantial just as it is, it can be bolstered by a tin of chickpeas, white beans or tuna, a few snipped anchovies and a handful of olives. It is also lovely with crumbled cheese (feta or salted ricotta), grilled halloumi or chopped hard-boiled eggs. It is also a patient dish that will sit around at room temperature until you are ready to serve. Just add a little more olive oil, a teaspoon extra of vinegar and toss again before you serve, with an optional glass of orzata on the side.Roast summer vegetable, herb and pearl barley saladServes42 red onions, peeled and sliced into chunky moons1 large red pepper, stalk, pith and seeds removed, flesh cut into short, chunky strips1 aubergine, cut into 2 cm cubes300g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped, or halved cherry tomatoesOlive oilSalt250g pearl barley200g cooked green beans, chopped into little bits (optional)1 big handful fresh mint, basil, parsley, oregano, dill1 tsp red-wine vinegar1 tsp honey vinegar, or other sweet vinegar (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the onion, pepper, aubergine and tomatoes on a baking tray, spoon over four tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle with salt and toss well so all the vegetables glisten. Bake for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the vegetables are very soft and golden at the edges; if they are also a bit mushy, that is fine, too.Meanwhile, boil the pearl barley in plenty of salted water for 15-20 minutes, or until al dente, then drain and spread on a plate to cool slightly.Mince the herbs and put them in a large bowl with the lemon zest, three tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspoon of red-wine vinegar and, if you wish, a teaspoon of honey vinegar or other sweet vinegar. Add the pearl barley, roast veg and green beans, if using, and toss well.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkSaladCereals and grainsVegetablesSummer food and drinkSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"
