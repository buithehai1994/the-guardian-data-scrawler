Whether or not you ever had the money for a jacket with an Armani label, you wore a jacket that he invented. He was the mastermind of contemporary style, the architect of how we dress now. If you have worn an unstructured suit with a T-shirt to a wedding; if you have worn muted neutrals to work; if you have thought it might be chic to paint your living room grey: that was Armani.Armani was working until his final days. Invitations had already been sent out for his next show, to be held on 28 September in the 14th-century courtyard of Milan’s Palazzo Brera. A spectacular party to accompany the show was planned as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the brand, which he founded in the summer of 1975.View image in fullscreenArmani at the end of his Emporio Armani spring/summer 1999 collection show in Milan.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APOn my phone I have dozens of videos of Armani taking catwalk bows at the end of his Milan ready-to-wear and Paris haute couture shows. For the past decade, everyone in the audience at each of his shows has been aware of being in the presence of a living legend. Each brief catwalk appearance has felt like a moment to capture, because even legends don’t live for ever.Those videos tell the story of a dignified, determined man, who even a decade ago, at 80, was taking bows in fitted navy T-shirts that showed off an impressive physique. In his last few years the walk became slower, the wave less muscular, but he was still immaculate.At his January haute couture show in Paris, he wore a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo, smiling as he walked on the arm of a favourite model, blue eyes still piercing. In June and July this year, he was absent from his menswear and haute couture shows for the first time but oversaw fittings via video link from home, and corresponded with reporters over email.Newspaper house style requires that we refer to him as Armani, but he was always Mr Armani, not just to the industry at large but to close colleagues. The fashion industry has long been a first-name-term world, even at the highest levels – backstage, Donatella is Donatella, and Karl was Karl – but the most commercially successful European fashion designer of the past century was never Giorgio, or even Armani, but always Signor or Mr Armani.His persona was elegant, detached and a little unknowable. On the occasions when I interviewed him – at his home in Milan, at Paris haute couture fashion week, and on his yacht, Mariu – he was courteous and polite, an impeccably gracious host, but always with a note of reserve.1:12Giorgio Armani: a celebrated fashion icon – video obituaryThe Armani story begins with a suit. In the late 1970s, Armani took the trousersuit, filleted out all the stuffiness and tradition, and replaced it with a veneer of urbane sophistication and a spritz of louche sex appeal. In doing so, he reinvented power dressing for the late 20th century.More than that, in fact: he redefined what it meant to look modern. Armani intuited how the once pin-sharp divisions between a starched world of work and a warm-slippered domestic bubble were already beginning to soften, in the 1970s and 1980s, even before the internet came along to annihilate them. His supple tailoring appealed to a generation who aspired to a different kind of success, who wanted to make it big but without losing their soul. They didn’t want to get stuck in the same office until they earned their carriage clock, but rather to prowl and preen around the city.View image in fullscreenArmani on the catwalk in Milan in 1981.Photograph: Vittoriano RastelliAs lifestyles shifted, Armani tailored a new silhouette to fit. “Style for me is a mood that can be applied to everything,” he once said. “I’ve always thought fashion is much more than just clothes: it is a way of being.” An Armani suit made a new generation feel like big beasts of the urban jungle. If you aspired to be an architect or an actor or a media hustler or an agent, this suit spoke to who you wanted to be. He took the suit, which had been stuck in the 9-to-5, and gave it both street smarts and bedroom appeal.Giorgio Armani, celebrated Italian fashion designer, dies at 91Read moreArmani was fond of saying that “the essence of style is a simple way of saying something complex”, a quote he borrowed and altered from Jean Cocteau (“style is a simple way of saying complicated things”). What he did: he took a man’s suit, and he took out the shoulder pads.He removed the lining, which changed the way the fabric hung: it was less taut, with a certain carefree swagger. He lowered the buttons of the jacket, and made the trouser legs a little fuller. He perfected the silhouette during the 1970s, and when the world saw it on screen on Richard Gere in American Gigolo in 1980 it seemed to capture something about modern life. In an Armani suit, a man looked primal and hungry, but somehow sophisticated and urbane at the same time. It was a heady mix of power and sex, money and ego.Armani was an outspoken critic of the rampant overproduction of modern fashion, criticising other designers for making too many collections. “It doesn’t make sense for my collections to stay in the shops for three weeks before they become obsolete,” he wrote in an open letter in 2020. “I don’t work like that and I find it immoral.”For the first two decades of the 21st century, Armani’s refusal to engage with trends – he never fundamentally changed either the clothes he designed or his own style – led to him being criticised as behind the times and out of touch. It turned out he was, once again, ahead of his time.A shift to sustainability has meant his point of view that clothes should be both designed and constructed to last has come back into fashion. He once said: “Elegance is not about being noticed, it is about being remembered.” He is gone but will never be forgotten.Explore more on these topicsArmanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

She doesn’t represent Tameside one little bit as far as I can see.”More than 250 miles away on the south coast, the words “tax evader” had appeared overnight, graffitied on the walls outside Rayner’s Hove flat. The word “bitch” had been sprayed on to the white walls in pink, with larger letters spelling out “tax evader” below.Rachel Reeves declares confidence in Angela Rayner after stamp duty ‘error’Read moreAcross the road, construction chipboard had also been vandalised, painted with the words “Tax evader Rayner” and “Rayner tax avoidance”.People living nearby said they were “appalled” by the vandalism, with one describing it as a “disgraceful thing to do”. A spokesperson for Rayner said “it was unjustifiable and beyond the pale”.Back in Ashton-under-Lyne, there was less vitriol but still an overriding sense of anger towards, and disappointment in, their elected representative.Liz Carroll, 40, said in her opinion Rayner “should resign totally” from her ministerial roles and her parliamentary seat. “She’s a disgrace,” Carroll said. “She’s deputy prime minister, she shouldn’t be doing something like that. It’s £40,000 tax evasion and her trying to say she knew nothing about it, when she’s the housing minister? Come on.”Carroll said at the last election she had votedLabour, “but now I wish I hadn’t. I was honest to God hoping that Keir Starmer would turn everything around.View image in fullscreenLiz Carroll said her next vote would go to Reform UK.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“I think next time it comes to the actual vote, I’m Reform all the way,” she said.Ashton-under-Lyne has high levels of deprivation, with more than 40% of children living in low-income families in 2023, almost double the national average.Many of Rayner’s constituents found the £40,000 figure she was alleged to have saved in tax staggering, and second home ownership beyond their reach.“I’ve only just about got one house, and that’s a bungalow,” Maureen Mills, 76, a retired office worker said, suggesting Rayner “has done something underhanded”.“When you think about people struggling, it’s just awful,” she added.She also criticised the prime minister, Keir Starmer, for standing behind his deputy. Mills said: “I think something more should be done than what they are doing.”Adam Barratt, 49, was also critical of Keir Starmer. “He should do his job,” he said. “He’s the boss, he sets the rules, he should go ‘you’re sacked’, but he won’t will he?”“I think it’s a disgrace,” said Stefen, a 31-year-old roofer. “Look at us struggling out here. Why should she get away with 40 grand, and we’re here struggling? It’s not right, is it obviously?” he said. “I think she should get sacked.”View image in fullscreenBrian Kays said that Rayner’s future should depend on the outcome of the investigation by the prime minister’s standards adviser.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBrian Kays, 64, worked on the railways for 40 years and describes himself as a Labour supporter.

Spoiler alert: she was right all along, you knowThu 4 Sep 2025 11.26 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 16.34 EDTShareGovernment debt at record levels. A deputy prime minister under investigation by the standards watchdog. Reform UK 15 points ahead in the opinion polls. A summer in which hatred of migrants has become normalised. Politicians competing with one another to appear more authoritarian.But hey, things aren’t all bad. Because at least we still haveLiz Truss. The country’s most abject prime minister. Liz of the 49 days. Radon Liz. Because she is both a gas and inert.I fell in love with her the day she was unable to find the door to let herself in to her own leadership launch. And then tried to leave via a first-floor window. You can’t buy that sort of genius. Comedians spend a lifetime trying to perfect that level of timing. We should enjoy her while we can. We won’t see her like again. Hopefully.In years to come there will be many books written about Truss. Was she ever fully human? Or some kind of semi-sentient being who somehow blagged her way into Downing Street? Maybe we will never know for sure.She is certainly one of a kind. Most people with her spectacular level of political failure would have wanted to crawl under a rock and never come back. But Liz has no self-awareness. No shame. She will turn up to the opening of a fridge. No invitation is ever refused. In her mind, the problem was not that we got too much Liz, but that we never had enough.Truss is like a cockroach after the nuclear apocalypse. Long after the rest of us are all dead, she will still be insisting she was right all along. That has become her shtick. Her USP. All she now has to offer is her insanity. The Madness of Queen Lizzie.And thankfully for the gaiety of the nation, there is no shortage of people willing to indulge her because they know she’s guaranteed box office. Just not in the way she thinks. All it requires is for the audience to suspend its queasiness about someone so obviously unwell and damaged being used in this way. Much like a Victorian freak show.Liz’s latest outing into the real world came this week on the Master Investor podcast presented by Sky’s Wilfred Frost. You can only imagine the laughter in the production office when it was suggested getting the prime minister who crashed the economy and sent the markets into turmoil on the show.Just as well that Frost is more than capable of keeping a straight face. As is Truss. There again, she is yet to realise she is a national treasure. A living piece of performance art. A starring role in her very own Truman show.The questions started softball. Was Liz enjoying life? She was. Very much so. Never been better. Life as an ex-prime minister was surprisingly fun. Not least because she got to do gigs like this. And what about the state of the nation? Obviously that was all fairly terrible. Growth was near stagnant and the Labour government had ruined everything. As had every Tory government except hers. Because all other Tory prime ministers had been closet Blairites. It never once occurred to her that she might have been the problem. That one of the reasons the economy was struggling now was the fallout from her budget.“I really enjoyed your book, Ten Years to Save the West,” said Wilf. Apparently seriously. If so, he is in a select club of one. The five people like me who also read it did so entirely for the lols. It’s quite something to have written a book in the style of extraterrestrial AI. And still manage to miss the point. A psychiatrist might suggest the book be interpreted as one long, desperate cry for help.But this was apparently the signal for the interview to become largely delusional. First, Liz got to tell us that the real reason she had supported remain was that it was the best way of securing a Brexit victory. Worryingly, I did wonder if she might have a point. Anyone finding themselves on the same side of the argument as Liz has to wonder if they have thought things properly through.Now, Radon Liz moved closer to the microphone. Almost conspiratorially. “They were all out to get me,” she whispered. “Every single one of them.” The Office for Budget Responsibility. The Bank of England. The judges. The civil service. Her own MPs. All the other MPs. That weird-looking bloke sitting upstairs on the 87 bus. Everyone had it in for her. The whole of the UK was out to destroy both her and the whole of the UK. Like some wild Hegelian dialectic implosion. Marxists every one of them.Frost started to look a bit nervous but he was in too deep now. Way too deep. Soon we were on to the mini-budget. “Loads of people think I was right,” Truss insisted. Who were those people? She couldn’t say. If she were to name them then they would be targeted by a secret cabal of 60 million people she called The Blob. No one had told her about liability driven investments. Everything had been a trap and she had fallen into it. The prime minister without power.But was there anything she might have done differently now? Maybe take things a bit slower. Not make huge tax cuts when you knew you couldn’t make spending cuts. Liz looked horrified. That would have been to succumb to the orthodoxy. Make her a rule taker not a rule maker. Frost passed her a couple of Valium to calm her down. After a few minutes the benzos started to kick in. “It was the LDIs,” she repeated over and over again. “Even the Financial Times says so.”“Er … they don’t,” Wilf corrected her. And you were still responsible for everything that happened. I wasn’t, Liz slurred. Blob. LDIs. OBR. Nothing had been her fault. No one would ever take her alive.

Roy Francis guided them to their first title in 20 years with a desperately tight 10-9 win over Halifax at Maine Road. Not only was Francis an outstanding coach but he was black and this was the 1950s. In his majestic new bookRugby’s Forgotten Black Leader, Tony Collins calls Francis “quite probably the only black person to be a leader of white people in any walk of life in Britain”. He really was extraordinary.No one had written in great depth about Francis and then two books came along almost at once. Peter Lush’sAhead of his Timefocuses on his tremendous playing and coaching career, whereas Collins widens the lens to take in Francis’s remarkable life.He was born in the Welsh town of Brynmawr in 1919. His mother, Alice May Evans, was the 19-year-old daughter of a farmer and his father, Lionel, a 37-year-old from Trinidad, was as unique as his son became. Lionel was a preacher and miner in Wales, a civil rights leader in New York City and, finally, a politician in Belize. Leadership and flair were in Roy’s genes. His half-brother Arthur Dibbin became a successful jazz singer and trumpeter who played with Snakehips Johnson. Not your usual rugby league family.Francis was a really good player: a teenage recruit at Wigan, a prolific tryscorer at Barrow – where he formed an all-black partnership with the veteran former England international wing Val Cumberbatch – and Warrington, then an influential veteran at Hull. He played five times for Wales and once for Great Britain.View image in fullscreenThe England army team, including sergeant Roy Francis (front row, second left), before a match against Wales in April 1944.Photograph: Getty ImagesLike most players born in the decade after the first world war, Francis spent what should have been his prime serving in the second world war. It took seven years of his career. When the Lions went on the Indomitables tour of 1946, he was not selected. Was his exclusion a racist decision? Collins makes the case that Francis did not deserve selection but that, given his race, would not have been picked anyway. In 1947 he became the first black man to play for Great Britain but he never experienced a Lions tour. Billy Boston, his fellow Welshman and protege, became the first black Briton selected to tour Australia in 1954.War derailed Roy’s playing career but, in retrospect, it forced him down a path to a glorious future. He became a physical training instructor in the army. Given his natural inclination to instruct, cleverly cajole and support, that was great preparation for a coaching career. The war was his apprenticeship for becoming British rugby’s first master coach – and the first black man to coach a top-tier team in Britain, in any sport.Francis was an innovator and an adopter of others’ ideas, with vast emotional intelligence. AtHull FC, he introduced an eight-week pre-season training programme; he issued players with spikes for sprint training so he had the fastest backs and forwards in the game; and his squad practised other sports, such as basketball, boxing and football (with two balls), to improve their movement and awareness.View image in fullscreenRoy Francis playing for Hull FC in the early 1950s.He watched films of matches and showed clips to his players decades before analysis was a thing in British sport. His management style was supportive and instructional. He kept it simple. Before his Leeds side played Wigan in a semi-final, he took them to watch Wigan play, and gave them only small coaching points to repeatedly rehearse before the big game. They won easily.There were no bollockings. Team spirit was paramount under Francis. He looked after players as if they were his sons, their wives like daughters-in-law. He installed family bars at Hull and Headingley, encouraging lock-ins after matches, inviting players and their families back to his pubs. The young Hull forward Johnny Whiteley hung on his every word. “I loved Roy, loved him,” he recalled.In his first season as captain-coach, 1951-52, Francis took Hull to the championship semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. Soon finals were his currency. Hull had top-five finishes in six of his first nine seasons at the club, winning the title in 1956 and 1958. Thousands stood outside the Guild Hall to laud them. As Collins writes: “Roy had become a black leader in a white world.”This was not only a significant achievement, but it was also a heavy burden. Francis was dogged by an undercurrent of racism in club boardrooms and a nagging notion of often failing on the biggest stage.A bigger Super League is not the only change coming rugby league’s way | Gavin WillacyRead moreThere were plenty of disappointments along the way. When he took Hull to Wembley in 1959, he sorely underestimated the emotional and physical toll a Challenge Cup final takes on teams. On the morning of the biggest match of their lives, he held a full training season in sapping heat in front of the watching press. Unsurprisingly, Hull faded and Wigan racked up a record 30 points. On the same stage a year later, his injury-wrecked Hull side conceded 38 points to Wakefield. Those humiliations never left him.He won the Challenge Cup with Leeds in 1968 but even that success was tinged with regret. As Francis presented his players their jerseys before the match he simply said: “The final act is down to you. You are all prepared. You are all good enough.” John Atkinson was in tears. Little did Francis know that outside the sea was falling from the sky. Leeds still won that Watersplash Final, but it was a hollow victory. The biblical flood stopped them from playing their thrilling champagne rugby to toast their inspirational coach. The rain had ruined it for Roy. He considered that three opportunities missed.View image in fullscreenLeeds players celebrate with the Challenge Cup in May 1968.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/AlamyWhat became known as the Francis formula – fit, quick, expansive on the field; united, organised and fun off it – was underpinned by a tenacity that saw his Hull team once go eight games without conceding a try. He took the same methods to the North Sydney Bears, who signed him in what was reportedly the biggest deal in rugby league history, be it for player or coach. While at the club he offered to babysit for players and put on pre-match barbecues for their families. They would call it cultural architecture these days.But two years of racism from Sydney society and the rugby league press eventually drove Francis out. He returned to England but short spells at Hull and Leeds also proved mistakes. A lingering lack of respect for him repeatedly undermined his career. Indeed, there were several elements reminiscent of other great managers: his charisma finally catapulting big clubs into successful ones (Bill Shankly), his originality failing to have the same impact on his return to clubs (José Mourinho), even his alcohol-fuelled decline (Brian Clough).View image in fullscreenRoy Francis playing snooker with English prop forward Jim Mills at North Sydney in November 1970.Photograph: John M Manolato/Fairfax Media Archives/Getty ImagesA week before he died in 1989, aged 70 after heart surgery, Francis attended the unveiling of the Leeds Wall of Fame at Headingley. He was the pride of the place. At that time, British rugby league had an array of world-class black players. Martin Offiah was on his way to becoming the highest try scorer since Boston and Ellery Hanley was the Great Britain captain. But since Francis there has been only a trickle of non-white coaches. No black Briton has led a Super League team for a full season since Hanley at St Helens a quarter of a century ago.Francis would be pleased to learn that the next Bears coach is also of mixed heritage. Being an historian of the game and an honourable man, Mal Meninga will surely see that the Bears pay suitable tribute to Francis, a fellow groundbreaking natural born leader.Follow No Helmets Required onFacebookExplore more on these topicsRugby leagueGuardian Sport NetworkHull FCNRLAustralia sportLeeds RhinosfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rajab herself, who survived the original assault by the IDF which killed those around her, stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), desperately begging for help. With startling audacity, Ben Hania has used the real audio recording of Rajab’s heart-wrenching voice, while fictionally reconstructing the drama of the emergency responders in their call-centre office, with real people played by actors, talking, shouting and emoting in response to Rajab’s actual voice.The result was greeted with a 23-minute standing ovationat Venice, about a quarter of the film’s running time, with journalists and festival attenders reportedly sobbing in the auditorium. Since that passionate reception, others have wondered if there is notsomething questionable or exploitativein presenting this authentic shattering recording in a Hollywoodised suspense drama, getting actors to cry and rage alongside a kind of docufictional hologram, almost instructing the audience in how they too should be responding. I wonder. Perhaps Ben Hania’s high-concept idea is debatable, and it might have been just as moving to present this extraordinary real-life recording in the straightforward documentary context of interviews with the responders and emergency workers. This might have made clearer what happened from their point of view, why they were impeded from helping Rajab and what continues to hinder them.But it must also be said: there is a reckless, ruthless kind of provocative brilliance in what Ben Hania is doing. Is it in bad taste? Problematic? Well, in a world where directors busy themselves and us with made-up stories about made-up people, Ben Hania is at least grabbing one of the most relevant issues of our time with both hands and finding a way to thrust it under our noses. I can’t agree with people who say there is “silence” onGazawhen it is so dominant in our discourse, but the director is right to reach for a way of engaging with the real world. In 20 years, there might be no debate about the propriety of telling this story in a docufictional mix. So why not do it now, when the issues are live?View image in fullscreenHigh-concept idea … The Voice of Hind RajabMotaz Malhees plays Omar, the emergency centre responder, taking calls on his phone headset, who first hears from Rajab’s desperate cousin in Germany, who had been called from the car. From there, Omar makes docufictional contact with Rajab herself, whose unbearably sad and unbearably real cries pierce the fabric of the drama: “My family – they’re all dead!”; “It will be dark soon – I’m scared!”. Omar’s own distress means he has to be calmed by his supervisor Rana (Saja Kilani).The Voice of Hind Rajab gets 23-minute ovation at Venice film festivalRead moreOmar works out that the little girl’s location is at a petrol station no more than eight minutes’ drive from the nearest ambulance, and some of the film’s most agonising moments consist of simply showing the PRCS’s digital map of the ambulance inching its way down bombed streets. But protocol holds up simply ordering the ambulance to drive there. The embattled coordinator Mahdi (Amer Hlehel) has to explain to hothead Omar that he can’t just radio the ambulance drivers and tell them to get moving. He must first establish a clear, safe route for them to drive down, and this has to be done in time-consuming cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, a unit in Israel’s Ministry of Defence. A mad ambulance dash through a war zone will simply result in the ambulance being hit and its occupants killed – people, he points out, with families and children.And so Ben Hania brings us to the issue that will always recur in this debate. Shouting with rage, Omar says: “How can you coordinate with the army that killed them?” Omar is making that familiar accusation: complicity. Mahdi has to keep his cool and explain to Omar that this is the reality he has to deal with. It is a fierce, vehement piece of work.The Voice of Hind Rajab screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIsrael-Gaza warGazaTunisiaVenice film festivalAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

As someone who spends an inordinate amount of time in stationery shops, I’d posit that no, it doesn’t. There’s just something about September that feels like a fresh start – whether that’s cracking the spine of a new notebook or jamming your feet into shoes without toe posts for the first time since May.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Admittedly, going back to the office after a summer spent corralling children, drinking canned cocktails, or some chaotic combination of both is less thrilling than heading into a new class when you’re a kid. But it still brings that same mixture of trepidation (emails) and excitement (new shoes).Of course, you don’t have to buy new – and of course, if you don’t need a new bag or loafers, you don’t have to buy anything at all. But a wardrobe or stationery refreshcanhelp you feel more prepared for whatever the new (school) year throws at you.So if you’re in need of some new-term bits and pieces (or hoping to refresh your existing ones), read on for our favourite back-to-the-grind buys for all ages. The perfect bring-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink bag? A planner that won’t prove completely useless come January? We’ve got you.Everything you need to get back to the grindView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victoria Jones/PAWomenswearThe back-to-school blouseView image in fullscreenPleated blouse£75 at ArketThere’s nothing like the promise of a new white shirt to lure you back to the office – let’s be honest, none of us are rushing back for the interminable commute and the terrible coffee machine. This waisted poplin shirt from Arket makes for the perfect low-maintenance outfit: just add jeans and a pair of flats, and call it a day.The ludicrously capacious bagView image in fullscreenSuede-toptote bag£130 at M&SEvery woman should have in her arsenal aludicrously capacious bag– or at least, one big enough to fit a laptop and a lunchbox. This soft, suede tote from Marks & Spencer is a serious upgrade to the greying canvas kind you probably lug your gymwear in. It holds its shape thanks to a structured base, the top handle sits comfortably on the shoulder, and it goes with just about every outfit imaginable.The wear-forever trenchView image in fullscreenA-line trench jacket£159 at ArketI’ve been on the hunt for a good transitional jacket since last autumn, and I’m now convinced the best ones sell out by late summer. You don’t always have to buy new – see Vinted and charity shops for great trenches that you can have altered to fit just right – but my money’s on this short cotton jacket from Arket. It hangs beautifully, can be worn for both work and weekend plans, and is heavy enough to last into the winter when layered over knitwear. (Plus, it’s brown in a chic way, not in a “why is Dad wearing that?” sort of way.)Refresh your knitwearView image in fullscreenSweater stone£13 at ToastIf there’s one item on this list that’s truly indispensable, it’s this recycled glass sweater stone. Yes, it’s more primitive-looking than those £30+ electric fabric shavers, but it does just as good a job at depilling and reviving tired knitwear. I’ve used it to smooth bobbly merino wool and cashmere, and I’m positive it would work just as many wonders on school jumpers and cardies.The perfect pumpsView image in fullscreenSplit suede ballerinas£35.99 at ZaraI recently sprained an ankle from walking too far in ballet flats, so you think I’d have learned my lesson. Yet here I am, pining for a new pair of back-to-work ballerinas to smarten up jeans and replace the hideous gorpcore sandals that have been glued to my feet all summer. What this suede Zara pair lack in arch support, they make up for in good looks. Dress them up with a pair of tailored trousers, or down with indigo denim.The goes-with-everything shirtView image in fullscreenClassic striped shirt£95 at With Nothing UnderneathGenerally, you want to avoid difficult decisions early in the morning – such as working out what to pair with a print. But stripes are an exception. A blue striped shirt will go with everything (except further prints – sorry!). I like the classic from With Nothing Underneath – it’s neat in the shoulders, has a round hem short enough to tuck, and washes like a dream. I bought mine on Vinted, so keep an eye out on resale sites for similar styles.Resole and repairIf your loafers or ballet flats have seen better days, extend their life by getting them resoled.Timpsondoes a good resole service at a reasonable price (you can get that emergency key cut at the same time), while most local high streets will have a cobbler ready with repair advice.Add interest to an old bagView image in fullscreenStay Sharp key fob£8 at Ark Colour DesignThanks to Labubus, the plush monster dolls that have inexplicably become a fashion sensation, joyful bag charms are getting their due. If a brand-new work bag is out of budget – or your current one is still going strong – a charm can add a bit of fresh interest. Cambridge-based Ark Colour Design make beautiful ones in every shape you can imagine, using leather that’s a byproduct of the meat and dairy industry.The bad-hair-day hackView image in fullscreenOversized stripe hair scrunchie£14 at AnthropologieEnough time has passed since the great scrunchie resurrection for us all to agree that they’re no longer a passing fad. From couture iterations at Celine to the ubiquity of Ganni’s cotton leopard hair tie, the scrunchie is here to stay – which is good, because it’s the most useful accessory around. Throw unwashed hair into a low bun for the school run or rush to the station to style out a bad hair day. (Wear at the nape of your neck to avoid looking like an eight-year-old dance prodigy.)The slip-on-and-go shoesView image in fullscreenGathered leather moccasin£89.99 at MangoWhether you’re pining for a pair of Clarks light-up trainers or black leather loafers in Mango, the thrill of new shoes for the new school year never goes away. And loafers really are a wardrobe staple: invest in a comfortable pair and you’ll make your money back tenfold. (I’m told that that’s what they call “girl maths”.)Iron out the kinksView image in fullscreenRussell Hobbs handheld clothes steamer£22 at John LewisI begin every school year with the resolve to become the kind of woman who irons her clothes. But as I’m still waiting for this to happen, a quick go-over with a steamer in the morning has saved many an outfit from looking as if I slept in it. I’ve just bought the Russell Hobbs Steam Genie: it heats up almost instantly, does a good job of getting out creases, and is cheaper than most.Hair up, head downView image in fullscreenHand-painted Big Apple claw hair clip£28.12 at Solar EclipseA novelty hair clip isn’t exactly what you’d call a new-termessential, but you’ve got to admit: itisfun. Solar Eclipse’s hand-painted acetate hair claws are designed by an all-women team in New York, and are great for keeping fringes and stray hairs out of your eyes when it’s time to get down to some serious business.MenswearThe smart shoeView image in fullscreenSuede derby shoes£169 at CosLoafers can look a little Hooray Henry on men (although if that’s the look you’re going for, by all means crack on). Derby shoes are a much more stylish alternative – a good halfway house between casual and formal, without looking too city trader. This chunky suede pair from Cos can be worn with everything from denim to tailoring. (Invest in a leather protector to make them last.)Pull your socks upView image in fullscreenCotton-rich socks, seven-pack£7 for a pack of seven pairs at M&STomisquoteAllen Ginsberg, I have watched some of the best outfits of my generation destroyed by a bad pair of socks. Yes, they should always match. No, the tops of them should not be visible when your trousers ride up. In terms of bang for your buck, this super-soft M&S pack of seven is pretty much the best there is.Down to a TView image in fullscreenEcru textured organic cotton T-shirt£45 at WaxDoes the perfect white T-shirt exist? Well, the perfect ecru one does. There’s something about an off-white tee that looks that little bit more office-appropriate than blinding bright white (possibly because it’s less likely to go grey after a few too many washes). This boxy cotton T-shirt is cut from a textured heavy-weight cotton you can wear well into the autumn under an open shirt or jacket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Be warned: it’s hand-wash only, but like most knitwear, a decent spot clean every so often should do the trick.Stationery and accessoriesA pencil case for grownupsView image in fullscreenSmall sage pouch£16 at Community ClothingA pencil case, but for adults in denial about owning a pencil case. Made from dead stock cotton, this Community Clothing pouch would make a nice addition to any cavernous work bag – just add pens, keys, hand cream and any other miscellaneous bits that are always falling to the bottom.The high fashion lunch bagView image in fullscreen£19.95 at Black + BlumCarting around last night’s stir-fry never looked so stylish. More micro-accessory than lunch box, Black + Blum’s roll-top mini cooler is leakproof, light and considerably more chic than a balled-up bag for life. Given that metal hardware, I wouldn’t be surprised if people thought it was a handbag.The bring-it-all backpackView image in fullscreen£65 at EastpakIf you’re lugging heavier-duty fare, then a backpack is much more practical than a tote – staving off shoulder pain, and allowing you to pile in everything from a laptop to a gym kit. Eastpak’s medium roll-top bag is a good size: big enough to fit what you need; not so big as to look like you’re running away from home.Strawberry sleeves for everView image in fullscreenStrawberry laptop sleeve£30 at BagguI’m a big believer in double-bagging your laptop: that is, putting it in a caseandputting it in the protective pocket of your backpack. (Mainly because I’ve learned the hard way how expensive they are to repair.) Made from recycled ripstop nylon, Baggu’s envelope-shaped sleeves make the dreaded Monday morning power-on just that little bit sweeter.The fancy penView image in fullscreenRollerball pen£12.99 for a pack of five at RymanGranted, they’re more expensive than your bog-standard stationery cupboard pen, but these Uni-ball fine liners really are the best. Do always keep one of those ballpoint pens nearby, though, should a colleague ask to borrow a pen.The waste-free plannerView image in fullscreenUndated week planner£14 at AsobiIf your well-intentioned resolution to keep a 2025 diary has gone out the window (honestly, who has either plans or inclination to fill one in January?) go for an undated planner that lets you map out your week in a more slapdash way. Margate-based Studio Todd makes beautiful planners with dyslexia-friendly coloured paper and 52 blank weeks to fill at your leisure.The fancy notebookView image in fullscreenClassic notebookFrom £15.90 at Leuchtturm1917When someone whips out one of these in the office, you know they mean business. Well, that or they’ve just had a birthday and a relative didn’t know what else to buy them. If you’re looking for a fancy notebook to kick off the (academic) year right, Leuchtturm1917 is pretty much the best it gets. Think sewn pages, a pocket at the back, a choice of hard or soft smooth covers (note: it’s not leather) and a wraparound elastic closure. FYI: if you’re feeling especially fancy, you can use a fountain pen on its pages and it won’t bleed through.The everyday notebookView image in fullscreenA4 notebooks£4.95 for a set of five at MujiSadly, a £16-a-pop notebook habit is unsustainable – at least for me. These are the ones I use come October when the fancy notebook runs out. With 30 faint-lined pages in each A4 exercise book (they come in a pack of five) and minimal bleed-through, they’re a decent everyday option to keep in your bag should inspiration – or your line manager – strike.The throwback pencil caseView image in fullscreenStorage container pen case£13.46 at London Graphic CentreThis Japanese brand is the stuff of a stationery lover’s dreams. Is this hardshell pencil case the most practical item in this edit? Not quite. Is it big enough to fit a lip balm and a couple of pens while, crucially, being chic? You got it.KidsThe big family plannerView image in fullscreenFamily weekplanner£8.99 at Butler and HillTo some indispensable, to others tyrannical, therise of the big family plannershows no sign of abating. And why should it? It’s a useful way of mapping out the week ahead while keeping hold of your sanity. This wipe-clean version from Butler and Hill will help you keep track of any after-school and evening commitments, without wasting reams of paper.The distinctive lunch bagView image in fullscreenPack a Lunch bag£13.50 at FrugiIf you want to make sure you see your kid’s lunch bag again, get a distinctive one with a label. Aside from being adorable, this rainbow lunch bag from Frugi has an insulated foil lining, and a small front pocket for snack storing.TheraincoatView image in fullscreenShower Resistant Mac£20 at Sainsbury’sIt’s September, which most likely means that your child will cycle through four seasons in one school day. This gender-neutral mac is shower-proof but light enough to run amok in.The best budget water bottleView image in fullscreenKids’ stainless steel water bottle£14.99 at Ion8There’s nothing like a fancy bottle to incentivise your kid to drink water. The adult version of Ion8’s stainless-steel water bottle waschosen by the Filteras the best budget bottle around (no small feat, given we tested 42 of them). The kids’ version is no different: leak-proof, dishwasher safe and small enough to slot into their school bag without weighing them down.The double-zip pencil caseView image in fullscreen£10.19 at Small KinsIf you’re a parent, chances are you’ve already been shepherded through Smiggle, getting the full disquisition on which pencil case and why, and who is likely to have the same one, and what this all means in the scheme of classroom politics. If not, though, this embroidered Forest Friends pencil case from Little Dutch has two handy compartments and is made from sustainable – and durable – material. (NB: if a new pencil case isn’t on the agenda – or in the budget – use a nail brush and some warm soapy water on last year’s, before laying it flat to dry.)Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that said, the president’s own words have helped legitimise the collective punishment of Palestinians, language that international jurists have warned could fall foul of the genocide convention.”However, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee who has been a strong critic of Israel, said “efforts should be made to engage” with Herzog, who has often been at odds with Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over domestic issues.“The question must be asked – how do you see Israel in 10 years? What is the future for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza? If you have no reasonable alternative plan, Mr President, then there must be a Palestinian state,” she told the Guardian.“But the only solution to this is through politics, through discussion. Herzog is easier to talk to than many in the extreme rightwing government in Israel. But we mustn’t pull our punches.”Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said Starmer should “seize this chance to state unequivocally to president Herzog that there must be an end to the suffering in Gaza through an immediate ceasefire”.Downing Street has previously indicated that Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK after the international criminal courtissued an arrest warrantfor him over alleged war crimes in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,” said Herzog in October 2023.That statement was given additional weight when it was included in the international court of justice’s order of 26 January 2024, finding the right of Palestinians to be protected from genocide was at “imminent risk” and saying Israel must ensure “with immediate effect” that its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the genocide convention and to protect Gaza’s population from genocide.Herzog claimed his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him.Starmer last met Herzog more than a year ago in Paris shortly after he was elected as prime minister, where he praised the “historic friendship between Israel and the United Kingdom” and reiterated the demand for the return of hostages and “support for Israel’s right to self-defence”.But Starmer and Lammy have since adopted a more critical position on Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have killed more than 65,000 people, according to the territory’s health ministry.Sanctions have been imposed by the UK government on two hardline Israeli cabinet ministers and Starmer has announced plans alongside France to recognise the state of Palestine this month.However, there remains considerable anger and concern within Labour and elsewhere that the UK has done too little to halt the suffering of Palestinians.Last week the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said heplanned to boycott a state dinnerto be hosted by King Charles during Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in a fortnight’s time – in protest at the US’s lack of pressure on Israel to end the war.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He said: “My experience is [Magnus] will be comprehensive in the report that he gives me. He will be quick, and that’s what I’m expecting. And so I want to let that process take its course.”Verrico, whom the Guardian revealed on Thursday was the conveyancer for the purchase, said in a statement: “I confirm my firm does not deal with trusts or offer tax advice. The stamp duty land tax was calculated using the HMRC calculator and was strictly based on the facts and information provided to us.”She added: “We believe we did everything correctly and in good faith.”The statement adds to the pressure on Rayner, who says she was given legal advice before buying the flat in May that she only needed to pay the lower rate of stamp duty because she did not own any other property.Supporters say the deputy prime minister believed she did not need to declare an interest in her family house in Greater Manchester because she had sold her stake in it to a trust in the name of her disabled son. However, the terms of that trust meant she retained an interest in the property for tax purposes.Rayner’s allies say she did not initially realise the tax implications of her son’s trust, even though she is understood to have consulted two experts on trust law before completing the purchase.Angela Rayner’s full statement on her stamp duty underpaymentRead moreAfter details of the purchase were published in the press, Rayner then sought separate advice from Jonathan Peacock, an experienced barrister specialising in tax. He gave her his draft advice on Monday, even as the prime minister continued to defend her, and a final opinion on Wednesday, after which she told the Guardian shehad underpaid her taxand was in talks with HMRC about rectifying the problem.The Guardian has seen the document filed with the Land Registry to apply to change the name on the deed to the Hove flat. The document was filed by Verrico, under a reference that includes Rayner’s name.According to its website, Verrico & Associates Ltd is a small firm based in Herne Bay run by Verrico and her three daughters. Experts have said that small, high-street law firms offering general legal services may not have the expertise to deal with the complex law that determines the ownership of properties held in trust. It is not yet known who Rayner relied on for advice on the trust.Downing Street said on Thursday: “The final legal opinion was received by the deputy prime minister on Wednesday morning, at which point she immediately took steps to refer herself to the independent adviser, and begin the process of engaging with HMRC.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She’s a good friend and a colleague. She has accepted the right stamp duty wasn’t paid. That was an error, that was a mistake. She is working hard now to rectify that, in contact with HMRC, to make sure that the correct tax is paid.“Anyone that saw Angela’s statement yesterday, saw her interview yesterday, I think will have a lot of sympathy with some of the challenging family circumstances around this, around Angela’s disabled son.”Earlier on Sky News, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson said: “The deputy prime minister sought advice at the point of purchase of the house, which enacted in line with the advice that she received.“The deputy prime minister has been clear for some time that she believed she had acted in good faith, that she had paid what was required of her through that house purchase. It then became clear subsequently that that wasn’t the case, that additional stamp duty was owed.“That was following new, fresh legal advice, but as I say there were limitations on what could be discussed given the existence of a court order that was there to protect her family and to protect her son.”On Wednesday night, Rayner’s Hove flat was vandalised with graffiti saying “tax evader”, an act her spokesperson called “unjustifiable and beyond the pale”.This article was amended on 4 September 2025.

They looked at those who were admitted for the first time between 2000 and 2014 with the protein damage. Armed with the patients’ zip codes, the scientists estimated their long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution, airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 thousandths of a millimetre. These can be inhaled deep into the lungs and are found in the bloodstream, brain and other organs.They found that long-term exposure to PM2.5 raised the risk of Lewy body dementia, but had less of an impact on rates of another neurodegenerative brain disease that is not driven by the toxic proteins.Lewy bodies are made from a protein called alpha-synuclein. The protein is crucial for healthy brain functioning, but can misfold in various ways to produce different kinds of harmful Lewy bodies. These can kill nerve cells and cause devastating disease by spreading through the brain.To see if air pollution could trigger Lewy bodies, the team exposed mice to PM2.5 pollution every other day for 10 months. Some were normal mice, but others were genetically modified to prevent them making alpha-synuclein. The results were striking: in normal mice, nerve cells died off, leading to brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. The genetically modified mice were largely unaffected.Further work in mice showed that PM2.5 pollution drove the formation of aggressive, resilient and toxic clumps of alpha-synuclein clumps that looked very similar to Lewy bodies in humans. Although the work is in mice, the findings are considered compelling evidence.“Putting the two together, to me, indicates that there’s a pretty strong association with air pollution causing Lewy body dementia. We think it’s a very important driving factor for dementia,” said Ted Dawson, a senior author on the study and a professor in neurodegenerative diseases at Johns Hopkins. “There needs to be a concerted effort to keep our air clean.”The work,published in Science, builds on previous studies that have found PM2.5s in people’s brains where damage has been linked toAlzheimer’s diseaseandreductions in intelligence.“Our findings have profound implications for prevention because they identify air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for Lewy body dementia,” Mao told the Guardian. “By lowering our collective exposure to air pollution, we can potentially reduce the risk of developing these devastating neurodegenerative conditions on a population-wide scale.”Last year, researchers at University College London and the Francis Crick Institute in Londonlaunched a project called Rapid, for Role of Air Pollution in Dementia, to investigate how the air we breathe may harm the brain.“This is an important and compelling study that deepens our understanding of how air pollution can drive neurodegenerative disease,” said Prof Charles Swanton, a co-leader of the Rapid project and deputy clinical director at the Crick.“By linking fine-particulate matter exposure to the biology of Lewy body dementia, it provides a mechanistic bridge between environmental exposure and disease pathology. More broadly, the work underscores the urgent need to understand and mitigate the impact of air pollution on dementia and disease risk more broadly, given its enormous and growing public health burden.”Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionDementiaMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

He described the independence of his brand as “an essential value”.Fashion offers sense of joy and renewal in difficult times, says Giorgio ArmaniRead moreHis inaugural 1975 presentation pioneered the idea of soft power dressing, earning him the title “King of the Blazer”. His proposition of fluid rather than structured suiting featuring longer-cut suit jackets, loosely pleated trousers and floor-sweeping belted coats formed an entirely new approach to dressing. He applied the same techniques to womenswear, freeing many from the fussy and figure-hugging silhouettes prescribed by other brands. His muted colour palette of greys and beige became synonymous with stealth wealth, long before the idea of quiet luxury entered the lexicon.View image in fullscreenArmani poses with models inside a shop in autumn 1980.Photograph: WWD/Penske Media/Getty ImagesIn 1980 the brand was catapulted to international fame when Richard Gere wore numerous pieces designed by Armani in the film American Gigolo.View image in fullscreenRichard Gere wore Armani suits in the film American GigoloPhotograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThis also pioneered a new way of working with Hollywood.

About 220,000 people with “greatest need” were set to receiveMounjaro, also known as tirzepatide and made by Eli Lilly, on the NHS over the next three years.But two months on, fewer than half (18 out of 42) of the commissioning bodies across England have confirmed they have begun prescribing the drug. Critics said the figures showed there was now a “postcode lottery” of access to weight loss jabs on theNHS.People using drug Mounjaro sustain weight loss over three years, trial findsRead moreNHS England had put in place a phased rollout of the drug over a period of up to 12 years, but the data suggests even patients who are eligible now cannot get the drug. Most patients on Mounjaro – about nine in 10 – are currently paying for it privately.According to freedom of information requests made by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), few integrated care boards (ICBs) have been allocated enough NHS cash for patients eligible for weight loss drugs. Only nine had the funding needed to cover at least 70% of their eligible patients, the BMJ reported.Ellen Welch, a co-chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said: “These figures confirm the fear that the rollout is not fit for purpose. There is a huge discrepancy between national messaging and what patients are actually being delivered on a local level.”Four ICBs told the BMJ the NHS funding they received covered just 25% or less of their eligible patients, with Coventry and Warwickshire faring the worst. That ICB said it had received funding to cover just 376 patients, despite identifying 1,795 eligible patients in the first year of rollout.The rolloutbegan on 23 June. Eligible patients in the first year include those with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 and other complicating illnesses such as high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes.Dr Jonathan Hazlehurst, a consultant endocrinologist and academic clinical lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said the rollout was “significantly underfunded”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The health secretary said he wanted more people to get them on the NHS after the manufacturer of Mounjaro said it was putting up prices in the private sector. Eli Lilly said in August that it was putting up the list price of the drugby as much as 170%.NHS England said it was “fully supporting” the phased rollout of Mounjaro for eligible patients and had provided funding to commissioning bodies in March.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it expected commissioning bodies to be making the drug available as part of the phased rollout “so those with the highest need are able to access them”.Explore more on these topicsNHSObesityGPsDoctorsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This related to claims made to insurance companies that his legs had been amputated because of sepsis rather than self-inflicted injury.He also admitted three charges of possessing extreme pornographic images relating to videos from a website called the EunuchMaker.Despite reassurances from NHS officials, former patients of Hopper are now seeking legal advice over the treatment they received from him for fear it was not needed.At Truro crown court on Thursday, Judge James Adkin heard that Hopper was identified after investigations into Marius Gustavson, who ran the website. Gustavson wasjailed for lifewith a minimum term of 22 years at the Old Bailey last year for leading an extreme body modification ring. It carried out male castration, penis removal and other procedures on people as young as 16.View image in fullscreenSurgeon Neil Hopper at the Royal Cornwall hospital.Photograph: Tom Last/SWNSHopper worked for the Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust from 2013 until he was suspended from duty in March 2023 after his initial arrest. He was suspended from the medical register that December and the court heard his wife is seeking a divorce.The trust has said the criminal charges against him did not relate to his professional conduct, adding: “There has been no evidence to suggest any risk to patients.”However, former patients – including some who underwent amputations – have contacted the medical negligence firm Enable Law with concerns about their treatment.Hopper dishonestly made a false representation to Aviva and Old Mutual Health that his “legs had been amputated because of illness rather than self-inflicted injury”, the court heard.In April 2019, he used dry ice to freeze his legs to the extent they were no longer viable and required amputation. This had long been an ambition of his and he had a sexual interest in it, the court was told.After the amputation, he made claims to the insurers that resulted in payouts of £466,653.81.

The court was told he “enjoyed the attention” the publicity generated, and he was shortlisted in the European Space Agency’s search for an astronaut with a disability.The General Medical Council placed restrictions on his practice in April 2023 and he has been suspended from the medical register since December 2023.After Hopper was charged, a Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust spokesperson said: “The charges do not relate to Mr Hopper’s professional conduct and there has been no evidence to suggest any risk to patients.

But he later said some countries would provide guarantees while remaining outside Ukraine, for example by helping to train and equip Kyiv’s forces. He did not say how many troops would be involved in the guarantees.The Ukrainian president hailed the move. “I think that today, for the first time in a long time, this is the first such serious concrete step,” he said.US contributions to the guarantees would be finalised in the coming days, Macron said.The meeting of 35 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” – of mainly European countries – was intended to finalise security guarantees and ask the US president for the backing that Europeans say is vital to make such guarantees viable.Many European countries including Germany, Spain and Italy have refused so far to provide troop commitments. A German spokesperson said: “The focus should be on financing, arming and training the Ukrainian armed forces,” a formula that is not vastly different from what Europe is now providing.Alarmed European leaders travelled to the White House in the wake of theAugust Alaska summitbetween Trump and Vladimir Putin fearing that the US president may be about to force Volodymyr Zelenskyy into a humiliating surrender, including loss of territory.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron hosts the video call summit at the Élysée presidential palace in Paris.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/ReutersTrump responded to the European lobbying by claiming he had won the Russian leader’s agreement to hold direct talks with the Ukrainian president, butRussiarejected any such commitment and largely maintained its demand for the surrender of Ukrainian territory and a commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato.Trump had set a deadline of 1 September for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but Trump is known to set deadlines that he then ignores.“We had a great relationship,” Trump said of Putin in an interview with the rightwing news website The Daily Caller. He said he was now very disappointed in the Russian president: “Thousands of people are dying; it’s a senseless war.”Europe has been desperate to ensure Trump does not wash his hands of the war, but it has been unable to convert Trump’s stated frustration with Putin into a plan to try to strangle the Russian economy.Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv offers retort to Putin for ‘messing around’ by demanding Moscow talksRead moreMacron in Paris sought to give the impression that Europe, unlike Russia, stuck to its commitments. He said: “The contributions that were prepared, documented and confirmed at the level of defence ministers under the strictest secrecy allow us to say: this work is complete and will now be politically approved.”Europe has been hoping for months that Trump would activate long-promised sweeping economic sanctions on countries that import Russian oil. The 50% tariffs that the US imposed on India, partly for importing Russian oil, appear to have driven the traditionally non-aligned Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister,closer into the arms of China and Russia.Stung by his diplomatic failure so far, Trump has given the impression of wanting to focus on domestic policy, including crime and the economy.The US was represented at the Paris talks by Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also met Zelenskyy separately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has met repeatedly at military and political level but not published any detailed plan of action, reflecting internal divisions and uncertainty about the nature of the US contribution.In a breakthrough of sorts, the plan for Europeans to buy US arms for use in Ukraine has started to bear fruit. On 28 August, the US state department announced the delivery of 3,350 ERAM long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, worth $825m (£615m, €705m).The funding came from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the US, but the financial contribution of each country was not disclosed. The ERAM missiles have a range similar to that of the Franco-British Scalp-EG missiles, which Ukraine fired at occupied Crimea and the Russian region of Kursk.Zelenskyy said he had not seen “any signs from Russia that they want to end the war”.Kim Jong-un promises to do ‘everything to assist’ Moscow after Putin meetingRead moreThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said it was not for Putin to decide if European troops would be stationed inside Ukraine. He said: “I think we really have to stop making Putin too powerful.”The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, described Putin as the most severe war criminal of our time.On Wednesday in Beijing, Putin attended a military parade alongside Xi Jinping and hailed Russian forces’ progress in Ukraine, saying troops were advancing on “all fronts”.But there are signs that sanctions are finally taking a toll on the Russian economy after two years of high growth fuelled by defence spending.The Sberbank chief, German Gref, one of Russia’s most powerful bankers, warned on Thursday that the economy was stagnating and that unless the central bank cut interest rates then the country would fall into recession.Russia’s war economy grew at 4.1% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 but it is slowing sharply under the weight of high interest rates required to dampen inflation.Explore more on these topicsEuropeUkraineRussiaEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerWar crimesTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He called her a ‘sissy porn-watching scumbag’ … He deliberately whacked the phone out of Ms Brooks’s hand.”Linehan denies one count of harassing the activist on social media between 11 and 27 October last year and a further charge of criminal damage of her mobile phone on 19 October last year.Linehan engaged in a relentless campaign on social media against Brooks, the court heard.Faure Walker said: “These posts were not merely irritating or annoying but rather oppressive and unacceptable, thereby crossing the threshold into harassment. These posts were not provoked by Ms Brooks online in respect of anything she had done to Graham Linehan.“The purpose of the posts was clearly not merely to relay events, to express political opinion, to criticise, to help identify perpetrators or to try to solve any crime. Nor is it a case that these posts merely presented ideas that may shock, disturb or offend. Rather, they were verbally abusive and vindictive, and reflected Mr Linehan’s deep disliking of Ms Brooks.”A conference held by the LGB Alliance, a charity that stands in opposition to the policies of the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall on transgender issues, was disrupted when some women released insects on 11 October 2024, the prosecution said.“Despite there being no evidence that Ms Brooks participated, Linehan linked disruption of the event to her,” Faure Walker said.On 13 October last year the defendant claimed Brooks was “behind countless episodes of harassment of women and gay men both online and off”, the prosecution alleged. He was said to have posted that Brooks was a “deeply disturbed sociopath and I believe he had some involvement in Friday’s homophobic attack”, referring to protesters’ actions at the conference.Giving evidence, Brooks told the court that she “felt alarmed and distressed” at being called a “deeply disturbed sociopath”.She said: “I was being branded as a deeply disturbed sociopath by a relatively famous person with over 500,000 followers – any of which could see Mr Linehan’s post and cause great harm to me.”Linehan also posted about someone with the name Tarquin, which Faure Walker said was the defendant’s “derogatory term” for the complainant. Asked how the Tarquin name came to be used, Brooks told the court: “It is apparently to do with my poshness.”Linehan was interviewed under caution on 5 February this year and provided a prepared statement.Faure Walker said: “He said, in summary, that he considered that the complainant – whom he referred to as ‘Tarquin’ throughout the prepared statement – had harassed him, by approaching him and filming him at close quarters; he said he tried to ignore the complainant, the complainant provoked him and made a provocative statement, put the phone in his face, he grabbed the phone and threw it to the side, it was a reflex response.“In relation to the online posts, the defendant did not accept it amounted to harassment; as a journalist – as he described himself – he believed exposing tactics of trans activities was in the public interest.”Before going into court, Linehan posed with a sandwich board sign that said on one side: “There’s no such thing as a ‘transgender child’,” and on the other: “Keep men out of women’s sports.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Lewis family, who own the club, have put a new leadership team in place with Peter Charrington, who was brought on to the board in March, stepping into a newly created role of nonexecutive chair.Vinai Venkatesham, who was named as the chief executive in April, will grow further in influence and one of their principal goals will be to attract fresh investment. It is understood that it is essential for Spurs to drive their varied plans to expand the business, which would help in the ultimate ambition of bringing on-field success.A source close to the Lewis family said: “Generations of the family support this special football club and they want what the fans want – more wins more often. This is why you have seen recent changes, new leadership and a fresh approach. In Vinai, Thomas [Frank, the new manager] and Peter Charrington, they believe they are backing the right team to deliver on this. This is a new era.”View image in fullscreenTottenham fans hold up a protest banner outside the stadium in February 2025.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesLevy, who took over from Alan Sugar as the chairman in February 2001, has been a magnet for criticism from the fans. They have accused him of putting profit before glory and staged protests calling for him to quit. They have been frustrated by the lack of silverware on his watch, although the team didwin the Europa League last season, adding to the League Cup success of 2008. Levy sacked 13 managers – excluding caretakers – in the pursuit of the winning formula.Nobody can deny what Levy has built at Spurs, starting with the magnificent new stadium and state-of-the-art training ground. With his sharp commercial acumen, he has established the club among the financial elite. According to Deloitte’s most recent Money League, published for 2023-24, the club were the ninth-richest in world football with an annual turnover of £512m. This was during a season when they did not compete in Europe. And it cannot be overlooked that they have become a much more consistent force in the league, the 17th-placed finish from last season notwithstanding.Levy led on the decisionto sack Ange Postecoglou as manager after the Europa League triumph and replace him with Frank and, around that time, he was looking forward with characteristic passion and enthusiasm to pushing ahead with the club’s non-footballing projects. They include the building of both a hotel and an indoor arena close to the stadium; an expansion of the training ground in Enfield to take in a hub for the women’s team and even a bespoke NFL training facility; and numerous residential developments in the Tottenham area. Levy was consumed by the creation of a legacy in the area that went beyond sporting victories.Quick GuideDaniel Levy's Tottenham managers in fullShowGeorge Graham – Oct 1998 to March 2001Departed within a month of Levy taking over as chairman.Glenn Hoddle –  April 2001 to  Sept 2003Club legend could do no better than a ninth-placed finish in his first full season. A poor start to the 2003-04 campaign proved too much for Levy’s patience.Jacques Santini – June 2004 to Nov 2004The Frenchman, appointed after David Pleat’s lengthy caretaker stint, lasted 13 games and left citing personal problems.Martin Jol –  Nov 2004 to  Oct 2007Secured European football in consecutive seasons but just missed out on Champions League qualification. Lost his grip on the job after a disappointing start to the 2007-08 campaign.Juande Ramos –  Oct 2007 to  Oct 2008Pulled Spurs out of their slump, won the Carling Cup – Tottenham’s most recent major trophy until last season’s Europa League win – and secured 11th place. But in late October 2008 the club were rock bottom of the league and change became inevitable.Harry Redknapp –  Oct 2008 to  June 2012Led Tottenham to fourth spot and Champions League qualification in 2009-10. In 2011-12 they finished fourth once more but Chelsea’s Champions League win elbowed them into the Europa League. Redknapp got the push.André Villas-Boas – July 2012 to  Dec 2013Given a second chance in London after his Chelsea failure but heavy defeats in big matches led to his three-year deal being cut short.Tim Sherwood –  Dec 2013 to  May 2014Sherwood stepped up from the academy and won 50% of games in his short time as manager, but departed at the end of the season.Mauricio Pochettino –  May 2014 to  Nov 2019Appointed over Frank de Boer and it paid off. Oversaw year-on-year progress, culminating in the run to the 2019 Champions League final. But a total of 14 points from the first 12 matches of 2019-20 was not enough.José Mourinho – Nov 2019 to  Apr 2021Nearly a year on from his sacking at Manchester United, Mourinho was appointed the day after Pochettino’s exit. His confrontational approach and dour football tested the patience of the club and a Europa League last-16 exit at the hands of Dinamo Zagreb proved the final straw.Nuno Espírito Santo –  Jun 2021 to  Nov 2021A long search ended in the arrival of the former Wolves manager. Began with three Premier League wins but, 124 days later, after two hours and 16 minutes without a shot on target in the league, he was gone.Antonio Conte – Nov 2021 to  Mar 2023Talks in the summer had broken down over the Italian’s transfer budget demands but by late autumn Conte was at the helm on a £15m-a-year contract. Took the club back in to the Champions League but things unravelled in 2022-23 culminating in a furious blast at his players in March. He left with Spurs fourth in the league.Ange Postecoglou – Jun 2023 to Jun 2025Postecoglou became the first Australian to manage in the Premier League after signing a four-year deal. Ended Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought with success in the Europa League but that was not enough to save his job after a 17th-place finish in the Premier League.Thomas Frank – Jun 2025 to …The 51-year-old Dane joined from Brentford after Spurs triggered his £10m release clause. He has won two of his three Premier League games so far.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 63-year-old welcomed the appointment of Venkatesham, the former Arsenal chief executive whom he has known for years, as he needed someone to take over the day-to-day running of the business to enable him to give the other projects greater attention. In short, it did not sound as though he was planning to walk away in the early weeks of the new season.Venkatesham said in a video released by the club in June – in which he gave his thoughts while sitting alongside Levy – that he would take “more of a lead day-to-day on operational matters on the pitch and off the pitch”. In the statement to announce Levy’s departure on Thursday, Spurs noted Venkatesham had been hired “as part of its succession planning”. Charrington has links to Joe Lewis, the Bahamas-based billionaire who, for years, was Spurs’ ultimate benefactor, controlling them through his investment company, Enic.The club’s ownership structure shifted in October 2022 when Lewis stepped back from his publicly stated position. He ceased to be a part of the Lewis Family Trust which controls Spurs, transferring it to unnamed members of his family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Charged with insider trading in the US on 26 July 2023, the 88-year-old was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $5m (£4m) on 4 April 2024. The Lewis Family Trust owns 70.12% of Enic, the company that holds 86.91% of the shares in Spurs. Levy and certain members of his family own the other 29.88% of Enic. Lewis has two children, Vivienne and Charles, and the family’s interest at Spurs is being looked after by two trustees.Charrington, a former chief executive of Citi Private Bank, is a director of Enic. He has also been a senior partner at Nexus Luxury Collection in the Bahamas, an operator of private member clubs and resorts – which was co-founded by Lewis.The backdrop to the seismic change at Spurs is the search for new investment. The game has been ablaze with takeover rumours involving the club, with agents and financiers claiming at various points this year that there is a buyer waiting in the wings. It is known that Amanda Staveley, the former Newcastle director who brokered the Saudi takeover at St James’ Park four years ago, has become a figure of influence at Spurs. Could the club find it easier to attract the additional money they need without Levy cutting a divisive presence at the top?

Soon after, police and firefighters arrived at the scene and ordered Azevedo and the others not to touch or move anything.“I remember looking around – the crying and the screaming gave way to complete silence,” said the 45-year-old driver. “There was a mountain of bodies that were not asking for help. They no longer moved; some were torn apart. I had never seen anything like it.”Mohammad Farid rushed down from his souvenir store in Restauradores Square to help. But for many, it was already too late.“We wanted to rescue people, to save lives,” Farid said. “But no one was asking for help because they were dead. They were dead in seconds.”By Thursday morning, the scene of the accident – inwhich 16 people died and 21 were injured– was filled with flowers and candles to honour the dead and mark the national day of mourning declared by the Portuguese government.View image in fullscreenOnlookers stand behind a police line, taking photographs of the wreckage on their phones.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty ImagesThe list of people caught up in the disaster reflected its international dimension. As well as Portuguese citizens, those being treated in hospital included people from Canada, Cape Verde, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, South Korea, Spain and Switzerland. Prosecutors said on Thursday evening that the dead included five Portuguese citizens, two Koreans and one Swiss national.Explainer: what is Lisbon’s funicular railway Elevador da Glória and how does it work?Read moreA group of local people standing close by the site were discussing what could have caused the tragedy. In the 1970s, Argentina Pereira, now 80, used to work in the Suisso Atlântico Hotel in Rua da Glória, where the tram derailed.She talked of the strain the funicular had been under since Lisbon began to establish itself as one of Europe’s biggest tourist magnets over the past decade.“I used to take the funicular four times a day [in the 1970s],” she said. “It was a beautiful time, and a different time. Now they allow more than 40 people aboard, but back then, no more than 20 people could travel at the same time. I think 40 is probably too much, and if they want it that way, they should do periodic inspections every two weeks.”A graphic showing how Lisbon’s Elevador da Glória works, with overhead electric cables powering the two cars, while electric motors on each axle drive the wheelsAzevedo also felt the tragedy should lead to increased checks.“I think that cities that receive a lot of tourists must guarantee high safety [standards] with this kind of infrastructure,” he said. “This is old infrastructure, and someone needs to answer for what happened.”Although Carris, the municipal public transport company that operates the service, said “all maintenance protocols” had been carried out – including daily inspections and monthly and weekly service programmes – some visitors to Lisbon said they had been put off by the appearance of the funicular.John Heron, a 75-year-old Australian who was on holiday in the Portuguese capital with his wife, Brenda, said he had thought the trams looked “dodgy” when he spotted them from the top of the hill of Rua da Glória a few days before the accident.View image in fullscreenTourists approach the wreckage of the derailed streetcarPhotograph: Miguel A Lopes/EPA“In Australia, we have very high-quality regulation systems, and I am not so sure the same is true here inPortugaland for a lot of older infrastructures in Europe,” he said. “When I first saw the Glória funicular, it looked very unsafe, but I am not an engineer; it was just a feeling. When I saw the news, I thought, ‘Lucky we ended up staying at the hotel yesterday afternoon, or who knows if we would have ended up deciding to take the ride’.”Others were also counting their blessings. Cristián Morgado, a 31-year-old tourist from neighbouring Spain, had been planning to ride the route on Wednesday afternoon with his partner, Soraya Navarro. In the end, they decided to do it in the morning.“Since we saw what happened, we can’t stop thinking that it could have been us if we hadn’t changed our minds,” said Navarro, 30.Despite Wednesday’s crash, which Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, described as “one of the biggest tragedies in our recent history”, Morgado doubts tourists will be put off from visiting Lisbon.View image in fullscreenOnlookers watch as police inspect the wreckage of the derailed funicularPhotograph: Horacio Villalobos/Getty Images“I don’t think this will affect tourism much,” he said. “Spain has a similar situation with overtourism, and now we are having a serious issue with pickpocketing, and foreigners know and that hasn’t stopped them.”In a few weeks, he said, foreigners would probably have forgotten about all this. “Portuguese people won’t, but tourists will.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cause: the Middle East, including a Palestinian state.“The time has come to promote the recognition and implementation of two principles universally accepted by the international community: the right to existence and to security of all states in the region, including Israel … [and] recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” stated theVenice declarationcalling for Palestinian self-determination.More than 45 years and many hand-wringing declarations later, the EU has been castigated for its inability to play a role in bringing peace to the Middle East or even to respond to one of the world’s most glaring humanitarian crises.View image in fullscreenPedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain, arrives for a meeting with Keir Starmer on Wednesday.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockEurope’s response to Gaza has been a failure, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,said this week. Striking a similar note, Slovenia’s president, Nataša Pirc Musar, described Israel’s policy as “genocidal” and questioned how some politicians, including in EU countries, could tolerate displacement, destruction of homes and acute shortages of essentials for Palestinians in Gaza.And in an exceptional rebuke, 209 former EU ambassadors and diplomatic staff wrote to EU leaders last month to voice“profound disappointment”that no substantive measures had been taken by the bloc to put pressure on Israel to end its brutal war on Gaza.As European leaders face pressure to act, this month’s UN general assembly (UNGA) may be another moment that showcases Europe’s divisions overIsrael, including the question of Palestinian recognition.France,the UK, Canada and Australia have signalled their intention to recognise Palestine at the UNGA, which would be a powerful symbolic move by three G7 countries and two UN permanent security council members.About a third of EU countries already recognise Palestine. The first group of these includes several central and eastern European countries that did so in 1988 under the orbit of the Soviet Union, including Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. The group includes Hungary, which today is led by Viktor Orbán, one of the staunchest defenders in Europe of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.While Czechoslovakia was part of this group, the Czech Republic describes the 1988 statement as “a political act due to the politics and organisation of international relations at the time”. Prague says it supports a two-state solution, but does not recognise Palestine nor intend to “unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state”.A second group consists of western EU member states that recognised Palestine in response to Israeli policy and actions in recent years. Swedenrecognised a Palestinian state in 2014, soon after a Social Democrat government was elected with the support of pro-Palestinian Greens and a leftwing party. Ireland, Spain and (non-EU) Norway took the decision in May 2024 in response to Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, seeking to keep alive a two-state solution.Soon they will be joined by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta. Emmanuel Macron announced in July thatFrance would recognise Palestine“true to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”. This week Belgium became the latest EU country to declare it would recognise Palestine, after complex negotiations nearly tipped its five-party government into crisis. As part of the compromise, Belgium’s royal decree on recognition will not be issued until the last Israeli hostage held by Hamas is released.As the Belgian debate revealed, Israel’s war on Gaza has roiled European politics, dividing parties and shaking fragile governments. The Dutch government has ruled out recognition for now but lost its foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, a former ambassador to Israel, whoquit the caretaker government in Augustover his coalition partners’ veto on tougher sanctions against Israel. Finland has also declined to recognise Palestine, amid splits on the issue between the country’s president and prime minister, although both are members of the same centre-right party.View image in fullscreenCaspar Veldkamp resigned as the Netherlands’ foreign minister after the cabinet failed to support enforcing sanctions on Israel.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesMartin Konečný, the director of the European Middle East Project, a Brussels-based NGO, argues that Palestinian recognition is a significant step but risks becoming an empty gesture without pressure on Israel to change course over the destruction of Gaza and the construction of illegal settlements in the West Bank.“If you are recognising Palestine and want the Palestinian state to exist then you need to couple it with pressure on the Israeli government which is currently doing everything to destroy Palestine on the ground,” he said. “[The Israeli government] is destroying, physically, Gaza and it is expanding settlements in such a way in the West Bank that is making the two-state solution … impossible, so Palestine is being wiped off the map and that’s not an exaggeration.”Israel’s president to visit London next Thursday for expected talks with ministersRead moreNearly two years after Israel launched its retaliation for the7 October attacks, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, the EU has not taken any measures against the Netanyahu government. In nearly 23 months, Israel has killed more than 63,700 people andinflicted a human-made famineon Gaza. The EU foreign policy service concluded in June that Israel wasbreaching human rights obligationsand later outlined possible sanctions. The European Commission has proposed arguably the mildest possible measure – apartial suspensionof Israel from the EU’s research programme. Yet this has failed to find the necessary majority, with Germany and Italy declining to support the move.Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, who until 2023 was the EU’s representative to the Palestinian territory, having also served as its envoy in Jerusalem, has concluded that for now there will be no EU collective response on Gaza. He helped organise the recent diplomats’ letter to EU leaders, the third in a series, urging action against the Israeli government.The latest letter, sent in August, called on European countries to take individual action against Israel, such as banning weapons sales, ceasing cooperation with Israeli universities, ending trade in goods and services from illegal settlements and sanctioning human rights violators where possible. The letter continued to urge common EU sanctions, although Kühn von Burgsdorff thinks the EU is stuck for now.He told the Guardian that individual member states should work outside EU formats, joining forces with countries in the global south. “I am seeing a configuration whereby the EU becomes less relevant on the Gaza file and coalitions of the willing across the regions will have more impact,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Here, security experts advise on the best ways to avoid being burgled.Be more secure than your neighbour“Thieves are generally opportunists,” says Anthony Neary, managing director ofsafe.co.uk. “If they are in a street looking at various houses, the one that is the least secure will get targeted. If you’ve got lights outside your property and someone else hasn’t, they will go for the people who haven’t got the lights.”Get a security lightThe evening is a common time to be burgled, says Neary. “Around September/October time, when the dark nights come in; you’re more at risk then, as the thief is hidden.” Security lights are an inexpensive deterrent: “A thief wouldn’t want to advertise that they’re trying to get into someone’s house. If there are lights flashing on, they are doing that.”Ellie Morrison is the senior category manager for electrical, lighting and smart home at Toolstation. “One of our top-selling smart items is a floodlight that also records,” she says. “Having that at the front and back of your house, with the added benefit of being able to record anyone that comes on to your property, is definitely one of the strongest [deterrents].”Don’t leave tools lying aroundView image in fullscreenMake sure your shed is secure as burglars often use tools not locked away to break in.Photograph: JohnnyGreig/Getty“Make sure that tools, or any equipment that would help someone to break into property, are not readily available,” says Neary. “It might sound obvious – people don’t tend to leave things lying about – but a lot of people have got garden sheds that are full of tools that will help someone into your house. So shed security becomes really important, and people just ignore it. It has probably got a very basic lock on it.” If you can make it more secure, that will really help, says Neary. “Again, it comes back to opportunists. They will look in a shed, not necessarily to steal things, that’s a misconception; people aren’t going to steal power tools and lawn mowers. It is to get tools out of there that can get you into someone’s property and you don’t have to carry them around.”Sort your locks outView image in fullscreenReplacing a lock barrel is a simple DIY job – and a quick way to boost home security.Photograph: Yuriy Gluzhetsky/Getty“Locks are probably one of the easiest things to replace,” saysWayne Perrey,a DIY expert and presenter. “Let’s say you’ve moved into a new property or you’ve lost your keys, so there is a set out there somewhere: it is really easy to change.“If you’re locked out, you need a locksmith. But if you’re able to open the door, then on the side edge of the door there are normally two screws. You can undo those screws and it allows you to remove the barrel cylinder. Take that down to your DIY store and match it like for like. There will be an exact same barrel available, which will have a brand new set of keys.” Make sure the lock is an adequate standard for your insurance policy, he adds: “It should be a five lever mortice lock.”Trim your hedges“The downside to hedges is that they are a hiding spot,” says Neary. “People want them for privacy, but creating little nooks and crannies in your garden is not a good idea, so keep your garden trimmed as best you can.” Perrey recommends putting in prickly plants around boundaries: “Hawthorn and other spiky plants will discourage people from being able to access your garden: they can’t just jump over the fences, because they’re going to get scratched.”Embrace smart securityView image in fullscreenSmart doorbells and cameras can deter intruders – but they can also lead to anxiety if badly set up.Photograph: takayib/Getty/iStockphotoSmart security, “allows you to keep an eye on what’s happening at your property at pretty much any time,” says Neary. “You can be abroad on holiday and easily see anything that is going on.”“Eighty per cent of the doorbell market is now smart doorbells,” says Morrison. “There are a lot of cameras where you can set up motion detection and just keep aware. So if something happens around your property, if someone drove into your gate post, for example, you would then have a record, and you would be able to use that for any claims that you need to make. You can also add things like sensors on to your doors and windows that can be tied into either recording or alarms, to alert the intruder that they are being watched,”or produce “a loud noise to summon help. It would also send you a push notification. A lot of it is about your awareness of your property, but also scaring off any potential intruders.”The downside is this can mean you obsess over home security when you aren’t there, says Neary: “As technology improves, we’re more informed all of the time, and security is just another aspect of that. So if you’re on the beach and your phone pings, nine times out of 10, it will probably turn out to be nothing, it’s a cat or whatever, but you don’t know so it will increase anxiety. But I think that’s just modern life.”Think about where cameras and sensors are positioned, says Perrey. “My internal Ring alarm used to go off all the time,” he says, which caused him to panic. Eventually, “I realised it was pointing at an area where there is major sunlight coming through, and if a cloud went past quickly across the sun, it thought somebody was walking into the lounge.”Consider an alarmView image in fullscreenAlarm systems are simple to install and act as a strong deterrent.Photograph: Grace Cary/Getty“Over the last 10 years, alarms have become a really easy DIY install,” says Neary. “There are no cables any more, they run from batteries which you need to remember to replace. You should always have a siren externally: it’s a great deterrent.” What about the cheaper option of a fake alarm box? “Anything you can do that creates a deterrent is a benefit, even if it’s not actually doing anything.”“I would say you get what you pay for,” disagrees Morrison. “I would expect that if someone is a professional burglar, they would know which ones are fake and which ones aren’t. I also think that old-fashioned alarm systems with an alarm box are not generally what people have anyway. Most of the time it is less obvious cameras, and it is about catching people in the act. Floodlights kind of do the same thing as a fake alarm box.”Make friends with your neighbours“If you are friendly with your neighbours or if you’ve got a group of people to keep an eye on the street or estate, that is fantastic,” says Neary. “Neighbourhood Watch still exists. It is phasing out, I suspect, because it’s so easy now to have smart security, but it’s still a good idea.”If you are away, make your home look lived in“You want your bins to be put out if you possibly can,” says Neary, which is also why getting on with your neighbours helps. “You can get TV simulators, which are very cheap. They are on a timer and can come on at 6pm and go off at 10pm, and it lights up the room in a TV style with a flickering light. You don’t want mail to collect if you’re away for long periods – people can see through the door and, if there is a mountain of post, that is a problem.”“I use smart lighting inside,” says Morrison, “which, if we’re on holiday, we can turn that to a schedule that randomises. The lights come on, so it seems like someone’s at home, and it’s not an old-fashioned timer that plugs into a lamp and comes on for an hour a day,” the regularity of which can suggest there is actually no one at home.Should you leave your curtains open or shut?“I would leave them half down, but then have lighting that comes on at various times in the day,” says Morrison. Closing the curtains, says Perrey, “lets people know that you’re away, so I wouldn’t do that.” “I am sure curtain timers exist but they aren’t readily available,” says Neary. “Curtains should be closed at night,” if you can get someone to do that for you.Don’t post about your holiday on social media until you get back“With holidays, a big one is not promoting it on social media,” says Neary. “You are literally giving someone a roadmap of who’s in and who’s not.”Get a dog – or even just a dog signView image in fullscreenA dog can be a strong deterrent – though experts warn ‘beware of the dog’ signs may backfire.Photograph: Kemal Yildirim/Getty“Again, it’s another deterrent,” says Neary. “If your neighbour’s got a dog and you haven’t, they would generally target you rather than your neighbour. Even if you’ve not got dogs, signage to say you have is better than not. That is much easier than having a real dog.”But Perrey says there is a school of thought that if people have “beware of the dog” signs, it implies that they don’t have an alarm system, as the animals will set it off, “and dogs can easily be persuaded with treats. So maybe don’t put those signs out. But also be aware that systems like Ring are adaptable so that pets don’t trigger them.”Buy small plants – and consider a ‘bulb lasagne’: how to give your garden a late-summer glow-upRead moreHaving a dog means Neary has a housesitter when he goes away which, as long as they are someone trusted, can be the ultimate way to keep your home secure.Use key safes wisely“I do think key safes are a good thing,” says Perrey, “because the alternative is you tend to put them underneath a mat or a plant pot. But if you do have one, don’t have it on display. I recommend storing it out of sight.”Make sure you use a police-approved version, advises Neary, “as some of them are fantastically secure,” and would take 10 hours and a lot of noise to get into. “Unfortunately, there are really cheap lock boxes that you just look at them the wrong way and they’ll open.”Make sure windows are secureAside from always closing and locking windows, Perrey says that everyone should check double glazed windows to make sure they are installed securely: “With a UPVC window, the glass is held in with beading that runs all the way around, so if your window fails or the double glazing is steamed up because the sealant inside has gone, you can replace the glass: the beading is taken off and you can just change it. Most of the time, the beading is on the inside of the house, but some are on the outside: if you want to break in, you could literally just pop off the beading, take the glass out, and climb in. So check your double glazing, because that could be a big issue.”Don’t forget to lock upView image in fullscreenSimple mistakes such as leaving doors unlocked make homes easy targets.Photograph: Kinga Krzeminska/Getty“Everyone at some point goes out and forgets to lock up,” says Neary. “It comes down to the person just not being on it.” He has spoken to ex-burglars about how they entered properties: “It is incredible how many people don’t lock doors, don’t close windows, just take no precautions whatsoever. That was the most common thing from the burglars. People leave things outside like ladders that just make it so easy. More than anything else, people are completely unaware of security and how important it is.”Lastly, if you think you are being burgled, “keep out of the way and ring the police,” says Neary. “Absolutely do not confront someone because you risk getting seriously hurt.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It feels like I’m experiencing a new way of performing. I said to the director when we first started that I wanted to throw myself into this and to be pushed as far as I can. When you’re in a band, or you’ve been perceived a certain way for a very long time, it’s nice to go into something where you can shake off the Post-it notes that have been put on you by yourself, or by other people.If there was to be a musical made with theGirls Aloudsoundtrack likeMamma Mia!, orHere & Now, what do you think the plot should be?SophieehOur experience of going from complete normality into a talent competition and becoming somewhat famous overnight, and then the trials and tribulations that follow with teenagers trying to navigate new national fame, is enough of a plot. I don’t need to drum up some new far-fetched stories, because I feel like the things that were happening were far-fetched enough.View image in fullscreenOvernight fame … Girls Aloud in 2002 after winning Popstars: The Rivals (from left, Kimberley Walsh, Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Sarah Harding and Nicola Roberts).Photograph: Dave Hogan/Getty ImagesHow was it interviewing Lady Gaga?alexgibbonIt was an experience. My TV plugger was also Lady Gaga’s TV plugger and she had this thing lined up with MTV. The plugger, who’s very much a friend, was like: “It’s just a girly chat, would you be up for doing it?” I was still very much in my shell. I said: “If it’s a girly chat and a fun conversation, I would absolutely love to do it, but I’m not a presenter, so if it turns into that then it’s not gonna work.” Lo and behold, it turned into that. I was in the deep end with this global icon. She was lovely to me. It’s hilarious that it’s become this meme that pops up. [At one point Nicola asks Gaga to pick a dangerous thing she would do once with no risk, to which she replies: “Die.” Later Gaga says “the moon”, when asked if she could be anyone for a day.] I’m quite a literal girl, so when she’s saying “the moon”, I’m like, where the hell am I going with this? Where do I go next?In Hadestown, what parts of Persephone’s character do you see in yourself?SophieehThe fact that she loves spring and she loves love. She loves to be lighthearted. I completely identify with her. In the past, people might say that I wasn’t lighthearted because of the circumstances I was in and the environment I was having to navigate: who is going to be lighthearted when they’re basically being bullied by the media? They’re not. It’s not normal to be like, sure, I’m going to come on to your radio show and act like we’re best friends and sell our song and stand for a picture when you’ve been bullying me. It’s just not natural. But I feel like my environment now is a lovely one.A world with social media or a world without it, which do you choose?AmongstTheWavesGrowing up without social media, the artist didn’t have a platform to have their say, and so the media would be able to portray you in a certain way. They could just write any little clickbait story and get away with it. Whereas now with social media, I feel like it gives people the opportunity to say, actually, that’s not what happened. Or maybe see it from my point of view. But equally, I hear so often from younger artists who can’t focus on their craft because they’re constantly being told: “You need to do more TikToks.” So that’s another pressure.View image in fullscreenIn rehearsal for Hadestown … Roberts with Chris Jarman.Photograph: © Justine MatthewWhat was your most chaotic backstage moment being solo or in Girls Aloud?SharonteenyWe had a moment on this last tour where Sexy! No No No … basically wasn’t working until the first show. We were struggling with the inflatable skirts. They weren’t being put on in time. The crew weren’t quite making the fan cue. There was a conversation that happened where we thought about scrapping it. Somehow, the stars aligned and it just worked. Did my skirt ever deflate? Cheryl’s deflated. Mine went half up, half down.What is the story behindtheSophieand AG Cook collab you did called Potion?SunnysideUp20I was in the studio on a typical writing session and on the mixing desk they had this little figurine. I just Instagrammed it very innocently with the caption “Hey QT” [the title of Sophie and Cook’s 2014 single], like, that’s cute. Then there was a headline saying: “Nicola’s working with PC Music.” I wasn’t, I was just in some random session. But from that headline, AG Cook got in touch and was like: “Should we grab a coffee?” We met, talked about our approach to music and the state of what music was at that time. Then we got into the studio together. The very beautiful human that was Sophie was there plus a couple of other people. And we were just experimenting. I was just going from room to room and they had this track and we created Potion. That was that. Things just moved on. Maybe a year or so ago I messaged AG Cook and asked if they were doing anything with the song. He said that, obviously, all of Sophie’s music rights are with Sophie’s family now.View image in fullscreen‘I absolutely love my red hair and I moved away from it because I felt like it was bothering certain people’ … Nicola Roberts in 2019.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIf Girls Aloud were to have an exhibition, what key pieces from your career would you have on display?AMac10We should do a hair exhibition and have hundreds of wigs from throughout our career. You’d have short ones, pink ones, black ones, brown ones, blond ones, short hair, long hair. Is there a wig I regret? Oh, babe. There are many wigs I regret. I regret having brown hair. I regret having frazzled, tangled hair. I regret having almost black hair, purple hair. I regret experimenting. I absolutely love my red hair and I moved away from it because I felt like it was bothering certain people. So, to try to fit in I’d just have brown like everyone else, or I’d put highlights in.Will we ever get to hear the Girls Aloud versions ofAlesha Dixon’s The Boy Does Nothing,Annie’s My Love Is BetterandKylie’s Giving You Up[all created by Girls Aloud’s production team Xenomania and demo’d by the group]?MikeS88I was in a shop and I remember hearing Kylie’s Giving You Up and freaking out for a split second, being like: what the hell, how has someone got this? And then realising, no, no, it’s Kylie’s version. But I feel like that song is Kylie’s song now. You make a song your own: The Boy Does Nothing is Alesha’s song. While a listener would love to hear a different artist doing it for their own entertainment, for the artist it becomes your baby.Why has there never been a follow-up to [2011’s solo debut album] Cinderella’s Eyes?splazshThere have been moments where I’ve started a project, but then just moved on quickly, creatively. I’m sure that the right time will come, and I’m totally open to it. But when I got on the circuit of writing for other artists, I wasn’t necessarily inspired. There was a theory of: write for other artists and then one song will pop up that you’ll just want to keep for yourself. But I never came across any producers that were willing to experiment because it would always be following a brief. That’s why I loved PC Music – there were no rules to it.How serious were you about working with Kate Bush on Cinderella’s Eyes?MrRaysWigworldIt was just a huge pipe dream. I would drop everything and fly to wherever she was in the world for us to collaborate and make my version of Running Up That Hill. I’d just be ultimately satisfied for life.What is your favourite song to sing in Hadestown?SophieehThere’s a song called How Long?, which is a duet between myself and Hades. It’s intense, but the melody is really beautiful. I also sing a song called Our Lady of the Underground. Do I ever accidentally sing Sound of the Underground? No, because this is American folk and New Orleans jazz, not frenetic drum’n’bass – but every now and then in the rehearsal room, I’ll add a little trill and they’ll be like, nope, that’s not what the melody is.Have you noticed a difference rehearsing in a theatre setting comparedwith your previous Girls Aloud rehearsals?SharonteenyIn the Girls Aloud setting, we have more tea breaks. The theatre setting is a little bit more professional. With Girls Aloud, you’re very much playing the bigger version of yourself. You’re engaging directly with the audience constantly and you’re feeding off their energy. Whereas with Hadestown, this is me fitting into a cog and I have to portray my part of the story. It’s like rubbing the belly and patting the head.It feels as though there is currently a welcome profusion of female solo artists. Who do you most rate and why?CatzPyjamasI’m loving watching whatJadeis doing. I wanted to do something different [with Cinderella’s Eyes] and I wanted to experiment. It’s really refreshing to watch her have that similar approach and navigate the line of: what can I get away with, and how can I experiment but equally still have it sound current?View image in fullscreenGirls Aloud in concert in Dublin on last year’s tour.Photograph: Tom Dymond/Rex/ShutterstockWhat does the future hold for Girls Aloud now that the reunion tour has finished?JosiahLumumbaWe all had a really amazing time together and it was so heartwarming to feel the support that we came back to. It really surprised us. And it surprised us how much we came together as women and where we’re at now. Back in the day, it would be like: “OK, we’ve just done a tour, now we’re gonna do this and we’re on a roll.” Everybody’s got different responsibilities now. But I think that it would be lovely to be back on stage again with the girls at some point.Nicola Roberts starts her run in Hadestown on 16 September at theLyric theatre, LondonExplore more on these topicsGirls AloudFilm & Music reader interviewPop and rockMusicalsWest EndinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Except when declining an invitation – then I always lie.Once, my fiance, Jared, and I were invited to a dinner we didn’t want to attend. We were worn out from traveling, and some of the other guests required a lot of energy to be around. I replied in the group text that we already had plans – but we were “so sorry to miss!” Jared, sitting next to me on the couch, gawped.“That’s a lie!” he said. Then, amazed and a little horrified: “You lied so fast.”Of course I lied! Wasn’t it more polite to make up a fake excuse than say you simply don’t feel like it?I started to wonder if that was true. Jared is always honest. Open and honest communication with those I love is important to me. Also, I got caught in my lies a couple of times, which was awkward and humiliating.I decided to try not lying for two weeks. A fortnight felt manageable – there were only so many people I could alienate in that time. I also turned to professionals to find out whether honesty is always the best policy.Why do people lie?People do lie for malicious reasons – “to get one over on people, and achieve all the ill-gotten gains that come from deceitfulness”, says Matt Lundquist, psychotherapist and clinical director and founder of Tribeca Therapy in New York.Conflict is healthy and normal. We asked experts how to approach it betterRead moreBut a 2022studypublished in the Canadian Journal of Behavioral Science found that some of the most common reasons for lying were “altruistic reasons, secretive reasons, and to avoid negative evaluation”. Simply put, we want other people to like us and we don’t want to make them feel bad.Sometimes, lying just feels easier. “Probably the most common reason people lie day to day is that it makes things simpler and more straightforward,” says Lundquist. The truth can be complicated and confusing, and a lie can be a convenient shortcut, he says.For instance, when I fibbed about dinner, I didn’t think everyone on the group text needed to know why we were declining – just that we weren’t going.“It’s quite common for people to tell a little white lie when they’re declining invitations,” says Elaine Swann, etiquette expert and author of Elaine Swann’s Book of Modern Etiquette. Swann says people do this to avoid offense and “soften the blow”.Exactly! I think. Isn’t it actually nice of me to lie? “Certainly, the sentiment that exists is admirable,” she goes on. But the lie itself is an issue. “It’s important for us to realize that we just should not lie, especially to our friends.” Oops.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’One’s proclivity to lie can also depend on “developmental” experiences, says Lundquist. When we were younger, how the adults around us were able to tolerate disappointment and frustration shaped how comfortable we became with telling the truth. If we learned that delivering inconvenient information feels unsafe, lying might seem easier.View image in fullscreen‘When I lie, I feel like a slug: spineless and slimy.’Composite: The Guardian/Getty ImagesWhat are the costs and benefits of lying?One reason I want to stop lying is that it feels bad. When I lie, I feel like a slug: spineless and slimy. Not only am I failing to act in accordance with my values, it seems kind of pathetic. I can’t be honest about why I’m skipping a coffee? Really?“If telling even small lies causes you anxiety and stress, then this will have all the negative effects on your body that stress does,” explains Dr Sharon Leal, a senior research fellow at the University of Portsmouth who studies the behavioral and physiological effects of deception. These might include increased heart rate, palpitations, dry mouth, altered respiration and lowered immune system efficiency, she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Say your friend invites you to a party, but you hate their partner. “In these circumstances, telling the truth could be far more stressful than lying and saying you have prior arrangements that night,” she says. These types of lies are known as “social lubricant” lies, she explains, because they help social interactions run more smoothly.Lies can have positive effects, Lundquist concedes – “which is not to say that I’m advising them or counseling them”, he adds – like making people feel less disappointed and sparing yourself an uncomfortable conversation. But there are costs, he says.“Lying can become a habit and a default way of operating in the world,” he says. That has consequences for relationships, he argues. Regular deception erodes others’ trust in us, as well as our trust in ourselves.Plus, in telling a lie, we miss the chance to connect with someone. “There’s a missed opportunity to build the kind of closeness that comes in being more direct,” he says. If you tell a friend you’re too burnt out to socialize, this can open the door for them to share how they’re doing.I think about the time Jared’s friend cancelled lunch plans because they were feeling exhausted and sad. “You can just be honest about that … ?” I thought in awe. They exchanged texts about it and agreed to check back in when they were feeling better. “I’m happy they felt like they could share that with me,” Jared said. I wondered what I was missing out on when I lied and told friends that I had food poisoning instead of admitting that I was feeling down.When you lie, you also miss the opportunity to see who can tolerate truthfulness. “It’s important for us not to try to own other people’s feelings and assume that they will be offended,” says Swann. When declining an invitation, she recommends “as much honesty as possible without being brutally honest”. You can still be polite: thank the person, then be truthful about why you can’t make it, Swann says. Maybe you’re tired, not feeling well, or just need a weekend to do absolutely nothing.If the person takes it personally, “that will give you insight into your friendship”, Swann says. “Think about the relationship, and whether there’s mutual respect.”In the first week of my experiment, a colleague asked if I wanted to join a fantasy football league. I like sports brackets, like March Madness, but I don’t enjoy fantasy leagues: too complicated, too involved. I thought up possible excuses (Mom says I can’t?), then remembered I have to tell the truth. It’s not really my thing, I said, “but thank you!”“That’s fair,” they said. I was not fired or ostracized. So far, telling the truth was easier than I expected.How do you learn to stop lying?When trying to break a habit, Lundquist says, you have to consider how the habit is serving you and notice when you do it. Then, set an amount of time to practice not doing it.Before my two-week experiment, I already knew that lying helps me pretend that I never make anyone feel bad and that I’m never in the wrong.Like the time my book club chose a book I had no desire to read. I could have said, “I’d rather stare at an empty wall for 10 hours than read this soppy book,” and made my beloved friends feel as if I don’t respect their taste. Instead, I waited until two days before and said something had come up. (It hadn’t.) Except – disaster – other people had actual reasons to reschedule. The new date was squarely within my two-week honesty window. Shoot.Jared said he didn’t feel like reading the book either, so he wouldn’t attend. Immediately, I conjured up excuses for his absence: I could say he was sick, or had work. But I had to be honest. Solemnly, I told Jared that, if asked why he wasn’t at book club, I would tell the truth. “OK, I don’t care,” he said, not taking his eyes off his video game.I would also have to be honest about myself. So I went and told everyone I had listened to 15% of the audiobook and decided that, although I loved them, I hated the characters and life was too short to finish it.“Damn,” one of my friends said. “I really liked it.”And that was it. It was fine.Throughout my experiment, I was reminded of the truism: nobody is thinking about you as much as you think they are. And probably no one cares about you attending something as much as you think they do.At the end of my two weeks, I proudly announced to Jared that I was done with lying, and now I was as honest as he was. He scrunched his nose. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think one of us should still be able to lie. It makes things easier.” I agreed – I’d had good experiences with telling the truth, but I could easily imagine a situation in which honesty might not be the smoothest approach. For instance, if one of my friends starts dating a DJ and invites me to one of their sets, I’ll probably have plans that night.Will I ever lie again? I can’t talk right now – I have food poisoning.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With estranged bandmates among the other stakeholders, legitimate bidders may be hard to findMorrissey puts his business interests in the Smiths up for sale ‘to any interested party’Thu 4 Sep 2025 09.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 09.42 EDTShareThere is a well-trodden line about assessing the trustworthiness of online bargains: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. It comes to mind when looking at the extremely unusual way in which Morrissey is apparently seeking to offload his business interests in the Smiths. This is not like the forensic and formal processes behind huge catalogue sales in recent years such asSting,Bob Dylan,Queen,David Bowie,Bruce Springsteen,Pink FloydorPaul Simon.A post on Morrissey Solo – the outlet for all official Morrissey communiques – says the singer has “no choice but to offer for sale all of his business interests in ‘the Smiths’ to any interested party/investor” and that he wants out. Maybe psychologically this is the closure he needs – the band will never reform, given bassist Andy Rourke’s death in 2023 and Morrissey’s clear personal and political differences with guitaristJohnny Marr– but, in straight business terms, this is shockingly cavalier.It all has the musty whiff of a yard sale. There is a Gmail address listed as the only channel of contact for prospective bidders. Except when you email it, you get a bounce back saying no such address exists.“Putting a rights sale on a free email account feels like the corporate equivalent of scrawling ‘guitar for sale’ on a lamp-post,” says Cliff Fluet, a partner at legal firm Lewis Silkin, a highly respected veteran of catalogue sales. “Serious investors will expect data rooms, warranties and proper disclosure. A Gmail pitch says none of that is coming, so heavyweight bidders will either steer clear or mark the price down heavily to cover the risk.”Most of Morrissey’s Craigslist-style post is vague, talking about “all” Smiths recording and publishing rights, merchandise rights, trademarks and so on being bundled up for sale. Yet he does not own any of these outright and eventurned down an offer from Marrto share control of band-related trademarks. Uncertainty reigns. Will he sign a deal with Marr ahead of this sale to clear obstacles for potential new owners? That is the great unanswerable question. Marr’s management declined to comment when asked by the Guardian.View image in fullscreenMorrissey and Marr pictured in happier times.Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty ImagesThere is an argument that bitter in-fighting, non-communication and Morrissey’s own controversial political pronouncements in recent years have seriously damaged the Smiths brand. Repairing and reviving it is perhaps never going to happen under current ownership, so something has to change.“On the face of it, Morrissey is simply cashing out of a partnership that appears to be long past ‘irretrievably broken down’,” suggests Fluet. “It feels less like a strategic play and more like a desire to walk away with whatever value he can still extract.”Alan Wallis is CEO of Dynamite Songs and previously ran the music transactions practice at Ernst & Young in the late 1990s and early 2000s, so has seen the changing dynamics of catalogue sales up close for more than a quarter of a century. He says selling a major stake in a commercially and culturally significant music catalogue in this idiosyncratic manner is utterly without precedent.‘Record companies have me on a dartboard’: the man making millions buying classic hitsRead moreHow such sales normally happen, he says, is that “you put together a pack with all the information that someone who is buying it would need to make a non-binding offer. Then you go into a diligence process with financial information for the last three to five years.” After that, the seller needs to put all related contracts in place. “This is to show that you’ve got title for whatever these assets are and that you own these assets,” he says.From there, the process is typically to solicit a small number of serious bidders. “Normally, you wouldn’t go out far and wide,” says Wallis. “You’d do it to a limited number [of potential bidders]. You pick who the likeliest are. What you want is a little bit of tension between the two or three [bidders] to try to maximise the price. I don’t think this is going to achieve that.”Wallis’s concern is that offering a sale in this way could be read by the market as a sign of desperation. Its unconventional nature and structure may scare off serious bidders such as record companies or major rights investors. This could mean more mercenary players step forward, ones who are equally mercenary in their bids. “When you look at it and you read how he just wants to get away from [the Smiths], bidders would low ball,” suggests Wallis.Quick sales can happen, but invariably they are dramatically below market value.View image in fullscreenRourke, Marr, Morrissey and Joyce pictured in 1987.Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex FeaturesThe Smiths were originally signed to Rough Trade in 1983 but their catalogue of recordings is now owned by Warner Music Group. Thecollapse of the Rough Trade distribution network in 1991saw the Rough Trade label sell off its entire catalogue to helppay off debtson the distribution side. A source with inside knowledge told the Guardian that Warner paid £1m for the Smiths’ recordings in this fire sale (equivalent to £2.3m today). “In retrospect,” they say, “it was far too cheap.” As such, any plans for the band’s recordings would need the full involvement of Warner. Buyers will be getting an important share, not total autonomy.Then there is Marr himself. As co-writer of all the Smiths’ songs, he controls 50% of their publishing. He is also currently thesole owner of their associated trademarks, which will directly impact anything related to merchandise. Anyone scooping up Morrissey’s stake will still have to find common ground with Marr and he will have the power to overrule any commercial plans if he feels they are inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the band’s legacy and earning potential.“You’d be buying into joint ownership with a co-writer who holds the trademark – on behalf of them both – and who has veto power over most commercial uses,” explains Fluet. “Without Marr’s nod, you don’t get control; you get a near-permanent negotiation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

As their creator or creative director, he technically would have owned the IP in them since Rough Trade was not as obsessed as the major labels with nailing everything down contractually. The sale of the catalogue to Warner, however, is likely to have contained a clause whereby ownership of artwork and promo videos would be rolled into the sale of the master recordings.One resolution, of course, would be that Marr and his team buy out Morrissey’s stake, meaning all the creator rights sit in a single pot and there are no complications or fraught negotiations needed to clear uses such as synchronisation deals. Yet given Morrissey’s terse statement (“I am burnt out by any and all connections to Marr, Rourke, Joyce”), it may be the case that he would peevishly refuse to sell to his former creative and business partner.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Meat Is Murder, one of Morrissey’s designs for the Smiths’ record covers.Photograph: Album artworkThere is, argues Fluet, too much financial uncertainty here for any potential purchaser. “The only dependable cash for a buyer lies in Morrissey’s receipts of publishing and master recording royalties – the receivables that come in every quarter,” he says. “But even that income depends on the seller standing behind his paperwork and staying willing to cooperate on audits and future clearances. Right now, buyers can’t be sure of either.”With politics and relationships being as curdled as they are, and the impact this has had on the band’s legacy management in both creative and commercial terms, the asking price could be significantly lower than one might expect for such an important catalogue.“In a perfect world – clean chain of title, no arguments, full cooperation – a Smiths catalogue could fetch tens of millions,” estimates Fluet. “This is not that world. Overlapping claims, years of legal sparring and the hint of fresh litigation mean any bidder will apply a chunky discount.”This is, even if everything is as it claims to be, undoubtedly the most unusual tactic to sell a significant catalogue and bundle of rights.Wallis, wincing at the fact bids have to be submitted via a Gmail address (functioning or otherwise), says Morrissey really needs hardened professionals around him to strike an equitable sale price. “Someone’s going to have to help him do this deal,” he says. “I don’t know who’s going to be looking at the offers that come in.”This, frankly, is just not how music rights sales are done. “It might be a pathetic attempt at trying to get attention,” sniffs one highly knowledgable music industry source.Another well-placed industry name is partly sanguine and partly drily cynical: “It will be interesting to see if he actually means it.”Explore more on these topicsMorrisseyThe SmithsJohnny MarrIndieanalysisShareReuse this content"

This time it is the “performative male”, basically the idea that posturing straight men only read books to get laid, outlined in recent trend pieces includingthe New York Times,Vox,Teen Vogue,Hypebeast,GQandmillionsof TikToks.According to the Times, this man “curates his aesthetic in a way that he thinks might render him more likable to progressive women. He is, in short, the antithesis of the toxic man.” Apparently these heterosexual men who read Joan Didion, carry tote bags and listen to Clairo are not in fact human beings who enjoy things but performative jerk-offs who don’t really care about any of that girly stuff and are just trying to impress their feminine opposites. As Vox put it: “think Jacob Elordi when he was photographed withthree different bookson his person, or Paul Mescalpublicly admiring Mitski”. Reading! Enjoying music by women! Perish the thought.Each piece differed slightly in what it defined as the key characteristics of the performative male, but they all shared one detail: he drinks matcha lattes.The stereotype has expanded beyond the white liberal: matcha hails a diverse new generation of milky boyThis was unsurprising. For three decades the latte has been the favored blog-whistle of the trend piece writer. It signals liberalism, femininity, gayness, pretension, gentrification – ideally all of the above – so reflexively that its origins as an insult are rarely revisited.It began in earnest in 1997, when journalist David Brookswritingin the Weekly Standard coined the term “latte liberal”. He was trying, disparagingly, to give name to the crunchy consumerist leftism of the time, in which organic vegetables and world music had become part of the social justice hamper: “You know you’re in a Latte Town when you can hop right off a bike path, browse in a used bookstore with shelves and shelves of tomes on Marxism the owner can no longer get rid of, and then drink coffee at a place with a punnish name that must have the word ‘Grounds’ in it, before sauntering through an African drum store or a feminist lingerie shop.”Brooks wanted to hint that leftism is a luxury only the bourgeois can afford – an idea encapsulated by the earlier formation of champagne socialist. But the latte proved a stickier, more evocative symbol, painting liberals as soft and effete.In 2004, lattes really entered politics, when a Republican Pac ran an ad accusing presidential candidate Howard Dean of being a “latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times-reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving left-wing freak show”.Lattes also became a byword for gentrification. In 2000, when the Brooklyn neighborhood Williamsburg was, the Times bemoaned at the time, reaching “the point of hipster saturation”, the final straw was “a local Italian specialty store and a working-class institution … advertising the arrival of the Chai latte”. In New York Magazine’s 2005 feature L-ification, the publication mapped out how gentrification was spreading further east into Brooklyn along the route of the L train with little latte icons, a milky glyph of whiteness by that point understood by everyone.Noticeably, the latte form remains permanent, even as the type of latte shifts. Newt Gingrich accused New York mayor Bill De Blasio of “small soy latte liberalism” in 2014 – emphasising that the only thing more girlish than drinking a big dairy milky coffee was drinking a small vegan milky coffee. On Drake’s 2010 song Thank Me Now, when he’s asking the woman he’s left behind if she still thinks of him, he croons: “But do I ever come up in discussion / Over double-pump lattes and low-fat muffins?”Labubus, The Bell Jar and tampons: the ‘performative male’ attracts attentionRead moreNow the performative male has once again given rise to the idea that there is something inherently disingenuous about a milky beverage. Interestingly as the latte has changed colour, from white to green, the stereotype has expanded beyond the white liberal: matcha hails a diverse new generation of milky boys.The idea of the performative male started out mostly as a joke on TikTok, where knowing posters would show a man reading at the gym, for example, and joke that he was pretending. Contests in which men meet in parks to compete to be the most performative have been funny, postmodern, heterosexual versions of drag.But with each passing write-up, the knowing humorous element has been rinsed away, until Vox earnestly announced in its piece that the “MeToo movement showed us that even supposed ‘nice guy’ could be capable ofalleged manipulationandabuse– that in fact, they could use their enlightenment as a kind of shield”. If you see a man with a matcha latte, you need to run!None of the pieces particularly wanted to reckon with the fact that, as Judith Butler put it, “gender identity is a performative accomplishment”to begin with, or that Arthur Schopenhauer was complaining in the mid-19th century that a performative reader “usually confuses the purchase of books with the acquisition of their contents”. Do we read in order to get laid? Only since forever.View image in fullscreen‘According to the performative male trend pieces, drinking a matcha latte indicates to women that you are soft, feminist-leaning and worldly.’Photograph: Iuliia Bondar/Getty ImagesIronically much of this ribbing comes from the same people who decry a crisis of masculinity, and worry for future generations of boys who feel like they lack purpose and companionship. Yet in the world of the performative male, even having female friends and drinking milky coffee is a divergence from true masculinity.Why is the latte such an enduring emblem for this distrust – a way to call men you do not like effeminate?Partly it is the allegory of milk, the pursed mouth of a graphic designer on a coffee cup as a surrogate for the Madonna del Latte, the thousands of medieval depictions of Jesus nursing at Mary’s breast. Grown men drinking milk has always been laden in symbolism, the blend of nurture and eroticism evocative of a sexual infantalization. It is why so many films from A Clockwork Orange to Babygirl centre milk as a poison beyond a place of regular intoxication. When Kelis sings that her milkshake brings her boys to the yard, the lyric is so heavy in implication that the exact innuendo she is reaching for is irrelevant.Even the ancient Greeks used to have their own version of the latte joke, belittling the Persians who drank milk: Aristotle said Empedocles described it as “whitish pus”.But the milk in the context of the latte also turns coffee, a drink which was sold as fuel, bitter black stuff for TV detectives and the working man, into a sweet little treat. A latte fundamentally dilutes the taste of coffee and so it is easy to present those who drink it as watering down their wine. Even though the iconography of the latte liberal is now so strong it has stretched to drinks that do not contain any coffee to begin with. According to the performative male trend pieces, drinking a matcha latte indicates to women that you are soft, feminist-leaning and worldly (after all, it’s from Japan).Why fear the tote bag-wielding, matcha-drinking ‘performative male’? At least he makes an effort | Rachel ConnollyRead moreEven though the latte is supposed to be this bastion of girlishness, women are not exempt from being chastised for drinking them, although the latte trope for them is more often a reflection of being superficial than performatively feminine. The logic of this makes little sense: latte liberal men are supposedly too European to be masculine, yet iced latte girlies are gormless Americans sucking on the straw of consumerism. No matter, the two sit side by side, one clutching a hot cup of simp soup, the other a pumpkin-spiced lobotomy. They are a pair one can project all their prejudices towards, without having to interrogate any of it too much.The irony is that hipsters and gentrifiers in coastal towns are rarely drinking lattes these days. They are much more likely to be sipping on a single origin V60 that’s been carefully weighed out on a digital scale. Indeed the stereotype could easily be flipped around – that it’s red states where complicated online Starbucks orders and Stanley cups filled with 32oz of latte abound. In the best survey of the coffee Americans actually drink and how it aligns with their politics byDiana C Mutz and Jahnavi S Rao, the differences were negligible. Although it is true that liberals do prefer lattes over conservatives (16% v 9%), the same research found liberals also prefer the more masculine-coded espressos over conservatives by a much bigger margin, and the vast majority of Americans prefer brewed coffee.But the milky latte stereotype persists because it is creamy and white (or green) and vaguely Italian.

Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianKirsten Smith was 19 when she first tried heroin; within a few years she was in prison. She says she willingly made bad choices and wants society to stop treating addiction as a diseaseByXi ChenThu 4 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareKirsten Smith was 16 when a boy from school injected her with morphine, 18 when she and a date Googled how to crush up and inject themselves with oxycodone, and 19 when she first shot up heroin. Living in Knoxville, Tennessee and modelling herself on Pulp Fiction’s freewheeling Mia Wallace, Smith spent her days experimenting with alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD and benzodiazepines. She read Kurt Vonnegut and the Beats, and wrote poems on an actual typewriter while listening to the Velvet Underground. For Smith, as for thousands of Americans who came of age in the early 2000s, drug use was a seemingly harmless lifestyle choice.That is, until she ran out of money. After Smith dropped out of high school and started regularly using heroin, she was caught stealing credit cards and chequebooks from a boyfriend’s wealthy parents, from a family friend at church and from her grandmother. On probation for two years, and forced by her parents into a month-long stay at an addiction treatment facility, Smith felt, for the first time, ashamed.Returning to school was supposed to be Smith’s lifeline. She went to community college and got a job as a waiter at Charlie’s, a local restaurant chain. Then, in the summer of 2004, she met Brad Renfro, who had starred as a child actor in Hollywood films such as The Client and Sleepers. He introduced her to smoking crack cocaine and the best heroin she had ever known. After three months together, Smith began to wonder whether she would be a junkie for the rest of her life.One day, standing in the living room of Renfro’s downtown boarding house, Smith watched him struggle to find a vein. Blood ran down his arm as he plugged in the dregs of his cocaine supply, a residue shot that Smith called a “low sad point in an addict’s life”. For her, Renfro had crossed a line into the shadowlands of compulsion. It was over between them. (Smith didn’t hear of Renfro again until he died of an overdose in 2008.)While waiting on tables at Charlie’s, Smith met a young man named Michael, who had grown up in the same suburb as her. Michael was quiet and kept mostly to himself. His buzz cut and angular features contrasted with his sweet smile and blue eyes. The two clicked when Smith revealed that she had sent a fan letter to the author of Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk, and had received a written response. Michael didn’t believe her until Smith brought the letter to work, dusty and charred by a house fire Smith had started when she was 15.In 2005, Smith and Michael rented a one-bedroom apartment in an old building downtown. They also did drugs together, shoplifting to subsidise their lifestyle, which Smith described as a “romanticised junkiedom”. Through their network of white suburban addicts, Michael and Smith became hooked on expensive black tar heroin shipped in by a drug cartel that they referred to as “the Mexicans”. Despite their addictions, Smith and Michael maintained a stable, domestic existence. They wrote stories, paid their bills and owned two cats.Later that year, Smith and Michael were both admitted to the University of Tennessee. This was Smith’s cue to get sober, but treatments for substance-use disorders and the torturous symptoms of withdrawal were limited. Relatively few medications were approved, and although behavioural and community-based treatments existed, when Smith, 23, tried to return to rehab, her stepfather’s insurance company rebuffed her.The couple attended meetings at Narcotics Anonymous (NA), a 12-step programme, where they were told that recovery was only possible with total abstinence and strict adherence to a set of rules. To them, it seemed as if they were being made to feel helpless in the grip of their addictions, which were thought of as a lifelong disease. The concept, pervasive in treatment, that addiction is a disease, emphasises the power of compulsions to overwhelm the individual. The problem, Smith told me, was that no one asked or cared about what her desires were. “When I was young and wanted to be a heroin addict, my behaviours were in line with my desires. Was that addiction?”After she was accepted to university, Smith continued to use heroin. This was less of a personal failure, in her view, and more of a series of decisions she made to try to pursue both drugs and education at the same time. As long as Smith had access to drugs and wanted to use, she was not going to choose abstinence. On one occasion, Smith and Michael flung their unused needles and syringes down a garbage chute, desperate to begin their fresh start. Within hours, they dived into a skip to get them back.After she was caught nodding out in front of customers, Smith was fired from her job, and later, so was Michael. Broke and withdrawing, they lay in bed until sunrise, racking their brains for fast money schemes to pay for heroin. Smith remembered hearing about an unsolved bank robbery near her parents’ home. The bank was a small redbrick building in an ideal location, abutting the entrance of the expressway, and it would be open at 8am.While Michael slept, Smith collected her supplies: an Airsoft gun her stepfather had bought her for Christmas, the bright orange tip painted black; supermarket bags, a scarf to wrap around her head, and a pair of Jackie O sunglasses.When she walked up to the front desk of the SunTrust bank and pointed her toy gun at the teller, Smith said: “You have 60 seconds to put money in these bags.” When the teller returned the plastic bags, Smith apologised and said: “Thank you.”As her Volkswagen sped down Northshore Drive, a pack of dye in one of the bags detonated, staining the bills red and filling the car with scarlet smoke. On the expressway, Smith got out, tore the duct tape off her licence plate, and barrelled home. Stumbling into her apartment, Smith woke Michael up. After soaking the bills in their bathtub with water and bleach, they salvaged about $11,000, enough for two months of rent, food, and heroin.The second robbery was more carefully planned. This time, Smith waited in the car while Michael went inside. But someone saw him leave the bank, and before they could get away, Smith and Michael were arrested.View image in fullscreenKirsten Smith during her younger years.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianAwaiting trial under house arrest at the home of her mum and stepfather, Smith handwrote letters to Michael, who was also under house arrest just a couple of blocks away. She told him about the cocktail of medications she was given, which included Xanax and Focalin, a stimulant used to treat ADHD that enabled her to write poetry, a “countdown to prison” journal and a 450-page novel, all in a week.Smith also drank heavily during this time. One night, with an ankle monitor on, she drove off drunk in her stepfather’s new car. Within two miles, she crashed into a tree and ended up in an emergency room downtown. With blood all over her face and wires holding her teeth together, Smith looked down and saw that she still had her bag, containing her syringe. She remembers that the first thing she thought was: “I still have time to buy heroin.”In December 2007, at Smith’s sentencing hearing, her stepfather testified that he hoped she would get the treatment she needed to overcome her problems. “She is a smart person who has made some mistakes,” he said. “Made them willingly.”Was Smith a patient simply in need of the right medications or a criminal who deserved punishment for actively choosing to harm others – or both? Before the hearing, in a character letter sent to the judge, Thomas Varlan, Smith chose to take responsibility for her crimes. “I wasn’t abused or molested as a child,” she wrote. “I didn’t grow up on the ‘wrong’ side of town. I wasn’t raised by wolves but by a mother and stepfather who love me and gave me countless opportunities to succeed.”Smith was steadfast in her belief that her actions were volitional from the start. Her drug use and crimes were not the products of an immoral character or a faulty brain incapable of change, but rather of an environment where heroin was accessible and desirable. This outlook determined her experiences in prison and beyond, ultimately leading her to dedicate her life to challenging predominant medical models of addiction with her research. Today, she is an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.In light of the non-violent nature of their crimes and their youth, Judge Varlan sentenced Smith to 47 months in custody and Michael to 46 months, the minimum duration for their charges. Smith’s first destination, Blount county jail, was a concrete bunker or, as she put it, a “hell”. She went into drug withdrawal without a doctor to manage her symptoms. Without medical care, she had to remove the wires in her mouth with a fork.Locked down 23 hours a day for two weeks with a wide-eyed stranger who rocked back and forth while withdrawing from cocaine, Smith, for the first time in her adult life, had no access to drugs or the outside world. The only reading material she had in the tiny room was a pocket-sized copy of the Gospels of the New Testament that community volunteers placed through a slot in the jail cell door. Smith read the words repeatedly to fall asleep; when she woke up, she started reading them again. After nine months, she was shipped to federal prison in Florida.In Smith’s account of her story, no amount of psychiatric diagnoses or personal reflection helped her quit heroin. The only things that did were incarceration and forced abstinence, followed by her return to education. In prison, it occurred to Smith that there were only two things people could not take away from her: “my tattoos and my education”. After she was released, at the age of 27, she got a job serving sandwiches at a deli that hired former convicts – including Michael, although their romantic relationship was over. Smith stayed sober and was eventually accepted by the University of Kentucky, which – unlike some other institutions – did not require students to disclose past criminal charges. She excelled, and after four years of college went on to graduate school with the hope of becoming an addiction therapist.Doing shifts at a rehab facility in 2015 while completing her master’s, Smith had a formative encounter with a man in his 20s who was detoxing from opioids. The patient mentioned to her that he had been drinking “a tea from Vietnam” called kratom. He said it soothed his anxiety and helped with his cravings for opioids. Although kratom is described by organisations such as the CDC as a stimulant, the patient said it did not make him feel high. However, the rehab facility enforced an abstinence-only approach to treating addiction, and Smith was required to report the young man. After he was kicked out of rehab, he stayed in contact with her, and told her about his commitment to achieving abstinence through the 12 steps. Two weeks later, he tried heroin and died from an overdose.View image in fullscreenActor Brad Renfro is handcuffed by LAPD officers after being arrested in  2005.Photograph: Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesIn an essay titled Disease and Decision, published in 2022 in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, Smith wrote about how, disillusioned by medical systems with no individualised or evidence-based care, she decided to change careers and turn her ambitions towards research. Often, Smith argued, people with substance-use disorders are actively discouraged from vocalising what they want from the recovery process. “If they try, they are told that they are selfish; that their character defects and thinking were what got them into trouble; and that thinking for themselves is dangerous.”For Smith, free will is a spectrum, and yet many volitional behaviours get jumbled together under the label “addiction”, as if people with substance-use disorders have permanently lost control over their actions. She believes that although her desires, intentions and choices were constrained by factors that developed from continued drug taking – such as a lack of access to medical care, running out of money, being locked out of the university system – she maintains her behaviour was always the result of conscious decisions. For the same reason, she emphasises that lifelong cravings and relapses are not inevitable. Like everyone else, people who use drugs are “complex systems that can change”, and she believes that they should be held responsible for enacting that change.Smith is thin and pale, with green eyes and dark curly hair. Her arms are covered in tattoos. On her right forearm, sealing the spot where she used to inject most frequently, are the words “Room 101”, the location in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four where Winston Smith betrays his lover to escape his greatest fear. When she was incarcerated, relapsing became Smith’s greatest fear. “That’s the betrayal,” she told me. “I would have broken my mother’s heart, and broken the people who invested love and hope in me.”The idea that addiction is a bodily disease was articulated in 1884 by the Scottish physician Norman Kerr. In his inaugural address to the Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety, he said that addiction to alcohol is “for the most part the issue of certain physical conditions”. He continued: “Whatever else it may be, in a host of cases it is a true disease, as unmistakably a disease as is gout, or epilepsy, or insanity.”Yet throughout most of the 20th century, a different model of addiction predominated in popular culture. The “moral model” sees addiction not as a disease of the body but of the will. Partly as a result, numerous countries adopted a penal approach to drug use that, particularly in the US, led to vast numbers of people being imprisoned for substance abuse.A turning point came in 1997, when the then-director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida), psychologist Alan Leshner, published an article in the respected journal Science, in which he argued that addiction should be treated not as a moral failing but primarily as a chronic, relapsing disease of the brain. Addiction, according to Leshner, starts with voluntary consumption of drugs but over time the addictive qualities of the drug hijack the individual’s decision-making with uncontrollable cravings and compulsions.Dr Norman Kerr.Photograph: Done & BallWhen I spoke to Leshner earlier this year, he explained how he sought to change addiction from a criminal issue into a public health problem that could be treated with medication instead of incarceration. He had been inspired by how advances in neuroscience had shifted cultural assumptions about people with schizophrenia, who had come to be viewed in a far more humane manner: as people with neurological diseases who deserved medical care. “It became clear to me,” Leshner said, “that a core difference between addicted and non-addicted people was the same as the core difference between individuals with and without schizophrenia – which is that they have changes in their brains.”Leshner stands by his 1997 article, in which he recognised the importance of environmental and socioeconomic factors on persistent drug use but argued that over-emphasising social and spiritual solutions to addiction only worsened “the tremendous stigma attached to being a drug user or, worse, an addict”. (By overturning the moralistic attitude towards drug use, Leshner also sought to justify putting medications such as buprenorphine – a weak opioid restricted because of its potential for abuse – into doctors’ offices and prisons.)Leshner’s approach, known as the brain disease model of addiction or BDMA, became the model for teaching addiction in medical schools in the US and beyond, as well as shaping drug education campaigns in schools. However, this approach has itself come under attack. Critics of BDMA, such as Smith, believe that downplaying the role of free will in addiction can dampen the belief that full recovery is possible. Smith does not deny that brains change from drug use – the impact of addictive substances on the brain’s reward pathways is well established – but claims that a perception of people with substance-use disorders as “recovering” but never “recovered” does little to improve the general understanding of addiction and can destroy any shred of hope that they may hold. Smith argues that terms such as “chronic” and even “disease” can push people with substance-use disorders and the people around them to see relapse as “an inevitable outcome”.Similarly, Eric Strain, an addiction psychiatrist who has helped mentor Smith at Johns Hopkins University, argues that the BDMA oversimplifies our understanding of addiction. The BDMA, according to Strain, says doctors know what people with substance-use disorders need. “It implies: ‘Just take Suboxone, everything will get better’,” Strain explained to me, referring to a commonly prescribed medication. But things are not always so simple. “Look at the treatment dropout rates,” he said. “They’re abysmally high.”The label of “disease” has trailed Smith for most of her adult life. After she obtained her PhD, which studied the treatment of substance-use disorders in incarcerated women, Smith went on to complete a four-year research fellowship at Nida, the centre of American addiction research. But her postdoctoral position came with conditions: she was forbidden from handling any of the money used to pay research participants or the drugs being tested in the labs. The issue of trust, and the assumptions people made about her capacity to function and resist relapsing, would not go away.Smith belongs to a new generation of addiction scientists who are using their personal experiences to inform their research. Their focus is on helping people with substance-use disorders to identify the environmental factors that lead them to use drugs, and encouraging them to take action to change those factors.In Smith’s own research at Johns Hopkins, which includes clinical trials and lab-based pharmacological studies, she interviews people with substance-use disorders about their experience of self-medication with unregulated substances like kratom. Instead of asking how the medical system can best force people into sobriety, Smith’s research asks how people with substance-use disorders have learned to manage their addictions themselves.Justin Strickland, a behavioural pharmacologist who worked with Smith on models of addiction that emphasise environmental triggers, told me that there is actually more agreement than disagreement between supporters and detractors of the BDMA. “We all know that addiction is affected by neurobiology, genetics and childhood trauma,” he said. “The differences are in what is emphasised.” As the psychiatrist Carl Erik Fisher, who had an alcohol-use disorder during his medical training, wrote in his recent book about addiction, The Urge: “It is not that addiction is or is not a brain disease, or a social malady, or a universal response to suffering – it’s all of these things and none of them at the same time, because each level has something to add but cannot possibly tell the whole story.”In the past five years, organisations such as Nida and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have increasingly supported research into psychosocial approaches to addiction, harm reduction and methadone clinics, as well as community-based services that emphasise continuity of care. Meanwhile, some addiction scientists with histories of substance-use disorders think that the BDMA debate is still worth having. Noel Vest, a friend of Smith’s who is now an academic, began to use methamphetamines at the age of 21 and became addicted to alcohol. By 25, he had lost his business, his car and his house. After seven years in prison for multiple offences including identity theft, Vest became a drug and alcohol counsellor, which he abandoned when he realised his work was merely an extension of the criminal justice system he had just left. Treatment failure and missed appointments were an inherent part of recovery, and he refused to punish people for what he saw as the natural course of addiction. While on parole, Vest attended a local university and went on to complete a PhD in experimental psychology.View image in fullscreenJudge Thomas Varlan and his wife, Danni Varlan, inKnoxville, 2017.Photograph: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel via ImagnFor Vest, the problem is not the BDMA itself but how early the concept of disease and the necessity of treatment is forced on to people with substance-use disorders. “If you tell someone early on in addiction – someone who can’t even tie their shoes because they can’t put a thought together – that they have this lifelong condition that will never get better, that’s a huge leap most are not ready for.”In many of my conversations with scientists both for and against the BDMA, one idea kept coming up: indeterminism. In an indeterministic model of addiction, any outcome, whether that be relapse or recovery, is neither predestined, nor fully within our control. The structure of the brain and one’s environment, as well as the influence of one’s past, are dynamic processes that we can study and attempt to shape, either through policy, treatments or personal choices. Hope and courage can coexist with chaos and chance.In our conversations, Smith always maintained that her drug taking was a choice, and that she was saved from hitting rock bottom by her upbringing, which she frequently described as perfect. “I wasn’t abused,” she told me. “I practised violin. I had a lot of protective factors. A lot of people in prison do not have those things.”Still, Smith’s childhood was not always straightforward. She describes her mother as a “good stay-at-home mother”, but she was also eccentric and volatile. When she divorced Smith’s father after 12 years of marriage, she plunged into a depression that she never fully rose out of. (“I had two people, whom I trusted and loved, telling me that the other person was evil,” said Smith, who was six when their drawn-out custody battle began.) While Smith was under house arrest, her mother attempted suicide for the first time. Returning home from prison years later, Smith found that her mother’s place was now packed with clutter. Her mother slept in the middle of the day, heavily medicated and not able to leave the house. In 2024, her mother died from complications with her medication regimen after a long struggle with mental illness. Months later, Smith’s stepfather also died.It was in the period after her mother and stepfather’s deaths that Smith was hired as an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins. Last year, the district court in Knoxville invited Smith to speak at a graduation ceremony for a programme called Full Circle that allowed people in prison with substance-use disorders to leave federal probation early after a year of working with a mentor.At the ceremony, Smith met the judge who had sentenced her all those years ago. The memory of that day, probably the bleakest of her existence, was a blur. “I remember looking up at this thing that was clearly a judge,” she recalled. “But I was crying so hard when I addressed him that I only remember sobbing.”Alcoholism and me: ‘I was an addicted doctor, the worst kind of patient’Read moreIt was difficult to look him in the eyes. Judge Varlan was a head taller than Smith, with a wiry frame and a clean-shaven face. She was surprised how quiet he was. His cadence was slow, his demeanour laconic, but his smile was warm and fatherly. To the judge’s wife, Smith expressed how nervous she was to meet them. Mrs Varlan smiled with tears in her eyes, and reassured Smith that the judge had been looking forward to her visit.In her speech, Smith told the graduates: “Most of us in this room are likely hard-headed and stubborn. Turning that stubbornness in the right direction can be a powerful thing.”Shoulder to shoulder with Judge Varlan, Smith watched a dozen or so ex-inmates walk across the stage, many starting over at an older age than she had. It sank in how rare “full circle” moments were for people like her. She had willed it into existence by remaining, as the judge and his wife, and Smith’s mother and stepfather had been, stubborn about her ability to change.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhereExplore more on these topicsThe long readDrugs (Society)Drugs (Science)featuresShareReuse this content"

Spray-painted on the wall outside Angela Rayner’s new flat in Hove, East Sussex, in purple, red and yellow, thegraffiti variously read“Tax evader Rayner” and “Bitch”.Politics comes scarily close to home these days, and that in turn makes politicians much more wary than they used to be of revealing anything about their home lives. Keir Starmer’s old house wassubjected to an alleged arson attack, the man whoultimately murderedthe Tory MP David Amess had previously staked outMichael Gove’s family home, and three years ago a man was jailed for telling Rayner that he knew where she lived so she had better “watch your back and your kids”. That’s not an excuse for how the deputy prime minister may have reacted when journalists started sniffing around her new post-divorce life by the sea, leading topictures of the Hove flatand her children’s family home in Ashton-under-Lyne appearing in the papers, and ultimately to her having to lift a court order protecting the privacy of her disabled son in order to explain exactly how she ended up apparently underpaying £40,000 in stamp duty on the new flat.Politicians must be accountable,as Rayner herself acknowledged, which remains true even if accountability means getting photographed drinking wine on the beach in your Dryrobe by an amused Daily Mail reader, journalists figuring out that you now live there, followed by the excruciating public unravelling of custody arrangements and post-divorce provision for a child with profound special needs. But a little accountability is long overdue, too, for all those who have remorselessly ratcheted up the temperature in British politics to the point of someone scrawling “Bitch” on the deputy prime minister’s home.All that said, a Labour housing secretary who has famously advocated for higher taxes getting her own taxes wrong – even if it was by mistake, as she claims, after faithfully following legal advice that has since been contradicted by a specialist tax lawyer – weeks before a likely tax-raising budget looks objectively terrible, and more so given it’s only months since the junior housing ministerRushanara Ali quitafter she allegedly evicted tenants from her rental property and then hiked the rent. If a forthcoming investigation by the ministerial ethics watchdog finds Rayner deliberately avoided any form of tax – for some are already questioning theinheritance tax implicationsof the family trust created to look after a compensation payout for her disabled son, to which she sold her stake in the family home before using the proceeds to buy in Hove – then she will simply have to go.But if the verdict is anything less cut and dried than vindication or damnation, then her future will depend in large part on how Downing Street thinks the nation feels not just about taxes or integrity in public life, or difficult personal lives, but about Rayner herself. And that’s not a simple question.Her famouslytough and scrappy startin life means she evokes both outrageous snobbery in some quarters and admiration for what she’s overcome in others. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, strikinglyrefused to call for her resignation, saying his and his wife’s biggest worry was providing for their own disabled son’s care after they have gone, and there will undoubtedly be much sympathy among parents caught in equally sad and complex situations. But some parents will get no further than the words “family trust” before bitterly concluding that her life is nothing like theirs. Some will see a witch-hunt, others a comeuppance. Rayner herself looked distraughtin parliament on Wednesday, sitting pale and mute as the prime minister some had expected her one day to usurprose to her defence.Until very recently, Rayner was viewed as the rising power in the cabinet, with colleagues noting that when she asks for something, she usually gets it. Popular with members, powerfully networked in the union movement and boasting her own elected mandate as deputy leader, it was long assumed that if Starmer fell under a bus, the race would be between her,Wes Streeting, and perhapsAndy Burnham. But now that balance of power in that quartet is shifting – though the other three all came out swinging on her behalf this week.Last year’s confected nonsense of a row over her supposedly failing to pay capital gains tax on the sale of her old council house years ago ended in her vindication, with HMRC concluding that shedidn’t actually owe them a penny. But it should have put her on her guard when buying her new flat. Sure enough, journalists who started sniffing around in Hove zeroed in very quickly on whether she had paid enough stamp duty, given that second homes attract higher rates. Why had she declared the old family house in Greater Manchester – which she no longer owns but where she still spends time with the children under a custody agreement designed to minimise upheaval – and not Hove as her main residence for council tax, but vice versa for stamp duty? What about the government flat in Admiralty Arch that she is also entitled to use? That she couldn’t swiftly produce a clear explanation – even though the process was complicated by the court order protecting her son – may leave some erstwhile backers wondering if she is really ready for the scrutiny that comes with the very highest office.Her survival now hinges on proving she took all possible steps to get the tax right at the time. As someone currently in the throes of a considerably more bog-standard house move, all I’ll say is that there’s a reason people say it’s almost as stressful as bereavement, and I’m not simultaneously trying to run a country. But assuming the story she has told holds water, Rayner could still be more asset than liability to aLabourparty that is painfully short of charisma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How are you coping with life, now that we are a global pariah alongside Pyongyang? How do you feel about modern Britain having to vie with North Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan for the wooden spoon on every international index of oppression?For that is the country Wednesday’s Daily Mail front page insists we have now become. It is tempting to laugh off a headline that asks “When did Britain become North Korea?” as just another here-today-gone-tomorrow piece of journalistic hyperbole. That’s even more the case when you read the cobbled-up pandemonium of provocations that form the contents of the headline-writer’s charge that Britain is being strong-armed into “Starmer’s socialist utopia” – nervy bond markets, the possibility of compulsory ID cards, the arrest of the Father Ted writer for his tweets and, of course,Angela Rayner.But there is something more at work here. The plain fact is that this list simply does not compare with North Korea’s place near the top of the global slavery index or at the foot of the international index of economic freedom. Some actions of the British state are undoubtedly annoying and wrong – even sometimes iniquitous. But there is still a gulf between the charge sheet and whatAmnesty International callsthe North Korean state’s untrammelled ability to “exercise total control over all aspects of life”.These things should hardly need saying, yet the increasing reality is that they now must be said. Parts of Britain’s political debate, if you can use that word any longer, are now routinely infused with a hysterical dystopianism, of which the Mail front page or the casual use this week by a Telegraph columnist of the phrase “Starmer’s Stasi” are classic examples. Both the old and the new media facilitate this, provoking governments –Labourtoday but previously also the Conservatives – into poorly thought-out legislative responses to manageable problems.View image in fullscreenThe net result, however, is that overstatement and exaggeration dominate our debates, squeezing out much-needed truth, proportion, fairness, reason and judgment in politics and government. Even now, a strong dose of all five of these qualities would surely have made a better job of clarifying – and in some cases, preventing – the four different genuine problems on which the Mail based its silly North Korea comparison.First, it is true the UK bond marketmoved up againthis week. The UK economy is stuck. But the main cause of nerves in the bond markets is global – caused by Donald Trump’s assaults on the Federal Reserve’s independence. That is washing over into many European markets, not just Britain. The idea that the UK market is uniquely spooked is false.Second, it is also true that ID cards are again on the UK government’s agenda. In other circumstances, the Tory press might be in favour, because digital IDs might bar unregistered migrants from working in the informal economy. But even a convert to ID cards, like me, who prefers the state rather than Elon Musk to control the digital world, needs to grasp that the system may not shrink the shadow economy very effectively. When Britain used wartime ID cards to enforce rationing, the black market still thrived.The Heathrow arrest of the Father Ted creator Graham Linehan looks, on the evidence, a very questionable use of police time. As theMet commissioner says, the law should be redrafted to be more sensitive to legitimate disagreements. All the same, one of Linehan’s tweets did suggest an act of violence. Social media, like the internet, has to be policed so that incitement is prevented and deterred, and I would rather the police did this than the untrustworthy tech giants.Unlike the Tory press, I have no problem with Angela Rayner’s ambition or dress sense. I also know a popular politician when I see one, and that popularity probably explains why Rayner is such a media target. Yet she herself now admits shepaid less tax on a propertythan she should have. Few of us know the full facts, so we must wait for the adviser on ministerial interests to report.In short, none of the four problems covers Britain in clouds of glory. None is the envy of the world. Yet none of them, either singly or in combination, justifies the level of panic and hyperbole that you read daily in the rightwing media. We all know that Britain is working badly. But what can explain something as egregiously unfair as the North Korea comparison?The answer may lie in the right’s abject craving for a British Trump in the shape ofNigel Farage. Farage appeared in Washington on Wednesday in front of the House judiciary committee. Misbilled as the Rt Hon Nigel Farage (I trust he corrected the US committee that he is neither right nor honourable), the Reform UK leader was there to attack the EU’s Digital Services Act and the UK’s Online Safety Act.Above all, though, he was there to pander to the lie, promoted by many Republicans, that Britain and Europe are intolerant enemies of free speech because they favour some degree of control of the terms of public debate rather than none. Yes, some of Britain’s and Europe’s laws on these subjects need to be rethought. But the real North Korea comparison is in places such as Russia, China and even, embryonically, in the United States itself. By their toadying to Trump, Farage and his sycophants are doing their utmost to bring to these shores the very thing by which they claim to be so outraged.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last year, a violent rightwing uprising tore through our streets – an attempted pogrom in which racists tried to burn asylum seekers alive, attacked homes and businesses thought to belong to migrants, petrol-bombed mosques and assaulted people of colour in broad daylight. That disgrace should hang permanently around the necks of the anti-migrant right, a warning of where scapegoating and toxic lies lead.Instead, the revolt succeeded. Anti-migrant rhetoric in politics and the press has grown more venomous. Reform UK now tops polls by a decisive margin. Its leader, Nigel Farage, raises the spectre of “major civil disorder” unless anti-migrant demands are met. Lucy Connolly – who was jailed after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire and is married to a former Conservative councillor – has beenrecast as a martyrby rightwing outlets and politicians. I don’t believe in jailing people for such speech, but her canonisation is chilling.Far-right activistscheered Robert Jenrick, the Tory leader-in-waiting, as he joined one of the anti-asylum protests sprouting across the country. Racist organisers boast that “the mainstream media are echoing our talking points”. Meanwhile, amosque in Portsmouthwas targeted, a nurse has beenracially abusedon camera in Halifax, aChinese takeawaywas daubed with racist slurs, andmasked mentried to force their way into a west London hotel housing asylum seekers. Every racist in Britain feels emboldened.And yet the shameful role of Keir Starmer’s floundering administration is what brings us to the brink. First, Labour refuses to confront a broken economic model that breeds insecurity and hands extremists their raw material. Witness the party’s botched attacks on support for pensioners and disabled people, and note thataverage disposable incomesare projected to fall on their watch.Second, rather than leading against anti-migrant hysteria, Labour feeds it. The party pumps outTrump-style videosof dark-skinned migrants being deported. Farage is chided for “moaning from the sidelines”, while the government gets on with the business of kicking out foreigners. In 2021 the home secretary, then chair of the home affairs select committee, warned that without safe legal routes for family reunion, more people would be driven into the hands of criminal gangs;now she blocks refugeesfrom reuniting with loved ones. Starmer, meanwhile, attacks the Tories from the right, accusing them of running an “open borders experiment”. He claimed immigration had done “incalculable damage” and warned Britain was becoming “an island of strangers”. He later disowned this Enoch Powell-esque language byblaming his speechwriters– confirming himself as the unprincipled frontman of a toxic faction.Hostility to migrants and refugees rests on lies that almost no prominent politician will challenge. That’s why Zack Polanski’s election as Green party leader is welcome: he unequivocally says thatmigrants are “not to blame”for crisis-stricken public services, and that we should instead focus our anger at “the private jets, the private yachts, and to multimillionaires and billionaires”.A Survation pollfound that a quarter of voters believe people crossing in small boats make up the largest share of migrants; in reality they account for 2%. Forty-four per cent think refugees and asylum seekers are the majority of migrants; the true figure is 16%.YouGov finds thatnearly half of the public believe most migrants here are “illegal”, though the vast majority arrived by plainly legal means.As for the law: the refugee convention forbids penalising asylum seekers for how they arrive. The greatest number of people arriving in small boatsare from Afghanistan: a country we first helped destabilise by backing the mujahideen in the Soviet-Afghan war, whichgave rise to the Taliban, before we participated in a disastrous 20-year military deployment in the wake of the “war on terror”.Despite our role in making nations like these unsafe, rich countries such as Britain take inabout a quarterof the world’s refugees, a figure that was much lower before Ukrainians fled Russia’s invasion. And by choking off safe, legal routes, governments have pushed more people on to dangerous boats. Seven in 10 voters supportpeople’s right to claim refugefrom war or persecution in Britain. The trick has been to demonise the tiny numbers arriving by small boat in order to smear migrants as a whole. Yet when asked aboutparticular groups– doctors, care home workers, catering staff, foreign students – the public mostly rejects cutting numbers.Labour chooses to cement, not challenge, these falsehoods. We know where that road ends.When France’s Emmanuel Macronadopted the right’s rhetoric and policies, Marine Le Pen proclaimed an “ideological victory” and only grew stronger. Austria’s mainstream parties championed anti-asylum detention and the veil clampdown; the Freedom Party surged in 2024.Germany’s Christian Democratsbroke the “firewall” against the far right, backing a migrant crackdown motion with Alternative für Deutschland; the AfD duly advanced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their arguments are legitimised, and they will always outbid you on ferocity and “authenticity”. The alternative is obvious: transformative policies that lift living standards – taxing the well-off to rebuild public services – forcing the right on to the defensive and exposing it as the tribune of vested wealth with no interest in ordinary people’s security. Labour’s leaders are ideologically opposed to that path. So they have capitulated to Faragism.

The files must be releasedStacey WilliamsThis is not a partisan issue. The American people – and Epstein’s many victims – deserve transparencyThu 4 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 07.45 EDTShareIn 1986, my life went from black-and-white to color. It was the year I taped a Duran Duran poster to my rural Pennsylvania high school locker, and then months later hung out with band members backstage at the Paris runway shows. It was the year I went from cleaning bathrooms for $3.35 an hour to making $50k in a day for a Maybelline shoot. Modeling opened a door into a gorgeous, creative, elite world – a dream born of a biological accident.It is also what led me, decades later, into the very uncomfortable position of speaking out about the horrific legacy of the child sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, whom I briefly dated in 1993.I was introduced to Epstein at a dinner party, which I attended at the request of my then agent, Faith Kates. He was charming and smart, and didn’t condescend as we connected over current events and the state of the world, a rare experience for me in those scenarios.The brief relationship that emerged was consensual. But some of the events that took place within the confines of that relationship were not.Last October, Icame forwardwith a story I had kept private (with the exception of sharing with my closest friends) for decades: Epstein once walked me into Donald Trump’s office at Trump Tower, where I was groped by Trump as Epstein stood by and watched. (Trump denies that this ever happened). For years I stayed silent in order to protect my privacy and my family. But with the release of a documentary in which I was featured, I felt I had to tell the truth. To support my account, I waspolygraphedby a renowned examiner, my close friends were interviewed to corroborate that I had shared this story over the years, and Trump biographerMichael Wolff confirmedthat Epstein disclosed the incident to him.More recently, I have also shared something Epstein once told me over tea and Zabar’s walnut bread at his mansion: that he hadvideo of me disrobedin a bedroom in his home. He described it as “the most beautiful thing” he had seen. That comment chilled me then, and it haunts me still. When I watched FBI agentsraid Epstein’s homesin 2019, I grew nauseous at the thought that such videos could have ended up in the hands of other people.Let me be clear: I did not consent to being groped byDonald Trump, and I did not consent to being filmed by Jeffrey Epstein. I am speaking out not because of politics, but because the American people – and Epstein’s many victims – deserve transparency.This is not a partisan issue. Being a victim crosses party lines. That’s why I’ve been encouraged to see Representatives Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, from opposite sides of the aisle, standing besides Epstein’s victims on Capitol Hill,demanding the releaseof the Epstein files. Hundreds of women have lived in the shadow of this man’s crimes. They deserve truth, not secrecy.Yet what we’ve seen is a game of political chicken. TheWall Street Journal reportedthat the attorney general, Pam Bondi, privately told Trump his name appears in Epstein-related files. The justice department’s second-in-command, Todd Blanche – Trump’s former lawyer –met behind closed doorsnot with victims, but with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for helping Epstein abuse underage girls. And despite public assurances that there is “nothing to see”, Congressrecessed earlyrather than debate the issue. Maxwell, meanwhile, was quietlymovedto a more comfortable minimum-security prison in Texas, despite the fact that sherepeatedly deflectedand minimized facts during her interview.Two days ago, in a deceptive move supposedly intended to signal transparency, the House oversight committee released more than 33,000 files related to Epstein that it received from the justice department. As Representative Massie pointed out, 97% of those pages are “already in public domain”.So here I am, like so many women in my position, mustering the courage to disclose and jumping through hoops to prove my truth – while perpetrators and enablers enjoy the benefit of secrecy. It is baffling that leaders from the president on down insist there is nothing to see, yet refuse to release the actual files. It is equally baffling to hearAlan Dershowitz denythat surveillance tapes exist, when testimony and evidence suggest otherwise. Maria Farmer, one of the first women to report Epstein and Maxwell for sexual crimes,told CBS Newsthat Epstein had hidden cameras throughout his home. A recent New York Timesreport included imagesof video cameras inside Epstein’s mansion, even above his bed. And Epstein specifically boasted that he had video footage of me.I know my pain is shared by countless survivors. I think ofVirginia Giuffre, who tragically died by suicide this April, and of the retraumatization survivors endure as they watch Ghislaine Maxwell settle into a more comfortable facility while their stories remain buried. That is not justice.We deserve peace of mind. We deserve healing that comes with accountability. And that will never come so long as our trauma is reduced to partisan warfare. Sexual violence and trafficking have no political party.It is time to put politics aside, release the Epstein files and help free the women at the center of this tragedy from a nightmare that has lasted for decades.Stacey Williams is a former modelExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpGhislaine Maxwell#MeToo movementcommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, in terms of people making policy and law in buildings that are world-famous for that purpose, the SW1 postcode is where it is at.But the heart of the machine beats with a weak pulse. The UK state is heavily centralised by the standards of most democracies, yet the people at the centre don’t feel powerful. Ministers can’t enforce bin collections in remote areas or call a halt to Middle East wars but they are made to feel answerable for all that is ill in the world, from hyperlocal to geopolitical.Convention portrays the chancellor as commander-in-chief of the nation’s economic wellbeing, but her arsenal of fiscal weapons has limited range in a world of volatile global markets. A gust of headwind from gilt traders blows Rachel Reeves’s budget plans miles off course.With control of the purse strings, the Treasury at least feels a grip onsomething. In Downing Street, the prime minister complains of levers that don’t connect to anything, civil service channels that are blocked, missing links in the chain of command. It doesn’t take much for No 10 to feel besieged, under pressure to react to every adverse twist of the news cycle at the risk of surrendering still more control of the agenda.Policymaking gets distorted by the demand for eye-catching announcements – another migration crackdown – with diminishing returns. A ceaseless, hostile roar carries from engines of online fury to newspaper front pages to BBC bulletins, drowning any message the government might want to transmit.These are the conditions that allow Nigel Farage, the routinely absent MP for Clacton, to rival Keir Starmer, the actual prime minister, for the title of Britain’s most influential politician. The Reform UK leader has overcome that constitutional disparity in status byamassing powerin the sprawling, informal, networked space where 21st-century politics happens.After a summer recess spent making hostile political weather for refugees, Farage has skipped Westminster and the resumption of Commons business. He is in Washington DC, bad-mouthing Britain as a benighted land of repression, where free speech is suffocated and dissenters are locked up. In support of that claim, hechampions the cause of Lucy Connolly, who was jailed in the aftermath of anti-immigrant riots last summer. She called for people to set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers and pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred.Farage’s message is intended to curry favour with Republicans in Congress, White House officials and big tech bosses who hate the UK’s online safety law, which imposes duties on social media platforms to restrict children’s access to harmful material. The Trump administration treats any requirement to regulate digital content as an aggression against American liberty and free enterprise. There could be retaliation in trade sanctions.An opposition leader travels to a foreign capital where he trash talks his home country and denounces its government in terms that solicit punitive action from a capricious despot. Under most circumstances there would be a domestic backlash against that kind of disloyalty. But Farage plays politics to his own rules, refereed by a partisan media that shares his disgust with modern Britain and calls the contempt patriotic. He is under no pressure to offer credible policy solutions to the complex problems he cynically exploits. When his rickety ideas wobble under scrutiny, as with last week’s pledge topay the Talibanfor taking shipments of refugees, including women and children, he changes the subject without penalty.Meanwhile, Starmer toils under the obligation to have plans that might actually work, which even in the best-case scenario can’t produce results fast enough to keep pace with the digital conveyors of doomscrolling public dissatisfaction. No one thinks Labour’s first year in office followed the best-case scenario.The prime minister’s frustration at slow progress has triggered a round of new advisory appointments and a reshuffle of Downing Street job functions. Tim Allan, a Tony Blair-era veteran, comes in as thenew director of communications, a role no one seems to keep for long in the Labour leader’s entourage. Darren Jones, formerly chief secretary to the Treasury, gets a newly invented job as chief secretary to the prime minister. He is tasked with unblocking pipes, connecting wires across Whitehall so Starmer can pull a lever inside No 10 and see something happen on the ground, for a change.In a generous interpretation, this is evidence of Starmer grappling with structural inadequacies of the British state that have thwarted most of his predecessors to some extent. It is consistent with his record as an incremental problem-solver who learns on the job, building the plane while flying it, shredding passengers’ nerves in the process, but somehow landing safely in the end.Keepers of that optimistic flame are a dwindling bunch in the parliamentary Labour party. It is easier to find anxious MPs who think the origin of the problem has not been a machine that refuses to do what the prime minister wants, but a leader who arrived in office not knowing what he really wanted from the machine. The difficulty getting the government’s message across has not been deficient comms strategists but incoherence in the agenda. There still isn’t a clear destination, the plane is losing altitude rapidly and the air keeps getting more turbulent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Someone’s marginally off-message “bold vision for Britain” will set the fringe sizzling with leadership speculation that will come to nothing. The prime minister will give a hotly anticipated speech that hardly anyone outside the hall will notice. There will be running commentary on channels no one is watching, looking for gamechanging moments in a niche sport with few fans outside the secure zone.Then it will be back to SW1, the familiar rhythm of parliament, the Downing Street “grid” of announcements, building towards a critical budget in November. Maybe the message will get clearer with a new team in place. Maybe systems will now work faster and voters will start to notice the delivery of better government. And yet it is hard to avoid the feeling that the problem goes much deeper; that politics delivered through the rituals of Westminster has lost the crowd and power, draining from the centre, is mustering elsewhere.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourNigel FarageReform UKRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

There must be a better way. You have already had to come to terms with disappointments on your long journey to your heart’s desire: a fellow human with whom to converse somewhere deep in the bowels of a company’s customer service department.First, there’s the dismay, if not surprise, when you find it’s not a person who has answered the phone. Then there’s the enervating torture of listening to the long list of options from which to make your selection. The most I’ve ever been offered is seven. SEVEN! For added annoyance you may well then be told that a) your call is important to them and b) that they’re experiencing more calls than usual. The latter is a certain precursor to the dreaded hold music.I’ve seen research by the University of York for the virtual network operator Talkmobile. More than 2,500 participants were subjected to hold music of various genres, as well as alternative audio, including nature sounds, trivia and silence. Trivia came out best – or rather least irritating; metal, as in heavy metal, came bottom. Interestingly, in all the years I’ll never get back that I’ve spent listening to hold music I’ve never once come across trivia or metal. Either would have made a nice change.It also emerged, to no great surprise, that if what is playing turns out to be on a loop, everyone hates it. It’s almost a doom loop, strongly suggesting you are on a quest without end.I’ve never understood why they do this. Why loop anything? Surely it’s not because of a shortage of tape? I’ve been doing battle with the Co-operative Bank’s hold music for years. The tune itself isn’t bad. But it is looped. And even worse, the way it is edited suggests someone has picked up. Cruel, so cruel.New thinking, the research concludes, is needed. Press 1 for “Oh really”; press 2 for “Of course it bloody well is”. One suggestion is to give customers the option to choose between music, silence or trivia. It’s all going to be so much fun listening where this goes that I hope nobody ever picks up.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionCall centresTelecomscommentShareReuse this content"

Maybe he should learn it firstSidney BlumenthalThe president seeking to overhaul the Smithsonian has a dark vision of the past that he’s using to advance his agendaThu 4 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 08.41 EDTShareOf all the presidents,Donald Trump– the man who wouldremake the Smithsonianand alter its presentation of “how bad slavery was”,as he put it– is surely the most ignorant of American history itself.What Trump doesn’t know fills the Library of Congress, whose chieflibrarian he has fired, along with driving out the heads ofthe National Archivesand theNational Portrait Gallery, as well asdissolving programsof the National Endowment for the Humanities anddefunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which as a result haspaused the acclaimed American Experiencedocumentary series.Trump claims he is tearing down the entire federal support for history in order to reveal the true story. In hisexecutive orderof 27 March, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, he stated: “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” The “improper ideology” that needs to be extirpated is a “divisive, race-centered ideology”.Pentagon to restore Confederate general portrait at West Point libraryRead moreThe White House issued amemoon 21 August, titled “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian”, citing a broad swath of scattered incidents ranging from “wokeness” to representations of immigration to a picture of the former leading health official Anthony Fauci, who is anathema to the right.Trump appointed areview panelto be headed by his vice-president, JD Vance, and the attorney and White House staffer Lindsey Halligan, who is actually the one in charge of the project. Echoing Trump, sheexplained: “We don’t need to overemphasize the negative to teach people that certain aspects of our nation’s history may have been bad.” ShetoldFox News, “What I saw when I was going through the museum, personally, was an overemphasis on slavery, and I think there should be more of an overemphasis on how far we’ve come since slavery.”A Trump White House aideelaborated: “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.” The aide had the Trump formula down pat: after the purge comes the retribution. Trumptweeted: “I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.”When Trump met on 28 August with Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian and founding director of the Smithsonian’s African American Museum ofHistory, he brought along Halligan as his expert.Her credentials for this crucial assignment in the culture war – after twice competing in the Miss Colorado USA beauty pageant, then becoming an insurance lawyer in Florida – must have been her work as one of Trump’sattorneys involvedin the case overclassified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Trump initiallynoticed herat the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in 2021. She is now, in addition to her other duties, the de facto Trump White House historian-in-residence. She told theWashington Postshe was interested in the civil war and westward expansion. A former colleague described her as “a fan of history”.Beyond Halligan’scomments in a letterabout packaging the past into a palatable Happy Meal of “ideals” and “Americanism”, the administration did not present its actual alternative history or the policies that flow from it. Trumpbellowed that the Smithsonian contained“Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future”.But this gospel of positive-thinking twaddle aside, Trump, proudly ignorant though he is, has for years articulated a vision of American history. That vision does not emphasize the strides the nation has made through tumultuous struggle since the abolition of slavery. Instead, it honors the those who defended slavery, committed treason to preserve it and claim it to be a worthy American “heritage”.Trump has repeatedly sought toshield the Confederate statues and symbolserected as tribute to the “lost cause” myth. He has expressed and unqualified admiration for Robert E Lee as a quintessential American hero almost always coupled with belittling remarks about Lincoln. His view of history squarely aligns him with neo-Confederates, not least those who carried the Confederate flag at the US Capitol during the insurrection on 6 January 2021 and whom he subsequently pardoned.Trump’s version of history is not, however, simply reactionary nostalgia, or treacly kitsch for the restoration of “Uncle Herschel”, the “Old-Timer” to the Cracker Barrel logo. His use of the culture war is a key element to advance his policy agenda.After the civil war, in reaction to Reconstruction, the southern slaveholding oligarchy regrouped to form the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist militias, most under the direction of former Confederate officers, to destroy the possibilities of emancipation and civil rights in the name of what they called “redemption”. Nearly a century later, the civil rights revolution of the 1960s overthrew the southern segregationist regime to restore and expand the enforcement of the original civil war amendments to the US constitution – the 14th amendment securing equal protection under the law and birthright citizenship and the 15th amendment protecting Black voting rights. The great southern historian C Vann Woodward called the civil rights movement the Second Reconstruction.Trump’s neo-Confederate culture war is the symbolic cover for hisfull-scale political assaulton those civil war amendments and the further enactment of their intent in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He is directing a second redemption to tear down the Second Reconstruction.The attack on the constitution has been swift, comprehensive and sharply partisan. Trump is seeking to nullify birthright citizenship in the 14th amendment. He ischallengingthe Voting Rights Act and abandoning previous justice department positions on the constitutionality of remedying racially discriminatory voting maps in support of arguments in the supreme court case Louisiana v Callais.In fear of losing Republican control of the Congress in the 2026 elections, he has encouraged states to ignore the practice of redistricting congressional districts based on the census and instead to redraw racially discriminatory lines to create new Republican seats.The Smithsonian would do well to mount a proper exhibit dedicated to Trump’s historical ignoranceHe has dismantled the civil rights division of the justice department.Seventy per centof its attorneys have been fired or driven to resign. His administration hasplanned to closethe Community Relations Service, a unit created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to mediate racial tensions. He has withdrawn from numerousjustice department lawsuitschallenging voter suppression laws.He has issued an executive order to prevent federal agencies from enforcing regulations forbidding “disparate impact” discrimination. He has attacked grants, contracts and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), withhis justice department creatingan Orwellian-named “civil rights fraud initiative” to target what his agents choose to define as illegal DEI practices, and use it to leverage control over universities, law firms and private businesses.Perhaps no official presidential statement exemplifies Trump’s adherence to the “lost cause” mythology more flagrantly than his veto of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, which included the creation of theNational Naming Commissionto remove names honoring the Confederacy from nine federal military forts and thousands of other assets. “I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles,” Trumpstated. The House and the Senate overwhelmingly overrode his veto.Once Trump reassumed office, he authorized wiping away the new names, some of them of Black soldiers, and reinstated the old last names of Confederate generals at the forts but with the cynical twist of claiming they werereally for different peoplewith the same names.The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, who called the National Naming Commission “woke lemmings” and its changes “garbage”,said: “Unlike the left, we recognize our history, we don’t erase it.” He announced the return of theConfederate memorialat the Arlington national cemetery, whose frieze depicts a faithfulenslaved woman taking careof a Confederate soldier’s child as he marches off to battle. In the West Point library,the Pentagon has rehungthe 20ft-tall portrait of Robert E Lee in his gray Confederate uniform with a faithful enslaved person tending his horse, Traveller, in the background.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The eulogizing of “the Four Seasons of the Confederacy” is now reframed with contemporary texts to explain the post-civil war romanticizing of the slave republic.The exhibit also features a widely circulated “lost cause”pamphletpublished by the United Confederate Veterans in 1919 that urged southern school districts: “Reject a book that says the South fought to hold her slaves … Reject a book that glorifies Abraham Lincoln and vilifies Jefferson Davis.”For perspective, around the corner from this exhibit, the Virginia Museum of History has stationed the white hood and sheet of a Ku Klux Klansman. In 2020 and 2021, the row of five towering Confederate statues along Richmond’s Monument Avenue of Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Jeb Stuart, and Matthew Fontaine Maury, erected as “lost cause” icons during the Jim Crow era, were removed.In the interest of “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, the Smithsonian would do well to mount a proper exhibit dedicated to Trump’s historical ignorance and his “divisive race-centered ideology”.‘Political cesspool’: Lincoln, Davis and a battle with echoes for the time of TrumpRead moreThe exhibit could begin with a kind of preface, posting the remarks of Trump’s chief of staff in his first administration, the former marine general John Kelly, who revealed Trump to be the ignoramus-in-chief. “He doesn’t know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,” Kellysaid. Trump reportedly told Kelly that Adolf Hitler “did a lot of good things”. He alsoreportedly saidhe needed “the kind of generals that Hitler had”, people “who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders”. (Trump representatives deny he made the remarks.)Kelly described the conversation to Jeffrey Goldberg inthe Atlantic: “‘Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?’” Kelly asked. “‘Do you mean the Kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t meanHitler’sgenerals?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’” Trump asked Kelly who the “good guys” were in the first world war.Then the exhibit might move on to President William McKinley, whom Trump lately hasinvokedas the “tariff king” to justify his own tariffs, largely ruled illegal so far by the courts. Trump seems to care about no other aspect of McKinley or his presidency – say, the Spanish-American War – while he has revived his memory by removing the Native American name of Mount Denali in Alaska and renaming it Mount McKinley. Trump has ignored McKinley’s second thoughts about tariffs, including his final speech before his assassination in 1901, in which he abjured severe tariffs. But how would Trump know that?Next the exhibit would devote ample space to Trump’s relationship to Abraham Lincoln, the one president Trump has discussed more than any other. In 2018, as Trump’s poll ratings dived, hetweeted: “Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.” Of course, there were no polls in Lincoln’s time.In 2019, Trumpstated: “The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it … Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances.” In fact, Lincoln’s name was kept off the ballot in Texas in the 1860 election and, of course, in 1864 when Texas was part of the Confederacy. In 2020, staging aninterviewwith Fox News within the Lincoln Memorial, Trump used Lincoln as a prop to elevate himself as a greater martyr. “They always said, ‘Lincoln, nobody got treated worse than Lincoln.’ I believe I am treated worse.” He apparently had forgotten Lincoln’s assassination.On the third anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, in 2024, he appeared to blame Lincoln for the civil war. “So many mistakes were made,” Trumpsaid. “See, there was something I think could have been negotiated, to be honest with you. I think you could have negotiated that. All the people died, so many people died. You know, that was the disaster … Abraham Lincoln, of course, if he negotiated it, you probably wouldn’t even know who Abraham Lincoln was.” Of course, Lincoln held out an olive branch in his first inaugural address, appealing to the “mystic chords of memory” and “the better angels of our nature”, which was met a month later with the firing on Fort Sumter. But in Trump’s view he had failed the art of the deal. He was the 19th century’s Zelenskyy.Then the exhibit would come to Robert E Lee. In the aftermath of the neo-Nazi rally at Charlottesville in 2017 in which 35 people were injured and a young woman was murdered, about which Trump infamously said there were “some very fine people on both sides”, hedefendedConfederate monuments against a protest to remove a statue of Lee that had been erected as a tribute to the “lost cause”. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” hetweeted.“So,” hesaidat a rally in 2018, “Robert E Lee was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia, he couldn’t beat Robert E Lee. He was going crazy … but Robert E Lee was winning battle after battle after battle and Abraham Lincoln came home and he said, ‘I can’t beat Robert E Lee.’”Lincoln had a clear and firm opinion about Lee. He considered him a traitor. Naming Lee high among officers of the army who had betrayed their oath to the United States, Lincolnwroteon 12 June 1863 that they were “now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now”. Lincoln wrote: “I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed” for not having arrested Lee and the others when their treasonous intent was known before they had joined the Confederacy to lead an armed insurrection against the United States.Of course, there is a memorial on the estate overlooking Washington where Lee lived before the war. Quartermaster General Montgomery Meigs, who had been a West Point classmate and friend of Lee, declared those grounds the Arlington national cemetery in 1864, planting the first graves of fallen soldiers in the rose garden as close to the house as possible, to ensure that Lee would never return.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

His campaigning prowess was instrumental in taking Britain out of the European Union. The methods he used, ratcheting the terms of debate ever rightwards, galvanising public dissatisfaction on a range of issues and connecting it to immigration, are now being deployed to boost his candidacy as a future prime minister.Opinion polls suggest it could happen. Mr Farage will want theReform UK annual conferencein Birmingham this weekend to project a sense that his march on Downing Street is unstoppable. It can and must be stopped.A preview of what Reform UK government would involve is available across the Atlantic. Mr Farage wasin Washingtonearlier this week, stoking radical Republicans’ paranoid illusion of Britain as a hellscape where free speech is stifled and national culture is corroded by immigration. He endorsed Donald Trump’s method of mass deportations, enforced with contempt for law and human rights.Mr Trump uses vicious rhetoric to stir fear and hatred of migrants, casting them as predators and criminals, blurring the distinction between illegal arrivals and legally settled, foreign-born citizens. He mobilises racial animosity for a wider project to degrade the constitution, dissolve civic norms and submit the US toauthoritarian rule. That is the agenda Mr Farage admires. It is the playbook he is following.The UK has a better record than many comparable democracies at integrating migrant communities and cultivating an open, tolerant, multicultural society. Politicians have tested the boundary where demand for stricter migration control shades into xenophobia, but there used to be taboos. Talk of rounding people up for mass deportation was confined to the outermost fringe. Now it is mainstream. That is partly Mr Farage’s doing, but it is a function also of cowardly imitation by other politicians who envy his knack for attracting publicity, and his poll ratings.Robert Jenrick, the Conservative shadow justice secretary, has called for asylum seekers to be “detained in camps” resembling “rudimentary prisons”. He wants “net emigration”, to give the UK “breathing space”, implying pressure on people who have legally settled in Britain to leave. That is not official Tory policy, but Kemi Badenoch, the party’s hapless leader, never contradicts the man whom many Conservatives treat as her successor-in-waiting.Mrs Badenoch’s acquiescence to radical nationalism is consistent with post-Brexit trends in Conservatism. More disturbing is the Labour government’s failure to mount an effective defence of multicultural tolerance or push back against the venomous tide of anti-immigrant rhetoric. Sir Keir Starmer’s strategy for dealing with Mr Farage is toaccept his definitionof the nation’s No 1 problem – wicked, unchecked migration – and only query the practicality of his extreme solutions.That approach predictably reinforces Mr Farage’s credibility among people who already don’t trust Labour, while alienating Labour supporters who crave a government brave enough to stand up to Mr Farage. It is a self-defeating spectacle and a dangerous one. Sir Keir’s prospects of re-election depend on the support of voters appalled byReform UKand what it represents. If the Labour leader is unable even to describe the threat, he will fail to counter it and British democracy will be the loser.Explore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageDonald TrumpLabourImmigration and asylumKeir StarmereditorialsShareReuse this content"

But Donald Trump is hastening Beijing’s riseThu 4 Sep 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 17.24 EDTShareOn Wednesday morning, Beijingers living near Tiananmen Square were issued with cold breakfast packs and ordered to refrain from cooking, lest smoke from stoves cloud the skies above themammoth military parade. China’s Communist party goes toextraordinary lengthsto ensure that nothing obscures the message of such performances – in this case, that Xi Jinping is reshaping the global order and that China is, in his words, “unstoppable”.The parade marked 80 years since the end of the second world war, positioningChinaas the critical force in victory in the east then, and a force to be similarly reckoned with today as “humanity is again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum”, in Mr Xi’s words. China is “not afraid of bullies”.Nationalism has becomeincreasingly centralto the party’s domestic message. For international observers, it was the guest list, even more than thesizeable nuclear and conventional arsenal, which spelled out the intent. The images of the Chinese leader flanked by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, with other autocrats paying court, could hardly have been more striking. It found its intended audience. Donald Trump – his pique perhaps sharpened by the contrast with hisown alarming but underwhelming paradein June – accused the trio of conspiring against the United States.Yet if China’s rise is the underlying force in the global shift of power, it is Mr Trump who has provided it with fresh opportunities as he divides and weakens his nation, bullies US allies andattacks the postwar global order. New Delhi was seen as a potential counterweight to Beijing. But Narendra Modi’s attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, another opportunity for Chinese grandstanding just before the parade, wasa clear riposteto Mr Trump’s punitive tariffs on India. To many governments, China now looks like the more predictable, if not friendlier, player.Despite the talk of an “axis of upheaval”, relations between the Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders are better understood as an alignment. There are limits to, as well as frictions in, the ties, though that need not prevent them enduring or causing lasting damage. Moscow has relied on Chinese diplomatic and economic support and equipment in its war in Ukraine – but has had to turn to Pyongyang for weapons and troops. Mr Xi embraced Mr Kim after Mr Trump wooed the North Korean leader. Now he keeps him close to prevent Pyongyang growing too close to Moscow.China’s military progress also faces challenges. Pakistan’s clash with India in May saw a Chinese fighter planetested in combatfor the first time. But it is decades since the People’s Liberation Army saw action anda widening purge, including of generalspromoted by Mr Xi himself, suggests he is still concerned about its corruption, political reliability or both.It would be folly to ignore Beijing’s statement of intent. But it would also be foolish to confuse it with a statement of fact. The future is still being written. Governments in Asia, Europe and elsewhere still have choices to make; and those will be shaped by US actions as much as Chinese. Mr Trump is surrounded by China hawks. Yet the biggest imminent threat to Taiwan is probably not that Chinese military confidence leads Mr Xi to risk war with the US, but that Mr Trump rats it out for a trade deal.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionXi JinpingVladimir PutinKim Jong-unRussiaNorth KoreaDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

It is the developer that decides when to submit a planning application, when to start building once a housing development gets consent, and the rate of building. Councils cannot influence any of that. Once development has started (any little bit of siteworks is enough) it can take years for the slightest progress to happen and councils can do nothing.That’s why we have land with planning consent for more than a million new homes in this country. To achieve a significant increase in new homes, the law must penalise developers for not building on allocated and consented sites. These could be considered liable to business rates.The planning and infrastructure bill seems toothless, and overriding local decision-makers just proves what residents already think – that plan-making is pointless.Cllr Dr Tony VickersWest Berkshire councilThe proposals to intervene when councils “consistently make poor-quality decisions about planning applications and prevent the delivery of the homes and infrastructure we need” is the latest attempt to blame local government for the nation’s housing crisis.Making a local plan is a statutory duty. Councils take a long time to put them together as they are prepared with the full involvement of their communities, and are required to take an evidence-based, comprehensive approach to assessing an area’s needs. They are subject to rigorous independent examination. Allowing ministers subsequently to impose ad hoc changes would destroy what little faith people have left in the integrity of the planning system.Instead of picking a fight with local planning authorities, the government should focus on developers that sit on land with planning permission. A “use it or lose it” rule was advocated by Labour as far back as 2014. What’s stopping them now that they have a thumping majority?David KaisermanWilmslow, CheshireYour article raises profound concerns for communities like mine in Cheshire. Barratt Homes is proposing alarge development on green belt landbordering an ancient woodland. The damage this would inflict on wildlife, habitats and heritage would be permanent.This is not a case of resisting homes for the sake of it. Frodsham has aneighbourhood plan (2024), approved by more than 70% of residents in a referendum, which identifies suitable sites for housing while safeguarding natural assets. To dismiss such a plan would not only undermine faith in the planning system but also erode trust in the local democracy.The proposed development comes with no new GP surgeries, no extra school places or road improvements.

It can be given by a variety of healthcare professionals, costs nothing to apply at home and would save the NHS millions in a few years’ time. Children would have less pain and dentists would have a happier job.Extending the sugar tax and challenging the aggressive marketing and lobbying tactics of the food industry, which promotes and profits from high-sugar foods, should also be considered if we are to take the problem seriously. There is “no specific correlation between the number of NHS dentists and young children with tooth decay” because the damage has been done and habits established before most children get to see a dentist.Incidentally, a bit more advice at the earliest stages would have significant health benefits in other respects too.Nick HopkinsonYorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Allow me to change your mind, 31 August) is full of the usual defences: that hunters are the ones who really care about wildlife and who protect it with their taxes and their efforts, and that hunting is a more ethical and humane means of consuming meat than store-bought factory-farmed. It conveniently overlooks the fact that hunters lobby government wildlife offices, hunters manage wildlife populations so that there is always a surplus of the kinds of animals they want to kill, and that hunters hold vast (usually right-leaning) political power in the US.And the fact is that hunters not only eat their “reverential” kills but also readily eat the “ethically inferior” often factory-farmed meat; the author makes brief mention of that in admitting her weakness for store-bought poultry. Frankly, hunted meat may normally be less cruel than meat produced by animal agriculture, but there is overlap in their government lobbying efforts – for example, both want wild horsesremoved from public landsand both want hunting seasons on wild predators such as wolves and bears.Kim BartlettPresident, Animal People IncIf you must murder, murder softly (or so runs Jessica Reed’s defence of hunting).

Plus a letter fromJoe CockerThu 4 Sep 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 13.08 EDTShareIsobel Lewis’s article on vegan restaurants suggests two reasons that they may be closing: general problems in the hospitality industry and a shift in cultural values (The plant-based problem: why vegan restaurants are closing – or adding meat to the menu, 2 September). Surely, it’s missing the real reason? I am vegetarian, but I rarely eat in vegetarian or vegan restaurants because I rarely dine out alone.People usually want to dine with their partner, or their friends. Quite a few people are vegan, but far fewer couples are likely to both be vegan. Even fewer friend groups are all vegan. To me, requesting that my non-vegetarian friends dine out at a vegan restaurant would be as selfish as it would be for them to request I eat at a steak house. We might occasionally agree on one or the other just to see how it goes, but most of the time we’ll go to a restaurant that caters to all our diets. This is why vegan-only restaurants find the going tough.Adam WilliamsonVancouver,CanadaI have not eaten meat for over 40 years and have gradually moved towards a more plant-based diet. I prefer my vegetables to look and taste like vegetables, not 3D-printed “vegan steak” (made of plant protein, with the fibrous feel of the real thing) and disarmingly realistic “tofish” (tofu fish). Maybe the demise of many vegan restaurants means that I am not alone.Fr Colin PateyAshby-de-la-Zouch, LeicestershireRendel Harris says that “if you really want to be kind to other species, go vegan” (Letters, 31 August). This is unfair. I really want to be kind to other species and as a result I have not knowingly eaten the flesh of mammals, birds or fish for the last 40 years. Yes, I could do more, but that is a reasonable start.I also use plant-based “milk”, margarine etc, and thus limit my use of dairy products.

He oversaw the construction of what is widely regarded as the best club stadium in England. Tottenham’s training ground is one of the best in Europe. He kept costs low. He has diversified the business, so the club hosts NFL, rugby, boxing, monster trucks and major concerts. He even had the chutzpah to get Tottenham intoSuper League conversations, despite the fact they haven’t won the league since 1961. Yet over the past year,Levy has faced constant fan protests.Daniel Levy steps down as Tottenham chairman with immediate effectRead moreThe news he had stepped down on Thursday came as a shock, although in retrospect there is perhaps a suggestion that he could feel the end approaching. In February he said “all options are open” in response to fan demands for his resignation. Last month, in a rare extended interview, given to Gary Neville,he remarked: “When I’m not here I’m sure I’ll get the credit,” a suggestion perhaps he was beginning to contemplate his legacy. He is 63 and missed theUefa Super Cup finalto help his daughter settle in at university in the US, perhaps an indication of somebody beginning to reassess their life priorities.Tottenham, similarly, had begun to restructure. The former Arsenal executive Vinai Venkatesham was appointed as CEO in the summer, and it was announced in March that Peter Charrington, a director of Enic, which owns 86.91% of the club, would be joining the board. Charrington now becomes nonexecutive chair. To what extent Levy was a willing participant in what looks now like succession planning is unclear, but the suspicion is there has been a conscious desire for a new approach from the Lewis family, which owns Enic, although Levy and his family have a 29.88% stake. That Levy had a financial stake in the club and so an interest in making it as profitable as possible has, along with the fact he was the best-paid Premier League chair, been a constant a bugbear for fans whose focus, understandably, is on the pitch.It is one of the curses of football’s executive classes that fans still care about trivialities such as winning the trophies and playing the game well, and one of the great ironies of the modern Premier League that before every match at Tottenham a video montage of highlights of the club’s history is played to stirring music and Danny Blanchflower’s dictum that the game is about glory. And then out run a team representing a club with a 42% wages-to-turnover ratio.To an extent that caution was forced on Levy by circumstance. White Hart Lane had to be upgraded and Levy has done that, while keeping the club in their traditional home. Managing that in London, where land is so scarce and so expensive, is not an achievement to be dismissed. The cost, though, was at least £1bn which, as Arsenal found when they moved to the Emirates, necessarily restricts expenditure in other areas.Caution in the transfer market, though, allied to rising ticket prices, has led to fan frustration. In Levy’s 24 years at the club, Spurs reached 16 semi-finals and seven finals, twice finished third in the league and once second, but won only theLeague Cup in 2008and the Europa League last season. Might they have collected more silverware with even a slightly more aggressive transfer strategy? Profitability and sustainability regulations have not been what has constrained them.View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy (right) congratulates Ange Postecoglou after victory for Spurs in last season’s Europa League final.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesThere have been two major frustrations. First, the £85m fee secured for Gareth Bale from Real Madrid was not well invested. Worse, though, was perhaps what happened after 2017-18 when Tottenham finished in the top three for a third consecutive season. They moved into the new stadium towards the end of the following season and reached theChampions League final. But the apparent positivity masked the staleness that had set in. Spurs had made no signings in the summer of 2018 and, just as significantly, failed to sell the players Mauricio Pochettino felt needed replacing. The result was they started their first full season in the new stadium badly, leading to Pochettino’s dismissal in November. The appointment of José Mourinho may have been a rare instance of Levy making an overtly ambitious move but it was one he misjudged, as though he were doing what it seemed like a big club would do rather than what was necessary.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What if Levy had been more prepared to take a risk? What if he had spent better? When success did finally return after 17 years it was in circumstances that made it very hard for Levy to take credit: he had so lost faith in Ange Postecoglou, the manager he had appointed,that he sacked him 16 days later.That’s what makes his legacy so hard to assess. The vision Levy laid out to Neville was overtly commercial, and by those criteria he succeeded at Tottenham. They were profitable in 13 of the 15 seasons before the stadium move and, while the current debt of £850m is significant, it is understandable: as Levy said, the stadium is the envy of many other clubs.But a football club is not just a commercial enterprise. At some point the actual football matters. Some may even argue it’s the point. And on that, Levy scores rather less highly.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurFinancesBusinesscommentShareReuse this content"

The club, who have started the season badly with one point from three games and no goals scored, were hemmed in by the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and the equivalent in Uefa competition.Villa paid out one major fee –£30.5m to Nice for Evann Guessand– and made only four further first-team additions, Marco Bizot being followed in on deadline day by Victor Lindelöf,Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho. The club were open to selling Emiliano Martínez only for there to be no buyer and movedJacob Ramsey to Newcastle for £39mdespite Unai Emery preferring to keep him. As a homegrown player, Ramsey counted as pure profit on the books.Transfer window and deadline day: Premier League club-by-club analysisRead moreVilla have been hurt by their high wages-to-revenue ratio, which stood at 96% in 2023-24 according to Deloitte. Uefa fined the club on 4 July for a breach of its squad cost ratio rules and warned they could face competitive restrictions if they did not have a positive transfer balance by the end of the window. Villa have qualified for this season’s Europa League.Konsa is preparing withEnglandfor Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra, which will be played at Villa Park. The tie has his full focus as he seeks to build on his encouraging performances under Thomas Tuchel. But it was not possible to overlook the situation at Villa and how PSR has become such a talking point.“It is crazy,” Konsa said. “I don’t understand it myself but from the outside looking in, it doesn’t look too good. I know that and I know it’s really killed us this transfer window. We’re going to have to deal with what we’ve got now.“Everyone knows it’s been a tough start but it’s part of football. We’ve done some recruitment on deadline day so hopefully the boys that have come in can really help us.”Konsa was asked whether he had followed Monday’s deadline day. “Pffff, no,” he replied. “I definitely didn’t watch that. It’s been tough, especially for us. I knew that signing players was going to be difficult so I did not look at transfer deadline day. Around eight o’clock, I went on Aston Villa Twitter to see what happened and I saw that we’d signed three players, who are really good and have Premier League experience. I think that’s what we needed as well.”View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa was sent off in Aston Villa’s opening day Premier League draw against Newcastle.Photograph: Ben Roberts/Danehouse/Getty ImagesKonsa has made something of a false start on a personal level. He wassent off in the opening fixtureagainst Newcastle, which finished 0-0, and banned for the 1-0 defeat at Brentford.Villa lost 3-0 to Crystal Palacein game three. Tuchel was in attendance for the first two matches.“Yes, he was there,” Konsa said, with a smile, of the Newcastle game. “I didn’t want to see him but he was outside the [dressing room] door. He was laughing at me. Not much to say about that! I got red-carded but he was very helpful, very understanding. It was a boring game anyway!

Was there any small talk? No. He didn’t speak [during play]. He was just focused. We only spoke at half-time. When we were watching the game, he didn’t say one word.”Konsa has been at Villa since 2019 and he has seen the truly hard times, especially his first season when the club narrowly avoided relegation to the Championship on the final day. He has faith in Emery, who has lifted Villa to finishes of seventh, fourth and sixth since taking over in October 2022. Konsa also has faith in what remains a talented team.“We want to stay in the top six, top five … we want to play Champions League football,” Konsa said. “I’ve been at Villa at the worst times so I know how bad it can be. We’re not there yet. It’s three games in.”Konsa also spoke about the responsibility he and his England teammates feel to unite an increasingly fractured nation with their performances. “Definitely,” he said. “We know how much we can bring people together. I saw it last year at the Euros, after the penalties against Switzerland [in the quarter-final win]. As footballers, sometimes you don’t realise how much power we have over people.

After theWorld Test Championship triumphin June came a second to savour at the home of cricket: a narrow five-run win under lights that sealed their first one-day international series victory on English soil for 27 years.As the tourists kept the celebrations in check – this was never going to top the final at the same venue three months ago – England reflected on a fifth ODI series defeat from their last six. They improved onTuesday’s Headingley howler, even if it would have been hard to have played any worse.England given target of 331 to beat South Africa: second men’s one-day international – liveRead moreSet 331 to win, Harry Brook’s side made 325 for nine through a spirited effort that did crackle at times. Jacob Bethell tucked into Keshav Maharaj en route to 58 from just 40 balls, Joe Root finessed a classy 61 before being stumped. And after Jos Buttler’s brisk 61 from 51, they needed 75 from the last 45 balls of the chase with four wickets in hand.But the Proteas always felt ahead and ultimately prevailed. A yorker from Lungi Ngidi had lit up Buttler’s stumps and, despite some late blows from Will Jacks (39) the regular fall of wickets then left the lower order too much to do. It finished with Jofra Archer needing 16 off the final over from Senuran Muthusamy – only to fall just short.Two-nil down, England now head to Southampton on Sunday hoping for a consolation win before the T20s that follow. This was their eighth defeat from 11 ODIs since Brendon McCullum’s brief was expanded to include the white-ball teams – their only wins this year coming against West Indies, who are ranked ninth in the world to England’s eighth.“It’s easy to say that, but in my eyes that’s just an excuse,” said Brook, when asked if fatigue or the switch from 100-ball cricket were relevant. “Slipping into any format is difficult. But we’re all good enough cricketers to be able to make that change and adapt as quickly as possible.”A bit went England’s way, too, be it Brook winning the toss after a morning of rain or an outfield that quickened up in the second innings. Wiaan Mulder, whose figures of three for 33 helped derail the home side at Headingley, was missing after an overnight illness. Saqib Mahmood coming in for Sonny Baker also meant more experience for England.But South Africa were unperturbed, their imposing 330 for eight built on another bright start from Aiden Markram (49) and a fourth-wicket stand from Matthew Breetzke (85) and Tristan Stubbs (58) that put on 147 in just 126 balls. Dewald Brevis then lit the afterburners, the 22-year-old smoking 42 from 20 to underline his remarkable hand-eye talent.Archer ran through his variations for four wickets but, not for the first time, the standout bowler was Adil Rashid. Sending down 10 overs for just 33 runs – and hit for just one boundary – the leg-spinner tickled Temba Bavuma’s outside edge with a beauty and removed Markram with a sharp return catch. In a parallel universe, this would augur well for the Ashes.View image in fullscreenWill Jacks hit 39 runs before losing his wicket to Nandre Burger.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlthough, as dreamily as Rashid bowled, there was no obvious need for South Africa to take him on. One of the hallmarks of Brook’s captaincy has been to pack the batting and winkle out 10 overs using part-time spin. Bethell did snuff out Brevis with his left-arm darts but, sending down five overs apiece, he and Jacks were taken for a combined 112 runs.Breetzke was among those to cash in, returning from a hamstring niggle to become the first man in ODI history to pass 50 in each of his first five innings. The right-hander unfurled some eye-catching shots, including one silky inside-out six off Bethell, only to be mugged by an Archer slower ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The youngster atoned at least, his late flurry of three fours and three sixes – plus a handy 32 from Corbin Bosch – leaving England needing to break a record at Lord’s.Their bid to do so faltered immediately, Jamie Smith pushing hard at an inswinger from Nandre Burger first ball for an edge behind – the first of three for the slippery left-armer. Ben Duckett also lacked fluency, penned in for a 33-ball 14 and bowled by Maharaj reverse sweeping.In came Bethell at 66 for two in the 13th over to continue a right-left combination with Root and finding some form at the end of a personally challenging summer. Taking 19 runs off an over from Maharaj, Bethell gave the innings momentum only to slash Bosch to backward point.When Root followed soon after – Maharaj reasserting himself – England’s chances hinged on one of Brook, Buttler or Jacks seeing it home. But the tourists kept plugging away, Muthusamy removing Brook for 33 via a leading edge and Burger shutting down Jacks and Brydon Carse.Much will be made of England’s balance, even if South Africa’s XI was set up much the same. The Proteas are a more developed and confident side, however, and Lord’s has proved inspirational for them this summer.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Other mooted sanctions include fines of up to 10% of a club’s revenue and being forced to sell up.The proposals for a new test for owners, directors and senior executives are critical to the regulator’s activities in a climate in which clubssuch as Morecambeand Sheffield Wednesdayhave experienced existential peril. Their intention is to assess the “honesty, integrity and financial soundness” of those currently or potentially running a club in the English professional game. They have been published for public consultation until 6 October, with the intention that the new regime is imposed as soon as possible. The government wants to fast-track the regulator’s start so that its powers are activated in the autumn.Among the most eye-catching elements is the prospect that in the most serious breaches of July’s act an owner could face criminal consequences. In the gravest scenario those could include imprisonment. Specifically, the destruction or disposal of information or documents required by the IFR is deemed a criminal offence; so are the provision of misleading information and obstructing the IFR from exercising its rights to enter business premises. Pursuit of criminal sanctions would be viewed as a last resort for when civil sanctions, such as financial punishments, are considered inadequate.The heaviest would lead to miscreants being fined between 8% and 10% of their club’s revenue from the previous financial year. The ability to levy sanctions on individuals, as well as organisations, is regarded as a significant pillar of the test.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It would also be able to consult law enforcement agencies and other regulatory bodies.Those behind the plans emphasise that they have been designed to promote sound investment rather than discourage those looking to put money into the game. “These powers will be used proportionately, in accordance with the IFR’s statutory duties, and with an understanding of the importance of owner investment and risk-taking in English football,” the statement said.Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their last World Cup qualifying victory was almost 12 years ago, a narrow success over the Faroe Islands, but this was anything but a straightforward win for Wales.By the end the chances were totting up, Craig Bellamy’s side clinging on with the Kazakhstan substitute Serikzhan Muzhikov cracking the bar with the final action, a 95th-minute free-kick. The visitors were ultimately grateful for Kieffer Moore’s first-half strike, which was sufficient to earn a victory that keeps alive their hopes of automatic qualification from Group J.Kazakhstan 0-1 Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – live reactionRead moreThechallenges of a 7,000-mile round triptraversing six time zones meant it was always going to be a game where any kind of win would do. Even more so given Wales’s only full training session came 24 hours before kick-off. As it happened, it was an unconvincing and sticky display.The most polishedWalesperformer was the 19-year-old debutant Dylan Lawlor, with the Cardiff centre-back assured in and out of possession. Relegation has bred opportunity in the capital and this was another milestone for Lawlor, who only made his Wales Under-21s debut in June.View image in fullscreenWales fans celebrate after the match, having travelled across six time zones to Almaty.Photograph: Pavel Mikheyev/ReutersThe goal stemmed from a free-kick won and taken by Harry Wilson. Liam Cullen flicked on Wilson’s slick left-foot cross and the goalkeeper Temirlan Anarbekov, on debut, could only parry the ball to the edge of the six-yard box, where Moore stabbed in.Bellamy recently said he was captivated by Wrexham’s journey to the Championship under their Hollywood owners and Moore, on his 50th cap, became the first Wrexham player to represent Wales since the defender Steve Evans in 2008, when they were in non-league.Wales had to ride waves of Kazakhstan pressure and there was clear relief when the referee, Alejandro Hernández, blew for full-time.Galymzhan Kenzhebek was Kazakhstan’s liveliest player and registered a hat-trick of near-misses, including rattling the bar himself via Karl Darlow’s fingertips at full stretch, before being withdrawn midway through the second half. It felt like a bizarre substitution given moments earlier Kenzhebek skipped past four Wales players and poked an effort just wide of a post but Islam Chesnokov, Kenzhebek’s replacement, also caused problems.Chesnokov’s neat back-heel allowed the overlapping wing-back Bagdat Kairov to send a low cross into the six-yard box, where Maksim Samorodov was waiting to equalise only for an alert Lawlor to intervene and hack clear. Lawlor, who has made just eight senior starts for the League One leaders, Cardiff, where he recently signed a new three-year contract, belted out the national anthem before kick-off and ably deputised for the injured Joe Rodon.“He was just so impressive and we needed him to be,” said the Wales manager. “You think: ‘How are we ever going to cope without Joe?’ We’ve gained a player from this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On paper people will look at Kazakhstan thinking we should dominate the game and score a couple of goals but it is never going to be easy.” Asked about Wales’s next qualifier, against the group favourites, Belgium, in Cardiff in October, the Tottenham defender added: “We came here and put ourselves in a position that it is now an important game.”Wales had few chances to double their advantage, aside from a tame Wilson strike, and instead they had to concentrate their focus at the other end in the final minutes. Chesnokov lashed a strike over the bar and the typically dependable Davies headed clear at the back post a Dastan Satpayev cross, conscious Kairov was lurking.Ali Aliyev, the Kazakhstan manager, slowly dragged his fingers down his cheeks after Muzhikov’s stoppage-time effort clinked the woodwork. “We had to dig in,” conceded Bellamy.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesKazakhstanmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Police have made 32 arrests and charged 21 people connection with incidents of disorder, which has included officers being assaulted.The district judge Christopher Williams also found Kebatu guilty of one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence.The trial concluded on Wednesday at Chelmsford magistrates court after hearings there and at Colchester magistrates court were told that Kebatu tried to kiss two girls on 7 July after one of them offered him a pizza. He also invited them to the Bell hotel, the judge heard.A 14-year-old boy who was friends with the girls said in a video interview with police that was played to the court on Wednesday that Kebatu asked them to “come to the Bell hotel to have babies, then we could go to Kenya with each other”.Kebatu’s advances were rejected and it was made clear to him that the girls were 14, the court heard.Kebatu sexually assaulted a woman a day later by putting his hand on her leg after she offered to help him with his CV, the court heard. The woman, who exercised her right to remain anonymous, told the court via video link that she was left shocked and uncomfortable after Kebatu touched her. She also said she had seen him touching one of the girls.The judge told Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on 29 June, that he could expect an immediate custodial sentence to be imposed when he returned to court on 23 September. “It’s just a question of how long any sentence is going to be,” he said.He asked that a report be prepared about Kebatu before sentencing, noting there was little known about him. Kebatu told the court he had worked as a teacher in Ethiopia.Essex police paid tribute to the victims and other witnesses after the verdict. The assistant chief constable Stuart Hooper said: “We’re acutely aware that this incident has attracted widespread public interest. We have always said that we treat and investigate every report made to us without fear or favour. We understand the strength of feeling in our community, but no crime should become an excuse for the disorder we have seen at times in Epping.”The deputy chief crown prosecutor with CPS East of England, Rebecca Mundy, said she recognised the incident had become “a cause of deep concern for the local community” and that prosecutors had worked carefully and impartially to bring the case to justice.Katie Lam, a Conservative shadow Home Office minister, said: “The crimes of this illegal migrant are shocking and heartbreaking and the victims have shown incredible bravery. This case shows the very real risks of housing illegal migrants in hotels and allowing them to roam around communities freely.“This must never be allowed to happen again. Every illegal migrant should be detained immediately and swiftly deported. Anything less leaves vulnerable people at risk, betrays public trust, and sends entirely the wrong message about how seriously Britain takes border security.”Kebatu had denied the charges. His barrister Molly Dyas said in her closing speech that he disputed “most of the alleged interaction with this group of children”.During cross-examination, she had asked one of the key witnesses if she had made up her account of the incident because she was angry that Kebatu was an asylum seeker. The woman in question rejected that assertion.The prosecutor, Stuart Cowen, who described Kebatu as a sexual predator, said the explanation he put forward at his trial was “so incredible that it lacks any credibility whatsoever”.Hours after the verdict, Epping Forest council announced that it had taken the decision to appeal against the overturning of a temporary high court ban on the current use of the hotel to house asylum seekers.More than 130 people are being allowed to remain at the property after three judges last Friday set aside a temporary injunction granted to the council.However, Epping Forest said it would instruct its legal team to proceed with an application to the supreme court for permission to appeal against the court of appeal ruling.A full high court hearing will also take place next month to discuss a permanent injunction for the Bell.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also shut 10 of its own bars, citing tough trading conditions. Watt’s co-founder, Martin Dickie, announced his own departure last month.On Thursday afternoon, BrewDog’s shareholders – who it calls “punks” – received an update outlining the company’s financial position.Sales growth was up by less than 1% to £357m, a marked slowdown for a brewer that has been noted for the meteoric growth it racked up as it took on – and often matched – large global beer corporations.While pre-tax losses narrowed from £59m last year to £36.6m, BrewDog still fell £34.5m into the red after tax. It also revealed that its largest shareholder, a private equity investor called TSG Consumer Partners, has agreed to lend it a further £20m. That is on top of high-interest loans that the brewer took out in 2022 and 2023 on an interest rate of up to 18%.The increase in debt helped push up BrewDog’s annual interest payments by £4m to £17.3m.In its statement, BrewDog played down the significance of stalling revenues and persistent pre-tax losses, pointing instead to its preferred “adjusted” profit before factors such as interest payments and tax. It said this earnings figure, of £7.5m, showed the company had “returned to profitability for the first time in several years”.James Taylor, who succeeded Watt as chief executive, said the company had “achieved our highest ever share of the UK beer market, selling the equivalent of 4.5 cans of beer every second in UK supermarkets”.Founded by Watt and Dickie in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, in 2007, the brand became popular during the 2010s as demand increased for craft beers. It now has breweries and pubs around the world, including 71 in the UK, of which 17 are in Scotland.Last month it was announced that BrewDog would close 10 bars across the UK, including its flagship pub in Aberdeen. Theother locations werein Dundee, Leeds, Brighton, Oxford, Sheffield, York and three in London.In 2021, former staff of BrewDogaccused the companyand Watt of creating a “culture of fear” in which workers were bullied and “treated like objects”. In an open letter that was shared on social media the company was accused of cutting corners on health and safety, espousing values it did not live by, and creating a “toxic” culture that left staff suffering from mental illness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it is a bummer that these podcasts with large audiences are spewing this old-school denier nonsense. It’s not helpful. In the US, people are in silos now and climate scientists can’t easily reach people who aren’t sure how climate change works. It’s not a healthy situation.”Last year, Tierney was part of a group that published an ambitious paperin the Science journalthat reconstructed a timeline of Earth’s temperature over the past 485m years. The research, which took two years to compile, was drawn from 150,000 data points, including fossil records and climate models.The study shows monumental shifts in the world’s climate over the eons, including periods that are far hotter than now, such as when an asteroid crashed to Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs around 66m years ago, and another era, about 250m years ago, when a massextinctionevent killed off more than 90% of all species on the planet.The current period of rapid global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation in just the last century, is shown on this vast timeline as a comparatively small upward tick at the end of the graph, following a span of relative planetary cooling that followed the demise of dinosaurs.Rogan has seized upon this temperature graph, as shown ina Washington Post article, to claim big swings in previous temperatures demonstrate concerns over current climate change are overblown.“There’s a lot of horseshit that’s involved in climate change, I’ve studied that,” Rogan told actor Mel Gibson on the Joe Rogan Experience in January. “The temperature on Earth is plummeting. Look at the drop at the end, that’s where we are. That’s the reality.”To agreement from Gibson – whose house burned down by fires in Los Angeles on the day the podcast was recorded, a disasterscientists saywas worsened by global heating – Rogan added that the world’s temperature has always fluctuated. “This idea that the whole thing is based on carbon emissions from humans is total bullshit, it’s not true,” he said.Since this conversation, Rogan has raised the topic of the temperature graph on five further episodes, including to his guest Bernie Sanders in June. “Essentially they found that we’re in a cooling period,” Rogan said to the US senator of the researchers’ work. “This was, like, a very inconvenient discovery. But they had to report the data and kudos to them for doing that.”Rogan’s repeated references to the Washington Post piece elides most of the actual article, which mentions the swift rate Earth is currently heating up and how this is being driven by human-caused emissions. Scientists areunequivocalthat the climate crisis is being caused entirely by the emission of greenhouse gases, at a rate not seen during human history.“It’s almost impressive how incorrect he’s able to be about an article he’s looking directly at,” said Rollie Willams, a climate science and policy expert who presentsClimate Town, a YouTube show that tracked Rogan’s mention of the graph.“It’s also an incredible example of how climate misinformation sneaks into extremely popular media and then gets absorbed into the brains of millions of Americans.”The world has heated up by about 1.2C (2.1F) since the industrial revolution but a crucial aspect of this change is its pace, Tierney pointed out. While the mass extinction event in the Permian period 250m years ago, ominouslycalled“the great dying”, saw Earth’s temperature jump by aboutd 10C, this unfolded over a span of around 50,000 years.The current surge in temperature has occurred in little more than a century, after humans enjoyed thousands of years of predictable climatic patterns to grow crops and settle near previously stable coastlines. The graph’s latest small upward line, in the context of hundreds of millions of years, represents a remarkable leap in global heat.“The temperature reconstruction is over millions of years. It’s not on a human timescale,” said Tierney of her work. “It’s all about the speed and we’ve never seen carbon dioxide and temperature rise as fast as now – even in big extinction events it was slower than this. We evolved in a cooler climate and now we are rapidly warming it up and putting life on this planet in danger. It’s scary.”Rogan is not the only high-profile podcaster or online streamer to distort climate science, with eight of the 10 most popular online shows in the US involved in spreading false or misleading climate information,according to Yale Climate Connections. These top-rated shows are dominated by rightwing figures such as Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro and often skew towards a young, male demographic.The audiences can be vast, too. Rogan, who has adeal with Spotifyand is the most popular of all, has more than 20m subscribers on hisYouTube channel.This is about 10 times more people than theprimetime viewershipof Fox News, a channel that has often faced criticism over its climate coverage, providing Rogan huge clout in dictating the only information many people hear about the climate crisis.“Ordinary folks don’t learn about climate change by reading science journals,” said Edward Maibach, an expert in climate communication at George Mason University. “They learn about it primarily by listening to what other people have to say about it, which includes social media influencers and podcasters. When those influencers don’t know what they’re talking about, everyone suffers.”More than a third of US adults aged under 30, and one in five adults overall, say they regularly get their news from social media influencers, polling last yearfound. Figures such as Rogan are particularly influential because of the parasocial relationship his audience forms, where many feel they know and trust him, Maibach said.“One would hope that people like Joe Rogan are self-aware enough to know what they know and what they don’t know, and to realize that helping to propagate misinformation and disinformation about our climate is extremely dangerous,” he said.The producer of the Joe Rogan Experience did not respond to a request for comment about Rogan’s mistaken fixation with the temperature graph. Tierney, the study’s co-author, said she would be willing to appear on the show to provide a more accurate explanation to its audience.“It’s dumb the way he’s interpreting this graph and if he wants to talk about it he should invite me onto the show instead of talking about it to Mel Gibson or Bernie Sanders,” said Tierney.“I think it’s safe to say Mel Gibson doesn’t know a whole lot about paleoclimate.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisJoe RogannewsShareReuse this content"

You have to go to school.” Greta retorted: “Why would I need an education if there is no future?”“If you get an education, you can affect the future,” replied the woman. “That’s what you’re supposed to do, you children and young people. For us old people it’s too late.”“It’s not too late,” said Greta. After a few more exchanges the woman walked away, looking dismayed.A younger woman stopped: “Hi. May I sit with you?”“Yeah,” said Greta.“I just wanted to say that what you are doing is so cool,” said the woman. “Do many people stop?”“So far today it’s been three,” replied Greta. They sat together. Then a young man, with his bike helmet still on, stopped and asked: “How long have you been sitting here?”Soon others too began to stop, read the pamphlet, and join in. All this is captured in the opening sequence of Nathan Grossman’s documentary I Am Greta. Within seven monthsa million people had joinedthe Fridays for Future school strike movement.The dynamics that start a social movement such as Fridays for Future are quite general. In a famous Ted talk,Derek Sivers narrates a videothat starts with a lone, topless man dancing wildly on a grassy slope at what looks like a festival. A bunch of other people are sat on the grass nearby, no doubt thinking: “Who is that crazy guy?”But then something happens: another man gets up and starts to join in the dance, imitating the moves. The first man immediately greets him as an equal, taking his hands, and they start dancing together.Now it is about them, not just him. As Sivers beautifully puts it, “that first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader”. The first follower shows everyone else how to join in. He immediately starts calling and gesticulating to his friends to come over. A second follower joins the dance, emulating the first follower, with wild exuberance. Three is a crowd and they start to draw attention. Two more people join in, and straight after that, three more. Then it snowballs.As Sivers puts it: “This is the tipping point. Now we’ve got a movement.” As more people join in, it gets less risky for the next person to join, because they won’t stand out or be ridiculed. Pretty soon the dynamics flip – even those who were reluctant to get up feel compelled to join in the dance, because they want to be part of the in-crowd and the new status quo.This is how a social movement can reach a tipping point: both Greta and the lone dancer successfully challenged social norms – of going to school rather than protesting, and of not making a spectacle of yourself in public. In Greta’s case she was trying to change another set of norms – of inaction on climate change. There is a social barrier to instigating change. It takes a particular kind of loner courage to be the first dancer that starts to move against the tide. That action must be public, and breaking established norms may be challenged, ridiculed, or simply ignored. In Greta’s case, she was vilified in parts of the media. But by setting a precedent, the first dancer invites others to join them and challenge the status quo.The first follower closes a reinforcing feedback loop and makes it easier for the next person to also break from norms and join in. Each subsequent person joining the movement makes it easier for the next person to join, and so on, creating an amplifying effect. If that amplification is strong enough, it can reach a tipping point. At a critical mass, the social incentives reverse, and change becomes self-propelling.At the start of a social movement those choosing to join in change their actions but not their views. They already agree with the values being expressed by those in the movement – they like dancing or they are convinced that climate change is an existential threat that politicians must take more seriously. It is just that beforehand they weren’t brave enough to break from the status quo until they saw others join in.At some point, however, a movement can start to tip the views of people previously indifferent or even opposed to the position taken by the movement. Abolishing the slave trade, votes for women, equal marriage and legalising abortion in Ireland are all examples of what beforehand seemed impossible and afterwards seemed inevitable.Later, we hear the self-congratulatory remarks from those we know once flatly opposed it: “Of course, I have always believed in the movement.” This is very human. We do not like to stand out from the crowd and when it changes, we change.And such change can go as deep as rewiring our worldview and beliefs. This is good news, because to avoid climate tipping points we need to transform the social world, and for some of us that will involve changing how we see the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As she put it: “One thing that I found very scary is tipping points, that once we reach tipping points, then there’s no going back. Then we start a chain reaction beyond our control.”Her response was “instead of worrying about how [the] future might turn out, you should try to change it while you still can”. Greta managed to trigger her own chain reaction by striking from school. With her first followers she triggered a social tipping point of escalating climate protest. But Greta and the many millions that have joined her are fighting for a much bigger tipping point.Greta’s aim was to trigger decisive political action to tackle climate change. If we look at what that change entails, it is profound as well as diverse. Ultimately it involves tipping societies from an unsustainable state to a sustainable one. Central to this is tipping an economy powered largely by fossil fuels into one that has been decarbonised. To achieve this overall tipping point will require a myriad of more specific tipping points. It demands a tipping point in social norms. For some there will be shifts in worldview. There need to be tipping points in the diffusion of technology. Tipping points in governance would help.For now, let’s crudely sketch the big picture. We can represent the situation as a current unsustainable, fossil-fuelled state of societies – the status quo – and an alternative sustainable state, with a barrier between them. That barrier exists for a multitude of reasons. We are to varying degrees locked in to existing systems, including existing habits, technologies, infrastructures and ways of thinking.While most of us just go along with the status quo and some like Greta actively oppose it, others are actively maintaining it. They tend to be those who benefit most from things staying as they are, and those who feel most threatened by change. These incumbents participate in feedback loops that maintain the status quo.For example, the fossil fuel industry buried its own studies of climate change and instead spread doubt about the science. It also actively lobbies governments for support. Governments provide subsidies and tax credits for fossil fuel extraction and use. Banks fund extractive industries. The fossil fuel industry in turn pays banks back with share dividends, and governments back with (mostly) content voters. All this helps keep the incumbent state stable.To get out of the incumbent, unsustainable state we need a fundamentally social tipping point, because it is people and their actions that either maintain the status quo or oppose it.For those who decide the existing system must change, there are complementary ways of trying to achieve that. We can work to weaken the damping feedback loops that maintain the status quo. Or we can work to strengthen the reinforcing feedback loops that can amplify change.Social movements, like the suffragettes or the climate protesters, are a particularly important way of tipping change. Many, if not all, of the great social changes in the past had social movements behind them. To achieve their political goals, social movements leverage the reinforcing feedback of escalating protest to increase political pressure on incumbents. By targeting and publicly opposing the incumbents, they tend to focus on weakening the damping feedback loops that maintain the status quo. For example, campaigning for divestment from fossil fuels.But we can also all be part of strengthening reinforcing feedback loops that amplify positive change. Just by adopting a lower-emission technology or behaviour (like eating less meat) we encourage others to join us. This is because of social contagion – the more people who adopt something, the more others they can influence to adopt it.With technologies there are extra amplifiers of increasing returns: the more of us who adopt a new technology, the better it will get (through learning-by-doing), the cheaper it will get (due to economies of scale), and the more other technologies will emerge that make it more useful. This is what is making solar PV panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles ever cheaper, better, and more accessible.Positive Tipping Points: How to Fix the Climate Crisis is published by Oxford University PressExplore more on these topicsEnvironmental activismGreta ThunbergClimate crisisextractsShareReuse this content"

Our neutrality is part of our value. In a world of strained trade relations, Lloyd’s licence network can be a safe harbour.”As well as announcing sweeping trade tariffs, Donald Trump has beenexpanding oil, gas and coalproduction, ordering companies to “drill, baby, drill” while ditching green energy programmes. Through his trade deals, he is seeking to impose the US energy shift on other countries,forcing the EU to buy more oil and gasfrom the US.In recent years, Lloyd’s warned of an increase in the frequency and severity of climate change-related weather disasters, ranging from the devastating California wildfires to huge floods in Texas this year. The corporationstarted divesting from coalin 2018.Tiernan’s predecessor Neal was criticised for being slow to act but ina lengthy report in 2020, Lloyd’s pledged to “start to phase out insurance cover for, and investments in, thermal coal-fired power plants, thermal coalmines, oil sands, or new Arctic energy exploration activities”.View image in fullscreenExtinction Rebellion protesters outside Lloyd’s of London last year. The group encourages insurers not to insure new carbon-related projects.Photograph: Guy Bell/RexIt stated that from 1 January 2022, Lloyd’s managing agents, who act on behalf of insurers, would be “asked to no longer provide new insurance coverage or investments in these activities”. However, Lloyd’sstopped short of mandating divestmentto its insurance members, saying it was up to companies to set their own strategy.While Tiernan’s position seems to mark a clear shift, a Lloyd’s spokesperson denied the market had changed its policy on underwriting energy. “Our aim is to support whatever energy mix individual governments determine is in their jurisdiction’s best interests while enabling managing agents to operate at the vanguard of new energy technologies,” they said. “For the market to run efficiently we must allow participants to make their decisions independently.”Tiernan said the world faced the same threats, namely major natural disasters, economic shocks and geopolitical instability. “What’s changing is the tempo – driven by new dynamics including climate change risk, the advent of AI, increasing social unrest and outsized liability awards, or ‘nuclear verdicts’,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is responsible for 18% of the reasonall rivers fail to meet good ecological and chemical standards.But unlike sewage pollution from overflows, pollution from highways runoff is not regulated or monitored by theEnvironment Agency, despite obligations for the regulator to address sources of river pollution, MPs on the environmental audit committee were told.There is not a single permit for a highways discharge in England, unlike water company sewage outflows, which are monitored and regulated by the agency.Jo Bradley, director of operations at Stormwater Shepherds, told MPs that runoff from the road network was toxic, carcinogenic and contained heavy metals, hydrocarbons and microplastics. Of the 25,000 outflows from roads, she told MPs National Highways had identified 126 as high risk, and said they would attempt to mitigate the toxic pollution from them by 2030.But Bradley said: “All 25,000 of these outflows are causing toxic pollution every time it rains. While sewage pollution attracts all the attention and coverage – with £56bn earmarked to address it, just a few million is invested into addressing pollution from these 25,000 road outfalls.“This pollution contains microplastics, hydrocarbons, toxic metals and chemicals. It is carcinogenic, it gets into the water system … but no one is measuring these harms. No one is interested.”The Cunliffe reviewinto the water sector does not significantly address the toxic pollution from road runoff, the committee heard. Bradley said it was important that this pollution was addressed in the white paper which would come from the review.The Guardian has mapped the 25,000road runoff sites which release a toxic cocktail of damaging chemicals into England’s rivers.Catherine Moncrieff, head of policy and engagement at the Chartered Institution of Environmental and Water Management, told MPs the problem was flying under the radar. “The problem of highway pollution is increasing, the issue is getting worse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It has led directly to patients being moved to intensive care or receiving drugs they needed, such as antibiotics, or benefiting from other vital interventions.It is named after Martha Mills,who died in 2021 at the age of 13from sepsis after a bicycle accident. A coroner found she would probably have survived if she had been moved to the intensive care unit at King’s College hospital in London when she began deteriorating. Martha would have been 18 on Thursday if she had lived.Martha’s rule became available in 143 acute hospitals in England last year. But it has also been implemented in the other 67 such sites, which means all 210 acute facilities are covered.It gives patients, their loved ones andNHSstaff the right to ask for a different medical team to examine the care being provided and recommend changes.NHS England’s national medical director, Prof Meghana Pandit, said it was having “a transformative impact” on how hospitals worked with patients and their families when their condition was worsening.Martha’s rule helplines in hospitals received 4,906 calls between last September and June from patients, relatives or staff who were worried about care. That led to 241 people receiving improvements to their care that may have saved their life.“It would be Martha’s 18th birthday today, another milestone she has missed as a result of the poor care and hospital errors that led to her unnecessary death,” said her parents, Merope Mills and Paul Laity, who persuaded ministers and NHS bosses to adopt the system of independent review.“We feel her absence every day. But at least Martha’s rule is already preventing many families from experiencing something similar.“The figures prove that lives are saved when patients and families are given power to act on their suspicions when they feel doctors might have got it wrong and their voice isn’t being heard.”They welcomed the adoption of the system named after their daughter by all 210 acute sites in England. “We look forward to a time when every patient in the UK knows about the initiative and has easy access to it,” they added.Merope Millstold BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the scheme had “highlighted the need for a different, more equal kind of doctor patient relationship”.She said: “So many people have contacted me to say that they have felt scared or powerless when they’re in hospital. It’s a real cultural problem, and I think what Martha’s rule does is it acts as a safety net, a way to formally or legitimately challenge clinical decisions if you’re worried that they’ve got it wrong, and I’m afraid they do get it wrong and they would be the first to admit that.”Mills said she would like to see the rule extended to cover maternity services and to other NHS services outside England.“I’ve had calls from people in Scotland and Wales saying, ‘Well, why don’t we have this?’ I think that’s a pretty fair point,” she added. “So this is sort of me making a direct appeal to the leaders of NHS Scotland and Wales and NHS Northern Ireland to say they should kind of step up and make that change.“The data’s there, the evidence is there, even meticulously researched posters and communication materials is available, and it’s time for everyone around the country to have that access.”Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said Martha’s parents’ “tireless campaigning has created a lasting legacy that is already having a potentially life-saving impact across England”.Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said the fact that every acute hospital in England now offered Martha’s rule was “a landmark moment for patient safety”.Almost three-quarters of the 4,096 calls came from parents seeking help, NHS England data showed.Walsall Manor hospital rolled out Martha’s rule last year across its services for adults andrecently extended it to services for children.Amy Blakemore, a matron in its sepsis and outreach response team, said that showed families and carers “are a vital part of the care and treatment decisions that are made for the children and young people in our hospital”.“Any concerns in relation to their child’s deteriorating condition that they feel are not being listened to can initiate Martha’s rule and they can get an independent review,” she said.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSHealthEnglandFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

Expectations for jobs growth weakened by 0.3 percentage points to 0.2%.Bank chief warns against ‘exaggerating’ rise in UK borrowing costsRead moreLabour has come under pressure over its economic management as the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, prepares to hold a late November budget, amid speculation that further tax increases could be required to cover a multibillion-pound shortfall in the public finances.Business leaders have warned Reeves that her first autumn budget measure to increase employer national insurance contributions (NICs) by £25bn from April this year has forced them to cut jobs and raise prices.Almost half of the 2,130 companies surveyed by the Bank said they were cutting the number of employees as a result of the change.The monthly Decision Maker Panel survey, which is closely monitored by Threadneedle Street’s interest rate-setters, also showed 66% of firms reported lowering profit margins as a result of the change. As many as 34% raised prices, while 20% said they were paying lower wages than they otherwise would have done.However, the Bank said fewer firms were reporting price increases, lower employment or lower wages in response to the employer NICs changes than it had expected in the three months to January, before the changes were implemented.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Financial markets anticipate the Bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged at 4%.“Stubborn wage and price pressures should keep the MPC [monetary policy committee] cautious, but falling employment is a building risk,” said Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.Reeves acknowledged on Wednesday that the UK economy was “not working well enough for working people” as sheannounced the date of her second budgetas 26 November.The later than usual date is likely to lead to weeks of speculation about how the Treasury will raise additional revenue, but the chancellor hopes to use the time to set out new pro-growth reforms.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsBank of EnglandEconomic policyTax and spendingRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

It had been nominated by a number of members of the public to be part of the institution’s Dear Library exhibition.In the wake of “polarising” debates over trans rights, and after concerns were raised by the library’s LGBT+ staff network, it said it had decided not to include the book in the exhibition although it did still have the text in its reading rooms.After an outcry over that decision, however, the library has said it will now include it.“Concerned about the effect of the polarising public discourse around the subject matter, the library made the curatorial decision not to include the book in this exhibition,” it said in a statement on Thursday. “The library has since been subject to scrutiny regarding the decision.”The U-turn comes after talks on Wednesday between the national librarian, Amina Shah; the chair of the National Library of Scotland board, Drummond Bone; and the book’s editors, Susan Dalgety and Lucy Hunter Blackburn.Shah and Bone apologised for not consulting the editors, the library said, adding that it had had further conversations with staff “and other exhibition stakeholders”.Dalgety and Blackburn said: “On behalf of the women who contributed to the book, the people who nominated the book, and all our readers, we are delighted that The Women Who Wouldn’t Wheesht is now taking its rightful place in the Dear Library exhibition.“We hope this is a turning point in public discourse in Scotland, particularly around sex and gender identity, but also other topics.“We will not progress as a nation unless we are able to celebrate our pluralist society and discuss ideas and beliefs in a rational way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With that work concluding, and a new chapter starting for the institute, now is the right time for new leadership and I am excited about what it will achieve.”One source familiar with the internal debate at ATI said Innes’s departure indicated that Kyle’s letter had been taken seriously. However, the source added that changes at board level would be needed as well if ATI was to focus fully on defence and national security. The reply letter to Kyle from the ATI chair, Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, said it would focus on defence and national security but would still work on environment and health.An ATI staff member, who said they had consulted on a range of concerns held by colleagues, said the resignation of Innes indicated governance at the institute was not working and that its leadership “needed to be held to account”. Many employees still want the institute to address “societal challenges” as well as focus on defence and security, said the staff member.Gurr thanked Innes, who will remain in her post until later this year, for focusing on “delivering real-world impact in priority areas for the UK”.‘Shut it down and start again’: staff disquiet as Alan Turing Institute faces identity crisisRead moreATI has been beset by internal strife since last year as staff protested against changes, culminating in a group of employeesfiling a whistleblower complaintto the Charity Commission last month. Citing references to funding in Kyle’s letter, they said they feared £100m of government backing may be withdrawn, which “could lead to the institute’s collapse”. ATI is a registered charity but relies on the government for most of its funding.The institute, which employs 440 people, had been undergoing a transformation programme before Kyle’s intervention, labelled Turing 2.0, in which it would focus on three key areas: health, the environment and defence and security. The overhaul has caused staff upheaval, with employeestelling the boardlast year that ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy”.A redundancy process is also under way at the institute, which recently notified about 50 staff that their jobs were at risk. ATI has dropped projects related to online safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality.ATI, named after the British mathematician widely considered the father of modern computing, was founded in 2015 as a national institute for data science before adding AI to its remit in 2017.Its goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as drive an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, University College London and Warwick, with its research work including teaming up with the Met Office toimprove weather forecasting, creatingcardiac “digital twins”to study heart disease, andimproving air traffic control.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was not immediately clear how much damage there was.A 5.5 magnitude aftershock struck on Tuesday, causing panic and interrupting rescue efforts as more roads were cut off by rockfall.Hamdullah Fitrat, a Taliban spokesperson, confirmed on Thursday that the death toll from Sunday’s magnitude 6.0 earthquake had risen to 2,205 – up from previous estimates of 1,400 and making it one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the country in decades.It hit the mountainous and remote eastern part of the country around midnight on Sunday, levelling entire villages where people were trapped under rubble.Most of the casualties were in Kunar province, where many houses are built from wood and mud bricks, making them highly vulnerable to earth tremors.Rescuers have managed to reach villages that had been completely cut off by the disaster and bodies continued to be pulled from debris on Thursday.About 98% of the buildings in Kunar were damaged or destroyed, according to an assessment from the charity, Islamic Relief.The rough and mountainous terrain has been hindering relief efforts. Taliban authorities have deployed helicopters and airdropped army commandos to help locate and rescue survivors. Aid workers reported walking for hours to reach villages cut off by landslides and rockfall.Resident Muhammad Israel said the quake unleashed a landslide that buried his home, livestock and belongings in Kunar.“All the rocks came down from the mountain,” he said. “I barely got my children out of there. The earthquake jolts are still happening. It is impossible to live there.”He was staying at a UN medical camp in Nurgal, one of the worst-affected areas. “The situation is also bad for us here, we don’t have shelter and are living under open skies,” he added.Rescue and relief efforts have been hampered by a lack of international aid funding and resources flowing into the country. Since the Taliban seized back power in 2021 and began imposing hardline religious laws, making it difficult for NGOs and aid groups to function, there has been a steep drop in support.Aid agencies said they were urgently in need of staff and supplies to tend to the injured and to house tens of thousands who have been left homeless and without access to food or water. About 84,000 people have been affected so far.The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had fewer than 450 staff inAfghanistan, whereas it had 1,100 in 2023 when the last major quake struck the country. The council has only one warehouse and no emergency stock.“We will need to purchase items once we get the funding but this will take potentially weeks and people are in need now,” said Maisam Shafiey, a communications and advocacy adviser for the council in Afghanistan.“We have only $100,000 [£75,000] available to support emergency response efforts. This leaves an immediate funding gap of $1.9m.”Shamshair Khan, a doctor tending to the injured at the UN camp in Nurgal, said supplies were already running out.“Neither these medicines are enough nor these services,” he said. “These people need more medicine and tents. They need food and clean drinking water. They need more aid. These people are in great pain.”The earthquakes came with Afghanistan already suffering from drought and a severe economic crisis. The withdrawal of USAid funding, after cuts by the Trump administration earlier this year, resulted in the closure of many hospitals and medical clinics.The pressures on the country have been exacerbated by the forced return of more than 2 million Afghans from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, many of whom have nowhere to live or work.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The city’s mayor has also asked Carris, the municipal public transport company that operates the service, to investigate.On Thursday evening the public prosecutor said five Portuguese people, two Koreans and a Swiss national were among those killed when one of the funicular’s two cars derailed and crashed into a building. The injured include Portuguese people as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from Canada, Cape Verde, France, Italy, Morocco, South Korea and Switzerland.Carris said one of its workers, a brake operator, died in the crash.LocatorThe injured people, five of whom were seriously hurt, were being treated in several hospitals in the Lisbon region. One of the most badly injured victims died in hospital overnight, raising the initial death toll from 15 to 16.Earlier figures from the civil protection agency had suggested 17 people were killed, but the toll was corrected on Thursday afternoon.Teams of pathologists from the national forensics institute worked through the night on postmortems, officials said. The Portuguese authorities suspended Lisbon’s other funiculars for safety checks after the derailment.Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Montenegro called the crash a “tragic accident that transcends borders and a pain that knows no nationality”, and he promised a quick investigation to establish what had gone wrong.View image in fullscreenPolice officers inspect the site.Photograph: Armando França/AP“The competent authorities will swiftly carry out the necessary investigations to determine the cause of this tragic accident,” he said. “We will determine all responsibilities with a sense of respect for all those who suffered and are suffering the effects of this accident.”The two vehicles on the funicular railway, known as the Elevador da Glória, go up and down a steep hill in central Lisbon in tandem, with one going the opposite way to the other.The leader of the Fectrans union, Manuel Leal, told local TV that workers had complained that problems with the tension of the cable that hauls the carriages had made braking difficult, but that it was too early to say if that was the cause of the crash.1:22Aerial footage shows wreckage of Lisbon funicular crash – videoFootage showed the wreckage of the yellow-and-white car lying on its side in the narrow street it ran along. Its sides and top were crumpled and it appeared to have crashed into a building where the road bends. Parts of the vehicle, made mostly of metal, were crushed.Witnesses told local media that the streetcar careened down the hill, apparently out of control. “It hit the building with brutal force and fell apart like a cardboard box,” Teresa d’Avó told the TV channel SIC.Another witness, Bruno Pereira,told CNN Portugalthat the car at the bottom of the hill had suddenly jerked off the track and on to the pavement, just before the other one came hurtling down “and struck the walls like a rock”.View image in fullscreenPolice officers guard the area.Photograph: Armando França/AP“The other tram – which counterbalances this one – arrived, completely out of control, crashing into the walls, people screaming. It hit the last time at the curve between Calçada da Glória and Rua da Glória and stopped with a loud crash,” he said.“There was panic. We all ran, everyone there. Some people tried to pull people out from under the tram … There were cobblestones everywhere, and the metal grooves, on which the car ran, were all popped out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that is possible if we’re disciplined,” he said, adding that there would be no cuts to healthcare spending, education transfers or transfers to individuals.In remarks critical of his predecessor,Justin Trudeau, Carney said the rate of government spending was too high and outpaced the growth of Canada’s economy – a view shared among senior cabinet ministers who also held top-level posts under the previous prime minister.“Will there be tough choices to make? Definitely. Is the nation ready? I would say yes. I mean, Canadians have elected us to do things differently,” the finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, said on Thursday of the “leaner” federal workforce he and Carney envisioned.Crown Royal dethroned in Canada as whisky company shifts some operations to USRead more“We said we’re going to spend less so we can invest more. And you know, people understand that. My mother understands that.”At the same time, Carney has promised a significant increase in defence spending and faster development of major infrastructure projects – both of which will require billions in government spending. In June, Carney said Canada would reachNato’s 2% military expenditure target this fiscal year, five years ahead of his previously announced schedule.“One of the reasons that the Liberals have become known as the ‘natural governing part of Canada’ is because they tend to shift their policies toward wherever the voters are going and have less of an ideological core than a right-leaning party like the Conservatives or the left-leaning party like the New Democrats,” said Elizabeth McCallion, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “Their main capability is being able to sit across that centre line to wherever the voters are most interested, and capturing those votes and enough votes to get them seats.”McCallion said the recent focus on austerity and the sharp departure from Trudeau’s spending on progressive programs “is not surprising” because the party “acts like a chameleon” to capitalize on what voters seem to want in the moment.Those policy shifts have produced challenges for Carney, however.Running April’s federal election on an elbows-up policy that vowed to fend off the threat fromDonald Trump, Carney has been forced to contend with the reality that the American and Canadian economies are deeply enmeshed.“There’s a dichotomy within his image of this guy who’s going to fight for Canada versus someone who won’t take an inflammatory situation and make things worse,” she said. “Carney is trying to walk this fine line between someone who will fight, which is what Canadians wanted, and then being the guy who’s not going to, you know, have inflammatory policies and make things worse by fighting back too hard.”In August, Carney announced his government would remove a handful of retaliatory tariffs in a sign of goodwill towards the US as the two sides worked to finalize a trade deal.Jean-Marc Léger, a prominent Canadian pollster, was invited by the Liberals to speak with ministers and told reporters that tariffs had slipped in importance among Canadians.“Last year, they were the No 1 issue and that’s one of the reasons this government was elected,” Léger said. “Today, it’s changed. Now, they only rank fourth.”Léger said the economy was a central issue among voters and that Carney’s team were trying to make it the “centre” of their government.As well as attempting to reconcile apparently contradictory promises to save and spend, Carney also seems to be seeking to strike a balance in his relations with Trump,whose threats to Canadian sovereignty defined the prime minister’s election.Eyebrows were raised when Carney invited Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a rightwing thinktank with close ties to the White House, to address the ministerial meeting. The Heritage Foundation was a key architect ofProject 2025, a proposal that envisioned an ultra-conservative reshaping of the US federal government.Roberts cancelled his appearance, but not before the invitation prompted controversy within the Liberals.“It’s an interesting strategy to kind of invite the opponent into your fold, and try and figure them out a little better,” said McCallion. “Because when it comes to figuring out what the White House wants, increasingly it feels difficult to figure out where the goalposts are. Maybe talking to the Project 2025 team will help with understanding of what is a real ask and what is a distraction?”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyTrump tariffsEconomic policyEconomicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

As majority leader, McConnell maneuvered to deny Barack Obama a rightful supreme court pick, and rushed to give Trump another in the final weeks of his first term in 2020. It made McConnell the architect of the current ultraconservative 6-3 majority on a panel that critics say has been overly loyal to Trump, not least last year’s astonishing ruling giving himimmunity for criminal acts.In the interview, McConnell said he had been focusing on “defense and foreign policy” in the months since returning to the Senate’s back benches, and had become worried about the direction he believed Trump’s “make America great again” (Maga) trade policies were leading the world.“I think this is the most dangerous period since before world war two. There’s certain similarities right now to the 30s,” he said.“[Then president] Herbert Hoover signed theSmoot-Hawley tariff billin 1930, widely believed by historians and economists to have taken the depression worldwide. Those who were totally anxious to stay out of all of what was going on in Europe were called ‘America First’. Sound familiar?“So what do we have today? North Korea, China, Russia, Iran and Iran’s proxies. They’re very different kinds of countries, but they have one thing in common: They hate us.”The interview was conducted before this week’sgathering in Beijingof world leaders largely hostile to the US, a meeting of authoritarians including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un that some analysts see as an unprecedentedredrawing of the global balance of power.McConnell, however, believes the US should already have been readying itself to meet the challenges posed by the rise of autocrats in other nations, but had not done so. He cited, indirectly, Trump’s failure to handle effectively Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war, now well into its fourth year, on Nato’s border.“When you talk about preparedness, we’re not prepared like we should be,” he said.“With regard to Ukraine, what we need to do is avoid the headline at the end of the war, ‘Russia wins, America loses.’ It has huge worldwide implications.”But he said he also saw financial benefits for the US incommitting more than $130bnin support for Ukraine’s military defense and humanitarian aid, whileTrump has flip-flopped on the issue.“For those who are concerned about the money, I think it’s important to remember that about half of the money was spent in this country, including in Kentucky, [with] 38 states modernizing our own industrial bases,” McConnell said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the Herald-Leader interview, McConnell rejected the opportunity to fire back.“My own view about the leader job, whether you’re the president or the leader of one of the parties, is the Ronald Reagan quote that I thought made the most sense. He had what he called the 11th commandment: ‘Do not speak ill of another Republican,’” he said.Yet McConnell did appear sensitive to a suggestion he was standing down because he had grown unpopular in Kentucky, amplified by thehostility of Nate Morris, the Republican businessman and Trump ultra-loyalist tipped to succeed him as senator. “I’m a Trump guy, not a McConnell boy,” Morris has said.McConnell said his record spoke for him. “These suggestions about who’s popular and who isn’t irritate the hell out of me, because when you get into the leadership position, you get beat up,” he said.“How do you judge popularity? Seven victories in Kentucky, nine victories in the [Senate Republican] conference.”Asked what he thought his legacy would be, McConnell said he was most proud of the2004 Kentucky tobacco buyout, which paid the state’s farmers to abandon their crops. “At the federal level it would be the courts,” he added.He declined an invitation to say whether he thought the US was in a better position now than before the Trump era. “I’m not sure enough time has passed to start evaluating who made a difference and who didn’t,” he said.But he added he had “thought a good bit” about whether people would think he had. “I would like everybody to be able to say, you know, I actually had an impact in a positive way on the country.”Explore more on these topicsMitch McConnellDonald TrumpTrump administrationTrump tariffsUS SenateUS CongressRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

Short Cuts (1993)To make a list of Lily Tomlin’s best performances, you run the risk of simply listing a bunch ofRobert Altmanfilms (they made four together; in The Player she just has a cameo). In the sprawling Short Cuts, even though she has a pivotal role – as the waitress involved in the accident from which the whole film hangs – Tomlin’s good-natured, moral performance has a habit of getting lost in the din of actors seeking to make their mark, only really coming to the fore after a few rewatches.9. The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981)View image in fullscreenSlyly feminist … Tomlin in The Incredible Shrinking Woman.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWritten by Tomlin’s wife Jane Wagner, this is a parody of 1957’s The Incredible Shrinking Man, in which Tomlin plays both the titular shrinking woman and her neighbour. While the film didn’t enjoy the kindest reception, subsequent generations have been able to see what its slightly muddled execution obscured: that this is a slyly feminist work about a woman buckling under the pressures of untrammelled consumerism.8. A Prairie Home Companion (2006)View image in fullscreenTime of her life … Tomlin with Garrison Keillor, Meryl Streep and Lindsay Lohan in A Prairie Home Companion.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyFor Altman’s final film, Tomlin found herself paired withMeryl Streep. They play Wisconsin sisters with an old-timey country music act. Tomlin’s approach to the film, she has revealed, involved impishly trying to throw Streep off her game wherever possible – and thereby having the time of her life. Witness, for instance, the moment where she interrupts Streep’s folksy introduction to the song My Minnesota Home by turning around and threatening to break the necks of everyone in the band.7. I Heart Huckabees (2004)Even if you haven’t seen David O Russell’s philosophical comedy, there’s a very strong chance that you will have seen its behind-the-scenes footage, in which Russell berates an unimpressed Tomlin in front of the crew. As you might expect from such a chaotic production, the final film is a bit of a mess, tonally and narratively all over the place. Nevertheless, it manages to showcase a range of terrific performances. Tomlin’s – as an existential detective who specialises in espousing transcendental interconnectedness – holds the whole thing together.6. Grandma (2015)Paul Weitz has become one of Tomlin’s most trusted collaborators in recent years, and this film – featuring her first leading film role in 27 years – feels tailor-made for her. Tomlin plays a poet mourning the death of her partner, who suddenly finds direction when her 18-year-old granddaughter (Julia Garner) asks her to scrabble together some money for an abortion. It’s a situation that allows Tomlin to play to every strength. She’s funny and short-tempered, and rightfully received a Golden Globes nod for the trouble.5. The Late Show (1977)View image in fullscreenPlayed to the hilt … Art Carney and Tomlin in The Late Show.Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy“The nicest, warmest, funniest and most touching movie you’ll ever see about blackmail, mystery and murder,” reads the poster for this hidden gem. Art Carney plays a private detective whose best years are behind him. Tomlin plays a woman with a missing cat who leads him into an ever-deepening conspiracy. What’s astonishing about this film is that all its contrasting tones are played to the hilt. As a thriller, it’s thrilling. As a drama, it’s tight as it comes. But, thanks mainly to Tomlin’s performance, you could easily confuse it for a comedy.4. Tea With Mussolini (1999)View image in fullscreenCutting through the stuffiness … Cher and Tomlin in Tea With Mussolini.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyFranco Zeffirelli’s semi-autobiographical drama about an Italian boy surrounded by British and American women during the second world war boasts a stellar cast. Maggie Smith is obstinate and dismissive. Judi Dench emotes like never before. Cher sings. But it’s difficult not to be drawn to Tomlin’s Georgie Rockwell, an archaeologist whose presence single-handedly cuts through much of the film’s innate stuffiness.3. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)In the comic book pantheon, Peter Parker’s Aunt May is often a thankless role, the doddery old do-gooder left behind after the death of her husband. Tomlin’s version, in the Oscar-winning animated film, was anything but. Halfway through the movie, she effectively becomes Miles Morales’s Q, unleashing a world of cutting-edge technology on the young hero to vault him towards the finishing line. And in a series filled with tremendous vocal performances, her deadpan “Oh great, it’s Liv,” upon seeing Kathryn Hahn’s Doc Ock runs away with the film.2. Nashville (1975)View image in fullscreenSteals the show … Tomlin with Keith Carradine in Nashville.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyThe ambition of Robert Altman’s vision here is impressive. An acid temperature check on the status of America in the 1970s, Nashville stars everyone – Ned Beatty, Jeff Goldblum, Shelley Duvall, Scott Glenn – and contains a full hour of songs. Tomlin plays a gospel singer with two deaf children, and steals the show. The stretch where she falls for Keith Carradine, only to leave with her dignity intact, is especially beautifully observed. Plus, she co-wrote one of the songs.1. 9 to 5 (1980)View image in fullscreenStroke of genius … Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda in 9 to 5.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe story goes that Jane Fonda settled on her co-stars for this seminal workplace comedy during a drive back from the theatre. She had been to see a Lily Tomlin play andDolly Partonwas on the radio. Whatever the reason, the casting was alchemic. And Tomlin’s performance as a long serving employee continually passed over for promotion represents its raging black heart. Not only was the film a stroke of genius, part of Fonda’s scheme to drip-feed serious issues as entertainingly as possible, but it kickstarted a double act with Tomlin that has lasted 45 years and counting.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedLily TomlinDolly PartonJane FondaRobert AltmanMeryl StreepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So much has happened in the intervening period that it’s easy to forget that, initially, the record received amixed response. There was praise for its expansive and experimental approach: songs built on rhythms by Brian Eno were handed over to a wide selection of producers to tinker with, then Byrne compiled the finished product. Part of a larger multimedia project called Reasons to Be Cheerful, it attempted to engender a spirit of positivity, but there were complaints that this amounted to a blithe abdication of responsibility amid the first Trump presidency. Respectful long-service-medal reviews coexisted with angry fulminating over the completeabsence of female contributors.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Who Is the Sky?Photograph: Matador Records/PAA mixed response was business as usual as far as Byrne’s post-Talking Heads career is concerned. He’s pursued an idiosyncratic path – diversions into Latin American music, opera and trip-hop, collaborations with dance producers and St Vincent – but never with results that achieved sufficient acclaim or commercial success to overshadow his former band. But then, something weird happened. The ensuing American Utopialive shows, which used cutting-edge technology and choreography to demolish the conventions of a rock show, attracted deserved hyperventilating praise. A tour that began playing modest theatres wound up filling arenas, spawning a Broadway show, two live albums – one named after a critic’s breathless assertion that it was The Best Live Show of All Time – and aSpike Lee-directed movie.So Byrne arrives at Who Is the Sky? with his stock higher than at any point in the last 35 years. It abandons American Utopia’s patchwork approach for a more straightforward form of collaboration, the whole album recorded with Brooklyn’s 12-piece Ghost Train Orchestra and Harry Styles producer Kid Harpoon. But its raison d’être remains essentially the same: more primary-coloured musical optimism, to which end it variously employs Mariachi-style brass (What Is the Reason for It?), sweeping 40s-Hollywood-musical strings (A Door Called No), rhythms that join the dots between Cuban clave and George Michael’s Faith (Don’t Be Like That) and an off-kilter, vocoder-bedecked take on the sumptuous soul of former Byrne collaborator Thom Bell on I’m an Outsider.David Byrne: What Is the Reason for It? ft Hayley Williams – videoThus far, 2025 has proved so unremittingly grim that it makes 2018 look like a lost sunlit nirvana: you can understand why Byrne thinks the world needs positivity and uplift, and Who Is the Sky? frequently sounds fantastic. The arrangements are superb, particularly when driven by the woody thwack of double bass. The songs are often melodically strong. The climax ofEverybody Laughs, with the voices of Byrne and St Vincent belting out over a marimba-speckled backdrop, is suitably joyous, as are the key shifts in closer The Truth. When We Are Singing’s blend of an oddly (and one suspects unwittingly) Oasis-esque guitar line with a chugging funk rhythm really works, although it’s debatable whether it strictly needed the sound of Byrne’s miaowing extempore vocals.The sound of Byrne mewing like a cat highlights the album’s major drawback. The lyrical tone tends to jokiness, which is fine when the jokes are funny. Moisturizing Thing concerns an anti-ageing cream that works so well, it leaves the protagonist looking like a three-year-old, plagued by people talking as if he’s a toddler and constant demands for ID in bars. Or when they carry a certain potent undertow: the man singing an impassioned love song to his flat on My Apartment Is My Friend could easily be an isolated shut-in; the character bamboozled by his partner’s knowledge and understanding of films, literature and human nature inShe Explains Things to Meseems suggestive of Byrne’s self-diagnosed autism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Similarly, the tone of optimism can seem too pat and Pollyanna-ish without a hint of darkness. To the latter end, you could hear The Truth as a paean to love or an acknowledgment that the titular concept seems increasingly malleable in a world of disinformation and manipulation: “The truth cannot hurt me, I know what I know.” When We Are Singing at least acknowledges the pallid state of things – “we’ve got one foot in the pearly gates and one foot in the flames” – while it’s hymning music’s transportive power.It’s hard not to have mixed feelings about Who Is the Sky?: business as usual. But perhaps it’s worth keeping American Utopia in mind. Byrne has suggested his forthcoming tour will blend “visual art, storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”.

Insouciant and party-centric as her image may be, the pop star born Charlotte Aitchison is a sharp student of pop culture; she knows the audience demand for pop stars’ constant reinvention. The next career phase, it seems, is acting, with no less prodigiousness than music; the 33-year-old has seven films in the pipeline as a supporting or lead actor.Charli is neither the full star nor the anchor of Erupcja (Eruption), directed by Pete Ohs, but she will inevitably be the reason most English speakers hear of it. Filmed over a few weeks in Warsaw, Poland, in August 2024, in the heat of Brat summer, Erupcja seems, on paper, like a sensible step for a pop star making her first foray into movies. Ohs is an unconventional, independent film-maker, who has dabbled in different genres – supernatural horror, sci-fi – and films chronologically, writing collaboratively as he goes. Charli spent the better part of a decade bridging pop music’s underground and mainstream. Slight, contained, relatively undemanding of its actors or its audience, it’s a safe trial run.Indeed, at a modest 71 minutes, Erupcja has the feel of a demo – loosely sketched, a little unpolished, potential proof of concept for what’s to come. With her distinctive frizzy hair and droll English accent, Charli hardly disappears into Bethany, a Londoner visiting with her devoted boyfriend Rob (Will Madden), and who is very much in the Bratosphere – cool, a little bitchy, largely inexpressive behind sunglasses, party-focused. The curious will have to wait: Charli reveals little playing her, either extending her pop persona or, in more demanding moments, operating with the over-precision of a diligent student. Ohs often films her from behind, shadowed by a stairwell, out of focus, either shirking or subverting the expected attention, depending on your view.For a movie named Eruption – so called because a volcano supposedly erupts whenever Bethany and her teenage friend Nel (Lena Góra, easily the best of the cast), reconnect; this time, it’s Etna – there is curiously little expression to be found. The agony and ecstasy in Nel and Bethany’s past friendship is implied not by the actors, feeling their way through dialogue remarkably if realistically heavy on logistics, but narration provided by an omniscient, adult male voice. His irreverent details fall, like many song lyrics, into the murky area in between profoundly simple and just simple, actually good and sounding good. (“Sometimes she listens to music,” he says of Nel at her favorite place to sit alone in the city. “Sometimes she does not.”) Rob wants to propose to Bethany, who treats him coldly. All of Erupcja, in fact, runs cold – icy silences, restrained emotions, freighted looks. Even Warsaw, with its bright slashes of graffiti over drab concrete, feels chilly, though Ohs frames it beautifully. (Zofia Chlebowska served as a Polish cultural consultant and translator.)Unfortunately, so does the central friendship, which supposedly provokes a mutual self-destructive streak. (Producer Jeremy O’Harris also pops in as Claude, a stereotypically insufferable expat artist whose house party milieu serves as Bethany’s getaway car.) A whirring, staccato montage of Bethany and Nel at a Warsaw club evokes the blurry thrills of a night out with an old friend, but leaves the evidence of their charged bond in tantalizing shards. We are often told of how they talk – about reality shows, about poetry, about themselves – but denied the pleasure of seeing it.We’re left, then, with the sketches of characters – one lonely and recessive, the other wildly self-centered. The initially alluring casualness of Ohs’s project fades quickly into a mildly irksome shallowness – lots of unearned and unconvincing staring, docile conversations, should-be evocative images that do not evoke. One wishes that Ohs or his actors, Charli included, tapped a little more into a suggested undercurrent of intense, simmering emotion, particularly for two friends with an allegedly combustible bond. But maybe that’s for next time; this was just practice.Erupcja is screening at theToronto film festivaland will be released at a later dateExplore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025First look reviewDrama filmsCharli xcxToronto film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But might it just be sowing the seeds of what’s to come?Stuart HeritageThu 4 Sep 2025 05.54 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 05.55 EDTShareSo far, South Park’s 27th season has had one clear goal: to provoke Donald Trump into a tantrum. Every episode has managed to pick on a new and different facet of his authoritarian rule – the silencing of his media critics, his use of Ice agents as an intimidation tactic – while simultaneously telling everyone what a tiny penis he has.So the anticipation levels were off the charts for this week’s episode, entitled Wok Is Dead, which promised to take on Trump’s tariff policy. And in fairness it did do this, but only in a couple of scenes where a Chinese character with an uncomfortablyMickey Rooney-esqueaccent complained about them. The rest of the episode just settled for a bunch of jokes aboutLabubu dolls, as well as calling Donald Trump “Satan” as many times as it feasibly could.For the most part, Wok Is Dead found itself split in two. The bulk of the episode was taken up with a very traditional South Park storyline about a cultural fad pushed to extremes. Everyone at South Park Elementary has become obsessed with Labubu dolls, a line of vaguely creepy collectible plush dolls sold in mystery boxes. In real life, the Labubu craze has been ramped up to the level of fidget spinners and loom bands before them, prompting the market to be flooded with a rush of carelessly manufactured fakes that potentiallypose a danger to children.In the world of South Park, however, the dolls prompt satanic rituals, with children sacrificing poultry and summoning plagues in their desire to find ever-rarer dolls, much to the dismay of Jesus, who is serving as the school counsellor. And that’s about it for that particular storyline. It’s South Park by numbers: find something newly popular, mock it for 20 minutes, and then go home.But that isn’t why people have been watching South Park in record numbers this year. No, they’re doing that because of how nakedly aggressive the show has been towards Trump. And this week it chose to achieve this by having as many characters as possible repeat the line: “Donald Trump is fucking Satan.”View image in fullscreenSuch a sweet couple … Satan and Trump in the South Park episodeSermon on the Mount.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis is for two reasons. First, throughout the season it has been evident that the cartoon Donald Trump has literally been having sexual intercourse with the devil, who makes a reappearance after his dalliance with Saddam Hussein in the South Park movie. Second, maybe the writers just wanted to call Trump “Satan” a bunch of times.In essence, this was South Park pulling the same trick it did with its controversial 2005 episode Trapped in the Closet, in which Tom Cruise locked himself inside a cupboard while everyone around him repeatedly stated: “Tom Cruise won’t come out of the closet.” On one hand, Tom Cruise was literally inside a closet. On the other, it was winking at unproven rumours about his sexuality.However, Trapped in the Closet had a grander aim, which was to describe the opaque beliefs of Scientologists. And it worked. Not only was it one of the best episodes of South Park ever made, but it changed the way the world talks about Scientology.Meanwhile, the aim of Wok Is Dead (aside from showing its disdain for Labubu dolls) seems to be to call Donald Trump Satan. Which, compared with the anger and specificity of the episodes preceding it, feels a little lazy. From everything we know about Trump, it feels like the jabs that land the hardest are the ones that undermine his ego, which is why he expends so much effort responding to claims about the size of his hands. Meanwhile, comparing him to Satan – the all-powerful embodiment of evil – feels as if it might actually be taken as a compliment.South Park has become the most important TV show of the Trump 2.0 era | Jesse HassengerRead moreStill, the payoff to everybody saying “Donald Trump is fucking Satan” so often is that Satan is now pregnant with Donald Trump’s butt baby, which is bound to play out in future episodes somehow.If you’re a fan of South Park, then Wok Is Dead’s scattershot cultural satire will have more than passed muster. But for those of us who have been tuning in to watch Trey Parker and Matt Stone take down Trump, it represents the first disappointment of the season. Perhaps it’s a blip, but this week’s episode suggests that Parker and Stone are starting to run low on ammunition, and want to broaden their horizons away from Trump in future episodes.Still, if that’s the case, the outcome would be a regular South Park season, and there are many worse things than that.South Park is on Paramount+Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Disappointments such asNightbitch,Eden,The Last Showgirl,Nutcrackers,The ReturnandThe Cutwere only mildly offset by the surprising appearance of Mike Leigh with his effectively gruelling dramaHard Truths.But after spottierVeniceandTelluridefestivals than usual, worryingly light on slam-dunks, all eyes return to this year’s Toronto, hopeful that it might correct course for the season.The Lost BusWith Venice and Telluride snapping up most of the bigger hitters, Toronto has felt a little light on Oscar contenders in recent years (since 2017, only six Toronto world premieres have been nominated for best picture compared with 15 from Venice). But if bets were to be placed based on an initial glance at this year’s crop, The Lost Bus would seem like the safest pick. It’s the new film fromPaul Greengrass, returning to the anxious immediacy of his fact-based retellings, having previously taken us back to the horror of September 11 (United 93), the Maersk Alabama hijacking (Captain Phillips) and the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks (22 July).In The Lost Bus, he’s working with producer and recent Oscar winnerJamie Lee Curtisto tell the harrowing story of the 2018 Camp fire, the deadliest in California’s history. Another Oscar winner,Matthew McConaughey, stars as a bus driver trying to save some schoolchildren and their teacher, played by Oscar nominee America Ferrera. Given theongoing wildfiresthat have affected California, including many of those within the entertainment industry, it sounds like a nail-biter that will also strike an emotional chord for many.Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out MysteryIt wasn’t as if Rian Johnson’sKnives Outcame without fanfare (this was, after all, the director of 2012’s superb sci-fi thrillerLooper), but no one expected it to create quite such a stir at 2019’s Toronto film festival. It was the kind of crowd-pleasing premiere film-makers dream about (the audience was as locked in and audibly enthused as I’ve ever heard at a festival) and restarted the whodunnit genre as we now know it. The Netflixication of the series (in pandemic times, the streamer paid $450m for two sequels) led toGlass Onion, which also premiered to Toronto in 2022. It was fun but notably inferior and now, with another three-year gap, the knives are out once again.Daniel Craigis of course returning, and this time his suspects includeJosh O’Connor,Glenn Close,Kerry Washington,Andrew Scott,Josh Brolin, Cailee Spaeny andJeremy Renner, whose fictional hot sauce made a cameo in the last film. Little is known, as one would expect, but this time there’s a religious component and the mystery appears to unfold in England.ChristyView image in fullscreenSydney Sweeney in Christy.Photograph: Allie FredericksThis Toronto promises a transformative role for Sydney Sweeney, a young actor who might be in need of some transformative PR aftera rough few months. She became instant thinkpiece fodder when sheappeared in a dubious American Eagle campaignabout “good jeans” before her two summer indies died at the box office. She’s surely praying that Christy, an old-fashioned awards play, will redirect the narrative as she takes on the role of groundbreaking boxer Christy Martin. The film tells of her rise to fame in the 1980s as well as her destructive marriage to a man who tries to kill her.It’s the latest from Australian directorDavid Michôd, who broke out with electrifying crime dramaAnimal Kingdombut has struggled to make an impact since, with starry films such asWar MachineandThe Kingfailing to land. Both Sweeney and Michôd (as well as those aiming to sell the film at the festival) will be hoping this one is a real contender.Good FortuneAziz Ansari’s rise from standup to Parks and Recreation supporting player to Master of None creator took a pause after he was the focus of aquestionable#MeTooexposé and then another when a film he was directing was shut down after star Bill Murray was accused of sexual misconduct. Bad luck followed as the Hollywood strikes delayed the start date of a film he was scheduled to write, direct and star in. But once the industry restarted, he finally got to the finish line with Good Fortune, a film he hopes will help revive the theatrical comedy experience. It’s a throwback to the kind of high-concept genre hybrid that would regularly hit big in the 1980s, focusing on a guardian angel who makes two men swap lives, one rich and one poor. The angel is played byKeanu Reeves(this will be his first non-franchise movie since 2019) withSeth Rogen,Keke Palmerand Sandra Oh also starring. This one has scored a plum Saturday night premiere (a slot previously given toThe Fabelmans) so expectations are high.The FenceView image in fullscreenMatt Dillon in The Fence.Photograph: Toronto film festivalIt’s unusual for a lot of esteemed European directors to premiere their films at Toronto, often preferring a Cannes or Venice debut, but Claire Denis bucked the trend back in 2018 with the gonzo, Robert Pattinson-ledHigh Life, her first English-language movie. It was warmly received, and with her last film, romantic thrillerStars at Noon, opening to a cooler reception at Cannes, she’s now heading back to Toronto with her follow-up, The Fence. It’s a tense drama about a British-owned construction site in Africa and the fallout from an accident that kills a local worker.Matt Dillon, who is on a bit of an auteur run after working with Wes Anderson and Lars von Trier, stars with How to Have Sex breakout Mia McKenna-Bruce and Tom Blyth.RoofmanToronto is by far the most commercial-leaning of the upper-tier festivals and aside from the Oscar contenders, it’s been host to a long line of broad crowd-pleasers. Films such asHustlers, Knives Out,Heretic,HalloweenandWidowswere all met with enthusiasm from both critics and general audiences and kicked off press cycles with added word-of-mouth buzz. This year, it feels like Roofman might do the same; it’s a film that looks like the kind of sturdy star-led comedy drama that would have been released back in the 2000s. It’s fitting that it’s also led by two stars of that era –Channing TatumandKirsten Dunst– heading up the true story of a runaway robber hiding in a Toys R Us who falls for one of the employees.It’s directed by Derek Cianfrance, who broke out with devastating divorce dramaBlue Valentinebut hasn’t really found his footing since (with messy crime dramaThe Place Beyond the Pinesand creaky melodramaThe Light Between Oceans). Here’s hoping this one lands.The ChristophersView image in fullscreenMichaela Coel and Ian McKellen in The Christophers.Photograph: Toronto film festivalIt’s never easy to predict whatSteven Soderberghwill do next; he’s a chameleonic director whose repeated threats of retirement have thankfully proved empty. In the last few years, he’s given us aparanoid tech thriller, anunconventional haunted house story, asexy London-set spy caper, a50s-set crime dramaand asemi-improvised Meryl Streep comedy, all either excellent or at the very least interesting. It tracks then that his next would be another left turn, this time all the way back to England with twisty black comedy The Christophers. He’s assembled a crackerjack cast –Ian McKellen,Michaela Coeland Baby Reindeer breakout Jessica Gunning – for a film about an artist who has to secretly complete the unfinished work of an ageing great for his greedy estranged children. It’s a rare lead role for Coel since her thrilling TV triumphI May Destroy Youand the prospect of her paired with McKellen is something to get excited about.The ChoralLast year,Ralph Fiennescharmed his way through awards season with hisConclavecampaigning, alternating betweenseriousandsilly, rather like the film he was nominated for. There’s a chance he could be in the running again, leading another potential crowd-pleaser about a group of men trying to navigate difficult circumstances.In The Choral, he plays a choir director trying to assemble singers in 1916 Yorkshire as the first world war rages on. It’s a reunion for director Nicholas Hytner and writer Alan Bennett, who last came together for 2015’s middlingMaggie SmithdramaThe Lady in the Van, but their previous collaborations still provide hope that this one could sing. It could be the kind of rousing, heartstring-yanking period piece that easily wins a classic Toronto afternoon audience over.EPiC: Elvis Presley in ConcertView image in fullscreenElvis Presley in concert.Photograph: Toronto film festivalBaz Luhrmann’s longtime passion forElvis Presleyhas already brought us a maximalist biopic that focused on a more creatively and commercially prohibitive period for the singer.Elvis(2022) was a divisive big swing for critics but a hit with both audiences and the academy, and during production, Luhrmann announced a second Presley project.Three years later and he’s bringing EPiC:Elvis Presleyin Concert to Toronto, his first world premiere at the festival (he’s tended to prefer Cannes for previous films). It’s the result of recently discovered archival footage, showing Presley during his Vegas residency in the 1970s. Unlike Elvis, this promises to show the singer unbound by limitations, the film flipping between excitable rehearsal footage, his electric performances and the thrilled celebrity audience.CoutureView image in fullscreenAngelina Jolie and Louis Garrel in Couture.Photograph: Carole BethuelAfter her big Marvel outingEternalswas a big flop and her much-buzzed Oscar play Maria was a bit of a buzzkill, Angelina Jolie is refusing to let any bad press slow down her comeback to acting. The Oscar winner is currently filming comedy Anxious People withAimee Lou WoodandJason Segeland will be attracting one of the biggest crowds this week when she premieres her new film Couture, a Paris-based drama. She’ll be playing a fashion-hating US film director, landing for fashion week, who finds her life intersecting with other international women involved with a show. It’s the latest film from Alice Winocour, who last came to Toronto with her sensitively drawn dramaParis Memoriesabout a woman processing her experience of a terrorist attack. It’s become unusual to see Jolie play an everyday person without horns, superpowers or celebrity, so Couture could maybe act as the real start to her A-list return.Explore more on these topicsToronto film festival 2025Toronto film festivalFestivalsDaniel CraigSydney SweeneyGlenn ClosePaul GreengrassfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Adapted from a 1981 children’s picture book by Chris Van Allsburg, it starred Robin Williams in an exuberant, winning but notably controlled lead performance. This is an entertainment in the broad Hollywood tradition of Capra and Spielberg, with a boisterous touch of Peter Pan in that the stern father figure and the scary villain are both played by the same actor. But there’s something else, too, a dash of something that, if it were played straight, would be genuinely creepy. And actually, even played just the way it is, it’s still pretty creepy.Williams plays Alan Parrish, a guy who in his childhood of the late-1960s found himself marooned inside the bizarre internal world of a crazy Kiplingesque board game called Jumanji. A couple of recently orphaned kids, Peter and Judy (played by Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst), chance upon this musty old game in the attic of their new house; they roll the correct numbers on the dice and release the crazed and disoriented Alan, whose strange and presumably jungle-dwelling garb is the only direct clue we will have to what his life has been like inside.But it isn’t just Alan who gets out; the game also disgorges a lot of nasty insects, crazy monkeys, rhinos, lions, icky venom-spitting plants and a rifle-wielding pith-helmet-wearing colonial-era Brit, played (like Alan’s stern dad) by Jonathan Hyde. The only way to get them all back inside is to continue the game that Alan started as a kid, to the end. And to do that they will have track down the now grownup woman that Alan was playing with at the time: the intensely messed-up Sarah Whittle, played by Bonnie Hunt.All those crazy creatures rampaging through the streets of a sweet little town makes for quite a bizarre spectacle and, 30 years later, the visual effects hold up rather well, despite or because of not approaching the uncanny-valley standards of what could be achieved now. And this weird game is also like something MR James might have dreamed up if he had worked in Hollywood. As for Williams himself, his wild-man routine is only in evidence in his opening scenes; otherwise he dials it down, perhaps sensing that the way to upstage the loony creatures is to be relatively rational. There is something touchingly innocent in his performance.Jumanji is in UK cinemas from 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmRobin WilliamsKirsten DunstScience fiction and fantasy filmsAction and adventure filmsToysFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The artist often ends up getting the shitty end of the stick. You have to work really, really,reallyhard, and sometimes it feels impossible.”“The way that minorities are treated in the music industry? Not surprising,” adds bandmate Heide Peverelle. “The way that women are treated in the music industry? Not surprising. The way that a lot of men are in the music industry? Not surprising, and often very disappointing.”“But there is fame and glory at the other end!” laughs Gracie Sinclair.Musicians v the climate crisis: ‘We’re trying to put on the greenest show in Australia’Read moreFolk Bitch Trio have had a crash course in the good and bad of the music industry over the past few years. The trio met at high school in Melbourne and started making music in year 12, which is when they coined their undeniable band name (one that confuses the festival bookers expecting a more typical folksy act than the breezy, indie-pop-meets-alt-rock band they actually are).Things moved fast: after a few early singles and “a lot of hustle”, this year Folk Bitch Trio announced their signing to US label Jagjaguwar, home of acts such as Bon Iver, Sharon Van Etten and Angel Olsen, and released their debut album, Now Would Be A Good Time. They modestly describe feeling “busy” right now; an observer might say they seem to be on the precipice of Big Things.When we speak via Zoom, the band, now all aged 23, are sitting in a hotel room next to a highway somewhere outside Utrecht, the Netherlands, on week seven of an eight-week tour that has taken them through North America, Europe and the UK, an experience that has been both exhilarating and exhausting. As well as the jam-packed tour schedule, they launched Now Would Be A Good Time from the road, jamming press in around shows and feeling buoyed by the positive reception they were met with.A lot of the songs are quite earnest, but we’re also poking fun at the situations that we’re writing aboutHeide PeverelleIt’s an easy album to like. Now Would Be A Good Time is a tender, lovely listen, sonically somewhere between Boygenius and Laura Marling, and anchored by the group’s three-part vocal harmonies (all three sing; Pilkington and Peverelle do most of the guitar work). The album is, as they describe it, “about the turmoils of being in your 20s, and the pathetic little tragedies that you have”, such as the embarrassment of getting dumped and wanting more from a situation than you can get and “being really dramatic about it”. It’s fertile ground to mine.“Being pathetic and lonely is a great space for songwriting, I think,” deadpans Pilkington.View image in fullscreenFolk Bitch Trio’s first album Now Would Be A Good Time is ‘about the turmoils of being in your 20s’.Photograph: Bridgette WintenBut in Folk Bitch Trio’s hands, the woes of youth are handled with light humour. There are songs about having a sex dream soundtracked by the TV infomercial you fell asleep watching, and lyrics that sarcastically reference inescapable self-help books (“Can’t deny it my body keeps the score/ But if you tell me that you need it/ I can get up off my floor”).“A lot of the songs are quite earnest, but we’re also poking fun at the situations that we’re writing about,” says Peverelle. “Because it’s not super deep, even though you feel like it is when you’re 20 and going through your first breakup. You will rebuild!”While many Australian artists start looking abroad after building a profile at home, Folk Bitch Trio had their sights set on going global from the jump. As soon as their album was recorded they flew to Austin’s South by Southwest, where they met with every label they could before inking their Jagjaguwar deal. The music industry is, of course, far bigger in markets like North America and Europe than it is in Australia, which is a practical reason to hop a time zone or two. But the trio have never really felt as if they fit in the traditional avenues for breaking Australian bands.Emma Louise on her late-in-life autism diagnosis: ‘I wish I knew earlier, because I’ve suffered so much’Read moreRadio station Triple J, historically one of Australia’s most powerful tastemakers, has only very recently begun playing Folk Bitch Trio’s music, at the very end of their album cycle (“They took their sweet time,” laughs Pilkington). In an age where there’s a lot of pressure on artists to go viral, the trio aren’t much for meme-y Instagram or TikTok content. And while they’re thrilled to be on the bill at this year’s Meredith music festival in December (a “bucket list” booking), Australia’s festival circuit – or, after a tough few years for the local music industry, what’s left of it – doesn’t feel quite right for them.“A lot of those Triple J festivals, I don’t think that’s ever really felt like what we’ve had our eyes on,” says Pilkington. “It’s not super accessible for us. I don’t think we’re quite making the right music for it. I think that our goals of [finding a] wide audience have existed outside of Australia.”But while their aspirations are global, Folk Bitch Trio say they’re fighting to keep Melbourne their base for as long as possible. For one, the music scene in their home town is “just so pumping all the time that you can go to an awesome gig every night – it’s what you want to be around,” says Peverelle.And while playing to a heaving crowd at a festival in Wales is cool, their most rewarding career moments have been at home – including hearing one of their mums listen to their record on vinyl for the first time from the other room. Those are, Peverelle says, “the special moments that surprise you and rock you a little bit”, and make the eyeroll-inducing stuff of bad music men and crappy money all worthwhile. The longer they spend away from home, the greater the pull becomes.“I think we all have surprised ourselves in how much our love for Melbourne has grown through being away from it,” says Pilkington from that grim, highway-side hotel room, on their first night off in almost a week. “Because you really can’t fight your home. And when you exhaust yourself travelling the world, it’s what you crave.”Now Would Be a Good Time is out now(Jagjaguwar).

Gail assumes she is next in line for the job, but the head tells her she doesn’t have the people skills and asks if she has considered retirement herself. Affronted, she walks out of the school and from her job without collecting the photo on her desk of her daughter, Debbie, who is about to get married. After Gail gets home, her ex-husband, Max, arrives. He is staying with her for the wedding weekend and tells her he has forgotten to bring a suit – although he has brought a cat. Not for the first time, Gail wonders “why it was that I had so many irritating people in my life”.Set in Baltimore, Anne Tyler’s novella spans the before, during and after of Debbie’s wedding. Told through Gail’s eyes, the plot is deliberately slim as it explores subtle family dynamics and the mundanity of everyday life. Thus, we accompany Gail as she collects her outfit from the dry cleaners and visits a hair stylist with whom she declines to make small talk. J Smith Cameron, best known for her role as Gerri in Succession, is the narrator, and adeptly captures Gail’s social awkwardness that, unbeknown to her, can come over as chilly and detached. As she ponders the breakdown of her marriage to Max, we see that the headteacher had a point. Although we root for Gail and her future happiness, it is clear her people skills need work.Available via Penguin Audio, 4hr 24minFurther listeningThe Story of a HeartRachel Clarke,Little, Brown Audio,9hr 1minClarke’s Women’s prize-winning book traces the remarkable journey of a heart from the body of a nine-year-old girl who is killed in a car crash, and transplanted to a young boy suffering from acute cardiomyopathy.

There are the five well-known mature quintets, as well as the early B flat work K174, for which Spuncunifait play two versions of its finale. All are composed for a quintet of strings with two violas (unlike Boccherini’s quintets and Schubert’s famous C major quintet, which employ two cellos).View image in fullscreenSpunicunifait: Mozart: Six String Quintets.Photograph: AlphaThe players – Lorenza Borrani and Maia Cabeza (violin), Max Mandel and Simon Von Rahden (viola) and Luise Buchberger (cello) – use a mix of 18th-century instruments and 21st-century copies; the recorded sound is close and involving. Not all aspects of the group’s approach will be to all tastes: vibrato is very sparingly used, and its absence can often be starkly effective, but the tendency to link notes in phrases with tiny glissandi can sometimes seem a little overdone. These are minor quibbles, though. The performances reveal the group’s musicality and deep understanding of these under-appreciated works in every bar.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

In the home counties cottage he shares with his parents and older brother, olive oil does duty not in the kitchen but as a bathroom remedy for bunged-up ears. If you are lucky enough to have a telephone (the Faulks are), it will probably be a “party” line shared with the people next door. Holidays consist of an icy week in Bexhill-on-Sea or, a step up, the Isle of Wight (just as cold but with a nicer class of ice-cream). Then there are all those tight-lipped middle-aged men busying themselves mowing the lawn and going to work in mysterious “offices”. Not so long ago they were shooting down Germans or trying to survive the north African desert.Faulks’s own father is one of these heroes in hiding – a provincial solicitor in a failing practice who won the Military Cross for service in Tunisia. Another is Commander Sanderson, the headteacher of the prep school to which Faulks is dispatched at the age of eight. It is impossible not to feel freshly affronted by a system that routinely sent privileged boys away from home in order to make a certain kind of man of them. No surprise either that at this point Faulks retreats into the third person, as if the obscenity is still too raw to tell directly. “A hopeful, credulous little boy is being unpicked and discontinued. He’s like a creature in a science-fiction story that’s been sent back to have its factory settings altered.”Reading from his novel in a Chicago bookshop, he breaks down completely, taking the audience with himInitially, it looks as though Faulks has emerged unscathed: he becomes head boy, wins scholarships to Wellington and then on to Cambridge. But something happens in his second year at university. Exactly what isn’t clear because, once again, he retreats into grammatical obscurity: “There were meetings with doctors, pills … panic attacks, agoraphobia, white nights of insomnia.” The only thing that helps him is listening on repeat to Procol Harum’s Fires (Which Burnt Brightly), a keening lament for youthful idealism.The rest of the book proceeds in this same puzzling way, hinting at depths that fail to take on a discernible shape. Instead, Faulks drops clues – for himself perhaps as much as for us – by recounting those many moments in life when he has found himself ambushed by grief. Sitting in the archives at the Imperial War Museum, researching the western front for the book that will becomeBirdsong, he stuffs a handkerchief in his mouth to stop himself from sobbing. Another time, reading from the novel in a Chicago bookshop, he breaks down completely, taking the audience with him. Later, this time on a plane and with no one looking, he tears up atCaptain Corelli’s Mandolin, Louis de Bernières’ account of the Italian occupation of Cephalonia during the second world war.Frustratingly, Faulks doesn’t identify what exactly is being catalysed in him by these stories of catastrophic loss. Is it the realisation that it was young men like him who bore the brunt of industrialised warfare in the 20th century? Or does the trauma press more directly on the psychological wounds that opened up with that annihilation at the age of eight? Or perhaps another kind of generational trauma is in play: only at the very end of the book does Faulks reveal his beloved mother’s own terrible early years at the hands of an erratic father (a Somme survivor) and an alcoholic stepmother who treated her with “appalling cruelty”.In his foreword, Faulks warns that this is going to be a “mongrel” book. It started life as a series of “essays on the things that had meant the most to me” during a career that stretched back to the raffish Fleet Street of the 1970s. Faulks’s publishers, though, had other ideas, and asked him to scrap the “least autobiographical” parts and rearrange the remainder in a chronological sequence. The result is a text that reads like a tussle, with Faulks steering away from anything that reads as memoir, while an unseen editorial hand shoves him just as firmly towards it.Fires Which Burned Brightly: A Life in Progress by Sebastian Faulks is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£20).

I’m an enthusiast for the sort of American fiction where cowboys make dolent pronouncements while staring into fires, sure – but less the kind where people are generally nice, and go to places called things like “Fink’s Drugstore” to drink “root beer floats”.So when Buckeye– the new novel from American author Patrick Ryan, whose collections of short fiction have garnered comparisons to William Faulkner and JD Salinger – clunked obstreperously on to my doorstep, I thought “you’ve got to respect a 440-pager”, and somewhat reluctantly pulled my little socks up for some Norman Rockwell-type business. And you know what? I now think slice-of-life Americana is good, actually.Opening in the first decades of the 20th century, this luminous and tender novel follows, for most of its stately length, the interwoven lives of two married couples in the fictional town of Bonhomie, Ohio. One half of the first of these couples is Cal Jenkins, the sweet-tempered son of a traumatised first world war veteran, born in the spring of 1920 with (to use the parlance of the era) a mild deformity: “The day you were born and one of your legs came up short,” his father, Everett, tells him, “right then I thought, well, that’s it. If we get into another big one, he’ll never be in it.” The delights of prolepsis!The US gets into another big one in quite short order, of course. Cal, just as his father predicted, is turned away from the recruitment office and ends up spending his days in drudgery at the local concrete factory instead. A chance meeting with Becky Hanover, a young woman with a dark bob and a loveably whimsical way about her, sees Cal married by the end of the first chapter. After all, Bonhomie is a small town, “hers was the first beret he’d ever seen that wasn’t on someone in a movie”, and we’ve got 50-odd years of American history to get through.As one of Ryan’s characters summarises it: ‘people get laid, babies get made, everybody lies to their kids’On 8 May 1945, Cal is working a shift at the hardware store owned by Becky’s father when a gorgeous, confused redhead stumbles in. Together, they listen to President Truman announce allied victory in Europe over the wireless – and then she kisses him. The gorgeous, confused redhead is Margaret Salt. Her own equally gorgeous and strangely aloof husband is away on a cargo ship in the Pacific. From here, the novel takes off at full thrust, and, as one of Ryan’s characters summarises it: “people get laid, babies get made, everybody lies to their kids”.It is no surprise that Ryan cut his teeth writing short fiction: Buckeye iselevated throughout by the precision with which he captures the tiny, haunting glories of everyday suburban life. We have a mother-in-law with a singing voice so beautiful it silences the room, like “throwing a blanket over a birdcage”; a newborn baby peering up at his father “in a single-brow-lifting, James Cagney kind of way”; a Japanese submarine, recovered from Pearl Harbor and taken on tour through the snowbound midwestern winter, “ringing dull and hollow under the pummel of mittens”. Across this intimidatingly weighty novel, I encountered only one duff simile (and it would feel churlish to retype it here).For all its quotidian charm, a deep melancholy prevents Buckeye from ever tipping into saccharine nostalgia. I’d probably not go quite so far as to bring Faulkner into it – this is accessible, amicable and more-or-less conventional literary fiction – but nonetheless, Ryan writes his wounded souls with the same exactitude as his dusty vinyl diner booths. His Bonhomie is peopled by men almost universally traumatised by their experiences of war. “Life chewed you up and spat you out,” Cal thinks, when he turns his mind to his home town’s many eccentric veterans, whose company he has been fatefully excluded from, “but it didn’t often spit the same way twice”. “Women had the babies, and men … began to distance themselves the moment they pulled out,” Margaret thinks, “because they had to go to a wife, or to work, or to war, or to that secret place of stoic brooding all men are given the key to at birth.” Ryan’s characters are universally nuanced and finely wrought, their gently interpolated inner monologues giving the lie to the pleasant respectability they strive to project. As the years tick by and we enter the 60s, Cal is a father – and prolepsis becomes a crueller mistress.So much for Norman Rockwell, who is invoked almost as the artistic antithesis of Buckeye’s project. “[Rockwell] was always capturing the perfect moments then putting them under a microscope to find the cute parts …nothingwas like those paintings.” Ryan, unlike Rockwell, is not interested in cute. With Buckeye, he strips away the Bakelite glaze of the American dream to expose the raw flesh beneath.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Blank-faced characters, dressed as if walking home from the night before, repeatedly spray-paint slogans on the pavement (“Tomorrow is cancelled”) before they’re wiped away. A film of a staged riot gives La Haine vibes. Political impotence cast through a bleak filter – that’s the intro to a takeover of the whole Southbank Centre by French dance collective(La)Horde. It puts films and live performances by a cast of 80 (with dancers from Ballet National de Marseille and Rambert) all over the complex’s buildings for a buzzing three hours.That’s as overtly political as it gets, though, because in (La)Horde’s world, everyone is too distracted by screens to engage, including a guy who walks around with a rig holding 40 phones, like a tourist with an elaborate selfie stick. In one piece called Deep Stream, the dancers, like avatars, go through the human motions, but it’s all fake laughter and glazed gazes. Across a lot of these performances, the mood is of eerie disconnect, joyless sex, aloofness, sadness. Is anyone happy in (La)Horde’s world? It’s a troubling depiction of gen Z. (The finale, though, offers a blast of primal energy that’s a thrilling tonic.)View image in fullscreenA troubling depiction of gen Z … Master’s Tools/Tomorrow Is Cancelled at the Southbank Centre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian(La)Horde excel at reframing or repurposing street and social dance, as in guest choreographers Cecilia Bengolea and François Chaignaud’s GrimeBallet, where dirty bass is unexpectedly paired with the clean pink satin of pointe shoes. Or the techno lindy hop of Hop(e)storm, swing dancing to a strict beat. They strip a dance of one context and give it another in a way that’s simple and readable but also strange and compelling. In To Da Bone, they bring together “jumpstyle” dancers, bedroom amateurs from around Europe who dance like they’re doing football tricks with an invisible ball. It’s very specific, very technical, and treated with the seriousness of a ballet petit allegro. It also reminds you of step dances from Ireland, South Africa and Chicago and the way such ideas were spread or developed long before digital memes.The evening’s format, of short pieces you dip in and out of, echoes online life. All the artists need to offer is a tasty bite, a novelty, a sensation, and you can walk away before anything gets too demanding or boring.

God bless and God speed.”She later expanded on her comments in follow-up Instagram stories, saying she had been explicitly told the production would not address her notes.“So I just butted out and left it alone because it’s not my project,” she said. “They’re going to make whatever they’re going to make. A big reason why I haven’t said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you guys are gonna be happy with it.“A big section of the film panders to a very specific section of my dad’s fandom that still lives in the fantasy, and they’re gonna be happy with it.”Paris continued to critique the “sugar-coated” Hollywood biopic model generally: “The narrative is being controlled and there’s a lot of inaccuracy and there’s a lot of just full-blown lies. At the end of the day, that doesn’t really fly with me. Go enjoy it. Do whatever. Leave me out of it.”The biopic, which has been produced in conjunction with the Jackson estate, has been gestating since at least 2019.It attracted controversy whenPuck magazinereported that the film was facing rewrites and reshoots after a third-act plotline about one of Michael Jackson’s accusers could not be used for legal reasons.A source close to the production denied the reports. “The Michael Jackson biopic is not in total chaos,” the sourcetold Peopleat the time. “The inflammatory headlines about the movie halting are simply not true.”Jaafar Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, will make his feature debut as the pop megastar in the biopic, whose cast also includes Miles Teller, Nia Long and Kat Graham.Michael is set for release on 24 April 2026.The Guardian has contacted representatives for Domingo, as well as the biopic’s production company, for comment.Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsVenice film festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

To put that into perspective, 32 million people in the UK tuned in to watch Princess Diana’s funeral broadcast live on the BBC. If you’re not familiar with the work, video essays may just be the biggest cultural phenomenon you’ve never heard of.Early versions of video essays – thoughtful deep dives that filter cultural analysis through the distinct personality of the creator – emerged in the early 2000s, but it was the converging currents of the “online left” and the creativity that flourished under lockdowns that saw the number of creators rise and the format swell in popularity. For the past eight years, the British Film Institute has put out ayearly rankingof video essays of the year. BBC auteurAdam Curtis has saidif he were starting out again, he would become a YouTuber, calling it “the last wild west” of online creativity.Prevailing common sense in the boardrooms of streaming services and broadcasting corporations is that attention, both in terms of quality and quantity, is dwindling. Research from the psychologist Gloria Markhas shown thatattention times are declining, now averaging 47 seconds on a given task while using an electronic device. This creates an issue for the commissioning of factual entertainment, which by its nature requires viewers to engage with ideas. To get round this problem, streaming services have turned to easily digestible output – reality TV, nature documentaries or grisly true-crime miniseries. Public service broadcasters such as the BBC, whose mission is to “inform, educate and entertain”, have mimicked streamers, not wanting to be left behind.On smaller phone screens, TikTok and Instagram Reels range between 30 seconds and 10 minutes. The bold, the catchy and, in some cases, the extreme, travel far. Other platforms, such as Facebook or X, where ideas might once have been exchanged and discussed in good faith have become wastelands of misinformation, posturing, hot takes and conflict.In contrast, video essays are thought-provoking, nuanced and self-reflexive. They mix philosophical theory, cultural studies and internet subcultures. Even if a streaming service wanted to, they wouldn’t be able to generate a tag for this type of content. The couple behindLeftist Cooks, former academic Sarah Oeffler and creative Neilly Farrell, are emblematic of the mixture of education and entertainment. Their video When Your Hero Is a Monster inspired by the unsavoury allegations against Neil Gaiman, went viral at the end of last year; it sees them literally donning a number of different hats in order to represent the struggle many have in reconciling their attachments to cancelled celebrities.Adam Curtis has said if he were starting out again, he would become a YouTuber“We’ll be talking about Foucault or something and then, yeah, it’s like: Oh, there’s that episode of BoJack Horseman that does that,” says Oeffler.Video essays can also be very, very long. The final product takes months, and in some cases, years worth of research, writing, planning, costume and set designing, filming and editing. ContraPoints’ magisterial 2hr 40min videoConspiracy,about the allure of this thinking and its impact on democracy, has no fewer than six costume changes, including one Eyes Wide Shut-inspired scene with eight different Venetian masks. In another scene, the channel’s creator, Natalie Wynn, “built this giant trope of a conspiracy wall with yarn … a week was spent making hundreds of photo prints … I went through three canisters of ink printing out declassified CIA documents and pinning them all over the wall. It’s probably eight feet.”José María Luna’s latest essay,Searching for God in Film, explores faith through cinema by referencing 50 films, including The Seventh Seal and The Sound of Music. It also features the creator dressed as St Sebastian (arrows and all), a cardinal and a layperson confessing his sins. When mood-boarding the essay, he thought: “‘What if I fake a confessional [booth]?’ So I faked [it] with some black poster board and the back of my bed in my bedroom, which was very fun.”By the metrics of bigger organisations, video essays shouldn’t work, and yet they do. In fact, these videos are mainlywatchedon larger TV screens, much like regular movies or shows. Canadian documentarian Dan Olsen, also known asFolding Ideas, has covered topics as wide-ranging as media criticism and online conspiracy and finance culture. He believes that YouTubers have reached a point of maturation where they are able to make ambitious, educational, entertaining content on a par with previous broadcast educators such as Carl Sagan, who popularised astronomy in the 1980s with his landmark documentaries. He believes that video essayists are a “filling a hole in documentary production, in educational content, in science communication, at a wide swath of budget and production levels that I think people are thirsty for and [that] broadcast TV has been unable or unwilling to fill for a very long time.”Line Goes Up, his definitive and acerbic two-hourbreakdown and takedownof cryptocurrencies and NFTs, through direct to camera monologue, graphics, images, and screen recordings has more than 17m views.The first creator to make videos in 2004 specifically for an internet audience was James Rolfe, theAngry Video Game Nerd, who posted scrappy gaming reviews and skits in character. This was followed by Channel Awesome posting comedic film reviews. After leaving the channel, creatorLindsay Elliswould go on to be one of the original YouTube essayists, posting long-form critiques of animation and fantasy films, among other things.The political strand of video essays emerged between 2014 and 2016 as progressive creators found themselves sharing YouTube with the emerging “alt-right”. Things came to a head overGamerGate, a misogynistic online harassment campaign against women in the gaming industry. Hbomberguy’s first video was theThe Sarkeesian Effect: A Measured Response, mocking the men who were taking aim at the woman at the centre of the outrage. The term “Bread Tube” (a reference to anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin’s book, The Conquest of Bread) was coined to describe a loose collection of creators, including the above as well as other channels such as Philosophy Tube,though many creators rejected it.The videos are in no small part successful because they represent political points of view, identities and creators – including trans people, queer people and people of colour – who have been marginalised by the mainstream. “People who are traditionally excluded from more formal publishing opportunities can have a voice onYouTube,” says Wynn. “And often there is an audience that is not being catered to elsewhere that does exist and is there on YouTube. There were creators and there was an audience. They were not being connected with each other until the gatekeeping was eliminated.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Wynn’sTwilightvideo, in which she sits at an overflowing banquet table replete with candelabras and skulls, uses feminist and queer theory to explore themes of sex, sexuality, desire and power dynamics between genders as evoked in Stephenie Meyer’s vampire novels.Fashion and lifestyle trends have also become a subject for creators such as Mina Le. Her first video was about the historical accuracy of the costume design in the film Atonement. “It’s OK to think seriously about things that are otherwise considered mundane or irrelevant,” says Zandile Powell, AKA Kidology, who documents in real-time the excesses and extremities of internet culture.‘The BBC feels very samey and boring’: the over-50s who prefer YouTubeRead more“This corner of the internet is a surprisingly pleasant place to be,” says Oeffler. “There’s genuinely a bunch of solidarity between creators. We try to boost people all the time, we recommend people to our audience who might not natively get as many views. We know based on research that people are less likely to click on the thumbnail of somebody if they’re Black, for example.” Although the parasocial relationship between creators and audiences, combined with the high standards of the left, has meant that audiences have at times pushed back against creators for not being radical enough.What next? “Right now we are in a golden age because there are a lot of channels that are able to access business-level budgets,” says Olsen. Thanks to Patreon, the most popular creators are able to hire teams and/or work full-time on their videos – although many smaller YouTubers rely on revenue made from hosting adverts in their videos, making them vulnerable to brands pulling advertising budgets as they did during the pandemic. Some video essayists are already moving away from YouTube to the creator-owned platform Nebula.For now, things are exciting. When I ask José María Luna what video essay concepts he is working on next, he pulls out his phone: “I have a Notes app full of ideas like ‘Donald Duck and cultural imperialism’ or ‘Musicals and mental illness’. I don’t even know what I meant by that.”Explore more on these topicsDocumentarySocial mediaYouTubeTelevisionAdam CurtisGamergateDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now Whitehouse is the subject of a new production starring Maxine Peake. We meet the gay feminist playwright who wrote itMark LawsonThu 4 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTShareThe morality campaignerMary Whitehousewas a trigger warning long before the term was used. From the 1960s onwards she pursued the BBC over sex and swearing on television and brought private prosecutions against the publisher of Gay News and the director of Howard Brenton’s play, The Romans in Britain, for what she viewed respectively as blasphemy and gross indecency.So, whenMaxine Peakeplays the Christian cultural vigilante in The Last Stand of Mrs Mary Whitehouse at the Nottingham Playhouse this week, will there be a warning about its content?Caroline Bird, the play’s writer, laughs. “Thereisone on the website and it’s quite funny because it sounds like a play that Mary Whitehouse would really hate.” The dramatist finds it on her phone. “Here it is: ‘This show contains graphic sexual language, homophobia and references to suicide and death. Religious imagery is used in a way some may find offensive.’ Although the one thing the play doesn’t have in it is actual sex, so she would have approved of that.”If the content advisory follows one modern theatrical trend, the play’s authorship goes against the increasing convention that subject matter should ideally match the playwright’s own experience.“Mary Whitehouse wasn’t material I would naturally have been drawn to – being leftwing and gay, two things of which she didn’t approve,” admits Bird. Her previous biographical drama for Nottingham Playhouse,Red Ellen(2022), was much closer to her own politics and feminism in its depiction of the pioneering Labour MP, Ellen Wilkinson.The idea of writing about Whitehouse came from Peake and the play’s director, Sarah Frankcom. Bird admitted her doubts but “they told me to go away, do a bit of research and see if there was something I could get my teeth into. So I ordered all of Whitehouse’s books off eBay and, within the first few hours of reading, she’d talked about Aids as a ‘vindication’ of her views, ‘spiritual conversion’ for gay people and homosexuality being part of a Russian conspiracy to bring down the west. Oh, and the ‘homosexual lobby’ conspiring to destroy the family.”Although, as a gay feminist, Bird’s engagement with Whitehouse was antagonistic, she knew instinctively that, for dramatic effectiveness, the play could not be purely a rebuke or refutation: “Like in a court case, you have to give each side equal time to speak, regardless of your personal views. But in a play you also have to empathise with either side.”View image in fullscreenTrying to get close to her ... Samuel Barnett and Maxine Peake in rehearsals.Photograph: Helen MurrayShe feels that, on both X and the stage, “it has become quite controversial to empathise with someone who you vehemently disagree with personally. ‘How could you humanise this person? How could you empathise with this person?’ But to write a play or a character you have to imagine how they feel.” Her motto while she was writing it was a quote from the film director Jean Renoir: “The real hell of life is everyone has [their] reasons.”Bird’s attempt to present Whitehouse’s reasons for believing what she did caused mild domestic tension: “I’d be sitting here all day and my wife would come in in the evening and find me looking haunted and she’d say: ‘Have you been writing some convincing homophobia again?’ And I’d say: ‘Yeah.’ Because it felt important to show how persuasive she was.”The writer rejects the idea that Whitehouse was simply of her time (born before the first world war) and tribe (Christian): “This is not the homophobia of my grandmother, who was Christian and called all my partners ‘flatmates’. This was a woman with a huge platform and agenda for 25 years.”Whitehouse has often been treated as an essentially comic figure. Barry Humphries fed elements of her (spectacular glasses, an insistence on “housewife” values) into Dame Edna Everage and the campaigner’s Spitting Image puppet was more silly than sinister. Rob Newman and David Baddiel deliberately riled the clean-up-TV evangelist with the title of their show The Mary Whitehouse Experience that ran on the BBC in the early 1990s.But, says Bird, “reading her books, I thought: ‘This woman is not at all the joke that some have presented her as.’ Even after her death, we have underestimated her. And that was another part of her personality: she knew she was underestimated and was frustrated by that on an intellectual level. But it was also part of her armoury: ‘Me, hateful? A grandmother who collects pebbles. I’m not coming for your free speech or to ban anything.’ It was also an excellent cover: the idea that she was just an ordinary person. She was anything but ordinary.’”Through the numerous books and interviews plus the lifelong diaries archived in Oxford’s Bodleian library (“They’re written in these tiny hieroglyphics. I had to zoom in on my phone for hours and hours.”), Bird tried to isolate the experiences that created Whitehouse’s beliefs.View image in fullscreenPrivate prosecution ... Greg Hicks, centre, in The Romans in Britain.Photograph: Graham Wiltshire/Getty Images“She fell in love with a married man at a time when her parents’ marriage broke down – something she never wrote about. At the same time she joined what many have seen as a cult and was at least cult-adjacent: The Oxford Group, which later became the Moral Re-Armament movement.”As her diaries reveal, throughout her life Whitehouse followed “Quiet Time”, a moral audit that her spiritual gurus promoted, in which someone writes down their thoughts and measures them against a series of divine criteria: is this absolutely honest? Is this absolutely selfless? Is this absolutely loving?“So you basically spend each morning indoctrinating yourself,” says Bird. “Mary used to complain about the media and entertainment brainwashing people, but, if anyone was brainwashed, it was her. I think, having deprogrammed herself from loving a married man, it led her to believe that gay people could sort themselves out in the same way. And that helped me to understand her psychology.”Bird was a student on a course taught by the playwright Simon Stephens: “He said you have to know things about characters that they don’t know about themselves. Which is hard enough with fictional people but having to get to that place with a real person is exceptionally tough. You have to do as much research as you can and then start making emotional decisions about what could be underneath what. It feels risky and historically impertinent but it’s the only way of making someone feel alive.”On the Stephens rule, the things Whitehouse didn’t know (or acknowledge) about herself perhaps included the possibility of that adulterous love affair, the loss of twin babies and her parents’ divorce.The play is a two-hander in which the 15 characters – including Whitehouse’s mother, Margaret Thatcher, a Roman centurion and Jesus Christ, the last two featuring in the poem that led to the prosecution of Gay News – who interact with Peake’s Whitehouse are all played by Samuel Barnett. But, while Barnett’s quick changes and cross-dressing are comedic devices, Bird stresses that: “It’s advertised as a comedy and I hope it is funny but it’s not a satire or send-up of Whitehouse; it’s trying to get close to the real person.”Whitehouse was instrumental in passing the Protection of Children Act 1978, making child abuse images illegal, and also campaigned against what were then called “video nasties”, a strain of violent entertainment that digital technology has vastly popularised. Because those concerns seem prescient – and overlap with feminist and liberal thought – they have led to a revisionist view that Whitehouse has been proved “right” about important matters.Bird understands this argument but demurs: “I have a slightly different take on it. We tend to think that, if we align with someone’s fears, we agree with them. But that’s only half the story; you have to look at what their solutions are. Of course we can align with her fears about the effects of unregulated content on young people. But her solution to that was sex education that only teaches chastity before marriage and fidelity within it. She was anti-abortion, anti-contraception, anti-divorce, anti-feminist. She wanted a very traditional Christian state. So before we say ‘she was right’, we have to look at the whole picture. She was on the money with some of the fears we all share but the Mary Whitehouse solution was dangerous. I understand why some people want to cherrypick her views but she represented a whole ideology. It’s probably because I’m gay but when people tweet things such as: ‘Where’s Mary Whitehouse when you need her?’, there’s a bit of a shiver.”View image in fullscreen‘It does feel like a risk’ … Caroline Bird.Photograph: Fabrice GagosA key question in biographical fiction is the degree of invention the writer permits. Bird has created some scenes and characters to examine aspects of the story but gives a clear example of where she draws the line. One of Barnett’s cameos is John Smyth, Whitehouse’s barrister in the Gay News trial, who was later accused of sadistic beatings at Christian camps; failure to deal adequately with these allegations contributed to the resignation of Justin Welby as the archbishop of Canterbury. Many in the audience will bring knowledge of Smyth’s reputed behaviour to the play, but he isn’t exposed within it?“No. The play is basically from Whitehouse’s perspective and she didn’t know about Smyth. If I thought for a second that she knew, I’d have included it. But she didn’t and so fictionalising her knowing would have been a step too far for me.”Smyth, though, interests her as one of several examples of how some abusers use piety and charity as a cover: “Jimmy Savile made sure he was very close and aligned to Whitehouse. One of her fatal flaws was that she saw abusers everywhere unless they were on her side.”Despite being a theatre play, Bird leaves out Whitehouse’s main engagement with the stage; the failure in 1982 of her attempt to jail Michael Bogdanov for directing an act of simulated sodomy in The Romans in Britain.“One trial per play is quite enough,” says Bird. “Also, although it seems similar to the Gay News case, the issues that led her to The Romans in Britain are quite different, so I didn’t want to do the thing Whitehouse did, conflating things that, when you look at them, are actually quite different.”Another Brenton play (with David Hare) – Pravda (1985), in which Anthony Hopkins was the monstrous newspaper baron, Lambert Le Roux – demonstrated the danger, long proved by Shakespeare’s Richard III, that a vivid character played by a great actor will take over the play and the audience.“Yes. That will be interesting,” agrees Bird. “But I am OK with that because that is what Whitehouse did.”Bird is aware that Whitehouse had an incredible way of getting inside people’s heads. “It does feel like a risk. A bit of me is terrified that someone who is slightly homophobic might come to the play and leave wholly homophobic! Because they’ve been so convinced by the speeches I’ve written for her. But you have to trust the audience.”The Last Stand of Mrs Mary Whitehouse is at theNottingham Playhouse, from 5-27 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreMary WhitehouseMaxine PeakeNottingham PlayhousefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s back to the commute, back to work, back to school …We are also back at school – every Thursday for the past few years we’ve been taking pottery classes at college. From 10 in the morning until five in the evening we are covered in clay; our muddy fingers cannot check the phone every five minutes, and everyone at work knows not to contact us unless it’s an emergency – and even then, only if there’s something we can actually do about it.This also means that, for the first time since high school, we don’t have an obvious lunch solution. Our working life may lack many things, but as chefs our access to fresh, delicious food isn’t one of them. At college, though, we need to think ahead if we don’t want to rely on the canteen offerings (triangle-of-sadness sandwiches from the fridge or a lukewarm baked potato) – and we’re enjoying the weekly challenge.View image in fullscreenFirm enough to travel without toppling … Sami Tamimi’s courgette and leek ijeh (Arabic frittata).Photograph: Ola O Smit/The GuardianWednesday-night dinner needs to be strategically planned so it will taste good at room temperature the next day. Pasta is a good shout, but not in a creamy or oily sauce, and nothing too fishy. All baked pasta dishes are better the next day, especially lasagne. That’s where Rachel Roddy’spasta al forno with meatballs and mozzarellacomes in – a bouncy, comforting baked dish that holds up beautifully (and tastes even better as leftovers). If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, Tamal Ray’sSichuan-style lasagne– layered with fragrant spices, fermented broad bean sauce, mozzarella and bechamel – strikes just the right balance between bold and bowl-pleasing. Eggs are also great – particularly a frittata-style slab that’s firm enough to travel without toppling. And we always feel gloriously smug when we have a cold noodle salad with a little pot of dressing on the side.Of course, we’re not always organised, but we have developed a niche in morning salads: a slice of whatever’s lurking in the fridge, a chunk of feta, maybe a handful of mint, all tossed with that aforementioned dressing, which, if you ask us, tastes very much like victory at 1pm, when everyone else is queueing for a sad sandwich. And since a few of you might be in the same boat – new routines, toting packed lunches, feeling slightly frazzled but hopeful – here are some things to keep in your back pocket: Yotam Ottolenghi’ssoba noodle salad(it practically begs to be eaten cold), Sami Tamimi’sfrittata with herbs and veg, and our cheese and za’atar swirls (basically an edible hug that fits in a lunchbox). And if you do opt foran old-fashioned sandwich, Anna Jones has some inventive ideas for fillers (pictured top).We can’t promise these will make you better at throwing pots – ours are still wonky, though we’re calling it “rustic chic” – but they will definitely make our Thursdays more delicious.Wishing you all a soft landing back to the grind, smooth commutes and very smug lunches.Our week in foodView image in fullscreenFamily affair … chef Hyun Sang Ko, second from left, with his family at their restaurant Miga, in London.Photograph: Pål Hansen/The ObserverTransported by flavours|We will travel far for Korean food.

Since then, a rift has emerged – Paul wants potatoes with every meal. Actually, he often wants two types of potatoes with his meals – mash and chips, for example, or roasties and mash. I prefer rice. We split the cooking, so it’s a continual battle between us: which carb is better?Paul is part-Irish and part-Welsh, and says potatoes are part of his heritage. But I’m Indian, so the same is true for me about rice. I’ve always eaten rice as my carb, even when sharing meals with people from different backgrounds. To me, rice isn’t just a side dish, it’s a cornerstone of culture, identity, and countless comfort meals and festive feasts.Paul also says that potatoes are more versatile, but that’s laughable. Rice can be steamed, fried, boiled, fermented, rolled, wrapped, puffed, flaked, and transformed into countless dishes like biryani, sushi, sticky mango rice, kheer, onigiri and more. It doesn’t need to put on a show to be delicious, unlike the potato, which needs loads of salt, breadcrumbs or oil to make it great. Rice is the perfect blank canvas to soak up flavour.Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roofPaul also says rice spikes blood sugar. But I don’t think dauphinois smothered in cream and cheese (his favourite form of potato) is exactly a miracle health food.Sometimes I want to have a traditional British meal, like a roast dinner, or a steak, with rice, but Paul hits the roof. He says, “You can’t have rice with that.” But I can and I do.I am more flexible with his meals than he is with mine. When he cooks, I have potatoes with whatever we’re having. But I would like us to just have one type of potato with our meal, we don’t need two: it’s unnecessary and unhealthy.I love Paul, but living with someone who worships potatoes as though they’re the eighth wonder of the world is a lot at times. He needs to come around to my way of eating.The defence: PaulI made thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor pretended she didn’t like themI love potatoes, but Noor is obsessed with rice. I can’t stand rice as it’s very boring, but I’ve adapted since we started living together.I’m Irish and Welsh, so potatoes are in my blood, but Noor says the same about rice. You can’t argue with either of us from a cultural perspective. The issue is, seeing as I do more of the cooking, I often opt for other carbs before I do rice.For me, rice just doesn’t hit the same. Potatoes are the most versatile food. They’re both a carb and a vegetable. They are cheap and delicious, and there is so much that can be done with them – mash, fries, jacket potatoes, dauphinois, croquettes, crisps … the list goes on.I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s appropriate, but Noor wants it with things like a roast dinnerYou be the judge: should my flatmate stop burning incense in our home?Read moreSometimes I like to put two types of potato with our dinner – mash and fries, or croquettes and mash – but I don’t do it every night. Noor says it’s unhealthy and that I should make space for other vegetables, but I disagree. I recently discovered how to cook thousand-layer potatoes and they were amazing. Noor quite liked them, though she pretended she didn’t.I don’t mind cooking rice, but it’s a hassle with all the water-measuring, and I find it very plain. You have to dress it up to make it taste of anything.I have started eating a lot more rice when it’s appropriate – with curry, for example – but I don’t believe in having it as a standard accompaniment to all our dishes. I don’t think it’s versatile enough. Noor, on the other hand, wants rice with things like a roast dinner, or a piece of chicken.I think I can make the argument that potatoes are more nutritionally balanced in their natural form, and you can do more with them. Rice spikes your blood sugar. Potatoes with the skin on are a great source of fibre, and it’s not like I fry them all the time.Noor has taught me how to make rice since we now live together, so I will try to cook it more because I love her.

But two types of potato with a meal is one too many for me. Sticking to one and having rice some nights seems the obvious answer.Rob, 54There’s culinary lawbreaking on both sides here (double spuds, rice with roast dinner … dear me), so neither party can claim the moral high ground. But Paul claiming that “potatoes are superior” is ridiculous – Noor obviously doesn’t think so for starters, and his lack of awareness puts him in the wrong.Xiang, 37Noor and Paul are both being stubborn. Surely it’s best to compromise and alternate carbs – that would keep both of them happy. It’s either that or preparing separate carbs for each meal, which would be time-consuming and probably lead to food waste.Emma, 26It’s great that Noor and Paul are both being true to their culinary heritages, but Paul needs to compromise. He is wrong to ask Noor to concede that potatoes are superior, and should let her spice up traditional meals with rice.Alice, 44As neither of them hates the other’s preferred carb, they should switch between rice and potatoes. Paul should accept this, and he definitely shouldn’t cook two types of potato – one green veg and one potato variety would be far healthier.Valerie, 40Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us if you think Paul’s argument is half-bakedThe poll closes on Wednesday10 September at 9am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherBillie should stop buying kitchen appliances.32%of you said yes –Billieis guilty68%of you said no –Billieis not guiltyExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Look to the JuraFrom savagnin to vin jaune and poulsard, this relatively unheralded French region is a gold mine for interesting bottlesHannah CrosbieThu 4 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareIf you’ve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of theJura, this grape’s iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of them.It’s a grape variety that’s been grown in France for 900 years, with high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it’s known for the complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It’s also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in thevin jaunestyle, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, asDonald Edwards, consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ”Because of the region’s relatively small output (a quick glance atDecanterreveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions), you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by everyone.Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the100% savagnin currently on the society’s websiteis £27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.Four Jura wines to pique your interestThe Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura£18.50 The Wine Society, 13.5%. Salted almonds abound in this complex and interesting white that’s about 50% savagnin.Tissot-Maire Blanc de Blancs Crémant du Jura NV£16.25 Corney & Barrow, 12%.

Of course, we already know it was Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it.At first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive to needs and tiny details.There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse episodeThe Wench is Dead, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat. Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to Chris Sullivan’s stupendousblog, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective, although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to something that goes with an omelette, namely thepappanozzamade by Salvo Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode –La gita a Tindari– is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death) comes home to findpappanozza– that is, potatoes and onions boiled until soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo, who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for crimes against Sicilian food andAndrea Calogero Camilleri.If you don’t fancy a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned.Potatoes, green beans and onionServes45 medium waxy potatoes3 small onions400g green beans, trimmedSalt and black pepper4 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp red-wine vinegar1 pinch dried oreganoPeel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain everything.Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkPotatoesVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

As if on cue, the castle’s daily gun salute fires overhead, scattering pigeons and punctuating our conversation with a jolt.Three years have passed since the 47-year-old anthropologist left her home in Kyiv for Edinburgh, after the Russian invasion. Celluloid warriors have long been replaced by the rhythms of life in a city she now knows like the back of her hand. So well, in fact, that she has launched a walking tour revealing a layer even locals might miss: the story of Edinburgh’s vibrant Ukrainian community.Bridges Across Borders: Tracing Ukrainian Roots in the Heart of Edinburgh started in June and is the latest in a growing portfolio of women-led immersive walks developed in partnership with Women in Travel CIC, the UK-based social enterprise that fosters gender inclusion in the tourism industry. It now offers seven tours celebrating multiculturalism in its many forms: from a Saudi-led deep dive into west London’s Edgware Road to a sensory stroll along Ealing Road in Wembley, north-west London, with its Hindu temples and sizzling street food. All tour leaders are trained through Women in Travel’s guiding academy, which aims to help women earn an income by sharing their stories with travellers seeking a deeper connection to a place.View image in fullscreenNataliya Bezborodova, right, with guests on her Ukrainian community walking tour of Edinburgh.Photograph: Simon WilliamsThe two-and-a-half-hour walking tour attracts a mix of locals and tourists, Nataliya tells me. “I’ve even had people from Ukraine join the group, who had no idea about our shared heritage with Scotland,” she says, as we stroll along Princes Street, the city’s main artery.Scotland’s Ukrainian population has grown since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, with about 5,000 refugees arriving via Edinburgh. But, as Nataliya points out, the ties go back centuries. Dominating the horizon, the crenellated outline of Edinburgh Castle looms large. It houses St Margaret’s Chapel, built in the 12th century and named after a queen thought to be a quarter Ukrainian. Edinburgh and Kyiv were also formally twinned in 1989, Nataliya adds. We pass the Scott Monument, its blackened gothic spires piercing the sky. At its base, a kilted busker skirls a haunting tune on the bagpipes.View image in fullscreenSt Margaret’s Chapel at Edinburgh Castle.Photograph: McPhoto/Ingo Schulz/AlamyWe are soon puffing our way up and down the leafy slopes of Calton Hill, pausing first at a plaque to Saint Wolodymyr – who helped bring Christianity to Ukraine more than a thousand years ago – and then at the Holodomor memorial stone honouring the seven million Ukrainians who died in the forced famine of 1932-33. “It’s a reminder that these things must never happen again,” Nataliya reflects.A short walk away lies Royal Terrace, on the eastern edge of New Town, a handsome Georgian sweep of sandstone townhouses by the Scottish architect William Henry Playfair. Tucked between swish boutique hotels and stately homes, blue-and-yellow flags flutter at the Ukrainian community centre.The arrival of recent refugees has rekindled pride among Edinburgh’s older Ukrainian diasporaInside, a plate of homemade potato dumplings, cooked by the centre’s summer camp children and topped with a dollop of sour cream, awaits. As we tuck in, Nataliya explains how the arrival of recent refugees has rekindled pride among Edinburgh’s older Ukrainian diaspora, whose first major wave came in the 1940s: “The newcomers helped them reconnect with a culture that had gone underground.” Today, the centre hosts coffee mornings, cookery classes and language lessons for the Ukrainian community, alongside a rolling programme of concerts and film screenings open to all.View image in fullscreenAerial view of Royal Terrace and Regent Terrace.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyBack out on the street, trams rumble by as we head west, passing familiar landmarks, including a bronze Sherlock Holmes, keeping watch at Picardy Place in tribute to his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, born just around the corner. In the shadow of the redbrick Scottish National Portrait Gallery lies our final stop: the Square, a Ukrainian-owned cafe that opened in 2023.This modest slip of a building, with its slate-grey facade and plant-fringed window, is easy enough to miss. Inside, though, it’s quietly pioneering: the first place in the city to serve both Scottish and Ukrainian staples (though not on the same plate). The full Scottish breakfast – haggis, tatties and all – sits alongside Ukrainian classics such asholubtsi(cabbage rolls stuffed with lightly spiced meat).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within minutes of sitting down, the table groans under bowls of steaming borscht, plates piled high with dumplings, andderuny(crisp golden potato pancakes drenched in parmesan sauce). Just as I think I can’t manage another bite, out comes the grand finale:syrnyky– sweet curd-cheese pancakes swimming in velvety berry juice – as Nataliya shares what creating the tour has meant to her personally.View image in fullscreenScottish and Ukrainian dishes are served at the Square on North St Andrew Street in Edinburgh’s New Town.Photograph: Simon WilliamsThe art of the city: a walking tour of Edinburgh’s best landscape sculpturesRead more“Putting the tour together made me realise just how many Ukrainian landmarks are hidden across this city,” Nataliya says. “It’s about finding connections between seemingly distant cultures.”As we wrap up, I’m handed a doggy bag for the journey home, a gesture that feels more like leaving a favourite grandma’s kitchen than ending a walking tour. An experience that initially seemed a little leftfield now makes perfect sense within the context of this city, I realise.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Google’s new cheapest Pixel 10 has been upgraded with more cameras, a faster chip and some quality software that has brought it out of the shadow of its pricier Pro siblings to set a new standard of what you should expect from a base-model flagship phone.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The regularPixel10 costs £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) – the same as last year’s Pixel 9 – undercutting the 10 Pro by £200 and matching rivals from Samsung and Apple while offering more for your money.The design is almostidentical to the Pixel 9, except for some new bold colours and the all-important new third camera in the pill-shaped lump on the back. The satin aluminium and glass body feels like a quality piece of hardware and the design certainly stands out in a sea of samey slab phones. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp, super-bright and smooth with a 120Hz refresh rate.View image in fullscreenThe fast screen and rapid under-display fingerprint scanner help the Pixel 10 feel very responsive in use.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe glass back hides another upgrade: Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support.

It also supports 15W wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe new Tensor G5 chip is about 34-38% faster than Google’s previous top processor in testing, which is quite a leap for the brand, but still falls short of the raw performance of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chip used in rivals. The Pixel feels rapid in operation and will handle most things just fine.The battery life is solid if not class-leading. It manages roughly two days of light usage between charges or about 33 hours of heavy use, including five hours of 5G out and about with seven hours actively using the screen. Most people will need to charge it every other day.The Tensor G5 also includes a significantly faster AI processor that runs Google’s advanced AI quicker and handles more complex systems on-device, making the Pixel a showcase for Google’s AI prowess.Android 16 with AIView image in fullscreenGoogle’s new Magic Cue, Daily Hub and Camera Coach AI features.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Pixel 10 runs the latest Android 16 out of the box and comes with software supportuntil August 2032. Google’stake on Androidis full of bold colours, big buttons and fun typography with plenty of nice touches and haptic interactions throughout the system. It’s a quality experience even if you choose more subtle colour combinations.The Pixel is a vehicle for some of Google’s most advanced AI systems, running the latest version of Gemini Nano on-device, which powers all sorts of AI features including various writing, dictation and image-editing tools. A flashy new voice translation system for phone calls can speak to you in a simulacrum of the caller’s voice, rather than one of the default Gemini voices.But Magic Cue is the most advanced new AI feature which runs locally on your phone and aims to be your little assistant running in the background on your device to proactively help you do things faster on your phone. It combines information from your Google account with multiple data sources on your phone to pop-up suggestions of useful information when using certain Google apps. For instance, it pulled up my order confirmation emails in a little card in the phone app when I called to check where my delivery was, giving me one-tap access to the order number.Or if someone texts about when your flight is due to land, it shows the time and date pulled from your calendar ready to send them with a single tap. The weather app suggests locations for your upcoming trips from your calendar, too.These things don’t sound particularly exciting, but are a step in the right direction for AI away from flashy gimmicks to useful little background time savers. Magic Cue currently works with Gmail, maps, calendar, Keep notes, screenshots, contacts and messages, with Google Photos and a few other Google apps coming soon. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t work in third-party apps yet, so if you use WhatsApp rather than text messages it can’t help you.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is fairly simple to use but has plenty of tools and modes to make the best of your photography.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Pixel 10 features a 10.5-megapixel selfie and three rear cameras: a 48MP main, 13MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto. It addresses the main complaint about the base-model Pixel phones, which have lacked a telephoto cameras.The main and ultrawide cameras produce excellent images across a range of lighting conditions, doing better than rivals at this price in higher contrast scenes or dimmer indoor lighting. The new 5x telephoto significantly closes the distance to objects shooting great photos and reaching up to 20x digital zoom if needed. The photos from all three cameras show a little grain when viewed at full crop, but most will be very pleased with them.Google is still the best at reliably producing good images without much thought. The new auto Best Take mode improves on the popular group shot Best Take system by shooting multiple images to automatically blend them together for an image where everyone is looking at the camera. In most photos it won’t have to do too much, but the more people and the more complex the situation, the more the AI intervenes.View image in fullscreenThe large pill-shaped camera bump on the back acts as a rest for your fingers and stops the Pixel rocking around on a table.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe popular Add Me feature allows the photographer to be added in to larger and more complex group shots, and has been improved to support larger groups of people, more complex backgrounds and images of pets. The camera app also now addsC2PA content credentialsto photos that show how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved.One of the most overtly AI tools is the new Camera Coach feature, which uses Gemini to help you compose and frame a shot for a better picture. Press a small button at the top of the viewfinder and it sends the current view to Google’s servers to analyse and suggest several different possible compositions. Select the one you like the look of and it guides you through the steps of moving the camera, framing the shot and taking the photo. In testing, the suggestions were pretty good, so for anyone interested in improving their photography, this could be a low-key way of getting a bit of help.Overall, the Pixel 10 shoots great photos and videos with generally helpful AI additions, particularly with Best Take and Add Me, but it is possible you end up with images of a moment that may never have actually happened.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenPixel 10s sold in US lack the nano sim slot in the top of the phone and must rely entirely on eSims.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batteryis rated to lastin excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repairwith manualsandparts available.The Pixel 10 is contains 32% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report and willrecycle old devicesfor free.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 costs from£799(€899/$799/A$1,349) in a choice of four colours.For comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro costs from£999, thePixel 9acosts£399, theSamsung Galaxy S25costs£799and theiPhone 16costs£799.VerdictThe Pixel 10 sets a new bar for base-model flagship phones, offering a high-quality experience and great camera with a meaningful telephoto zoom that doesn’t feel like a poor second cousin to the Pro models.The outside has not changed a lot since last year but it is an attractive design that stands out in the sea of rather samey phones, at least from the back. It feels snappy in operation, even if it doesn’t have the fastest chip available, and the battery lasts a decent 1.5 to two days between charges.Some of the new AI features actually seem like meaningful improvements, particularly Magic Cue, auto Best Take and other small bits that run locally in the background while you are doing things. Combined with Gemini, Google is leagues ahead in the era of actually useful AI tools compared with rivals such as Apple, and it doesn’t get in the way of the core smartphone experience.It is not quite the killer bargain ofGoogle’s cheaper Pixel 9abut the Pixel 10 is one of the best phones you can get and great value nonetheless.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x telephoto, great screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, good size, fast fingerprint and face recognition.Cons:face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 is an attractive, quality-feeling flagship smartphone that is better than rivals.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsPixelGoogleSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Each session brings a new theme: one week it’s crochet, the next jewellery-making, the week after that they learn latte-art. Coffees are sipped, biscuits are passed around and chatter fills the room.This is theGirls Craft Club, founded earlier this year by art history graduate Gabby after a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorderleft her feeling isolated. “We were all going through life problems,” she says. “We decided to make something beautiful out of it. When you make your own bag or repair your clothes, you value them differently. And you value yourself differently, too.”What may seem like pure nostalgia is, in fact, part of a wider cultural shift. Across the UK, gen Z is embracing hobbies once more associated with their grandparents or great grandparents: crochet and knitting circles, pottery cafes, mahjong nights and supper clubs that echo Come Dine With Me. These “slow” pastimes are flourishing, not because they are a retro trend being revived, but because they offer something people feel is urgently missing: connection, purpose and respite from digital fatigue.This return to analogue hobbies is happening against a bleak national backdrop. Britain’s teenagers are among the unhappiest in Europe. In its Good Childhood report last year,the Children’s Societywarned of a youth happiness recession, with just over 25% of 15-year-olds in the UK reporting low life satisfaction, compared with 7% in the Netherlands.For many who came of age during lockdowns, the need for real-world connection is acute. Nights out are expensive, the cost of living crisis is biting hard, and hours of doomscrolling after working from home have left young people exhausted. Slow hobbies offer a counterweight: affordable, screen-free – and often physical – skills. While some of these are female-led initiatives, the joys of creative community appeal to all. For Carmine Valente, 34, a regular at a pottery cafe in Fulham, west London,pottery painting is one of the only times he fully switches off. “It’s calming and I always leave relaxed – a brilliant way to catch up with mates while doing something creative,” he says.View image in fullscreenLatte-art at the Girls Craft Club in Edinburgh.Photograph: Meghan Gibson Photo/HandoutThe appeal is multifaceted. Emma, 23, from London, who regularly attends London Creative Gals club, says: “It is about connection and rebuilding community after the isolation of the pandemic, but it’s also about cost, with free events or £10 craft sessions undercutting the price of a night at the pub.”“Purpose is another factor,” says Sabah, 24, from Blackburn, who is part of a dog life drawing group. “And the ability to develop practical and creative skills that feel meaningful.” James Chapmanagrees: “There’s something so special and unpredictable about dog life drawing. I’ve been many times, drawn many dogs, and it’s the kind of event that always manages to surprise me.”A sense of purpose is something Gabbyalsovalues: “You get something real, you make genuine connections, and you switch off. Everyone mentions wellbeing and being off phones – it’s a real mental break.” It feels like part of a growing trend, she says, “where being in a new space and doing a creative hobby becomes an accessible and great way to feel connected to people in your area and develop new skills.”View image in fullscreenPottery painting can help people switch off.Photograph: HandoutThe therapeutic benefits of the craft activities themselves are cited as another draw. “The process forces you to slow down, and use your hands in a meditative and repetitive way to do something proactive rather than reactive,” says Sarah P Corbett, founder of the global Craftivist Collective. “Stitch by stitch you regulate your breath, relax your body, and be mindful.” As Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology at UCL and author of Art Cure, explains: “Gen Z have a proactive focus on mental health, and they recognise the value of these hobbies and the role art plays in regulating biological stress levels.”In Belfast, the search for community has taken the form of supper clubs. When Fiona Fitwi startedCooking With Friends Archivesin 2022, she simply wanted to make more friends. She began cooking meals in art galleries and selling tickets for £45 a head, with guests encouraged to bring their own drinks. Groups of 12 to 27 gather to eat, talk and disconnect from technology. “It feels better to pay £45 for a supper club than £50 on a night out you won’t remember,” she says.Fitwi has been in London over the summer for culinary school. “When I moved, half of my leaving party were people I’d met through Cooking With Friends Archives,” she says. She has now received a grant from Belfast city council to host a free supper club in October, in recognition of the need for accessible community events like hers.In Edinburgh, Gabby’s craft circle offers a similar mix of community with a splash of creativity. “Rotating crafts keeps things fresh,” she says. “It helps people discover new skills, build confidence and connect with others in a safe, supportive environment.” Sessions cost up to £30, though some are free, and participants often leave with two or three pieces of jewellery, stitched bags, or crocheted items.“We’ve lost touch with creating,” Gabby says. “When you create something tangible, your confidence grows and you see yourself in a different light.” For many, the screen-free evenings are as important as the skills themselves: small rituals that help people to slow down in a culture that often feels relentlessly fast.The benefits of slow hobbies are not just anecdotal but backed by research. A 2024 survey of more than 7,000 UK adults by Anglia Ruskin University found that arts and craftsproduced greater life satisfactionthan paid work.“With so much of our life being on Zoom, screen-free craft spaces have become medicine for gen Z,” says Corbett. “People love to use their hands for something bigger than themselves and value the time they spend away from phones and computer screens.”In Sheffield, Nottingham and Leeds, artist Liah has found a different way of bringing people together. Herdog life drawingsessions began in 2018, when Sheffield University wanted to host student union events that didn’t revolve around alcohol. Nowadays, these sessions attract about 40 people each week. At about £11 for a two-hour class, they are a cheap evening out and wildly popular with students who miss their pets back home. Some arrive as beginners; others come to rekindle a childhood passion for art. “It’s fun, but also therapeutic,” Liah says. “People come alone and leave with friends.”View image in fullscreen‘Special and unpredictable’ … a dog life drawing classPhotograph: HandoutThe Fulhampottery cafe, which opened in 1998, has found unexpected new life with gen Z. Guests can paint ceramics, order a drink from the licensed bar, and spend a few hours creating something lasting. Prices start at £7.95 for a session, plus the cost of a piece, ranging from £6 to £60. “We’ve noticed a real increase in younger visitors since the pandemic,” says Ahmed, who helps run the studio. “You come out feeling as if you have just been to therapy. We host first dates, mates, family reunions. It is a real community hub.”In Manchester,The Read Roomis reinventing the book club. Each month, more than 130 people gather in a dimly lit venue as an author reads aloud from their work. Guests receive a free copy of the book, a welcome drink and a goodie bag. Sponsored by car brand Cupra, the event is free to attend. “When do you ever get a full room in Manchester to be totally present and social?” says one guest, Nathan, 28. “This is powerful!”“We wanted to make reading sexy again,” say the co-founders Sophia Wild and Kya Buller. “Lots of people loved reading as kids but stopped because it wasn’t seen as cool. Now they’re coming back and engaging with literature again.” The sessions often end with drinks or dancing, but the focus remains on reading, and on creating a community.“People don’t go to a run club to run,” says Fitwi from Cooking with Friends Archive. “They go to make friends and have a chat. These hobbies are the same – but they’re also about supporting each other and building community.”View image in fullscreen‘We wanted to make reading sexy again’ … Sophia Wild and Kya Buller.Photograph: HandoutThe benefits extend beyond individual mood. Fancourt from UCL has identified lots of social benefits of these hobbies: “Whether practised alone or in a group, hobbies such as crochet and knitting become part of your social identity, functioning as a vehicle for reducing loneliness and building community.”For Gabby, these hobbies have become a lifeline. “As life speeds up, we need to actively decide to slow down,” she says. The craft workshops also give participants practical, sustainable skills, helping them learn to repair, create, and treasure what they own – a counterweight to a throwaway culture dominated by fast consumption.From book clubs to crochet, drawing to pottery, gen Z is building a new social life from old materials. Against the backdrop of a youth mental health crisis, these slow hobbies are more than quaint diversions. They are small acts of resistance against digital exhaustion, isolation and a culture that measures worth in productivity.In the hum of craft and conversation, Britain’s young people are building something important: connection.Explore more on these topicsHobbiesYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he is to join a panel entitled “How can Reform succeed in office? Saving British democracy and lessons from Trump” alongside the rightwing historian David Starkey.Farage will address his supporters inside the huge Birmingham National Exhibition Centre (NEC) on Friday at 4pm, preceded by a 10-minute speech from a mystery special guest. The Conservatives fear a big-name defection but Reform watchers note that Farage does not like to be outshone at his own events.Ahead of the conference, Faragewas in the USembracing more openly hard-right rhetoric by calling the influence of Islam in the UK “literally catastrophe”, and praising Donald Trump’s mass round-up of migrants in the US.Migration had fundamentally changed the UK, he told Fox News, speaking before he gave evidence to a congressional inquiry on “Europe’s Threat to American Speech and Innovation”.“You said to me once, you went through parts of London, you didn’t even recognise it to be England,” he told the host, Sean Hannity. “So, please, America, take the warnings. Recognise why President Trump is brave and true and right to control the southern border and to make sure you keep your American culture.”View image in fullscreenFarage testifying at the inquiry.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesWhile immigration will undoubtedly be a major focus back in Birmingham, the official theme of the conference is a bland one, with Reform saying it will focus on “the next step” in its own growth. Since last year’s event, it has expanded from 80,000 to nearly 240,000 members, rising from 19% to 30% in the polls, and securing 900 councillors across 12 local authorities.With Reform having led the polls for around six months, the Tories and Labour are both nervous about the level of business and lobbying attention the party is likely to attract.Heathrow is sponsoring a lounge, while the housebuilder Thakeham, which has previously given almost £1m to the Tories, is advertising in the party’s conference brochure.The crypto industry, which Farage has pledged to deregulate, will also have a prominent presence. Yusuf will be in conversation with Stani Kulechov, the Finnish founder of a company called Aave Labs, while another firm called Zebec Technologies is hosting an event on “strengthening the rule of law” as well as “improving economic competitiveness” through encouraging cryptocurrency and blockchain.The party is also welcoming a tobacco firm, Japan Tobacco International, as host of an event on “revitalising the great British high street”.Climate change sceptics will be out in abundance, with one fringe session on “climate realism” led bythe Heartland Instituteand attended by former deputy Ukip leaderLord Christopher Monckton.View image in fullscreen(Left to right) Richard Tice, Sarah Pochin and Lee Anderson are all scheduled to speak.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAFor the first time, there will also be a substantial number of fringe events hosted by thinktanks, charities and others, plus a diplomatic presence from the embassy of Israel and the government of Gibraltar. The party has been selling a “diplomatic guest” pass for £500 a head.Among those confirmed to be attending was the embassy of Albania, whose prime minister has engaged in an online spat with Farage. The Reform UK leader eventually accepted an invitation to visit the country on condition that he would discuss the return of Albanian prisoners.Alongside the more overtly ideological rightwing outfits including the Adam Smith Institute, the Taxpayer’s Alliance and the Institute of Economic Affairs, there will be several non-aligned or centrist organisations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We can no longer be the disrupters. We have to be the next government. People will rely on us not to make a hash of things, so what greater task is there than to be those responsible for the next government? And it is a task that we take with the utmost seriousness,” he said.Towler instanced the demand for Reform spokespeople. He had been asked by Sky News to “top and tail” their coverage of Farage’s keynote speech on Friday evening while also appearing on a range of panels on the same day.View image in fullscreenTowler at a farmers’ demonstration at Whitehall last December.Photograph: Benjamin Cremel/AFP/Getty Images“It will be different this time. We will have motions put forward by branches, there will be an extensive fringe. It doesn’t have to mean we have weakened our radical zeal, but it means we are happy to engage with people and corporate Britain.”More in Common, the thinktank founded after the murder of MP Jo Cox that aims to dissuade politicians and others from pursing so-called “culture wars”, will also be releasing polling of Reform UK supporters and hosting a fringe event.Those taking part include Professor Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe.“This is a party which is ahead in the polls and setting the political weather. Why would we not go?” he said. “The key thing for Reform will be to have a conference that makes them look professional, a party of government, and also makes money for them. But, rather than us, the key indicator of how they are doing will be how many businesses turn up. Businesses tend to have a good nose for who is heading for power.”With that in mind, Reform is working to ensure the conference appears as professional as possible and avoids the kind of chaos rearing up over the past year, with the party already having lost its former deputy leader Ben Habib, London mayoral candidate Howard Cox and MPs Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock.Yusuf also had a major public falling out with the party,quitting as chairand saying it was not worth his time, beforebeing persuaded backby Farage.Yusuf will now receive major billing on the Friday of the conference before Farage’s own speech, showing his continuing importance. Lee Anderson, the unpredictable former Tory deputy chair and now Reform MP, also gets a Friday speaking slot, while the deputy leader Richard Tice and MP Sarah Pochin are speaking on the Saturday.The mood of the conference would be “celebratory but not complacent” and above all aiming “to avoid unforced errors”, says one senior party figure. With newly elected councillors, mayors, rising stars and a panoply of big egos in the party all jostling for attention on the stage and at the fringe, that will not be easy.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the fastest the police have seized was capable of 70mph. What will stop the rise of these souped-up and potentially fatal vehicles?Sam WollastonThu 4 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareAbusy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate inLondonand Sgt Stuart Ford of the City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road. “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d still pull him over and have a look.”Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery ofUberEats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.”E-bikes aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is theclick click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.The trouble is a lot of e-bikesaren’tlegal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they wouldn’t catch me,” he says.The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the company’s.”Back at Bishopsgate police station, Ford shows me the pound with some of the other bikes they’ve seized over the past few days (from here they get taken away to be crushed). There’s one that’s probably 500 or 750W. The pedals aren’t even connected to the chain to turn the wheel – it’s not even pretending to be a bicycle. Several have been converted from regular pedal bikes, using kits, also readily available. Again, not illegal in itself, so long as the motor is not bigger than 250W – you can generally tell from the size of the hub on the rear wheel. A few seconds on my phone, and I’ve found a 3,000W conversion kit, made in China, that I can have delivered for £142.59. I can’t see anything about it being illegal to ride on the road in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘This is basically a motorcycle’ … PC David Parker (left) and PC Harry Rose stop delivery rider Mahede Hasan for riding an illegal e-bike in the City of London.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianFord estimates that about three-quarters of the illegal e-bikes they deal with are ridden by food delivery riders. They’re getting wise to the clampdown. “They’ll come down the road, see us, spin round, that’s usually a giveaway they’re on an illegal bike. We’ll then try to catch up with them if we can.”E-bikes – usually high-powered, ready-made ones – are also the vehicle of choice for gangs of phone snatchers, Ford adds: “Because they’re so quick, and they can’t be detected because they’ve got no licence plates and [if the riders are wearing helmets] you can’t see who they are.”What about the people who aren’t committing any other crimes, who just want to get around a bit quicker, most likely in order to make a half-decent wage? The issue is, says Ford, that these illegal e-bikes are in effect motorbikes. “These people have passed no test, have no road training and don’t have the road skills. They just get on and ride around without insurance, tax, the bike not conforming to lights and everything else it should conform to, it’s not registered with the DVLA, all these things.”Ford shows me another one they’ve just impounded; it looks more like a motorbike than a bicycle. He invites me to lift up one end to feel the weight of it. “Imagine if that hit you – or a child – at 30, 40mph.” The fastest one they’ve seized was capable of 70mph.Christine White doesn’t know how fast the e-bike that hit her dad was going. On the morning of 6 July 2023, 91-year-old army veteran Jim Blackwood was sorting the bins outside his house in Rochester, Kent, when a man on an e-bike coming down the hill ran into him. White, who was staying with her parents at the time, ran out in her pyjamas. “Dad had managed to get up and was hanging on next door’s gate,” she tells me.View image in fullscreenChristine White with her father, Jim Blackwood, who was killed after being hit by an e-bike.Photograph: Courtesy of Christine WhiteIt didn’t initially seem that bad – Jim had a scrape on his cheek and was bleeding from his finger. But in hospital they found he had internal injuries – a bleed on the brain and an artery in his kidney was ruptured. After an operation, there were more complications, a heart attack and infections. He ended up spending three months in hospital before being sent home for palliative care. He died on 13 October. Before the accident, Jim had been in great health. “I expected him to get to 100, no problem,” White says. The rider is now awaiting trial on charges of manslaughter and “causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving”. He has not yet entered a plea.White thinks the way e-bikes are classified should be updated, even legal e-bikes (she doesn’t know if the one that hit her dad was legal or not). “For me, an e-bike is no different to a 50cc moped, except it’s electric rather than petrol-powered. The government has been far too slow to bring in proper regulations. They should need insurance, and a registration plate, be identifiable.”Her father had four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She says her mum has trouble coming to terms with the fact that her husband, who served with the British army for 26 years, in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and before that clearing mines in Malaysia, is no longer around. “Mum says he survived all that and then he gets killed outside his front door.”Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for Leeds North, calls the danger posed by illegal e-bikes “a crisis hiding in plain sight”. He’s chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, which this summer publisheda report on the issue. Its findings highlighted a surge in battery fires caused by unregulated e-bike conversion kits, low-cost batteries and poor-quality imports. In 2023, the London fire brigade attended 179 incidents involving e-bike or e-scooter fires. That December,28-year-old Mohsin Janjua diedwhen his e-bike battery caught fire at his home in Bradford. The APPGCW report also highlights the online marketplaces selling unsafe products with little or no oversight, enforcement or legal liability. “It never ceases to amaze me that you can sell a product that is illegal to be used on the roads,” Hamilton tells me.He’s a big fan of legitimate e-bikes, and has a British-made folding one himself. “I love it. When I finish this call I’m going to get on my e-bike and ride home. It will never catch fire because it is properly designed and has proper battery management systems.” And if he’s rushing home, at 15.5mph the electrical assistance will cut out. “I do go faster than that, but by using the muscles in my legs.” It cost £1,600 – cheaper than the equivalent Brompton, he says, but almost certainly not in Mahede Hasan’s price range.The exploitation of gig-economy riders, who are incentivised to use faster, illegal bikes to meet delivery targets, is also underlined in the report. “Deliveroohas been sold for £2.9bnto an American conglomerate [a takeover by rival company DoorDash], and that’s off the back of the most shocking exploitation of some of these riders, most of whom daren’t give their names because they’re in the country illegally,” says Hamilton. “What happens, I’m told, is that people who pay people smugglers to get into this country are told they can pay the money back by taking this job for the next three years and earning their way back out of it. So it’s even worse for them, because they don’t even get to keep the paltry amount they get paid for the deliveries that they make, which they have to do illegally. It’s a circle, isn’t it? And you’ve got to break that circle somewhere.”View image in fullscreen“It never ceases to amaze me that you can sell a product that is illegal to be used on the roads” … Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for Leeds North, on his legal e-bike.Photograph: EstarliHe compares it to what was going on in the 19th century. “When theFactory Actswere passed, MPs said we’re going to need to have inspectors to enforce them or they’ll just be ignored by the exploiters. So they introduced theFactory Inspectorate, which stopped children being exploited in factories to earn vast profits for the owners. This is a new form of industrial revolution where the most vulnerable are being exploited but now they’re foreigners, people who have come here for asylum or economic migration.”Hamilton, and the report, call for a number of things: for online retailers to withdraw unsafe e-bikes from sale; making retailers legally accountable for unsafe listings; ending the loophole that allows them to be sold under the guise of off-road use; and a safety Kitemark for legal bikes. Additionally, it calls for enforcing compliance from delivery companies, requiring them to run checks on the bikes used by couriers; and rights and protections for gig-economy riders.Celestino Pereira, originally from Brazil, came to the UK – legally – in 2019, and began working in London as a rider forDeliveroo. “You only need a phone and a bicycle, just show the number and pick up the order, no need to speak English, so it was good for me.”Pereira began on a pedal bike, but found it impossible to make the minimum wage, so when he had enough money he got an e-bike – a road-legal one, for about £500 – and was initially able to get a few more orders. But three weeks after getting it, the e-bike was stolen outside a block of flats in south London.That’s when he decided to give up on e-bikes. He thinks the legal ones aren’t suited to real-world working conditions. “Many models don’t allow for battery replacements, so riders have to sit idle for hours, waiting to recharge. When replacement batteries are an option, they are so expensive.” Pereira got a petrol moped, which meant he had to do CBT (compulsory basic training), have a licence, get insurance, all of which cost him money. He estimates that about 70% of food delivery riders in London are on illegal e-bikes, and he understands why. “They’re cheaper than legal ones and are faster, so you can complete more orders, and they can have more batteries so you don’t have to stop to recharge.”Pereira estimates that now, with his moped, he makes about £11 an hour. He knows people who are struggling to make seven or eight pounds. “The companies have no interest in the wellbeing of the workers, it’s about minimising the costs and maximising returns.” As soon as his son is old enough to go to and from school on his own, he will try to find other work, he says.A Deliveroo spokesperson says: “We take our responsibilities regarding road safety in the communities we operate in very seriously. All riders are provided with road safety information when they join, and we have a number of partnerships in place to give riders access to safe and affordable e-bike rentals. We will investigate and stop working with the rider if they are in breach of their obligations to follow the rules of the road.“Each rider has a minimum guaranteed rate of pay of £12.30 an hour for the period on an order, but in practice most orders pay more than this.An Uber Eats spokesperson says: “Uber Eats is fully committed to tackling illegal work and the criminal networks who are often behind it. We have taken a number of steps, including introducing state-of-the-art identity and document-video verification technology, but we are constantly reviewing our tools and finding new ways to make sure that everyone on our platform has the right to work.”And so back to Hasan, now speaking to me a couple of weeks later from the flat he shares with his parents in east London. His seized bike will probably have been crushed by now. He was also fined £300 and given six points on his driving licence. Again, he stresses that he didn’t know the bike was illegal, and can’t understand how online platforms are allowed to sell them. He also questions the £300 fine. “The first time, if people don’t know, they should give you a warning.”Hasan has got another e-bike; he needs to work. This one is legal, he was assured at the shop: 250W, 15.5mph limit, no throttle. It cost £900, he’s paying in instalments, and it’s going to take a while.E-bikes could slash our reliance on cars – but overpowered illegal models on the roads make us all less safeRead moreHasan says he makes £50-60 for an eight- or nine-hour shift. “On a busy day, sometimes £70. In a week I can make £350.” He hasn’t got a Bangladesh sticker for the new bike’s front mudguard yet, but he does have something to look forward to: he’s heading there at the end of the month to see his wife. They married in 2023, but she can’t join him in the UK. “Unless you earn good money, you cannot bring your spouse. You have to be earning nearly £30,000, and you can’t earn this money doing a delivery job.”There’s a reason illegal e-bikes are illegal: they’re dangerous – to other people on the road, to pedestrians, often to the riders themselves. Still, looking at the bigger picture – of an industry that exploits vulnerable people while making huge profits, and online marketplaces that sell unsafe products with no liability or retribution – it’s hard to see a 21-year-old from Bangladesh, struggling to make the minimum wage, as the bad guy in this story.Explore more on these topicsCyclingPoliceLondonDeliverooWork & careersUberImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Such low-frequency deceleration tends to be associated withhigher levels of motion sickness.We’d like to hear from people about their experiences of feeling car sick while being a passenger or driving in an EV.

And that is possible if we’re disciplined,” he said, adding that there would be no cuts to healthcare spending, education transfers or transfers to individuals.In remarks critical of his predecessor,Justin Trudeau, Carney said the rate of government spending was too high and outpaced the growth of Canada’s economy – a view shared among senior cabinet ministers who also held top-level posts under the previous prime minister.“Will there be tough choices to make? Definitely. Is the nation ready? I would say yes. I mean, Canadians have elected us to do things differently,” the finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, said on Thursday of the “leaner” federal workforce he and Carney envisioned.Crown Royal dethroned in Canada as whisky company shifts some operations to USRead more“We said we’re going to spend less so we can invest more. And you know, people understand that. My mother understands that.”At the same time, Carney has promised a significant increase in defence spending and faster development of major infrastructure projects – both of which will require billions in government spending. In June, Carney said Canada would reachNato’s 2% military expenditure target this fiscal year, five years ahead of his previously announced schedule.“One of the reasons that the Liberals have become known as the ‘natural governing part of Canada’ is because they tend to shift their policies toward wherever the voters are going and have less of an ideological core than a right-leaning party like the Conservatives or the left-leaning party like the New Democrats,” said Elizabeth McCallion, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “Their main capability is being able to sit across that centre line to wherever the voters are most interested, and capturing those votes and enough votes to get them seats.”McCallion said the recent focus on austerity and the sharp departure from Trudeau’s spending on progressive programs “is not surprising” because the party “acts like a chameleon” to capitalize on what voters seem to want in the moment.Those policy shifts have produced challenges for Carney, however.Running April’s federal election on an elbows-up policy that vowed to fend off the threat fromDonald Trump, Carney has been forced to contend with the reality that the American and Canadian economies are deeply enmeshed.“There’s a dichotomy within his image of this guy who’s going to fight for Canada versus someone who won’t take an inflammatory situation and make things worse,” she said. “Carney is trying to walk this fine line between someone who will fight, which is what Canadians wanted, and then being the guy who’s not going to, you know, have inflammatory policies and make things worse by fighting back too hard.”In August, Carney announced his government would remove a handful of retaliatory tariffs in a sign of goodwill towards the US as the two sides worked to finalize a trade deal.Jean-Marc Léger, a prominent Canadian pollster, was invited by the Liberals to speak with ministers and told reporters that tariffs had slipped in importance among Canadians.“Last year, they were the No 1 issue and that’s one of the reasons this government was elected,” Léger said. “Today, it’s changed. Now, they only rank fourth.”Léger said the economy was a central issue among voters and that Carney’s team were trying to make it the “centre” of their government.As well as attempting to reconcile apparently contradictory promises to save and spend, Carney also seems to be seeking to strike a balance in his relations with Trump,whose threats to Canadian sovereignty defined the prime minister’s election.Eyebrows were raised when Carney invited Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a rightwing thinktank with close ties to the White House, to address the ministerial meeting. The Heritage Foundation was a key architect ofProject 2025, a proposal that envisioned an ultra-conservative reshaping of the US federal government.Roberts cancelled his appearance, but not before the invitation prompted controversy within the Liberals.“It’s an interesting strategy to kind of invite the opponent into your fold, and try and figure them out a little better,” said McCallion. “Because when it comes to figuring out what the White House wants, increasingly it feels difficult to figure out where the goalposts are. Maybe talking to the Project 2025 team will help with understanding of what is a real ask and what is a distraction?”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyTrump tariffsEconomic policyEconomicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Roughly 70% of homicides in Mexico are perpetrated with a firearm – and more than two-thirds of firearms recovered from crime scenes and submitted to tracing were sourced from the US.But in the US, the annual overdose death rate is similarly high, at 21.5 per 100,000 people. And the majority of overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl.Some states, like West Virginia, have overdose deaths rates on a level with the homicide rates of the most violent states in Mexico.“Narratives that [place] casualties and costs of the war on drugs predominantly in the Global South are inaccurate in the context of synthetic opioids and, in particular, fentanyl,” wrote the authors. “The result is a region, not just one country, with high levels of excess mortality.”Mexico has been under intense pressure to show that it is tackling fentanyl trafficking, with the Trump administration designating six Mexican organised crime groups – including the Sinaloa cartel – asforeign terrorist organisations(FTOs).One thing the FTO designation could be used for is to prosecute individuals involved in firearms trafficking who demonstrably provide “material support” to such groups in Mexico.But for now, despite a recent fall in seizures of fentanyl on theborder that both governments have celebrated as a sign their interventions are working, the situation in the US remains unchanged.“There’s no shortage or price changes reported [in the US],” said Farfán-Méndez. “And that suggests we don’t have any less fentanyl.”Explore more on these topicsUS-Mexico borderFentanylDrugsUS gun controlCaliforniaMexicoArizonanewsShareReuse this content"

They point you to your seat and help with your luggage, before giving the safety demonstration, and preparing the plane for takeoff. And there’s a good chance they have done it all for free.But a tentative deal between AirCanadaand thousands of flight attendants has sparked hope more airlines will end a little-known reality for many North American cabin crews – and pay flight attendants when planes are not moving.“The Air Canada strike helps negotiations everywhere,” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA)-CWA, which represents about 55,000 flight attendants at 20 different airlinessaid in a statement. “It defined the problem of ridiculous expectations for flight attendants to work without pay.”More than 10,000 flight attendants at Air Canadawalked offthe job last month, in a battle with management that centered on pay during boarding and unboarding of flights.The three-day strike at Canada’s largest carrier snarled global summer travel, prompted the country’s government to force binding arbitration and led to atentative dealthat includes at least 60 minutes of ground pay before each flight, at 50% of a flight attendant’s hourly rate.The demonstrations by workers, and concessions by Air Canada on pay, “place additional pressure on management everywhere to get real in negotiations”, added Nelson.Air Canada indicated it would gradually increase the pay of flight attendants for an hour before flights on narrow-body jets, and 70 minutes on larger, wide-body aircraft, reaching 70% of full wage for ground work within four years – dashing flight attendants’ hopes of full compensation for this work, but shifting away from the established practice of no pay until flights are in motion.Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, says the agreement could serve as a foundation for a “new norm” across the continent. “This deal becomes the new standard,” she said, after the deal was agreed, “because … other unionized flight attendants that have the ability to demand better at the bargaining table will be looking at this collective agreement to say, ‘we want that, too’.”Airline employees in the US are covered under theRailway Labor Act, which does not mandate direct hourly pay, unlike theFair Labor Standards Act, which covers most other public and private sector workers.For a generation, flight attendants for most airlines across North America have not been paid for their work during boarding of planes. Delta Air Lines became the first big carrier to change this in 2022, in the midst of a union organizing drive.Alaska Airlines and American Airlines followed. United Airlines has indicated it stands ready to do so, too, although a tentative agreement was voted down in July, with bargaining under federal mediation set to recommence in December.Things are changing. “Air Canada and its flight attendants agreed on a formula for ground pay that is over and above what Delta introduced in 2022, and what American and Alaska have agreed since,” said John Gradek, an aviation expert and business professor at McGill University in Montreal.The deal will probably influence contract negotiations for WestJet flight attendants in 2026 in Canada, added Gradek, and may provide a window for United flight attendants to secure better boarding pay deals, too.‘Most of our passengers have no idea’“We’re working more, we’re working harder, and we’re not getting enough pay to make our bills every month,” said Jen Sala, a longtime flight attendant at Frontier Airlines who serves at president of its AFA union. “Flight attendants deserve to be paid for every single hour we work. Airlines shouldn’t be able to pick and choose the hours that they pay their employees.”About 4,100 flight attendants at Frontier Airlines voted last September to authorize a strike with99.6%in favor, as they have been fighting for a new contract since 2023 that includes boarding pay for flight attendants. The union is currently in federal mediation with the airline.Frontier Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.“We can fly upwards of 15 hours in a day and only get paid for three and a half. Our flight attendants don’t make a living wage,” said Becky Black, a flight attendant for nearly 22 years at PSA Airlines, which operates flights for American Airlines. “We have a flight attendant who lives in a homeless shelter. We have flight attendants that are living in crew rooms. We have flight attendants who are 30 years old and have to move back in with their parents because they can’t afford to live with this job.“Most of our passengers have no idea that we are only paid from the time the door closes until the door opens.”Unlike flight attendants directly employed by American, flight attendants working for PSA are not paid until the plane door is closed and the pilot releases the parking brake.Black, a member of the PSA’s union negotiating committee, is one of1,500 flight attendantsat the airline who have been in negotiations for a new union contract for two years, with negotiations currently under mediation.Flight attendants at PSA are expected to report 45 minutes before a flight, and have to arrive at the airport earlier to get through security screening, Black said. Their pre-boarding procedures, including safety checks and boarding passengers, take at least an additional 30 minutes.“We’ve been on duty, but we haven’t been getting paid yet. We get paid for the flight time. And when we land and the door opens, we stop getting paid at that point, and we do the deplaning,” Black said. “Our time does have value, and we do deserve to be paid for what we’re doing. And that’s where the boarding pay comes in.”The union representing flight attendants at the airline authorized a strike with a99.2%vote last September, and have held severalpicketdemonstrations since to raise awareness and support for securing boarding pay and wage increases that align with other American flight attendants in their union contract, as PSA flight attendants are paid 40 to 45% less than flight attendants directly at American.“We’re there to hold your hand when you’re afraid of flying, to talk to you or hold your hand when you’re traveling to a funeral for a loved one, to save your life if you’re having a heart attack in the middle of a flight, or to put out a fire,” said Black. “We’re there to evacuate the airplane in 90 seconds to make sure that you all get off safe and get to your family. And we’re not asking for much. We’re just asking for respect, to be respected for the job that we do for American Airlines, and to have a livable wage.”American Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment. PSA Airlines did not comment on the boarding pay issue. “We share the same goal as our flight attendants to get a deal done,” said a spokesperson. “With the support of the National Mediation Board, we continue to meet regularly with the AFA and have made progress toward reaching an agreement that our flight attendants deserve.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsCanadaAmericasAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Of the 63 seats being contested, preliminary results showed the JLP winning 34 seats and the PNP 29.In his victory speech, Holness promised to continue delivering for the country. He said: “In our second term we created a momentum. We are on the right path, heading in the right direction with the right trajectory. That should not be broken and the Jamaican people share that view and therefore we will continue to use the momentum to accelerate the development of our country.”The JLP rode to victory after a strong performance during their previous two terms. Under Holness’s leadership, Jamaica has improved its economy and significantly reduced crime.The World Bank has praised“significant strides” in reducing public debt, from more than 140% of GDP in 2013 to 73.4% in the financial year 2023-2024, and the economy is expected to grow by 1.7% this year.Caribbean leaders back Jamaica petition to King Charles for slavery reparationsRead moreThere has also been a drastic reduction in crime under the JLP, with a 43% drop in killings so far this year, marking the most significant decline in decades. The improvement is largely credited to the current administration’s increase in firearm seizures and a stronger, coordinated security force presence across the Caribbean island.The prime minister was also able to convince voters that he could be trusted after the PNP put the spotlight on concerns raised by the national anti-corruption body, the integrity commission, about his income and assets declarations and recommended further investigation by thefinancial investigations division, a specialised unit within the finance ministry.The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, gaining permission fromthe supreme court to challenge the reportwhich he branded unlawful and unfair.Defending himself during a debate with the opposition a few days before the election, he said: “I have been investigated, for a year, with an expert forensic auditor. The findings of that report have suggested no corruption. There have been no charges. Every aspect of my report, every aspect of my personal life and my personal financial details are in the public domain.”In his victory speech he thanked voters for standing by him. “Make no mistake about it, this was not victory by default. Make no mistake about it, this was not an easy victory. Make no mistake about it, this was a fight. But, my political organisation, we did not descend to the gutter to fight,” he said, adding that his party “proved that we can run a decent campaign and win”.The PNP has made significant gains since the last election in 2020. Golding, who analysts say came in as the underdog, has exceeded expectations and is expected to gain 15 seats.Conceding defeat, Golding said to supporters: “It’s my duty as a believer in democracy to acknowledge and concede the result and to congratulate our opponents, the Jamaica Labour party, for their victory tonight.“Jamaica’s democracy is important and we must cherish it. Sometimes it brings bitter disappointments. Sometimes those disappointments are laced with a tinge of a sense that not all is fair and just, but it is very, very important that we put democracy ahead of all of those feelings and I accept the result of these elections.”Commentators raised concerns about the poor voter turnout, with under 40% of the just over two million registered voters on the island of 2.8 million people making it to the polls, according to preliminary results.Holness stressed that the country’s democracy had proven to be intact. “We do have our concerns about the turnout, but [for] the people who voted, the majority spoke and chose Jamaica.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian independently confirmed the continued presence of most of them last week, using commercial civilian maritime tracking platforms.On Wednesday, Taiwan’s presidential office spokesperson, Karen Kuo, called forChinato “clearly explain” its actions and “immediately cease illegal deployment and exploitation activities in the economic waters of countries in the region, including Taiwan”.“This not only violates international legal norms such as the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (Unclos), but also seriously undermines the international order and poses uncertain risks to regional stability,” she said.Kuo said Taiwan’s defence and security agencies were aware of the situation and were “conducting a comprehensive review of the patterns and risks of the related activity”.Experts told the Guardian that the activity fitted into Beijing’s pattern of using both military and commercial activity to gain control over disputed territory, particularly in the South China Sea andaround Taiwan, which Beijing is preparing to annex as a Chinese province.That such activity had continued essentially in plain sight for five years, without a response from Taiwan, surprised analysts.“Failure to protest today risks normalising sovereignty shaving and encourages further encroachment,” the Jamestown report warned.But analysts also said Taiwan was very limited in what it could do about it. Taiwan’s political status means it is not party to the UN convention on the law of the sea or its arbitration mechanisms. Domestic law about which parts of the EEZ border are enforced by Taiwan is unclear and Taipei does not have the maritime strength to challenge such activity.William Yang, the senior north-east Asia analyst with the International Crisis Group, said Taiwan first needed to clarify which agency was responsible and then establish a set of diplomatic and law enforcement responses, including increased support for more coastguard patrols.“Without these initial steps, it will continue to struggle to effectively address these challenges,” Yang said.A spokesperson for Taiwan’s ministry of defence, Col Chiao Fu-chun, told the Guardian the ministry was aware of the vessels operating near the Pratas Islands – which Taiwan calls the Dongsha Islands – and could “assist our coastguard to respond when needed”.Kuo said Taiwan would “cooperate with relevant countries in the region” to seek joint responses. Last month Japan protested against similar activity by Chinese oil rigs inside its EEZ, and Vietnam and Korea have also made similar complaints in the past.Yang said: “If Taiwan can make a strong connection between these Chinese grey zone activities, it could encourage other countries with more diplomatic leverage and resources to incorporate the challenges that Taiwan is facing into their potential collective regional responses.”Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

All eyes have been onChinathis week as the second biggest global economy flexed its muscles.Dozens of world leaders, including from the global south, authoritarian pariah states and the EU, attended China’s largest ever military parade on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China calls the war of resistance against Japanese aggression.China’s president, Xi Jinping, was flanked by the Russian and North Korean leaders,Vladimir Putinand Kim Jong-un, in what has widely been called a show of defiance to the west. It is the first time all three leaders – who were chatting and shaking hands as they walked the red carpet in Tiananmen Square – have been seen together.The others in attendance included Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian, and Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing.It was a highly choreographed display of power from the emerging (emerged?) global superpower, with a formidable guest list that was designed to send a message to the rest of the world.But what was that message? How does Xi hope to reshape geopolitics, and what will a more confident China mean for global human rights? I spoke to Amy Hawkins, the Guardian’s senior China correspondent, to find out. That’s after the headlines.Five big storiesUK news|Deputy PM Angela Rayner has admitted sheunderpaid stamp dutyon her £800,000 seaside flat, after coming under intense pressure to be more transparent about her property arrangements.Russia|Vladimir Putin hasinvited Kim Jong-unto visit Russia during a lengthy meeting in Beijing on the sidelines of China’s biggest military parade, as Kim promised to do “everything I can to assist” Moscow.Police|The Metropolitan police havedeclined to drop their investigationinto the comedy writer Graham Linehan for tweets about trans issues, and said that the law used by officers to detain him needs reviewing.Israel|Israeli dronesdropped four grenadesnear UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon, the agency’s force said on Wednesday, in what it described as “one of the most serious attacks” on its personnel since a November ceasefire.Portugal|A day of national mourning has been declared in Portugal after at least15 people were killedwhen Lisbon’s well-known Gloria funicular railway car derailed and crashed on Wednesday.In depth: China’s display of mightView image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square yesterday.Photograph: Alexander Kazakov/AFP/Getty ImagesChina’s massive display of military hardware and personnel was the culmination of a week of diplomatic grandstanding. The weekend before the military parade, dozens of leaders had descended on Tianjin, in northern China, for the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.Amy Hawkins told me that when the annual summit first started in the 1990s, it included China,Russia, and several central Asian countries. “It has since expanded to 10 members and several more partner countries. It now also includes India and other Eurasian countries, central Asia, and other non-western, largely autocratic countries. The grouping represents nearly half of the world’s population and positions itself as an alternative to US-led multilateral organisations.”During the summit, Xi Jinping announced plans to accelerate the creation of a development bank and set up an international platform for energy cooperation, in partnership with Russia and India. The summit was Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’sfirst visit to Chinain seven years.Leaders from the US such as Donald Trump (more on him in a bit), western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and other major democracies were not in attendance at the summit or the military parade.“Instead, you had the leaders of Russia, North Korea, Iran, Myanmar, Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and other global south countries. It showed a united front from these anti-western or anti-US countries. It was a display of might and getting behind China’s vision,” Amy said.Reshaping the global orderThe US is seen as the undisputed global superpower, but China has, in recent years, been on its tail vying for the top position. What would a world dominated by China’s political, military and economic might look like? Amy explained China has no real interest in replacing America as the world’s police because it conceives of the global order differently from the US.“China’s principle is that it doesn’t get involved in other countries’ affairs, but whether that’s actually the case in reality is debatable. China has always said they respect other country’s sovereignty. It rejects the idea of universal values. And that’s obviously very appealing to smaller and often autocratic countries who don’t want to be told what to do by the US, and don’t want to be criticised for their human rights records,” Amy said. “It is more that China wants to reshape the global order in a way that’s suitable for its aims both domestically and abroad.”While China says it rejects the idea of a so-called “new cold war” with the US, the week’s summit and parade show a real hardening of a China-led bloc of largely authoritarian, anti-western leaders, Amy said. “This week really showed the pull of Beijing’s power and signalled its aim of reshaping the global order.”Many analysts specifically focused on the show of a united force between Xi, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. “It’s the first time the three have been seen in public together. China has always had a close relationship with Russia and North Korea, but in the past year or so, Russia and North Korea have independently become closer and they’ve signed a mutual defence treaty. North Korea has sent thousands of troops to help Russia during its war in Ukraine, and has sent weapons,” Amy said.“And as Russia and North Korea become closer, there was some speculation that China was being frozen out of the anti-western bloc. But by having all three leaders together in Beijing, with it being Kim Jong-un’s first reported international trip since 2019, it reaffirms that China is the most powerful player in that relationship.”Peace vWarXi’s speech during the military parade warned that the world was facing a choice between “peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum”.“It was aggressive and while these speeches are often quite bombastic – it is a military parade after all – it wasn’t the kind of speech that was trying to placate or calm any western fears about China’s military might,” Amy said.The 70-minute parade featured tanks, drones, long-range and nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft. There were reports of the J15-DT, China’s new carrier-based electronic warfare jet, and a new submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile.“China has been learning lessons from the war in Ukraine and has been thinking specifically about how it might fend off an assault on Taiwan and any aid that comes to Taiwan in that event,” Amy said.Xi and the Chinese Communist party claim Taiwan is part of China, with which it vows to “reunify”. Taiwan’s democratically elected government and its people are opposed to this.In response to the parade, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, said: “The people of Taiwan cherish peace, and Taiwan does not commemorate peace with the barrel of a gun.”The end of US-China cooperationThe US had its own military parade overseen by Donald Trumpin June, but it is notable how underwhelming it was when compared with Beijing’s. The US president was watching the events that took place in China, responding in typical Trump fashion on his Truth Social platform.“He sent this sarcastic message saying, ‘Congratulations to Xi, Putin and Kim, enjoy conspiring against the US,’” Amy said. While on one level he was critical, “Trump clearly has sympathy and admiration for the idea of showing off your country’s strengths through a massive military parade. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he was also a bit jealous.”Another key message from this week was the end of the so-called “golden era” of US-China cooperation, most notably on climate change. “The US has become increasingly hawkish on China, both under Trump and Biden. The mood in China is that there’s not really much room to negotiate with the US. There’s no love lost between the two countries,” Amy said. “What’s important to China is to build up its alliances that are independent of any western system; such as ensuring energy security by buying more oil and gas from Russia and ensuring stability on the border with North Korea.”The rise of China’s dominance comes off the back of a US global retreat, which will have an impact on human rights. Amy explained that cuts to USAID funding, which supported civil society groups, as well as the US’s erratic policies around tariffs as part of Trump’s America First agenda have left a vacuum on the global stage. And much to its delight, China doesn’t even need to be proactive in filling it.“Many countries see China as the more reliable partner, economically, politically,” Amy said. This is especially true for smaller and less powerful countries who once looked to the US for support, she added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

email,free appordaily news podcastNatasha MayHealth reporterThu 4 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 19.36 EDTShareTheNew South Walesenvironment watchdog sat on a report for four years linking elevated levels of lead in children’s blood to current mining, and promised mining companies they would not do any “finger-pointing”, new documents tabled in state parliament show.The documents include internal emails released under freedom of information laws that show the scientist who produced the report into lead exposure in Broken Hill was at one point texting the Environment Protection Authority every two days asking when it would be published.According to an email from a manager summarising her briefing to the mining companies, when the agency did release the report,it told them the EPA would “quietly load it onto the LeadSmart website and not tell anyone”, and said they would ensure there was “no fanfare or media release” and that they were “not doing any finger-pointing at the mines”.The NSW Greens said the documents, tabled in the state parliament last week, exposed a “concerning culture” within the EPA, with the party’s mining spokesperson, Cate Faehrmann, expressing alarm that it had taken four years before the research was finally published in late 2023, and accusing the EPA in parliament of suppressing it.Prof Mark Taylor delivered hisreport summarising all of the existing published scientific researchon environmental lead risks at Broken Hill, where there has beenlong-term mining of the metal, to the EPA in 2019.Emails show lead mining companies in Broken Hill were given access to the report and its findings at least a year before it was made available to the general public.A NSW EPA spokesperson said the community was provided with the draft report in 2020.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailTaylor was commissioned to lead the review by the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Program, which was established under the EPA in 2015 as part of a$13m state government commitmentto address the issue of lead exposures and elevated blood lead levels in children in Broken Hill.The report stated the level of lead in the blood of almost half (49%) of children under five and more than three-quarters of Indigenous children (76%) in the town remained elevated, and found the available research made clear that both past and current emissions from mining operations were the “leading source” of environmental exposure in the western NSW town.While the report did not look at the harms related to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood, theNSW government’s LeadSmart websitestates unborn babies, infants and young children are most at risk of harmful health effects from lead, particularly on “brain development, which may cause behaviour and learning problems that can last a lifetime”.The documents, which were released to a Mudgee community group opposing proposals for a lead mine in their region, have revealed the email correspondence between Taylor and EPA officials beginning in March 2022 when he begins to “chase up” when his report would be made publicly available.Taylor eventually became so frustrated that he wrote in a 28 June 2022 email: “Eventually, I will just send it to the library – it’s becoming so old it’s embarrassing it’s not out.”The EPA officials acknowledged it was a “really important piece of work” and apologised to Taylor for all the delays, blaming the “bureaucratic tangle when the EPA restructured” as the reason for the delay.In August 2022, officials were planning to have the report published before further emails in September and October cited the “need to socialise the report” with the mining companies and “understand any concerns they might have” before it was published.The documents show Taylor was asked to make a presentation to the mining companies which he said he was “happy to do” but noted that “to the best of my knowledge, it’s been circulated previously to the miners and in all honesty, there’s nothing in here that they don’t already know or ought to know”.The documents show that a meeting with lead mining companies CBH and Perilya went ahead on 3 November and managers noted it “went well” but “we [BHELP] have a ways to go to gain their trust”.In an email on 9 January 2023 the same manager wrote: “I think we will have to push the mines and get the report out.”A senior EPA official wrote to the new EPA chief executive in March 2023: “I understand that the mining companies are also particularly sensitive about the report and would prefer that we didn’t publish it … they have pretty much refused to engage, other than to say that they would prefer they weren’t published.”When EPA managers begin discussing a media strategy, emails show, they noted that the timing of the Cadia goldmine parliamentary inquiry was an “issue”.A manager writes in another reply: “when we say ‘release’ we mean quietly load it onto the LeadSmart website and not tell anyone”.On 26 October the manager sought permission to publish the report, noting: “I am now receiving texts from Mark Taylor every 2 days asking where it’s up to.”The emails also reveal the EPA offered to brief the mines in advance of publishing the report, and told them the report would be published to the website with “no proactive media,” and that holding lines have been prepared in the event of any media, which “reference the long-standing and complex nature of the problem”, and “we are not doing any finger-pointing at the mines”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News

As soon as I became aware of this, when I became head of this agency, we moved expeditiously to brief the Minister and release it.”Chappel said he couldn’t support Faehrmann’s “characterisation”.Faehrmann said the suppression was important because it occurred at the same time as Bowden’slead, zinc and silver mine in Mudgee was being assessed, and also meant it was not available to the parliamentary inquiryinvestigating the impacts of heavy metals mining, including lead.More than 100 charges brought over Sydney asbestos mulch crisis after major NSW EPA investigationRead moreIt’s not the first time concerns have been raised about theEPA failing to make information public.Guardian Australia revealed last yearthe regulator had known for more than decadethat producers of a type of soil fill made from construction and demolition waste were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community.Faehrmann told the Guardian: “Instead of taking action to protect babies and young children from toxic lead exposure, government officials have tied themselves in knots to protect a dangerous industry.“It’s outrageous that the mining companies had access to this report for at least a year while it was withheld from an upper house committee investigating the impacts of heavy metals mining, including lead.“Now that we know how long they sat on this for, the government must immediately report on its progress towards implementing everything that Mark Taylor said was needed to reduce blood lead levels.”A NSW EPA spokesperson said the authority “refutes the suggestion that the Broken Hill lead report was suppressed”.“The community was provided with the draft report in 2020 through the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Program steering committee, which included the Broken Hill Aboriginal community and the stakeholder community group convened by Broken Hill Council,” an EPA spokesperson said.“The draft was also shared with other government agencies and industry, which is common practice.”Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesNew South Wales politicsHealthMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

But he later said some countries would provide guarantees while remaining outside Ukraine, for example by helping to train and equip Kyiv’s forces. He did not say how many troops would be involved in the guarantees.The Ukrainian president hailed the move. “I think that today, for the first time in a long time, this is the first such serious concrete step,” he said.US contributions to the guarantees would be finalised in the coming days, Macron said.The meeting of 35 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” – of mainly European countries – was intended to finalise security guarantees and ask the US president for the backing that Europeans say is vital to make such guarantees viable.Many European countries including Germany, Spain and Italy have refused so far to provide troop commitments. A German spokesperson said: “The focus should be on financing, arming and training the Ukrainian armed forces,” a formula that is not vastly different from what Europe is now providing.Alarmed European leaders travelled to the White House in the wake of theAugust Alaska summitbetween Trump and Vladimir Putin fearing that the US president may be about to force Volodymyr Zelenskyy into a humiliating surrender, including loss of territory.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron hosts the video call summit at the Élysée presidential palace in Paris.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/ReutersTrump responded to the European lobbying by claiming he had won the Russian leader’s agreement to hold direct talks with the Ukrainian president, butRussiarejected any such commitment and largely maintained its demand for the surrender of Ukrainian territory and a commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato.Trump had set a deadline of 1 September for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, but Trump is known to set deadlines that he then ignores.“We had a great relationship,” Trump said of Putin in an interview with the rightwing news website The Daily Caller. He said he was now very disappointed in the Russian president: “Thousands of people are dying; it’s a senseless war.”Europe has been desperate to ensure Trump does not wash his hands of the war, but it has been unable to convert Trump’s stated frustration with Putin into a plan to try to strangle the Russian economy.Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv offers retort to Putin for ‘messing around’ by demanding Moscow talksRead moreMacron in Paris sought to give the impression that Europe, unlike Russia, stuck to its commitments. He said: “The contributions that were prepared, documented and confirmed at the level of defence ministers under the strictest secrecy allow us to say: this work is complete and will now be politically approved.”Europe has been hoping for months that Trump would activate long-promised sweeping economic sanctions on countries that import Russian oil. The 50% tariffs that the US imposed on India, partly for importing Russian oil, appear to have driven the traditionally non-aligned Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister,closer into the arms of China and Russia.Stung by his diplomatic failure so far, Trump has given the impression of wanting to focus on domestic policy, including crime and the economy.The US was represented at the Paris talks by Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who also met Zelenskyy separately.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has met repeatedly at military and political level but not published any detailed plan of action, reflecting internal divisions and uncertainty about the nature of the US contribution.In a breakthrough of sorts, the plan for Europeans to buy US arms for use in Ukraine has started to bear fruit. On 28 August, the US state department announced the delivery of 3,350 ERAM long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, worth $825m (£615m, €705m).The funding came from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the US, but the financial contribution of each country was not disclosed. The ERAM missiles have a range similar to that of the Franco-British Scalp-EG missiles, which Ukraine fired at occupied Crimea and the Russian region of Kursk.Zelenskyy said he had not seen “any signs from Russia that they want to end the war”.Kim Jong-un promises to do ‘everything to assist’ Moscow after Putin meetingRead moreThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said it was not for Putin to decide if European troops would be stationed inside Ukraine. He said: “I think we really have to stop making Putin too powerful.”The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, described Putin as the most severe war criminal of our time.On Wednesday in Beijing, Putin attended a military parade alongside Xi Jinping and hailed Russian forces’ progress in Ukraine, saying troops were advancing on “all fronts”.But there are signs that sanctions are finally taking a toll on the Russian economy after two years of high growth fuelled by defence spending.The Sberbank chief, German Gref, one of Russia’s most powerful bankers, warned on Thursday that the economy was stagnating and that unless the central bank cut interest rates then the country would fall into recession.Russia’s war economy grew at 4.1% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024 but it is slowing sharply under the weight of high interest rates required to dampen inflation.Explore more on these topicsEuropeUkraineRussiaEmmanuel MacronKeir StarmerWar crimesTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The city’s mayor has also asked Carris, the municipal public transport company that operates the service, to investigate.On Thursday evening the public prosecutor said five Portuguese people, two Koreans and a Swiss national were among those killed when one of the funicular’s two cars derailed and crashed into a building. The injured include Portuguese people as well as two Germans, two Spaniards and one person each from Canada, Cape Verde, France, Italy, Morocco, South Korea and Switzerland.Carris said one of its workers, a brake operator, died in the crash.LocatorThe injured people, five of whom were seriously hurt, were being treated in several hospitals in the Lisbon region. One of the most badly injured victims died in hospital overnight, raising the initial death toll from 15 to 16.Earlier figures from the civil protection agency had suggested 17 people were killed, but the toll was corrected on Thursday afternoon.Teams of pathologists from the national forensics institute worked through the night on postmortems, officials said. The Portuguese authorities suspended Lisbon’s other funiculars for safety checks after the derailment.Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Montenegro called the crash a “tragic accident that transcends borders and a pain that knows no nationality”, and he promised a quick investigation to establish what had gone wrong.View image in fullscreenPolice officers inspect the site.Photograph: Armando França/AP“The competent authorities will swiftly carry out the necessary investigations to determine the cause of this tragic accident,” he said. “We will determine all responsibilities with a sense of respect for all those who suffered and are suffering the effects of this accident.”The two vehicles on the funicular railway, known as the Elevador da Glória, go up and down a steep hill in central Lisbon in tandem, with one going the opposite way to the other.The leader of the Fectrans union, Manuel Leal, told local TV that workers had complained that problems with the tension of the cable that hauls the carriages had made braking difficult, but that it was too early to say if that was the cause of the crash.1:22Aerial footage shows wreckage of Lisbon funicular crash – videoFootage showed the wreckage of the yellow-and-white car lying on its side in the narrow street it ran along. Its sides and top were crumpled and it appeared to have crashed into a building where the road bends. Parts of the vehicle, made mostly of metal, were crushed.Witnesses told local media that the streetcar careened down the hill, apparently out of control. “It hit the building with brutal force and fell apart like a cardboard box,” Teresa d’Avó told the TV channel SIC.Another witness, Bruno Pereira,told CNN Portugalthat the car at the bottom of the hill had suddenly jerked off the track and on to the pavement, just before the other one came hurtling down “and struck the walls like a rock”.View image in fullscreenPolice officers guard the area.Photograph: Armando França/AP“The other tram – which counterbalances this one – arrived, completely out of control, crashing into the walls, people screaming. It hit the last time at the curve between Calçada da Glória and Rua da Glória and stopped with a loud crash,” he said.“There was panic. We all ran, everyone there. Some people tried to pull people out from under the tram … There were cobblestones everywhere, and the metal grooves, on which the car ran, were all popped out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Striking a similar note, Slovenia’s president, Nataša Pirc Musar, described Israel’s policy as “genocidal” and questioned how some politicians, including in EU countries, could tolerate displacement, destruction of homes and acute shortages of essentials for Palestinians in Gaza.And in an exceptional rebuke, 209 former EU ambassadors and diplomatic staff wrote to EU leaders last month to voice“profound disappointment”that no substantive measures had been taken by the bloc to put pressure on Israel to end its brutal war on Gaza.As European leaders face pressure to act, this month’s UN general assembly (UNGA) may be another moment that showcases Europe’s divisions overIsrael, including the question of Palestinian recognition.France,the UK, Canada and Australia have signalled their intention to recognise Palestine at the UNGA, which would be a powerful symbolic move by three G7 countries and two UN permanent security council members.About a third of EU countries already recognise Palestine. The first group of these includes several central and eastern European countries that did so in 1988 under the orbit of the Soviet Union, including Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. The group includes Hungary, which today is led by Viktor Orbán, one of the staunchest defenders in Europe of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.While Czechoslovakia was part of this group, the Czech Republic describes the 1988 statement as “a political act due to the politics and organisation of international relations at the time”. Prague says it supports a two-state solution, but does not recognise Palestine nor intend to “unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state”.A second group consists of western EU member states that recognised Palestine in response to Israeli policy and actions in recent years. Swedenrecognised a Palestinian state in 2014, soon after a Social Democrat government was elected with the support of pro-Palestinian Greens and a leftwing party. Ireland, Spain and (non-EU) Norway took the decision in May 2024 in response to Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, seeking to keep alive a two-state solution.Soon they will be joined by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta. Emmanuel Macron announced in July thatFrance would recognise Palestine“true to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”. This week Belgium became the latest EU country to declare it would recognise Palestine, after complex negotiations nearly tipped its five-party government into crisis. As part of the compromise, Belgium’s royal decree on recognition will not be issued until the last Israeli hostage held by Hamas is released.As the Belgian debate revealed, Israel’s war on Gaza has roiled European politics, dividing parties and shaking fragile governments. The Dutch government has ruled out recognition for now but lost its foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, a former ambassador to Israel, whoquit the caretaker government in Augustover his coalition partners’ veto on tougher sanctions against Israel. Finland has also declined to recognise Palestine, amid splits on the issue between the country’s president and prime minister, although both are members of the same centre-right party.View image in fullscreenCaspar Veldkamp resigned as the Netherlands’ foreign minister after the cabinet failed to support enforcing sanctions on Israel.Photograph: Sem van der Wal/ANP/AFP/Getty ImagesMartin Konečný, the director of the European Middle East Project, a Brussels-based NGO, argues that Palestinian recognition is a significant step but risks becoming an empty gesture without pressure on Israel to change course over the destruction of Gaza and the construction of illegal settlements in the West Bank.“If you are recognising Palestine and want the Palestinian state to exist then you need to couple it with pressure on the Israeli government which is currently doing everything to destroy Palestine on the ground,” he said. “[The Israeli government] is destroying, physically, Gaza and it is expanding settlements in such a way in the West Bank that is making the two-state solution … impossible, so Palestine is being wiped off the map and that’s not an exaggeration.”Israel’s president to visit London next Thursday for expected talks with ministersRead moreNearly two years after Israel launched its retaliation for the7 October attacks, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, the EU has not taken any measures against the Netanyahu government. In nearly 23 months, Israel has killed more than 63,700 people andinflicted a human-made famineon Gaza. The EU foreign policy service concluded in June that Israel wasbreaching human rights obligationsand later outlined possible sanctions. The European Commission has proposed arguably the mildest possible measure – apartial suspensionof Israel from the EU’s research programme. Yet this has failed to find the necessary majority, with Germany and Italy declining to support the move.Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, who until 2023 was the EU’s representative to the Palestinian territory, having also served as its envoy in Jerusalem, has concluded that for now there will be no EU collective response on Gaza. He helped organise the recent diplomats’ letter to EU leaders, the third in a series, urging action against the Israeli government.The latest letter, sent in August, called on European countries to take individual action against Israel, such as banning weapons sales, ceasing cooperation with Israeli universities, ending trade in goods and services from illegal settlements and sanctioning human rights violators where possible. The letter continued to urge common EU sanctions, although Kühn von Burgsdorff thinks the EU is stuck for now.He told the Guardian that individual member states should work outside EU formats, joining forces with countries in the global south. “I am seeing a configuration whereby the EU becomes less relevant on the Gaza file and coalitions of the willing across the regions will have more impact,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But that said, the president’s own words have helped legitimise the collective punishment of Palestinians, language that international jurists have warned could fall foul of the genocide convention.”However, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee who has been a strong critic of Israel, said “efforts should be made to engage” with Herzog, who has often been at odds with Israel’s hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over domestic issues.“The question must be asked – how do you see Israel in 10 years? What is the future for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza? If you have no reasonable alternative plan, Mr President, then there must be a Palestinian state,” she told the Guardian.“But the only solution to this is through politics, through discussion. Herzog is easier to talk to than many in the extreme rightwing government in Israel. But we mustn’t pull our punches.”Calum Miller, the Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said Starmer should “seize this chance to state unequivocally to president Herzog that there must be an end to the suffering in Gaza through an immediate ceasefire”.Downing Street has previously indicated that Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK after the international criminal courtissued an arrest warrantfor him over alleged war crimes in Gaza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,” said Herzog in October 2023.That statement was given additional weight when it was included in the international court of justice’s order of 26 January 2024, finding the right of Palestinians to be protected from genocide was at “imminent risk” and saying Israel must ensure “with immediate effect” that its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the genocide convention and to protect Gaza’s population from genocide.Herzog claimed his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him.Starmer last met Herzog more than a year ago in Paris shortly after he was elected as prime minister, where he praised the “historic friendship between Israel and the United Kingdom” and reiterated the demand for the return of hostages and “support for Israel’s right to self-defence”.But Starmer and Lammy have since adopted a more critical position on Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have killed more than 65,000 people, according to the territory’s health ministry.Sanctions have been imposed by the UK government on two hardline Israeli cabinet ministers and Starmer has announced plans alongside France to recognise the state of Palestine this month.However, there remains considerable anger and concern within Labour and elsewhere that the UK has done too little to halt the suffering of Palestinians.Last week the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said heplanned to boycott a state dinnerto be hosted by King Charles during Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in a fortnight’s time – in protest at the US’s lack of pressure on Israel to end the war.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

When the mother was released after 53 days she found the children begging on the streets.The Sde Teiman military base at one point held so many sick, disabled and elderly Palestinians that they had their own hangar, dubbed “the geriatric pen”, a soldier serving there said.The scale of civilian detention indicated by Israel’s own data has been revealed in an investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication+972 Magazineand the Hebrew-language outletLocal Call.Israeli military intelligencekeepsa database of more than 47,000 named individuals whom it classifies as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters.Commanders consider it the most accurate informationIsraelhas on enemy forces, according to multiple intelligence sources. It is based on information including files captured from Hamas, updated regularly and includes names of new recruits.In May this year the database listed 1,450 individuals in detention, whose files were marked “arrested”. That is equivalent to just one in four of all Palestinians fromGazaheld in Israeli jails on suspicion of militant links since 7 October 2023.At that point in May Israel had detained 6,000 people under its “unlawful combatants” legislation, which allows indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial, official data released after legal appeals showed.Israel is also holdingup to 300Palestinians from Gaza suspected of taking part in the 7 October attacks. They are in criminal detention because Israel says it has sufficient evidence to prosecute them, although no trials have been held.Both rights groups and Israeli soldiers have described an even smaller ratio of fighters to civilians. When photos of Palestinians stripped and shackled caused international outrage in late 2023, senior officerstold Haaretznewspaper that “85 to 90 per cent” were not Hamas members.The Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights has represented hundreds of civilians held in Israeli jails. “We believe the proportion of civilians among those detained is even higher than Israel’s own figures suggest,” said Samir Zaqout, Mezan’s deputy director.“At most, perhaps one in six or seven might have any link to Hamas or other militant factions, and even then, not necessarily through their military wings.”Israel’s military said it had returned more than 2,000 civilian detainees to Gaza after finding no connection to militant activity. Israel was fighting enemies who “disguise themselves as civilians”, but those releases demonstrated “a thorough review process” for detentions, the military said in a statement.It did not dispute the existence of the database or the figures for May, but claimed that “most” detainees were “involved in terrorist activities”.In May 2,750 Palestinians were permanently interned as unlawful combatants, and another 1,050 had been released under ceasefire deals, the military said.Israeli politicians, the military and the media often refer to all detainees as “terrorists”.That includes Fahamiya al-Khalidi, an 82-year-old with Alzheimer’s who was abducted with her female carer in Gaza City in December 2023, and held in Israel for six weeks under the unlawful combatant law, prison documentation shows.She was disoriented, could not remember her age and thought she was still in Gaza, according to a military medic who treated her in Anatot detention centre after she injured herself on a fence.“I remember her limping badly toward the clinic. And she’s classified as an unlawful combatant. The way that label is used is insane,” the medic said. Photographs confirm his presence at Anatot at the time.The Israeli military said Khalidi was targeted “based on specific intelligence concerning her personally”, but the arrest should not have gone ahead.“The detention was not appropriate and was the result of a local, isolated error in judgment,” the military said, adding that “individuals with medical conditions or even disabilities can still be involved in terrorism”, citing Hamas’s former military chief Mohammed Deif.Israel’s unlawful combatants legislation allows indefinite detention without producing evidence in open court.The state can hold someone for 75 days before allowing access to a lawyer and 45 days before bringing them in front of a judge to authorise the detention. At the start of the war, those periods were extended to 180 and 75 days respectively. There have been no known trials of anyone captured in Gaza since 7 October 2023.Tal Steiner, the director of the Public Committee Against Torture, said: “As soon as the wave of mass arrests began in Gaza in October 2023, there was serious concern that many uninvolved people were being detained without cause.“This concern was confirmed when we learned that half of those arrested at the beginning of the war were eventually released, demonstrating that there had been no basis for their detention in the first place.”State figures on the number of unlawful combatants were given to the group after it launched a lawsuit. One soldier who served at Sde Teiman military prison, which became notorious for abuse, described mass detentions of elderly and severely ill people.“They brought men in wheelchairs, people without legs,” he said, adding these detainees were sent to a “geriatric pen”. “I always assumed the supposed excuse for arresting patients was that maybe they had seen the hostages or something.”Hassan Jabareen, the director of the Palestinian legal rights group Adalah said Israel’s unlawful combatants legislation was “designed to facilitate the mass detention of civilians and enforced disappearances”.“It strips detainees of protections guaranteed under international law, including safeguards specifically intended for civilians, using the ‘unlawful combatant’ label to justify the systematic denial of their rights.”The military medic who treated Khalidi said he also treated a woman bleeding heavily after a miscarriage and a breastfeeding mother who had been separated from her baby and asked him for a pump to stop her breast milk from drying up.View image in fullscreenAbeer Ghaban realised in interrogation that officers had confused her husband, a farmer, with a Hamas member of the same name.Photograph: Enas TanteshAbeer Ghaban, 40, who was held with Khalidi inside Israel, was separated from her daughter aged 10, and two boys aged nine and seven, when she was detained at an Israeli checkpoint in December 2023.Although officially still married, she was raising them alone, so when she was taken away the children were on their own.She realised in interrogation that officers had confused her husband, a farmer, with a Hamas member of the same name. One conceded his error after comparing photographs, she said, but she was kept in jail for six more weeks.Israeli troops deployed to guard Palestinians often opposed releasing civilians cleared of any Hamas links, an Israeli stationed at a military facility said. They wanted to hold them indefinitely as leverage in hostage negotiations.“We kept releasing people ‘for free’, and it made [soldiers] angry,” the source said. “[The soldiers] would say: ‘They’re not returning hostages, so why should we let them go?’”Israeli politicians have expressed similar sentiments.When Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Gaza’s Shifa hospital, was released last year, Simcha Rothman, chair of the Knesset’s constitution, law and justice committee, complained that he was freed “not in exchange for hostages”.Rights groups suspect this approach has unofficially been a driver of mass detentions throughout the war. “Even before 7 October, Israel withheld the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians, using them as bargaining chips instead of returning them to their families for burial,” said a spokesperson for Al Mezan.‘We are dying for no reason’: Israeli reservists face fresh call-up for a war dividing their nationRead more“We believe the thousands of civilians from Gaza now in detention are likewise intended to be used as bargaining chips.”The majority of people held as unlawful combatants are also effectively keptincommunicado, deepening anguish for both those in jail and their loved ones in Gaza.When Ghaban was released, she found her children begging in the street. “They were alive, but seeing the state they had been in for 53 days without me broke me,” she said. “I wished I had remained in prison rather than seeing them like that.”The unlawful combatants legislation has been used to facilitate the “forced disappearance of hundreds and even thousands of people”, said Jessica Montell, the director of the legal rights organisation HaMoked.Nesreen Deifallah spent months searching for her 16-year-old son, Moatasem, who went to look for food on 3 December 2024 and never came home, even checking decomposed corpses in hospital morgues in case she recognised his clothes.View image in fullscreenMoatasem before his detention.Photograph: Courtesy of Nesreen DeifallahIn August a recently freed detainee told Deifallah he had been held with Moatasem. “I fainted when I learned that my son was still alive,” she said. Still she cannot confirm where he is, or contact Moatasem, who was sick, according to the man.By August Israel’s prison service held a record 2,662 unlawful combatants, data obtained by HaMoked showed. An unknown number more are in military detention facilities.One Israeli officer who led mass arrest operations in Khan Younis said soldiers saw no difference “between a terrorist who entered Israel on 7 October and someone working for the water authority in Khan Younis”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was not immediately clear how much damage there was.A 5.5 magnitude aftershock struck on Tuesday, causing panic and interrupting rescue efforts as more roads were cut off by rockfall.Hamdullah Fitrat, a Taliban spokesperson, confirmed on Thursday that the death toll from Sunday’s magnitude 6.0 earthquake had risen to 2,205 – up from previous estimates of 1,400 and making it one of the deadliest natural disasters to hit the country in decades.It hit the mountainous and remote eastern part of the country around midnight on Sunday, levelling entire villages where people were trapped under rubble.Most of the casualties were in Kunar province, where many houses are built from wood and mud bricks, making them highly vulnerable to earth tremors.Rescuers have managed to reach villages that had been completely cut off by the disaster and bodies continued to be pulled from debris on Thursday.About 98% of the buildings in Kunar were damaged or destroyed, according to an assessment from the charity, Islamic Relief.The rough and mountainous terrain has been hindering relief efforts. Taliban authorities have deployed helicopters and airdropped army commandos to help locate and rescue survivors. Aid workers reported walking for hours to reach villages cut off by landslides and rockfall.Resident Muhammad Israel said the quake unleashed a landslide that buried his home, livestock and belongings in Kunar.“All the rocks came down from the mountain,” he said. “I barely got my children out of there. The earthquake jolts are still happening. It is impossible to live there.”He was staying at a UN medical camp in Nurgal, one of the worst-affected areas. “The situation is also bad for us here, we don’t have shelter and are living under open skies,” he added.Rescue and relief efforts have been hampered by a lack of international aid funding and resources flowing into the country. Since the Taliban seized back power in 2021 and began imposing hardline religious laws, making it difficult for NGOs and aid groups to function, there has been a steep drop in support.Aid agencies said they were urgently in need of staff and supplies to tend to the injured and to house tens of thousands who have been left homeless and without access to food or water. About 84,000 people have been affected so far.The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had fewer than 450 staff inAfghanistan, whereas it had 1,100 in 2023 when the last major quake struck the country. The council has only one warehouse and no emergency stock.“We will need to purchase items once we get the funding but this will take potentially weeks and people are in need now,” said Maisam Shafiey, a communications and advocacy adviser for the council in Afghanistan.“We have only $100,000 [£75,000] available to support emergency response efforts. This leaves an immediate funding gap of $1.9m.”Shamshair Khan, a doctor tending to the injured at the UN camp in Nurgal, said supplies were already running out.“Neither these medicines are enough nor these services,” he said. “These people need more medicine and tents. They need food and clean drinking water. They need more aid. These people are in great pain.”The earthquakes came with Afghanistan already suffering from drought and a severe economic crisis. The withdrawal of USAid funding, after cuts by the Trump administration earlier this year, resulted in the closure of many hospitals and medical clinics.The pressures on the country have been exacerbated by the forced return of more than 2 million Afghans from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, many of whom have nowhere to live or work.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the casualties have been in Kunar province, where people typically live in wood and mud-brick houses along steep river valleys separated by high mountains.About 98% of the buildings in the province were damaged or destroyed, according to an assessment issued on Thursday by the charity Islamic Relief. Aid agencies said they were sorely in need of staff and supplies to tend to the region’s survivors.Muhammad Israel said the quake unleashed a landslide that buried his home, livestock and belongings in Kunar. “All the rocks came down from the mountain,” he said. “I barely got my children out of there … The earthquake jolts are still happening. It is impossible to live there.”He was staying at a UN medical camp in Nurgal, one of the worst-affected districts. “The situation is also bad for us here, we don’t have shelter and are living under open skies,” he said.Previous estimates said about 1,400 people were killed. The Taliban spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat said on Thursday that the updated death toll was 2,205 and that search and rescue efforts were continuing.“Tents have been set up for people, and the delivery of first aid and emergency supplies is ongoing,” he said.The rough terrain is hindering relief efforts. Taliban authorities have deployed helicopters and airdropped army commandos to help survivors. Aid workers have reported walking for hours to reach villages cut off by landslides and rockfall.Funding cuts are also having an impact on the response. The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had fewer than 450 staff in Afghanistan, whereas it had 1,100 in 2023 when the last major quake struck the country. The council had only one warehouse remaining and no emergency stock.“We will need to purchase items once we get the funding but this will take potentially weeks and people are in need now,” said Maisam Shafiey, a communications and advocacy adviser for the council in Afghanistan. “We have only $100,000 available to support emergency response efforts. This leaves an immediate funding gap of $1.9m.”Dr Shamshair Khan, who was tending to the injured at the UN camp in Nurgal, said his own condition had deteriorated after seeing the suffering of others. “Neither these medicines are enough nor these services,” he said. “These people need more medicine and tents. They need food and clean drinking water. They need more aid. These people are in great pain.”Before the earthquake, Afghanistan was already struggling with drought, a weak economy and the recent return of 2 million Afghans from neighbouring countries.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanEarthquakesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

About 220,000 people with “greatest need” were set to receiveMounjaro, also known as tirzepatide and made by Eli Lilly, on the NHS over the next three years.But two months on, fewer than half (18 out of 42) of the commissioning bodies across England have confirmed they have begun prescribing the drug. Critics said the figures showed there was now a “postcode lottery” of access to weight loss jabs on theNHS.People using drug Mounjaro sustain weight loss over three years, trial findsRead moreNHS England had put in place a phased rollout of the drug over a period of up to 12 years, but the data suggests even patients who are eligible now cannot get the drug. Most patients on Mounjaro – about nine in 10 – are currently paying for it privately.According to freedom of information requests made by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), few integrated care boards (ICBs) have been allocated enough NHS cash for patients eligible for weight loss drugs. Only nine had the funding needed to cover at least 70% of their eligible patients, the BMJ reported.Ellen Welch, a co-chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said: “These figures confirm the fear that the rollout is not fit for purpose. There is a huge discrepancy between national messaging and what patients are actually being delivered on a local level.”Four ICBs told the BMJ the NHS funding they received covered just 25% or less of their eligible patients, with Coventry and Warwickshire faring the worst. That ICB said it had received funding to cover just 376 patients, despite identifying 1,795 eligible patients in the first year of rollout.The rolloutbegan on 23 June. Eligible patients in the first year include those with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 and other complicating illnesses such as high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes.Dr Jonathan Hazlehurst, a consultant endocrinologist and academic clinical lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said the rollout was “significantly underfunded”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The health secretary said he wanted more people to get them on the NHS after the manufacturer of Mounjaro said it was putting up prices in the private sector. Eli Lilly said in August that it was putting up the list price of the drugby as much as 170%.NHS England said it was “fully supporting” the phased rollout of Mounjaro for eligible patients and had provided funding to commissioning bodies in March.The Department ofHealthand Social Care said it expected commissioning bodies to be making the drug available as part of the phased rollout “so those with the highest need are able to access them”.Explore more on these topicsNHSObesityGPsDoctorsHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel banned medical volunteers from bringing in basic medicine or equipment into Gaza, and would sometimes at the last minute debar a medical team as they waited to cross the border from Jordan. Rose said she lost half a stone in her 28 days treating patients.Israeli military database indicates only a quarter of Gaza detainees are fightersRead moreShe listed a typical morning schedule in which she operated on six children with body parts blown off, from an 18-month-old with 15% burns to a 5-year-old girl with her arm blown off, whose sister had lost her left cheek and shoulder.Opening the tribunal, Corbyn said: “The truth needs to be told and information needs to be provided and if parliament won’t effectively inquire into what is going on, then the tribunal might be able to do so.”Francesca Albanese, the UN Rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories, said the British government had failed in its obligation to end the occupation of Palestine, which had been declared illegal in July 2024 by the international court of justice.She claimed UK government officials can be held individually responsible if found to have continued economic ties, arms transfers or intelligence exchange with Israel.The UK government has claimed that a complex picture of information means it cannot judge responsibility for individual incidents.Emily Tripp, director of Airwars – a London-based not-for-profit group – challenged this, saying her small organisation had detailed responsibility in 1,300 incidents of civilian harm.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warJeremy CorbynnewsShareReuse this content"

Police have made 32 arrests and charged 21 people connection with incidents of disorder, which has included officers being assaulted.The district judge Christopher Williams also found Kebatu guilty of one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence.The trial concluded on Wednesday at Chelmsford magistrates court after hearings there and at Colchester magistrates court were told that Kebatu tried to kiss two girls on 7 July after one of them offered him a pizza. He also invited them to the Bell hotel, the judge heard.A 14-year-old boy who was friends with the girls said in a video interview with police that was played to the court on Wednesday that Kebatu asked them to “come to the Bell hotel to have babies, then we could go to Kenya with each other”.Kebatu’s advances were rejected and it was made clear to him that the girls were 14, the court heard.Kebatu sexually assaulted a woman a day later by putting his hand on her leg after she offered to help him with his CV, the court heard. The woman, who exercised her right to remain anonymous, told the court via video link that she was left shocked and uncomfortable after Kebatu touched her. She also said she had seen him touching one of the girls.The judge told Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on 29 June, that he could expect an immediate custodial sentence to be imposed when he returned to court on 23 September. “It’s just a question of how long any sentence is going to be,” he said.He asked that a report be prepared about Kebatu before sentencing, noting there was little known about him. Kebatu told the court he had worked as a teacher in Ethiopia.Essex police paid tribute to the victims and other witnesses after the verdict. The assistant chief constable Stuart Hooper said: “We’re acutely aware that this incident has attracted widespread public interest. We have always said that we treat and investigate every report made to us without fear or favour. We understand the strength of feeling in our community, but no crime should become an excuse for the disorder we have seen at times in Epping.”The deputy chief crown prosecutor with CPS East of England, Rebecca Mundy, said she recognised the incident had become “a cause of deep concern for the local community” and that prosecutors had worked carefully and impartially to bring the case to justice.Katie Lam, a Conservative shadow Home Office minister, said: “The crimes of this illegal migrant are shocking and heartbreaking and the victims have shown incredible bravery. This case shows the very real risks of housing illegal migrants in hotels and allowing them to roam around communities freely.“This must never be allowed to happen again. Every illegal migrant should be detained immediately and swiftly deported. Anything less leaves vulnerable people at risk, betrays public trust, and sends entirely the wrong message about how seriously Britain takes border security.”Kebatu had denied the charges. His barrister Molly Dyas said in her closing speech that he disputed “most of the alleged interaction with this group of children”.During cross-examination, she had asked one of the key witnesses if she had made up her account of the incident because she was angry that Kebatu was an asylum seeker. The woman in question rejected that assertion.The prosecutor, Stuart Cowen, who described Kebatu as a sexual predator, said the explanation he put forward at his trial was “so incredible that it lacks any credibility whatsoever”.Hours after the verdict, Epping Forest council announced that it had taken the decision to appeal against the overturning of a temporary high court ban on the current use of the hotel to house asylum seekers.More than 130 people are being allowed to remain at the property after three judges last Friday set aside a temporary injunction granted to the council.However, Epping Forest said it would instruct its legal team to proceed with an application to the supreme court for permission to appeal against the court of appeal ruling.A full high court hearing will also take place next month to discuss a permanent injunction for the Bell.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In comments attached to the judgment, Lord Justice Underhill said: “I believe that the appeal has a real prospect of success.”The hearing challenging the decision to review the proscription of Palestine Action will take place on 25 September. In July, lawyers for the group’s co-founder Huda Ammori won permission to challenge the ban, they argued the decision breached the right of free speech and acted as a gag on legitimate protest.More than 700 people, many of whom have publicly declared support for Palestine Action, have been arrested by the Met since proscription on 5 July.The home secretary banned the group under terrorism laws after paint was daubed on jets at RAF Brize Norton. Police said the act caused £7m of damage.It means membership or support for Palestine Action is a crime that can lead to up to 14 years in jail. The government has said the ban is justified because it narrowly targets a group that was organising serious criminality.The charges against six people relate to plans for meetings in London, Cardiff and Manchester which were allegedly organised over Zoom meetings in July, August and this month.Tim Crosland, a former government lawyer from Southwark, south London, appeared at Westminster magistrates court, alongside Dawn Manners, 61, from Hackney, east London, and David Nixon, 39, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire.In a separate hearing on Thursday afternoon, student Patrick Friend, 26, of Grange, Edinburgh, appeared in court along with Gwen Harrison, 48, from Kendal, Cumbria, and Melanie Griffith, 62, from Southwark, London.Defend Our Juries, the group co-founded by Crosland, is organising this Saturday’s protest at Parliament Square in central London.Explore more on these topicsHome OfficeYvette CooperPalestine ActionnewsShareReuse this content"

Its members now need to think the unthinkable and look to the future.”After months of secret talks conducted at a Mayfair club, Dorries said theConservativeshad left her and that her values were now more aligned with Reform.She is the third former cabinet minister to join Reform in recent months, after theformer party chair Jake Berryand the ex-Welsh secretaryDavid Jones. Other former Conservative MPs to jump ship include Andrea Jenkyns, now Reform mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, Marco Longhi and Adam Holloway. The former Tory vice-chairLee Anderson defected to Reformin the last parliament and was elected as an MP.With Reform enjoying a double digit poll lead, the number of former and current Tory MPs seeking to defect is only likely to ramp up as it gets closer to an election in order to increase their chances of staying in or returning to parliament.Rees-Mogg, Gove and pyrotechnics: what to expect from Reform party conferenceRead moreFarage said on Thursday night: “I am absolutely delighted to welcome Nadine Dorries toReform UK. She is a hugely successful politician, author and columnist and will be a great boost to our campaign to win the next general election.”A Labour party spokesperson said Dorries was one of the people “who helped to kill” the Tory party, adding: “She backed Boris Johnson through thick and thin despite the partying in Downing Street during the pandemic while people couldn’t see their loved ones.“Nadine Dorries has gone on quite a political journey – from being the minister who introduced the online safety bill to joining a party that wants to scrap it without having any idea how to replace its protections for children and adults. It’s a perfect illustration of how incoherent Reform are.”Dorries has been highly critical of the Conservatives over their treatment of her, writing about what she saw as a conspiracy by a faction including Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings to control the party in her memoir The Plot.The high-profile defection is a boost for Reform ahead of its conference in Birmingham where Farage will on Friday give a speech at 4pm on the party’s next steps after leading in the polls for six months.Since last year’s event, it has expanded from 80,000 to nearly 240,000 members, rising from 19% to 30% in the polls, and securing 900 councillors across 12 local authorities. There is also considerable interest in the conference from businesses who for the first time are taking seriously the possibility that Farage’s party could enter government.New figures from the Electoral Commission showed on Thursday that Reform UK attracted almost £1m from former Tory donors in the second quarter of the year, including a long-promised £500,000 from property billionaire Nick Candy.Candy handed over the sum across the spring and summer, after joining Reform in December as a treasurer and saying he would hand over a seven-figure amount to the party.Reform’s other gifts from former Conservative donors included £200,000 from Bassim Haidar, a billionaire IT investor, and £100,000 from Johan Christofferson, a hedge fund manager and foxhunting enthusiast who previously gave money to Boris Johnson.R20, an investment vehicle linked to property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, is a further former Tory donor that has given to Reform for the first time, with a £50,000 contribution.Farage’s party also accepted £100,000 fromGreybull Capitalwhich bought a struggling British Steel in 2019 before selling it to the Chinese company Jingye later that year.Despite the flow of donors to Reform, theConservativesstill raised significantly more money than both Reform and Labour in terms of funds from private donors.The Tory chair Kevin Hollinrake said the figures “underline the continued strength of support behind the Conservative party”, adding: “We are building momentum quarter after quarter, and it is clear that people recognise and believe in Kemi’s mission of Conservative renewal.”Explore more on these topicsNadine DorriesReform UKParty fundingNigel FarageConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, the Tesla CEO stated on his social media platform X that he was invited but could not make it. He said he planned to send a representative. He spent the day on X posting a familiar stream of attacks on immigration and trans people.The White House did not respond for comment on why Musk would not be at the dinner.Musk’s absence, even if voluntary, is a stark turnaround from when Trumprepeatedly jokedfollowing the election that “Elon won’t go home, I can’t get rid of him”. The vacant seat highlights a divide that has emerged between the two men since their very public falling out earlier this year, one that has seen Musk’s influence over the government wane despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars to re-elect Trump during the 2024 election.How Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA companyRead moreMusk’s omission from the list of attendees also echoes one of the seminal moments of his political evolution, another White House event. In 2022, then president Joe Bidenfailed to invite the Tesla CEO to a summit on electric vehiclesover concerns it would draw backlash from autoworkers’ unions. Musk, who had not yet publicly aligned himself with the Republican party, lashed out at the White House for the snub and declared that he would not vote for Biden. The move proved enormously costly for Democrats.The incident clearly stuck with Musk, who like Trump has shown a tendency to harbor longterm grudges. Even on the day of Trump’s Rose Garden dinner, he reserved his ire for Biden rather than the current president, retweeting a clip of himself from 2023 addressing Biden’s snub with the post “I try not to start fights, but I do finish them”.In the ensuing years, Musk has taken a hard turn to the political right. He has turned X into a bastion of far-right influencers, whom he frequently retweets to his more than 200 million followers. He has promoted false theories about Democrats conspiring to get immigrants to illegally vote en masse and embraced far-right political parties around the world. He also became Trump’s most vocal and deep-pocketed supporter, contributing nearly $300m to the re-election campaign and Republican causes.Musk’s support for Trump placed him in a position of immense power after the president’s inauguration as the tech mogul established and led the so-called “department of government efficiency” and its sweeping dismantling of federal agencies. It also turned him into a prominent guest at political dinners and events, only a year after the British government didnot invite him to a major tech summitas he made inflammatory anti-immigrant posts that claimed a “civil war” would take place in the UK.Since Musk and Trump’s relationship imploded in May over policy differences – Musk railed against Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill – which then snowballed into Musk accusing Trump of being in the files pertaining to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the xAI CEO has all but vanished from high-profile government events. Although Trump still praises Musk as a “genius”, he told reporters on Wednesday night that Musk has “got some problems” and the two have not been seen together since their public spat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Earlier this month, Trump hosted Cook, the Apple CEO, at the White House, who in turngifted the president a 24-karat goldsouvenir. Meanwhile, Trump aides have discussed cutting Musk’s government contracts,according to the Wall Street Journal, only to find upon review that doing so would endanger too many key operations.If Musk were to attend Thursday’s dinner, it would create an awkward arrangement as he issuing two of the companies whose leaders will be in attendance– Apple and OpenAI, helmed by his former collaborator and now nemesis Altman. As with Trump, Musk has also attacked Gates for his ties to Epstein after the Microsoft founderaccused him of “killing children”through Doge’s cuts to foreign aid.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskDonald TrumpBill GatesTim CookSam AltmanMark ZuckerbergMetanewsShareReuse this content"

They point you to your seat and help with your luggage, before giving the safety demonstration, and preparing the plane for takeoff. And there’s a good chance they have done it all for free.But a tentative deal between AirCanadaand thousands of flight attendants has sparked hope more airlines will end a little-known reality for many North American cabin crews – and pay flight attendants when planes are not moving.“The Air Canada strike helps negotiations everywhere,” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA)-CWA, which represents about 55,000 flight attendants at 20 different airlinessaid in a statement. “It defined the problem of ridiculous expectations for flight attendants to work without pay.”More than 10,000 flight attendants at Air Canadawalked offthe job last month, in a battle with management that centered on pay during boarding and unboarding of flights.The three-day strike at Canada’s largest carrier snarled global summer travel, prompted the country’s government to force binding arbitration and led to atentative dealthat includes at least 60 minutes of ground pay before each flight, at 50% of a flight attendant’s hourly rate.The demonstrations by workers, and concessions by Air Canada on pay, “place additional pressure on management everywhere to get real in negotiations”, added Nelson.Air Canada indicated it would gradually increase the pay of flight attendants for an hour before flights on narrow-body jets, and 70 minutes on larger, wide-body aircraft, reaching 70% of full wage for ground work within four years – dashing flight attendants’ hopes of full compensation for this work, but shifting away from the established practice of no pay until flights are in motion.Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, says the agreement could serve as a foundation for a “new norm” across the continent. “This deal becomes the new standard,” she said, after the deal was agreed, “because … other unionized flight attendants that have the ability to demand better at the bargaining table will be looking at this collective agreement to say, ‘we want that, too’.”Airline employees in the US are covered under theRailway Labor Act, which does not mandate direct hourly pay, unlike theFair Labor Standards Act, which covers most other public and private sector workers.For a generation, flight attendants for most airlines across North America have not been paid for their work during boarding of planes. Delta Air Lines became the first big carrier to change this in 2022, in the midst of a union organizing drive.Alaska Airlines and American Airlines followed. United Airlines has indicated it stands ready to do so, too, although a tentative agreement was voted down in July, with bargaining under federal mediation set to recommence in December.Things are changing. “Air Canada and its flight attendants agreed on a formula for ground pay that is over and above what Delta introduced in 2022, and what American and Alaska have agreed since,” said John Gradek, an aviation expert and business professor at McGill University in Montreal.The deal will probably influence contract negotiations for WestJet flight attendants in 2026 in Canada, added Gradek, and may provide a window for United flight attendants to secure better boarding pay deals, too.‘Most of our passengers have no idea’“We’re working more, we’re working harder, and we’re not getting enough pay to make our bills every month,” said Jen Sala, a longtime flight attendant at Frontier Airlines who serves at president of its AFA union. “Flight attendants deserve to be paid for every single hour we work. Airlines shouldn’t be able to pick and choose the hours that they pay their employees.”About 4,100 flight attendants at Frontier Airlines voted last September to authorize a strike with99.6%in favor, as they have been fighting for a new contract since 2023 that includes boarding pay for flight attendants. The union is currently in federal mediation with the airline.Frontier Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment.“We can fly upwards of 15 hours in a day and only get paid for three and a half. Our flight attendants don’t make a living wage,” said Becky Black, a flight attendant for nearly 22 years at PSA Airlines, which operates flights for American Airlines. “We have a flight attendant who lives in a homeless shelter. We have flight attendants that are living in crew rooms. We have flight attendants who are 30 years old and have to move back in with their parents because they can’t afford to live with this job.“Most of our passengers have no idea that we are only paid from the time the door closes until the door opens.”Unlike flight attendants directly employed by American, flight attendants working for PSA are not paid until the plane door is closed and the pilot releases the parking brake.Black, a member of the PSA’s union negotiating committee, is one of1,500 flight attendantsat the airline who have been in negotiations for a new union contract for two years, with negotiations currently under mediation.Flight attendants at PSA are expected to report 45 minutes before a flight, and have to arrive at the airport earlier to get through security screening, Black said. Their pre-boarding procedures, including safety checks and boarding passengers, take at least an additional 30 minutes.“We’ve been on duty, but we haven’t been getting paid yet. We get paid for the flight time. And when we land and the door opens, we stop getting paid at that point, and we do the deplaning,” Black said. “Our time does have value, and we do deserve to be paid for what we’re doing. And that’s where the boarding pay comes in.”The union representing flight attendants at the airline authorized a strike with a99.2%vote last September, and have held severalpicketdemonstrations since to raise awareness and support for securing boarding pay and wage increases that align with other American flight attendants in their union contract, as PSA flight attendants are paid 40 to 45% less than flight attendants directly at American.“We’re there to hold your hand when you’re afraid of flying, to talk to you or hold your hand when you’re traveling to a funeral for a loved one, to save your life if you’re having a heart attack in the middle of a flight, or to put out a fire,” said Black. “We’re there to evacuate the airplane in 90 seconds to make sure that you all get off safe and get to your family. And we’re not asking for much. We’re just asking for respect, to be respected for the job that we do for American Airlines, and to have a livable wage.”American Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment. PSA Airlines did not comment on the boarding pay issue. “We share the same goal as our flight attendants to get a deal done,” said a spokesperson. “With the support of the National Mediation Board, we continue to meet regularly with the AFA and have made progress toward reaching an agreement that our flight attendants deserve.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsCanadaAmericasAirline industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It is also widely watched – and admired – internationally as a barometer of theUS economy.Trump’s second presidency is ‘most dangerous period’ since second world war, Mitch McConnell saysRead moreBoth liberal and conservative economists have criticizedTrump’s nominated replacementat the BLS and have raised concerns over what will happen to the agency after the dramatic shake-up. Here’s what we know about what’s happening to the bureau.What does the Bureau of Labor Statistics do?The bureau reports key economic statistics through surveys of employers and prices. Every month, it releases data on the labor market, including the current unemployment rate, and the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the cost of a basket of goods and services. This data is an important monthly snapshot of theUS economyand how it changes over time.Why did Trump fire the bureau’s commissioner?Last month, the bureau announced the US had added just 73,000 jobs in July – far lower than expected – and madebig revisionsto previously released stats on the labor market in May and June. The number of jobs added to the economy across those two months was dramatically cut by more than 250,000.Trump, who spent months boasting about the strength of the economy amid fears about the impact of his trade wars, was furious. “Today’s Job Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,” he declared on social media.Hours after the numbers were released, Trump announced he was firing McEntarfer and that she would “be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified”.Has Trump firing of the bureau’s commissioner changed its operations?Economists say that Trump’s firing hasn’t changed the bureau, yet. The White House has made other job cuts at the BLS, as it did throughout the federal workforce. Since Trump took office, the bureau hasseena hiring freeze and has lost 15% of its workforce.While the bureau said it wasdownsizingits data collection for CPI, it did not say it was making any significant changes to its survey to employers.Economists say that, for now, the bureau’s operations have largely remained the same. William Watrowski, a longtime leader within the bureau, is currently its acting commissioner. But there are still many questions about the future of the bureau, especially after Trump announced his nomination for McEntarfer’s replacement.Who does Trump want to appoint as the bureau’s new commissioner?Trump has nominatedEJ Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the bureau’s commissioner.Antoni was a contributor toProject 2025– the Heritage Foundation’s rightwing blueprint for reshaping the US government – and was a vocal critic of the bureau last year, claiming that it manipulated numbers to make them more favorable to Joe Biden and Democrats. Last November, Antoni said on Twitter that Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” needed to “take a chainsaw” to the bureau.“Month after month, the government bean-counters under former-president Biden published overly optimistic estimates for everything from job growth to the size of the economy, only to have those numbers routinely – and quietly – revised down later,” Antoni wrote in May.When announcing his appointment, Trump said Antoni “will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST AND ACCURATE”.Antoni has yet to be confirmed by Congress, and a confirmation date has not been set.Why did the bureau revise its job figures for May and June?Revisions are standard to the bureau’s reporting of the labor market, which is based on surveys of employers throughout the country.Large revisions often happen when employers take more time to complete the bureau’s surveys or revise their own figures due to changing circumstances. Economists have pointed out that uncertainty can lead to larger revisions. The pandemic, for example, saw jobs figures in flux as employers were handling different shutdown laws and the spread of the virus.The impact of Trump’s tariffs on data collection could be a major factor in the revisions seen earlier this year. Businesses have been reportingrollercoaster levelsof uncertainty over tariff policy, with sentiment among US small businesses dipping down in the spring before going up again in the summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the mid-90s, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chair at the time, criticized the way the bureau was calculating the CPI. Greenspan argued that the bureau was overestimating CPI, making inflation look higher than it actually was.Thomas Stapleford, a historian at the University of Notre Dame and author of The Cost of Living in America: A Political History of Economic Statistics, pointed out that Greenspan’s criticism led to a series of hearings in which the bureau’s methodology came under question and debate. There were congressional hearings and a committee of economists was formed to investigate the methodology.“There’s all this detailed look at digging into the methodology by these outside experts and also testimony from [the bureau],” Stapleford said. “In my mind, if you have questions about the methodology, that’s the way to approach it.”But Trump has pushed the bureau into uncharted waters. Stapleford noted McEntarfer’s firing was the first time the president fired a bureau commissioner.“What the administration, in the eyes of critics, is doing is pushing the numbers in a particular direction. Not for reasons that it can justify publicly in terms of methodology, but simply because it would like a different outcome,” Stapleford said. “That’s a really big deviation from how the bureau has operated in the past.”What does this all mean for the future of the bureau?The commissioner isn’t involved in much of the day-to-day operations of the bureau. A new leader could have major sway over how the bureau collects and reports data in the long term, but there are protections in place, and any significant changes would be subject to public scrutiny.“The commissioner isn’t directly involved in the data calculation. Most of the BLS staff are long-term civil servants. They’ve been there a long time, they have various protections around them,” Stapleford said. “If the new commissioner started to force major methodological changes, I think that would raise a lot of red flags if those changes were controversial.”But even if major changes aren’t made immediately, the fact that Trump has called the bureau’s data into question could risk confusing Americans over whether the data can be trusted.“It takes a whole lot longer to build credibility than to lose. I don’t think any of the experts involved at this point are at all worried about the credibility of BLS’s work, but I know a whole lot less about what’s filtering down to the average person right now,” Madowitz said.As an example, Madowitz pointed out how the science around the climate crisis has been clear.“But having a one-side, other-side public position on what the science says has left the public really confused,” Madowitz said. “It would be really bad if that’s how we decided to understand the economy.”What are expecting from this month’s jobs figures?Ironically, it looks like August’s jobs report could be a repeat of July’s.New dataon the labor market released by payroll firm ADP on Thursday showed sluggish growth in August for private payrolls, a sign that Friday’s job report could show some stagnation. Economists arepredicting75,000 new openings in August, on par with the 73,000 openings in July.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment dataDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS economyEconomicsUS politicsexplainersShareReuse this content"

The administration asked for that decision to be made by 10 September.The appeal calls for an accelerated schedule with arguments being heard by 10 November, according to filings seen by Bloomberg. Justices could then rule by the end of the year.Here’s what to know about the court ruling striking down Trump’s tariffsRead moreThe ruling that the tariffs were unlawful upheld a previous decision by theUS court of international trade.The federal appeals court said last Friday that US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties or the like, or the power to tax”.It said many of Trump’s steep tariffs were “unbounded in scope, amount and duration” and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on.The president swiftly hit back. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Addressing reporters at the White House, Trump claimed the US “could end up being a third-world country” without tariffs.A defeat for Trump’s levies would at least halve the current average US effective tariff rate of 16.3%, and could force the US to pay back tens of billions of dollars, according to Chris Kennedy, an analyst at BloombergEconomics. It could also derail the preliminary trade deals the president has struck with some countries, including the UK and the EU.Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump claims he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.Earlier this week, the US clothing brand Levi’s said “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies”could drive British shoppers awayfrom its denim. Other brands, such as Tesla, have also suffered in Europe and in Canada, while protests against US goods have led to a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s whiskey.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationUS supreme courtDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

And who will win it all?Oliver Connolly,Doug Farrar,Melissa Jacobs,Graham SearlesandAR ShawThu 4 Sep 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 10.55 EDTShareThis will be the year of…The Micah Parsons revenge tour.Ignore the nonsense coming out of Dallas. Jerry Jones’s claim that Parsons hurt the Cowboys’ run defense is laughable. So is the idea that Parsons’ ego was an issue. NFL history is filled with game-breaking pass-rushers with big egos or, umm, personality quirks. What matters is production, and Parsons is a one-of-a-kind pass-rushing force, capable of detonating the pocket from any alignment. No defender has generated more pressures since Parsons entered the league.With him on the field, the Cowboys had the No 1 defense in the league; when he was off the field, they fell to thesecond-worst unit in the league. If he needed any extra motivation, the Cowboys booting him on the way out should provide it.OCThe running quarterback.Not the quarterback who can get outside the pocket with mobility, but the quarterback who is a legitimate running threat. In pro football history, including the postseason,there have been eight seasonsin which a quarterback ran for more than a 1,000 yards in a season. Two of those examples happened in 2024 – Lamar Jackson’s 1,035 yards, and Jayden Daniels’ 1,026. Add in QBs like Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts and Kyler Murray, and the league’s designed quarterback run concepts could be amplified in 2025.DFYoudo nottrade away star edge-rushers in their prime. Jones’s idioticdecision to trade Parsons to Green Bayis set to be franchise-altering for both teams. How it plays out for both sides will be the talk of the league.MJThis is the beginning of the end.First-down technology is here, the chain gang merely standing idle to measure the distance in case their robot overlords fail. In 30 years, when we are watching a AI infused VR simulation of a simulation of the NFL, you will see the folly of all this. Bring backGene Steratore’s magic paper, before it’s too late!GSAn exciting youth movement at quarterback. Six quarterbacks (Daniels, Michael Penix Jr, CJ Stroud, Brock Purdy, Bo Nix and JJ McCarthy) 25 or under will start for teams that are likely to be in playoff contention. Daniels, Stroud, and Purdy could become MVP candidates and lead their teams deep into the postseason. The 25-and-under quarterbacks whose teams are projected to miss the playoffs (Cam Ward, Bryce Young, and Caleb Williams) will also draw national attention.ASBest team that won’t make the playoffs …Daniels is a phenom. But theCommandersare relying on ageing and declining stars to fill out key positions. Despite having a 24-year-old quarterback, the Commanders have theoldest roster since 2012. Maybe pairing that veteran savvy with Daniels’ magic will click. More likely, injuries will bite, the team’s pass-rush will remain sub-par, and they will fall away before January.OCFrom dynasty to soap opera: how Jerry Jones traded Dallas Cowboys glory for ‘365 days of sizzle’Read moreYes, theVikingsmanaged a 14-3 regular-season record in the brutal NFC North last year, but they did on the back of Sam Darnold’s unpredictably great season … until it wasn’t. I don’t have the same faith in McCarthy to make that kind of leap, even with a fine head coach, Kevin O’Connell, in his corner.DFBen Johnson had options, and he chose Chicago, seemingly with a plan to develop Williams. TheBearsused their first three picks this year on offensive players. Look for Chicago to start gelling as the season goes on, before the brutal trifecta of the Packers, 49ers, and Lions in the Bears’ final three games sees them fall just short of the postseason.MJTheRamswould walk into the postseason if everything goes their way. However a 37-year-old Matthew Stafford dealing with a herniated disc feels like a case of when, not if, he is replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo. The underpowered backup quarterback will leave his team short.GSJoe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, leading one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses, will solidify themselves as the league’s top quarterback-wide receiver duo. However, that will not be enough to overcome deficiencies on defense. Al Golden has implemented a new defensive scheme, but without a drastic overhaul, theBengalswill fall short of the playoffs again.ASView image in fullscreenCaleb Williams could lead the Bears to unexpected success this season.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APThe most underrated team this year is…Last season ended with a playoff win, but it still felt underwhelming thanks to an offensive line that hung Stroud out to dry. That’s been patched, if not fixed. It’s the defense, though, that will drag theTexansdeep into the postseason. They have gamechanging players at all three levels.OCTheBearsmay not win a ton of games in the loaded NFC North, but Johnson will make the most of Williams in the QB’s second season, and new defensive coordinator Dennis Allen could reform the Monsters of the Midway. Not a playoff team in 2025, but an opponent nobody will want to face.DFTheBroncosare probably underdiscussed rather than underrated. Nix was overshadowed by Daniels in the rookie of the year conversation, not to mention Patrick Mahomes in his own division. Sean Payton has been overshadowed by Andy Reid and Jim Harbaugh. Yet Payton reminded everyone that he is a coaching wizard, turning Nix into a force and making the playoffs. With last season’s Defensive Player of the Year, stud corner Patrick Surtain II, leading an elite defense, the Broncos have the tools to make a run.MJIf Murray and Marvin Harrison Jr find some chemistry then theCardinalscould make waves in the playoffs. They should have one of the meanest defensive fronts in the NFL after picking up pass rusher Josh Sweat, so if the offense can step up they have great potential.GSStroud will be a top 10 quarterback with help from offensive weapons Nico Collins, Nick Chubb, and rookie Jayden Higgins. Defensively, theTexanswill cause havoc for opposing quarterbacks, with edge rushers Will Anderson Jr and Danielle Hunter leading the way.ASOne bold prediction …Rodgers will end his career on the bench. It’s all kumbaya in Pittsburgh for now. But once the games start, theRodgers of New Yorkwill turn up: skittish in the pocket, inaccurate, unable to create on the fly. If the Steelers stumble, Tomlin will need to pivot to rookie sixth-rounder Will Howard.OCMike Tomlin’s Steelers tenure will come to an end.The Rodgers experimentlooks like a flameout for all kinds of reasons, and while I think it will be more about Tomlin’s own frustration than the franchise’s desire to move on, there’s always that one shocking coaching move ...DFBill Belichick returns to the NFL… to coach the Dolphins. Mike McDaniel’s struggles from last season look likely to continue as Belichick’s might after a ratherinauspicious start with the Tar Heels. Surely a very late career move to sunny Florida makes sense? He certainly knows the division quite well.GSSaquon Barkley will again rush for over 2,000 yards, this time breaking Eric Dickerson’s record of 2,105. Go big or go home, right? The record falls this season as the Eagles continue Barkley’s astronomical workload behind that stellar offensive line. Why tinker with success as long as Barkley’s body can handle it?MJShedeur Sanders will end the season as QB 1 for the Browns. Joe Flacco, 40, will serve as the starter for the first month or two. Dillon Gabriel will get an opportunity to start during midseason. But as the losses pile up, the fans and local media will call for Sanders to get a shot. He will be the sole reason the Browns garner national viewership in December.ASView image in fullscreenHe’s back whether you like it or not …Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APJohnny Manziel disaster waiting to happen departmentThe Browns and Saints will have worse records, butthe Colts’ season could spiralfaster. GM Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen are already on the hot seat, and they have new owners to please. Starting Daniel Jones over Anthony Richardson is understandable, but it is leading the team nowhere. Put me down for Lou Anarumo as interim head coach by Christmas.OCThe Cowboys.Without Parsons, Dallas’ defense won’t be a patch on what it was, Dak Prescott is 32 and injury-prone, and though getting receiver George Pickens should improve the passing game, do we want to take odds on the first time he melts down on the field?DFRodgers and DK Metcalf.Two volatile weirdos in Pittsburgh. What could go wrong?MJRodgers and the Steelers are going down in flames. The reasoning behind moving on from Russell Wilson and Justin Fields is sound but bringing in another has-been, only one who is much, much older at 41, is just not going to improve an offense in need of fresh ideas. That said, they will be more fun to watch.GSJones said that his team wouldimprove defensivelyby trading Parsons, but it only ensures that theCowboys’ 30-year Super Bowl droughtwill continue.ASMVP ...Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs.The Chiefs won 14 games and made the Super Bowl last season, but it was a down year for Mahomes. Behind a fragile offensive line, the Chiefs’ offense turned into a three-yard snooze-fest. This season, they’re betting on a pair of debut linemen to solve any concerns on the left side. That’s a big ask, but it’s doable. Around Mahomes, they’ve added much-needed speed with rookie running back Brashard Smith and free-agent cast-off Tyquan Thornton. The Chiefs will be more explosive, Mahomes won’t turn the ball over and he will have the comeback narrative on his side.OCLamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens.Last season,Jackson led the NFL in nearly every statistical category that counted, and he was better in the postseason than people think. This year, Jackson snags his third MVP award, and hands the NFL a bit of comeuppance after his snub last time around.DFJacksonhas already won two MVPs and enters 2025 feeling snubbed after Allen got the award in 2024, and frustrated with the loss to Allen’s team in the playoffs. Look out, Buffalo. More so, look out NFL.MJJayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders. His ridiculous first season is the type of platform hall of fame careers are built from while Washington have improved the offensive rookie of the year’s working conditions by beefing up the offensive line and receiving crew. Another year working in Kliff Kingsbury’s system allows Daniels to confirm he is a legit superstar.GSThis season, Allen and Jackson will remain in the MVP hunt with challenges from Mahomes, Hurts, Daniels, Stroud, Purdy and Jordan Love. ButJacksonwill prove to be the most dominant, earning his third MVP award.ASThe best rookie will be …Abdul Carter, LB, New York Giants.The answer is obviously Travis Hunter. But let’s go with Giants edge-rusher Carter, who will be an immediate game-breaker. Pair him with Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, and the Giants quietly have one of the most fearsome pass-rushes in the league. Parsons had 13 sacks as a rookie. Carter could flirt with that number.OCCam Ward, QB, Tennessee Titans.Last season, Ward was the NCAA’s best quarterback throwing from the pocket, which you don’t expect when you watch his plays outside structure. As was the case for Daniels last season, Ward will find that this transfers very well to the NFL, and he has better targets than one might expect for a guy taking over a 3-14 team.DFAshton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders.From vision to explosiveness, Jeanty has all the tools to transform a franchise desperately in need of a lightning bolt. Running backs that go in the top half of the first round usually excel. See Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan Robinson in 2023.MJCarter. The hype has him breaking the rookie sack record with 15. If he even gets close to that mark the defensive rookie of the year award is heading to the Giants. Jared Verse only needed 4.5 sacks to take it last season.GSRaiders head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly are known for emphasizing the run, andJeantywill be the centerpiece of their offense. Hunter will challenge for rookie of the year, but Jeanty’s high total yards from scrimmage will give him the edge.ASAFC East champBill Belichick’s humiliating college football debut brings only schadenfreude or sadnessRead moreThe Patriots are improving, but theBillswill waltz through the division. They still have the most balanced offense in the league and Allen at quarterback. There areplenty of questions about the Bills’ defense, but they won’t be answered until the postseason.OCI have some serious concerns about Buffalo’s defense, and the Patriots should be an upcoming force, but there will be just enough on the offensive side of the ball for theBillsto win their sixth straight AFC East title.DFThere is plenty of momentum on offense and reinforcements on theBillsdefense. Shockingly, there is ongoing drama brewing with Tyreek Hill in Miami as players opted not to make him a captain. The Jets are trotting out Justin Fields and Drake Maye is still developing for the Pats. No one will touch Buffalo.MJTheBillsare the biggest division lock across the NFL. A lot of maybes hang over the trio attempting to knock one of the most consistent teams off their perch. Allen appears only to be growing stronger, and so does his team’s grip on the division.GSExpect the AFC East to be more competitive this year as the Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots have added significant pieces and are trending in the right direction. Allen and theBillswill win the division for the sixth year in a row, but it won’t be as easy this time around.ASView image in fullscreenWill it be another disappointing season for the Bengals?Photograph: Stephanie Scarbrough/APAFC North champTheRavens. It’s an indictment of the Bengals’ front office that this isn’t closer. Expecting a significant turnaround from Cincy’s defense without any major offseason additions is nonsensical. Burrow and the offense cannot play any better than last season. Most have penciled in a repeat performance, but if the group falls back to Earth even slightly, they’ll miss the playoffs again.OCTheRavenshave a top-tier defense, the ageless Derrick Henry, a receiver group that’s better than you think, a great offensive line when healthy, and one Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr, the best player in the NFL. That will be enough to get them past the Rodgers drama in Pittsburgh, and the defense-lite Bengals, no matter how well Burrow plays.DFTheRavensrival the Eagles for most stacked roster in football, especially with the additions of Jaire Alexander and Malaki Starks to the secondary. The division will be competitive thanks to Pittsburgh’s defense and Cincinnati’s still-promising offense.MJTheRavensand Bengals offenses are stacked with talent but defense will earn Baltimore another year on top. Addressing their pass coverage by bringing in Alexander signals the Ravens’ intent to go all the way.GSIn the toughest division in the NFL, each Sunday will be a battle. The Steelers will remain competitive under Tomlin, the Bengals will score a slew of points, and theRavensare in Super Bowl or bust mode. After the final snap, Jackson and the Ravens will be the last team standing in the division.ASAFC South champIt’s hard not to get caught up in the Jacksonville hype train. No team has a higher floor or ceiling given the weapons on offense and the new coaching staff. But the offensive line is too leaky and the staff too green to clinch a division race over theTexans.OCTheTexansoffense is solid enough, while their defense is among the league’s best, with the NFL’s best cornerback in Derek Stingley Jr, and a host of dominant players.DFThe Titans should at least be entertaining as they start their rebuild with Ward. We can’t say the same about the Colts, who are rolling out Daniel Jones as their win-now option. Houston easily win the division with their top-five defense, and if new OC Nick Caley can turn Stroud back into a superstar, theTexanscould toy with the AFC’s best.MJJacksonville are an exciting prospect with a rookie head coach providing an unknown quantity after Doug Pederson’s stale, shambling Jaguars. That said, an offensive line now hopefully able to protect Stroud and a brutal defense led by Anderson should be good enough to seal theTexansanother divisional title.GSTheTexanswill take care of business and possibly surprise a few teams in the playoffs. The Jaguars won’t make the playoffs, but will be a fun team to watch as Hunter plays both sides of the ball and Trevor Lawrence aims to prove that he can live up to the $275m contract extension.ASAFC West champThiscouldbe the year theChiefs’ grip on the division falls. The Broncos are loaded on both sides of the ball. They have the best four-man pass-rush in the NFLandthe league’s best blitz designer. Nix doesn’t need to take a major leap forward for Denver to be a force. Still, it’s hard to bet against the Mahomes-Reid axis.OCTheBroncoslast won the AFC West in 2015, when they also won the Super Bowl with the NFL’s best defense. The 2025 Broncos also have the NFL’s best defense, and the Nix/Payton relationship will bear unexpected dividends for the offense.DFPayton reminded everyone what a good coach he is. Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers are teeming with potential, though the Rashawn Slater season-ending injury was a massive loss. Both have playoff potential. But it’s theChiefsuntil it ain’t. Kansas City’s new offensive line will need to perform but reviews for rookie tackle Josh Simmons have been mostly good.MJThe Chiefsshouldcome out on top. But theBroncosare starving for success, have a league-leading defense and a coach who can match Reid.GSTheChiefswill win the AFC West for the 10th year in a row, but they’ll face more challenges from division foes. The Payton-led Broncos were one of only three teams to defeat the Chiefs last year. Harbaugh’s Chargers will also take aim at KC as they fight for a playoff slot. Carroll will lead the Raiders’ rebuilding efforts and guide young talent such as All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers and Jeanty.ASNFC East champThe defending Super Bowl champs steamrolled through the playoffs last season, but it’s easy to forget they were not a juggernaut for all of 2024. TheEagles’ defense dominated from the off, but the offense lacked rhythm, relying on a boom-or-bust style that hit in the postseason. If new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo can help bring some precision to Hurts’ game, Philly will be even better this year.OCTheEagleshave enough to hold off the Commanders, mostly on defense (when you have Vic Fangio as your defensive coordinator, that’s an edge in and of itself). Even if Saquon Barkley regresses from one of the best running back seasons ever, there’s still enough on the ball for the defending champs.DFIs there a more foolproof roster in the NFL than theEagles? Daniels’s presence automatically makes Washington a threat. The less said about Dallas and New York the better.MJTheEagleswill be wary as the Commanders have strengthened the offense around Daniels, but the Super Bowl champions’ stronger defense should edge the division.GSTheEagleswill win back-to-back division titles as they hold off the surging Commanders. Daniels will build on his impressive rookie of the year campaign, but the Commanders’ defensive weaknesses will be the key reason they fail to take over the division. The Cowboys are coping with Jones’s decision to trade Parsons, and the Giants are no longer the most important team in New York.ASView image in fullscreenMicah Parsons changes the dynamics of the NFC North.Photograph: Jayden Mack/Getty ImagesNFC North champThePackershave everything a contender needs. They can run the ball. They can create chunk plays in the passing game. Their secondary force turnovers, even if they gag up big plays. Oh, and they have excellent coaching and a top-tier quarterback. With the addition of Parsons, they will have a potent pass-rush.OCThe Lions are dealing with losing offensive coordinator Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn. The Vikings need to insert McCarthy, essentially a rookie, in as quarterback. The Bears have improved but are not quite there yet. That leaves thePackers, with a healthy Love, rookie Matthew Golden as the No 1 receiver, and Parsons to lead an underrated defense.DFThis is where the Parsons trade becomes division altering. If he is the same player we saw in Dallas, and if Love can stay healthy, thePackersare in tremendous shape. Detroit are offensive powerhouse but demons from last season’s playoffs and major turnover on the coaching staff will leave them just short of the division. Minnesota are also a strong contender if McCarthy can step up. Everything else is in place.MJThe frozen north was looking open considering that Green Bay, Detroit and Minnesota all made the playoffs last season. And all three could do so again. However the Parsons trade has given thePackersa huge boost on defense while likely providing a similar bump to the team’s confidence. The Lions and Vikings will be fighting for wildcards.GSThePackerswill hold off the Lions as Parsons anchors Green Bay’s top-five defense and Love leads an improved offense. The Vikings will also remain in the mix, but Darnold’s absence will be felt.ASNFC South champTheBuccaneershave the most well-rounded roster in the division, including the best offensive line in the league – when Tristan Wirfs is healthy. Tampa’s ceiling is the NFC title game, depending on how well Baker Mayfield gels with his new offensive play-caller.OCBuccaneersquarterback Mayfield is coming off his best season to date, and has great receivers. Bucky Irving may be the NFL’s most underrated running back, the offensive line is led by Wirfs, the best offensive lineman in the NFL, and Todd Bowles got enough pass-rush reinforcement in the draft and free agency to improve a unithe was unhappy with in 2024.DFMayfield’s phenomenal 2024 may not be an outlier, given theBuccaneers’ cadre of elite receivers. Plus, this is another win-by-default situation given the rest of the division is in rebuild mode.MJThePanthers’ last crown came 10 years ago when they monstered the league with a 15-1 record. No such dominance will be forthcoming from them or their rivals, none of whom have shown any significant signs of improvement in the offseason, so this division is there for the taking. If Young can keep his run of form going from the backend of last season then the Panthers could spring a huge surprise.GSA two-team race between the Buccaneers and Falcons. The Bucs are a more balanced team, but theFalconsboast a high-powered offense that will make them a threat in the NFC. Similar to last season, the division will be decided by one or two games. The Falcons’ offensive firepower will be the difference-maker and lead a return to the playoffs for the first time in seven years.ASNFC West champA second bold prediction: the Seahawks will have the best defense in the NFL. But Darnold, in a new environment and behind a flaky offensive line, will keep them from winning the division. Every year the Niners have been healthy under Kyle Shanahan, they’ve made the big dance. But they’re neither healthy nor as talented as in previous years, particularly along the defensive line. Stafford’s health remains a going concern in LA. TheCardinalssneak it with a solid offense and achaotic defense.OCWe’re assuming two things here – first, that Stafford’s back issues play into the season, and thatSeahawksoffensive coordinator Klint Kubiakcan make the most of Darnold. Seattle may have a top-five defense, and that could be enough in a division where too much is uncertain elsewhere.DFWith all due respect to Garoppolo, the resurgent Rams’ Super Bowl hopes lie on the back of Stafford. And that back is healthy enough … for now. TheRamsare so well-coached and stacked that barring injury, they may coast to the division title. The 49ers will sneak into the postseason via wildcard thanks to the NFL’s easiest schedule and Robert Saleh back leading the defense.MJSan Francisco endured a feature length nightmare in 2024. That cursed 6-11 season puts head coach Mike Shanahan under pressure to deliver a deep playoff run or move on. And while the Rams and Cardinals are going to provide very stiff competition, the49ershave a point to prove.GSPurdy is a sleeper MVP candidate, and the return of Saleh as defensive coordinator brings the49ersback to Super Bowl form. The Rams stand as the biggest hurdle for San Francisco, but the health and age of Stafford could be a major concern as the season unfolds.ASAFC wildcard teamsBroncos, Bengals, Jaguars.OCChiefs, Bengals, Chargers.DFBroncos, Bengals, Chargers.MJChiefs, Bengals, Jaguars.GSSteelers, Chargers, Broncos.ASNFC wildcard teamsSeahawks, Lions, Vikings.OCRams, Lions, Commanders.DFLions, Commanders, 49ers.MJCommanders, Lions, Cardinals.GSCommanders, Lions, Buccaneers.ASAFC championship gameRavens over Bills.OCBroncos over Ravens.DFBills over Ravens.MJRavens over Bills.GSRavens over Chiefs.ASNFC championship gamePackers over Eagles.OCPackers over Eagles.DFEagles over Lions.MJLions over Commanders.GSEagles over Packers.ASView image in fullscreenLamar Jackson may well be celebrating his first Super Bowl title this season.Photograph: Nick Wass/APSuper Bowl LXRavens over Packers. It’s now or never forthisversion of the Ravens. The Ravens have finished fifth and seventhall-timein DVOA over the past two seasons. Jackson’s brilliance alone keeps them in contention; now, he finally has his best supporting cast. Coaching snafus hamstrung the Ravens at the start of last year, costing them home-field advantage through the playoffs. Securing the No 1 seed this year will be essential. If they can overcome worries on the interior of their offensive line, Jackson will make – and win – the first Super Bowl of his career.OCBroncos over Packers.It’s a Super Bowl XXXII rematch, with the resurgent Packers and Parsons falling just short, and the Broncos picking up their fourth Lombardi Trophy. As much as the Packers’ defense should scare Nix and company, Payton will have enough answers, and there isn’t a better defense in the NFL than Denver’s.DFEagles over Bills.Buffalo will make it to the promised land in their seventh-straight playoff appearance. Most of the Super Bowl week hoopla will be focused on Allen and the special nature of Bills fans. All very heartwarming until the reality of the game reminds the world that the Eagles are the kings of roster-building. Simply put, the Eagles have the same roster as last year. It was the best then, and best now. This squad will also have the advantage of not being overwhelmed by the unique nature of the Super Bowl.MJRavens over Lions.The key for the Ravens is depth. For instance, Baltimore picked Mike Green, a pass rusher who would start for most teams, in the first round of the 2024 draft. He is conceivably their fourth-best option for getting to the QB this year. If and when the injury bug bites they can ride out the storm with depth like this across the board and lift the Lombardi.GSEagles over Ravens.The Super Bowl has become the Kansas City Chiefs’ invitational in recent years. It’s not wise to go against the majestic Mahomes, but this time around, Jackson and the Ravens will finally get over the AFC Championship hump. In the NFC, the Eagles will take out the feisty Packers in a quest to win back-to-back titles. A showdown between Jackson and Hurts will feature theatrics as two of the league’s most exciting quarterbacks perform under the big lights. After three quarters of back-and-forth scoring, the game will be decided by which offense controls the ball in the final two minutes. Expect the more experienced Eagles to find a way to score in the waning moments to secure Super Bowl LX.ASExplore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while I am here, I’m going to try to stay open-minded about what I have here and maximize that as much as I can.”Chicago improved to 10-30 after routing Connecticut on Wednesday night. Reese had 18 points and 13 rebounds. The franchise is 3-15 since the All-Star Break, but Reese missed a lot of those games with a back issue.“I’m not settling for the same ... we did this year,” the young star told the paper. “We have to get good players. We have to get great players. That’s a non-negotiable for me. I’m willing and wanting to play with the best. And however I can help to get the best here, that’s what I’m going to do this offseason.“So it’s going to be very, very important this offseason to make sure we attract the best of the best because we can’t settle for what we have this year.”Reese, who was the No 7 pick in the WNBA draft last season, is averaging 14.6 points and and a league-best 12.6 rebounds. She has at least one more season on her rookie contract.Reese walked back her comments after Wednesday night’s win and said she had already apologized to the team.“I probably am frustrated with myself right now,” she said. “I think the language was taken out of context and I really didn’t intentionally mean to put down my teammates because they’ve been through this with me throughout the whole year.”Reese said she has to learn from the situation.“I just have to be better with my language because I know it’s not the message it’s the messenger and understanding what I say can be taken any kind of way so I just have to really be better and grow from this,” she said.Reese told the paper that she wanted coach Tyler Marsh to coach players harder and didn’t think the team’s current roster was good enough to win championships. She also was called out injured point guard Courtney Vandersloot, who is sidelined with an ACL injury. Vandersloot was a big part of the franchise’s only championship in 2021.“We can’t rely on Courtney to come back at the age that she’s at,” Reese said. “I know she’ll be a great asset for us, but we can’t rely on that. We need someone probably a little younger with some experience, somebody who’s been playing the game and is willing to compete for a championship and has done it before.”Explore more on these topicsChicago SkyWNBAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Lewis family, who own the club, have put a new leadership team in place with Peter Charrington, who was brought on to the board in March, stepping into a newly created role of nonexecutive chair.Vinai Venkatesham, who was named as the chief executive in April, will grow further in influence and one of their principal goals will be to attract fresh investment. It is understood that it is essential for Spurs to drive their varied plans to expand the business, which would help in the ultimate ambition of bringing on-field success.A source close to the Lewis family said: “Generations of the family support this special football club and they want what the fans want – more wins more often. This is why you have seen recent changes, new leadership and a fresh approach. In Vinai, Thomas [Frank, the new manager] and Peter Charrington, they believe they are backing the right team to deliver on this. This is a new era.”View image in fullscreenTottenham fans hold up a protest banner outside the stadium in February 2025.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesLevy, who took over from Alan Sugar as the chairman in February 2001, has been a magnet for criticism from the fans. They have accused him of putting profit before glory and staged protests calling for him to quit. They have been frustrated by the lack of silverware on his watch, although the team didwin the Europa League last season, adding to the League Cup success of 2008. Levy sacked 13 managers – excluding caretakers – in the pursuit of the winning formula.Nobody can deny what Levy has built at Spurs, starting with the magnificent new stadium and state-of-the-art training ground. With his sharp commercial acumen, he has established the club among the financial elite. According to Deloitte’s most recent Money League, published for 2023-24, the club were the ninth-richest in world football with an annual turnover of £512m. This was during a season when they did not compete in Europe. And it cannot be overlooked that they have become a much more consistent force in the league, the 17th-placed finish from last season notwithstanding.Levy led on the decisionto sack Ange Postecoglou as manager after the Europa League triumph and replace him with Frank and, around that time, he was looking forward with characteristic passion and enthusiasm to pushing ahead with the club’s non-footballing projects. They include the building of both a hotel and an indoor arena close to the stadium; an expansion of the training ground in Enfield to take in a hub for the women’s team and even a bespoke NFL training facility; and numerous residential developments in the Tottenham area. Levy was consumed by the creation of a legacy in the area that went beyond sporting victories.Quick GuideDaniel Levy's Tottenham managers in fullShowGeorge Graham – Oct 1998 to March 2001Departed within a month of Levy taking over as chairman.Glenn Hoddle –  April 2001 to  Sept 2003Club legend could do no better than a ninth-placed finish in his first full season. A poor start to the 2003-04 campaign proved too much for Levy’s patience.Jacques Santini – June 2004 to Nov 2004The Frenchman, appointed after David Pleat’s lengthy caretaker stint, lasted 13 games and left citing personal problems.Martin Jol –  Nov 2004 to  Oct 2007Secured European football in consecutive seasons but just missed out on Champions League qualification. Lost his grip on the job after a disappointing start to the 2007-08 campaign.Juande Ramos –  Oct 2007 to  Oct 2008Pulled Spurs out of their slump, won the Carling Cup – Tottenham’s most recent major trophy until last season’s Europa League win – and secured 11th place. But in late October 2008 the club were rock bottom of the league and change became inevitable.Harry Redknapp –  Oct 2008 to  June 2012Led Tottenham to fourth spot and Champions League qualification in 2009-10. In 2011-12 they finished fourth once more but Chelsea’s Champions League win elbowed them into the Europa League. Redknapp got the push.André Villas-Boas – July 2012 to  Dec 2013Given a second chance in London after his Chelsea failure but heavy defeats in big matches led to his three-year deal being cut short.Tim Sherwood –  Dec 2013 to  May 2014Sherwood stepped up from the academy and won 50% of games in his short time as manager, but departed at the end of the season.Mauricio Pochettino –  May 2014 to  Nov 2019Appointed over Frank de Boer and it paid off. Oversaw year-on-year progress, culminating in the run to the 2019 Champions League final. But a total of 14 points from the first 12 matches of 2019-20 was not enough.José Mourinho – Nov 2019 to  Apr 2021Nearly a year on from his sacking at Manchester United, Mourinho was appointed the day after Pochettino’s exit. His confrontational approach and dour football tested the patience of the club and a Europa League last-16 exit at the hands of Dinamo Zagreb proved the final straw.Nuno Espírito Santo –  Jun 2021 to  Nov 2021A long search ended in the arrival of the former Wolves manager. Began with three Premier League wins but, 124 days later, after two hours and 16 minutes without a shot on target in the league, he was gone.Antonio Conte – Nov 2021 to  Mar 2023Talks in the summer had broken down over the Italian’s transfer budget demands but by late autumn Conte was at the helm on a £15m-a-year contract. Took the club back in to the Champions League but things unravelled in 2022-23 culminating in a furious blast at his players in March. He left with Spurs fourth in the league.Ange Postecoglou – Jun 2023 to Jun 2025Postecoglou became the first Australian to manage in the Premier League after signing a four-year deal. Ended Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought with success in the Europa League but that was not enough to save his job after a 17th-place finish in the Premier League.Thomas Frank – Jun 2025 to …The 51-year-old Dane joined from Brentford after Spurs triggered his £10m release clause. He has won two of his three Premier League games so far.Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The 63-year-old welcomed the appointment of Venkatesham, the former Arsenal chief executive whom he has known for years, as he needed someone to take over the day-to-day running of the business to enable him to give the other projects greater attention. In short, it did not sound as though he was planning to walk away in the early weeks of the new season.Venkatesham said in a video released by the club in June – in which he gave his thoughts while sitting alongside Levy – that he would take “more of a lead day-to-day on operational matters on the pitch and off the pitch”. In the statement to announce Levy’s departure on Thursday, Spurs noted Venkatesham had been hired “as part of its succession planning”. Charrington has links to Joe Lewis, the Bahamas-based billionaire who, for years, was Spurs’ ultimate benefactor, controlling them through his investment company, Enic.The club’s ownership structure shifted in October 2022 when Lewis stepped back from his publicly stated position. He ceased to be a part of the Lewis Family Trust which controls Spurs, transferring it to unnamed members of his family.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Charged with insider trading in the US on 26 July 2023, the 88-year-old was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $5m (£4m) on 4 April 2024. The Lewis Family Trust owns 70.12% of Enic, the company that holds 86.91% of the shares in Spurs. Levy and certain members of his family own the other 29.88% of Enic. Lewis has two children, Vivienne and Charles, and the family’s interest at Spurs is being looked after by two trustees.Charrington, a former chief executive of Citi Private Bank, is a director of Enic. He has also been a senior partner at Nexus Luxury Collection in the Bahamas, an operator of private member clubs and resorts – which was co-founded by Lewis.The backdrop to the seismic change at Spurs is the search for new investment. The game has been ablaze with takeover rumours involving the club, with agents and financiers claiming at various points this year that there is a buyer waiting in the wings. It is known that Amanda Staveley, the former Newcastle director who brokered the Saudi takeover at St James’ Park four years ago, has become a figure of influence at Spurs. Could the club find it easier to attract the additional money they need without Levy cutting a divisive presence at the top?

Those travails were later compounded by a five-place grid penalty for failing to slow sufficiently under a yellow flag before the race at Zandvoort.“It’s been an emotional rollercoaster,” he said on Thursday of his time with the Scuderia. “What can I really say? Did I expect it to be as volatile in terms of the feeling? No, but that’s life.”The 40-year-old has not taken a podium place for 17 meetings, the longest streak of his career, and is sixth in the world championship.

I’m really trying to be in the present and enjoy every moment because this half of the season has gone by really quickly.“I don’t want to miss any of these special moments that we’re having.

Not any moreThu 4 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 07.30 EDTShareIf there’s the tiniest sliver of an upside to the latest news about ticketing for the 2026World Cup, it’s that we can finally dispense with the pretense that Fifa is interested in growing the game any more.Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time,use a dynamic ticket pricing modelfor the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. While tickets will initially range from $60 for the cheap seats in some group-stage matches to $6,730 for the best vantage point at the final, those prices will then be algorithmically handed over to the market to respond to demand, which will probably cause them to skyrocket. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply.‘We get nothing’: residents fight back as Mexico builds big for 2026 World CupRead moreEffectively,Fifahas absorbed the secondary market of ticket sales – the bit of the ticket hustle that arbitrages the market – in the name of protecting the fans, while subjecting fans to the exact same extortion. But rather than being a lone tout loitering outside a stadium, hoping to scalp a few tickets for a profit, it’s Fifa itself making the deals.Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world’s most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you’re-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa.The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport’s expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. It went to South Africa in 2010 and Brazil in 2014 not because they were the most moneyed markets, but to spread the sport around the globe. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup.This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. And Fifa will help itself to as much of it as it can.“It’s key to highlight Fifa’s mission and Fifa’s objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa’sWorld Cup 2026chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we’re looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it’s always a balance between different factors.”It claims to do so out of a kind of fiduciary duty to its member federations, but to further constrain attendance at the sport’s signature event to the lucky few who can afford it gives the lie to serving the best interests of the sport writ large.Infantino’s latest Oval Office show reminds us Trump will be inescapable at the 2026 World CupRead moreFifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky –a YouGov pollshows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it’s worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events.After widespread anger erupted at the dynamic pricing that more than doubled the cost of some Oasis reunion tour tickets in the United Kingdom,the band ditched the modelfor its US dates. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. “She didn’t want to do that to her fans,” an AEG executiveexplainedin an interview. Even Wendy’s faced ferocious backlashwhen it announcedthat it would introduce dynamic pricing in its fast-food restaurants, before it backed down.The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it’s also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-finaltumbled from almost $500 to just $13in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue.Fifa is doing nothing illegal. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn’t violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislatorshave taken an interestand Australia hasmoved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure.It is also legal to use the data you have on your customers – a browsing history suggesting, for instance, a desperation to snag tickets to a particular game – to set prices, which is known as “surveillance pricing”. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquirywas swiftly abandonedby the Trump administration.Fifa, then, isn’t breaking any rules. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team is out in the spring of 2026.

We’re going to have to deal with what we’ve got’David HytnerThu 4 Sep 2025 17.30 EDTShareEzri Konsa has said that football’s spending regulations “killed”Aston Villaduring a difficult summer transfer window. The club, who have started the season badly with one point from three games and no goals scored, were hemmed in by the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules and the equivalent in Uefa competition.Villa paid out one major fee –£30.5m to Nice for Evann Guessand– and made only four further first-team additions, Marco Bizot being followed in on deadline day by Victor Lindelöf,Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho. The club were open to selling Emiliano Martínez only for there to be no buyer and movedJacob Ramsey to Newcastle for £39mdespite Unai Emery preferring to keep him. As a homegrown player, Ramsey counted as pure profit on the books.Transfer window and deadline day: Premier League club-by-club analysisRead moreVilla have been hurt by their high wages-to-revenue ratio, which stood at 96% in 2023-24 according to Deloitte. Uefa fined the club on 4 July for a breach of its squad cost ratio rules and warned they could face competitive restrictions if they did not have a positive transfer balance by the end of the window. Villa have qualified for this season’s Europa League.Konsa is preparing withEnglandfor Saturday’s World Cup qualifier against Andorra, which will be played at Villa Park. The tie has his full focus as he seeks to build on his encouraging performances under Thomas Tuchel. But it was not possible to overlook the situation at Villa and how PSR has become such a talking point.“It is crazy,” Konsa said. “I don’t understand it myself but from the outside looking in, it doesn’t look too good. I know that and I know it’s really killed us this transfer window. We’re going to have to deal with what we’ve got now.“Everyone knows it’s been a tough start but it’s part of football. We’ve done some recruitment on deadline day so hopefully the boys that have come in can really help us.”Konsa was asked whether he had followed Monday’s deadline day. “Pffff, no,” he replied. “I definitely didn’t watch that. It’s been tough, especially for us. I knew that signing players was going to be difficult so I did not look at transfer deadline day. Around eight o’clock, I went on Aston Villa Twitter to see what happened and I saw that we’d signed three players, who are really good and have Premier League experience. I think that’s what we needed as well.”View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa was sent off in Aston Villa’s opening day Premier League draw against Newcastle.Photograph: Ben Roberts/Danehouse/Getty ImagesKonsa has made something of a false start on a personal level. He wassent off in the opening fixtureagainst Newcastle, which finished 0-0, and banned for the 1-0 defeat at Brentford.Villa lost 3-0 to Crystal Palacein game three. Tuchel was in attendance for the first two matches.“Yes, he was there,” Konsa said, with a smile, of the Newcastle game. “I didn’t want to see him but he was outside the [dressing room] door. He was laughing at me. Not much to say about that! I got red-carded but he was very helpful, very understanding. It was a boring game anyway!

Was there any small talk? No. He didn’t speak [during play]. He was just focused. We only spoke at half-time. When we were watching the game, he didn’t say one word.”Konsa has been at Villa since 2019 and he has seen the truly hard times, especially his first season when the club narrowly avoided relegation to the Championship on the final day. He has faith in Emery, who has lifted Villa to finishes of seventh, fourth and sixth since taking over in October 2022. Konsa also has faith in what remains a talented team.“We want to stay in the top six, top five … we want to play Champions League football,” Konsa said. “I’ve been at Villa at the worst times so I know how bad it can be.

Other mooted sanctions include fines of up to 10% of a club’s revenue and being forced to sell up.The proposals for a new test for owners, directors and senior executives are critical to the regulator’s activities in a climate in which clubssuch as Morecambeand Sheffield Wednesdayhave experienced existential peril. Their intention is to assess the “honesty, integrity and financial soundness” of those currently or potentially running a club in the English professional game. They have been published for public consultation until 6 October, with the intention that the new regime is imposed as soon as possible. The government wants to fast-track the regulator’s start so that its powers are activated in the autumn.Among the most eye-catching elements is the prospect that in the most serious breaches of July’s act an owner could face criminal consequences. In the gravest scenario those could include imprisonment. Specifically, the destruction or disposal of information or documents required by the IFR is deemed a criminal offence; so are the provision of misleading information and obstructing the IFR from exercising its rights to enter business premises. Pursuit of criminal sanctions would be viewed as a last resort for when civil sanctions, such as financial punishments, are considered inadequate.The heaviest would lead to miscreants being fined between 8% and 10% of their club’s revenue from the previous financial year. The ability to levy sanctions on individuals, as well as organisations, is regarded as a significant pillar of the test.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It would also be able to consult law enforcement agencies and other regulatory bodies.Those behind the plans emphasise that they have been designed to promote sound investment rather than discourage those looking to put money into the game. “These powers will be used proportionately, in accordance with the IFR’s statutory duties, and with an understanding of the importance of owner investment and risk-taking in English football,” the statement said.Explore more on these topicsFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their last World Cup qualifying victory was almost 12 years ago, a narrow success over the Faroe Islands, but this was anything but a straightforward win for Wales.By the end the chances were totting up, Craig Bellamy’s side clinging on with the Kazakhstan substitute Serikzhan Muzhikov cracking the bar with the final action, a 95th-minute free-kick. The visitors were ultimately grateful for Kieffer Moore’s first-half strike, which was sufficient to earn a victory that keeps alive their hopes of automatic qualification from Group J.Kazakhstan 0-1 Wales: World Cup 2026 qualifier – live reactionRead moreThechallenges of a 7,000-mile round triptraversing six time zones meant it was always going to be a game where any kind of win would do. Even more so given Wales’s only full training session came 24 hours before kick-off. As it happened, it was an unconvincing and sticky display.The most polishedWalesperformer was the 19-year-old debutant Dylan Lawlor, with the Cardiff centre-back assured in and out of possession. Relegation has bred opportunity in the capital and this was another milestone for Lawlor, who only made his Wales Under-21s debut in June.View image in fullscreenWales fans celebrate after the match, having travelled across six time zones to Almaty.Photograph: Pavel Mikheyev/ReutersThe goal stemmed from a free-kick won and taken by Harry Wilson. Liam Cullen flicked on Wilson’s slick left-foot cross and the goalkeeper Temirlan Anarbekov, on debut, could only parry the ball to the edge of the six-yard box, where Moore stabbed in.Bellamy recently said he was captivated by Wrexham’s journey to the Championship under their Hollywood owners and Moore, on his 50th cap, became the first Wrexham player to represent Wales since the defender Steve Evans in 2008, when they were in non-league.Wales had to ride waves of Kazakhstan pressure and there was clear relief when the referee, Alejandro Hernández, blew for full-time.Galymzhan Kenzhebek was Kazakhstan’s liveliest player and registered a hat-trick of near-misses, including rattling the bar himself via Karl Darlow’s fingertips at full stretch, before being withdrawn midway through the second half. It felt like a bizarre substitution given moments earlier Kenzhebek skipped past four Wales players and poked an effort just wide of a post but Islam Chesnokov, Kenzhebek’s replacement, also caused problems.Chesnokov’s neat back-heel allowed the overlapping wing-back Bagdat Kairov to send a low cross into the six-yard box, where Maksim Samorodov was waiting to equalise only for an alert Lawlor to intervene and hack clear. Lawlor, who has made just eight senior starts for the League One leaders, Cardiff, where he recently signed a new three-year contract, belted out the national anthem before kick-off and ably deputised for the injured Joe Rodon.“He was just so impressive and we needed him to be,” said the Wales manager. “You think: ‘How are we ever going to cope without Joe?’ We’ve gained a player from this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On paper people will look at Kazakhstan thinking we should dominate the game and score a couple of goals but it is never going to be easy.” Asked about Wales’s next qualifier, against the group favourites, Belgium, in Cardiff in October, the Tottenham defender added: “We came here and put ourselves in a position that it is now an important game.”Wales had few chances to double their advantage, aside from a tame Wilson strike, and instead they had to concentrate their focus at the other end in the final minutes. Chesnokov lashed a strike over the bar and the typically dependable Davies headed clear at the back post a Dastan Satpayev cross, conscious Kairov was lurking.Ali Aliyev, the Kazakhstan manager, slowly dragged his fingers down his cheeks after Muzhikov’s stoppage-time effort clinked the woodwork. “We had to dig in,” conceded Bellamy.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesKazakhstanmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The 20-year-old completed a medical earlier on Thursday in London, after boarding a flight from Los Angeles late on Wednesday night, amid extensive negotiations between the two clubs.Women’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from world’s top six leaguesRead moreThe current world record transfer fee for a women’s footballer stands at the $1.5m that was paid by Orlando Pride last month to sign Lizbeth Ovalle from the Mexican side Tigres, which eclipsed the £1m move by Arsenal to sign Olivia Smith from Liverpool in July. It is understood Chelsea’s move for Thompson would not be a world-record fee upfront but could rise to be so with add-ons.It came at the end of a busy day in the WSL window, with the promoted sideLondon City Lionessesconfirming the signing of the Barcelona youngster Lucía Corrales.

An individual who made a huge contribution to Scottish club football, the robust forward’s only goal for his country came in Copenhagen’s original Parken. Denmark 1Scotland4 in October 1972. The Scots, then briefly under the management of Tommy Docherty, had set themselves on course to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, ending an absence of 16 years.Come Friday, Copenhagen is again the venue. The painful wait this time stretches back to 1998. Togo, North Korea, Panama, Saudi Arabia and Wales have featured in the World Cup since Scotland last did. Steve Clarke will shortly become the longest-serving Scotland manager by games overseen. Scotland have a Ballon d’Or nominee – in respect of Scott McTominay’s country represented if not of birth – and six games to determine their 2026 fate.From fast risers to fallen giants: World Cup 2026 qualifiers to watchRead moreIs this to be Clarke’s slowest of final steps or a lusty skip into the pantheon of Scotland greats? The answer will be apparent by November. Clarke has 540 minutes to deliver automatically what would by a distance be the finest achievement of his career. Nobody should underestimate the scale of this task.It has been clear for some time that Clarke views the end of this World Cup cycle, and his contract, as a natural time to conclude a tenure which began in 2019. Whether that inevitable departure is healthy is a point for debate. The more serious, lingering notion the 62-year-old has to disprove is that he is presiding over a team that peaked long before thenumbing experience of Germanyandthe last Euros. Scotlandrallied over the latter stagesof their subsequent Nations League campaign but the paucity of performance in losing home gamesagainst Greeceand Iceland, conceding three goals in each, had red flags flying high above Hampden Park. Clarke’s rare public pronouncements have not quietened grumbling in the stands, which exists partly through familiarity breeding contempt. Greece, an emerging youthful force, again lie in wait in this qualifying section.Scotland’s desire to end their World Cup hiatus is palpable and how the tournament would benefitfrom a tartan invasion. Clarke’s success in raising standards is similarly plain. However, there are unavoidable reasons for scepticism. So many of them, in fact, that Clarke’s challenge, starting against Denmark on Friday, is substantial. The Scottish Football Association will revert to panic mode when it eventually comes to sourcing Clarke’s successor. The lack of discernible playing talent will render this job a hard sell. Scotland’s clubs either play a part in or do not care about the broader picture, as the lengths gone to in sourcing journeymen in the recent transfer window shows.Scotland’s goalkeeping scenario is more national emergency than dilemma. Liam Kelly does not play for Rangers, Zander Clark surely will soon not be playing for Hearts and Angus Gunn has had no game time since lasting seven minutes of that loss to Iceland in June. Clarke will probably turn to Gunn against Denmark, which is akin to damning the 29-year-old with faint praise. The Nottingham Forest back-up keeper has failed to convince in Scotland colours.View image in fullscreenSteve Clarke (right) has raised standards for Scotland but he has a paucity of high-class players at his disposal.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAThe central defence is weak in international context. That Andy Robertson is no longer a guaranteed starter at left-back for Liverpool need not be a huge issue, but it suggests his star is fading. Kieran Tierney’s return to Celtic has been notable only because of obvious physical limitations, which led on Thursday to his withdrawal through injury. The attack is either untried at this level (Kieron Bowie and George Hirst) or lacks scoring punch (Che Adams). Hence continued reliance on Lyndon Dykes. Giddy excitement over Ben Gannon-Doak ignores the fact the 19-year-old still has to gain a foothold in club football, as Clarke has regularly pointed out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aaron Hickey’s return after a horrible period out with serious hamstring problems should alleviate worries at right-back, where Scotland had been scratching for a solution. The midfield, spearheaded by McTominay, is more than adequate for international football. Clarke’s conundrum there is in accommodating so many talented players. It must also be recognised that Denmark away is precisely the sort of fixture Scotland tend to revel in, with backs against the wall and organisation not in doubt. Even a point would be a fine outcome before Monday evening’s must-/surely-will-win meeting with Belarus in deepest Hungary. Scotland’s last meeting with Denmark four years ago witnessed arguably the finest performance of Clarke’s tenureand a 2-0 win.In 1972, Scotland were on the crest of a wave. Billy Bremner, Martin Buchan, Peter Lorimer; Kenny Dalglish and Joe Harper replaced Lou Macari and Bone. Copenhagen triggered a run in which the country reached six out of seven World Cups. There are parallels as another section begins in the Danish capital. It is just that the fundamental differences feel so hard to shake off.Explore more on these topicsScotlandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s been training well. She’s mentally and physically in a good position.“She is one of the players who everyone wants to see on the pitch and it’s nice for me to have her in the squad with her leadership and experience.

Bompastor said: “She had successful surgery, which is something really positive, but it’s sad for Mayra and sad for us because she was a really important player in the team.

After taking time to find their feet with positive performances not always matching their results, the Hammers went on an unbeaten run that kept them in the picture for fifth place. In the end, they finished just five points off Brighton who claimed that spot.Their turn in fortunes very much came with the return of Shekiera Martinez from her loan spell at Freiburg. The 24-year-old spearheaded the attacking line, developing a relationship with the influential Viviane Asseyi, who enjoyed one of her best seasons in east London. In 12 appearances, Martinez scored 10 goals and finished just two below joint Golden Boot winners Bunny Shaw and Alessia Russo with a shot conversion rate of 32%.The Germany forward will be integral once again this season and the club’s ability to hold on to her and most of Skinner’s preferred 15 players was crucial over the summer. While there have been significant outgoings with players such as Dagny Brynjarsdóttir, Shannon Cooke and Kirsty Smith departing, the majority were on the fringes with limited game time.One concern will be the relatively few number of signings that have been made this window. Yu Endo brings experience to the back line while the Wales international Ffion Morgan has proved her talent after four years at Bristol City. Sarah Brasero , brought in from Estoril, and Leila Wandeler, who arrives from Lyon, are exciting youngsters at a key stage of their development as footballers.A pre-season tour to Prague provided valuable preparation for the campaign ahead. That was followed by a win over Liverpool and loss to Arsenal in readiness for an opening-day derby at Tottenham, a game that has traditionally proved to be entertaining and competitive.West Ham finished 9th in 2021, 6th in 2022, 8th in 2023, 11th in 2024 and 9th in 2025West Ham will hope to improve on last season’s 9th place finish.The managerSkinner is entering her third season at the club and is starting to see the rewards of her rebuild. Before last season, she brought up the issue of short-term contracts leading to high player turnover and the club have responded. Honest with her players and willing to speak about wider issues in the game, she has worked to build an industrious team that is good in possession and always looking to attack. Smart recruitment has brought in Katrina Gorry, Manuela Pavi and Martinez, all of whom have helped the team progress.Off-field pictureWest Ham are in talks to sella stake in their women’s team to Monarch Collective, the world’s largest female-dedicated sport fund.

The Hammers’ existing ownership would retain a controlling interest.

After theWorld Test Championship triumphin June came a second to savour at the home of cricket: a narrow five-run win under lights that sealed their first one-day international series victory on English soil for 27 years.As the tourists kept the celebrations in check – this was never going to top the final at the same venue three months ago – England reflected on a fifth ODI series defeat from their last six. They improved onTuesday’s Headingley howler, even if it would have been hard to have played any worse.England given target of 331 to beat South Africa: second men’s one-day international – liveRead moreSet 331 to win, Harry Brook’s side made 325 for nine through a spirited effort that did crackle at times. Jacob Bethell tucked into Keshav Maharaj en route to 58 from just 40 balls, Joe Root finessed a classy 61 before being stumped. And after Jos Buttler’s brisk 61 from 51, they needed 75 from the last 45 balls of the chase with four wickets in hand.But the Proteas always felt ahead and ultimately prevailed. A yorker from Lungi Ngidi had lit up Buttler’s stumps and, despite some late blows from Will Jacks (39) the regular fall of wickets then left the lower order too much to do. It finished with Jofra Archer needing 16 off the final over from Senuran Muthusamy – only to fall just short.Two-nil down, England now head to Southampton on Sunday hoping for a consolation win before the T20s that follow. This was their eighth defeat from 11 ODIs since Brendon McCullum’s brief was expanded to include the white-ball teams – their only wins this year coming against West Indies, who are ranked ninth in the world to England’s eighth.“It’s easy to say that, but in my eyes that’s just an excuse,” said Brook, when asked if fatigue or the switch from 100-ball cricket were relevant. “Slipping into any format is difficult. But we’re all good enough cricketers to be able to make that change and adapt as quickly as possible.”A bit went England’s way, too, be it Brook winning the toss after a morning of rain or an outfield that quickened up in the second innings. Wiaan Mulder, whose figures of three for 33 helped derail the home side at Headingley, was missing after an overnight illness. Saqib Mahmood coming in for Sonny Baker also meant more experience for England.But South Africa were unperturbed, their imposing 330 for eight built on another bright start from Aiden Markram (49) and a fourth-wicket stand from Matthew Breetzke (85) and Tristan Stubbs (58) that put on 147 in just 126 balls. Dewald Brevis then lit the afterburners, the 22-year-old smoking 42 from 20 to underline his remarkable hand-eye talent.Archer ran through his variations for four wickets but, not for the first time, the standout bowler was Adil Rashid. Sending down 10 overs for just 33 runs – and hit for just one boundary – the leg-spinner tickled Temba Bavuma’s outside edge with a beauty and removed Markram with a sharp return catch. In a parallel universe, this would augur well for the Ashes.View image in fullscreenWill Jacks hit 39 runs before losing his wicket to Nandre Burger.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAlthough, as dreamily as Rashid bowled, there was no obvious need for South Africa to take him on. One of the hallmarks of Brook’s captaincy has been to pack the batting and winkle out 10 overs using part-time spin. Bethell did snuff out Brevis with his left-arm darts but, sending down five overs apiece, he and Jacks were taken for a combined 112 runs.Breetzke was among those to cash in, returning from a hamstring niggle to become the first man in ODI history to pass 50 in each of his first five innings. The right-hander unfurled some eye-catching shots, including one silky inside-out six off Bethell, only to be mugged by an Archer slower ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The youngster atoned at least, his late flurry of three fours and three sixes – plus a handy 32 from Corbin Bosch – leaving England needing to break a record at Lord’s.Their bid to do so faltered immediately, Jamie Smith pushing hard at an inswinger from Nandre Burger first ball for an edge behind – the first of three for the slippery left-armer. Ben Duckett also lacked fluency, penned in for a 33-ball 14 and bowled by Maharaj reverse sweeping.In came Bethell at 66 for two in the 13th over to continue a right-left combination with Root and finding some form at the end of a personally challenging summer. Taking 19 runs off an over from Maharaj, Bethell gave the innings momentum only to slash Bosch to backward point.When Root followed soon after – Maharaj reasserting himself – England’s chances hinged on one of Brook, Buttler or Jacks seeing it home. But the tourists kept plugging away, Muthusamy removing Brook for 33 via a leading edge and Burger shutting down Jacks and Brydon Carse.Much will be made of England’s balance, even if South Africa’s XI was set up much the same. The Proteas are a more developed and confident side, however, and Lord’s has proved inspirational for them this summer.Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Losing at the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, was painful enough, but Alcaraz’s disappointment was particularly down to how he had lost.Novak Djokovic had visibly begun to struggle with a leg injury earlyin their four-set quarter-final, but instead of focusing on his own game, Alcaraz found himself staring across the net and thinking too much about his opponent’s condition rather than about what he needed to win. While the Spaniard’s focus wavered, Djokovic’s difficulties inspired his most offensive, decisive tennis, and he willed himself to a miraculous victory.Djokovic unsure if he’ll be fit enough to beat Alcaraz in US Open semi-finalsRead moreThat meeting was the last encounter in what has become one of the most unusual rivalries the sport has seen. At 38 and 22 respectively, Djokovic and Alcaraz were born 16 years apart. Their first meeting at the Madrid Open in May 2022, won by Alcaraz, occurred two days after his 19th birthday and two weeks before Djokovic turned 35. Considering that significant age gap, just one match between them would have been a fortunate outcome.Instead, when they enter Arthur Ashe Stadium for their semi-final match on Friday, they will have met on every single major stage in professional tennis: Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open, the Olympic Games and ATP Finals. Djokovic leads their head-to-head 5-3 and those meetings have included some of the most memorable matches in the sport, from Alcaraz’s recovery to win hisfirst Wimbledon title in 2023to Djokovic’scareer‑completing Olympic gold medaltriumph last year.The contrasting dynamics of their careers have always been at the forefront of this match, with the Serb desperately fighting to maintain his high level despite his advancing age while Alcaraz attempts to mature and grow as he moves closer to his physical peak.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic leads Carlos Alcaraz 5-3 in their head-to-head, including beating him in the gold medal match at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Photograph: Claudia Greco/ReutersThis tournament has underscored both of those challenges. After spending his early years succeeding despite his wavering focus and impulsive shot selection, Alcaraz has never been more consistent. The 22‑year‑old is seeking to reach an eighth consecutive final and a third major final in a row. The confidence he has gained from an immense summer has afforded him his first run to a grand slam semi-final without dropping a set. Alongside his improved concentration and clarity of thought on each point, the development of Alcaraz’s serve into an increasingly consistent weapon has been invaluable.Djokovic, meanwhile, has reached a point in his career where he simply does not know how his body will respond to the difficulties of trying to compete against the best players in the world across a gruelling grand slam tournament while in best‑of‑five‑sets format. Hisphysical difficulties at the grand slam tournamentsthroughout this year have been clear warning signs. However, he is still performing at such a high level and he is as resilient as ever, which he reinforced with a mental masterclass in his four-set win overthe No 4 seed, Taylor Fritz, on Tuesday.On a basic level, this semi-final pits Alcaraz’s immense offensive weapons and variety against Djokovic’s ability to absorb and neutralise such attacking pressure, responding with relentless depth, direction changes and spotless decision-making. But in a match-up between two of the most complete players in history, how they adapt in the heat of battle will determine the winner. Back in Australia, Djokovic’s physical struggles left him with no choice but to attack at all costs. As he served supremely well and smothered Alcaraz with his forehand aggression, the Spaniard just did not know how to respond.There will be moments when Djokovic tests Alcaraz’s patience and shot tolerance but, considering the uncertainty around his physicality and the No 2 seed’s efficient run through the draw, a similarly offensive-minded performance is surely the 24-time major champion’s best chance of winning. Alcaraz, of course, can dominate anyone in the world from the baseline but he will have to return better than in Australia, rein in his impulsive instincts and fare better in the advantage-court backhand battle, which Djokovic dominated in his recent wins over the Spaniard. One positive outcome for Alcaraz is that, unlike in Melbourne, they will compete in the daytime here, the livelier day conditions augmenting his unparalleled ball pace and spin.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having spent his earlier years as the third man, tasked with taking down the duopoly of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he now occupies the same position against two players born almost two decades after him. Although the odds are stacked against him – as they were 17 years ago – the simple goal is to frustrate Alcaraz and Sinner for as long as he can.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Carlos AlcarazNovak DjokovicUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world No 1 and top seed in New York was tested only in flickers but proved unmovable, saving all seven break points he faced while converting five of his six opportunities. The result laid bare once again the gulf between Sinner’s metronomic consistency and the rest of the field, even when confronted with a compatriot armed with one of the most elegant backhands in the sport.Auger-Aliassime comes from set down to beat De Minaur and make US Open last fourRead moreSinner burst from the gate, taking the first five games from an unsettled Musetti and pocketing the opening set in just 27 minutes.

The second set was tighter. At 1-2, Sinner erased the only early danger with a 129mph unreturnable serve out wide before holding with a thunderous ace. Musetti went break point down in the fifth game after succumbing in an 18-shot rally only to escape with the hold to stay on serve. But serving at 4-4, 30-40, he double-faulted to gift the advantage to Sinner, who calmly served it out after the change of ends for a two-set lead.The lack of tension in the match led to some poor crowd behavior – the customary din of conversation in Arthur Ashe Stadium even more distracting than normal, spectators going to and from their seats outside changeovers, the actor John Turturro at one point taking the place of a camera operator to delight of nearby fans – but Sinner’s composure never wavered, his game as mechanical as the No 7 trains rattling by within earshot.By the start of the third, Musetti’s resistance was fading. He was broken in his opening service game and immediately under siege again. To his credit, he manufactured four break-point chances in the very next game and another two at 3-2, but Sinner repelled all of them with a mixture of poise and precision. When Musetti was broken again late in the set, the contest was over, Sinner sealing victory at love with a pair of aces.The statistics lent numerical context to the one-way traffic. Sinner won 42 of 46 first-serve points (91%), finished with 28 winners to 17 unforced errors, never lost his serve and maintained an iron grip whenever danger loomed. Musetti struck 12 winners but sprayed 22 errors, undone as much by his failure to capitalize on rare openings as by Sinner’s relentless ball-striking. The 24-year-old has now dropped just 38 games in five matches, the second-fewest by a man to reach the US Open semi-finals since 2020. It was also his 26th consecutive win at majors played on hard courts, a streak that moved him above John McEnroe and now ranks alongside Novak Djokovic and Ivan Lendl as the third-longest in history.View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner returns a shot against Lorenzo Musetti during Wednesday night’s US Open quarter-final match.Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images“Finding myself again in the semis of a grand slam, it’s a great achievement,” said Sinner, who is bidding to become the first man to successfully defend the US Open title since Roger Federer claimed the last of five straight championships in 2008. “We try to prepare in the best possible way to be in this position. I really like playing best-of-five, I know my body a little bit better, so I’m very pleased to be here again.”Anisimova gains revenge for Wimbledon by beating Swiatek to make US Open last fourRead moreFor Musetti, the occasion was both a lesson and a measure of how far he has come. “I never played, honestly, someone who put me on this kind of rush in the rally,” he said afterwards. “He was always leading the rally. Of course, he’s better than me, and he showed.” He added: “Pretty impressed by Jannik’s performance today. I think he served really well, and he was pushing me to my limit. I’m happy I played against him to understand the things I have to improve.”Sinner, for his part, was quick to acknowledge the peculiar challenge of facing a compatriot. “Obviously, we know each other very well,” he said on court. “We come from the same country, we have so many Italian players every time in the draw. It’s nice to play here, obviously, playing Davis Cup together and then stuff like this, but we have to take the friendship away for the match and then when we shake hands it’s everything fine. From my point of view, it was a great performance, very solid, especially starting very well in the match.”Asked whether he felt he was playing his best tennis, Sinner demurred. “Every player who is in the semis of a grand slam, they are playing amazing tennis,” he said. “It’s a very special tournament. They always say it’s the last grand slam of the year, the last biggest tournament we have throughout the season. So there’s no better place to play a night match here in the biggest stadium we have with an amazing crowd. It means a lot to me.”He also reflected on the significance of an all-Italian occasion. “For sure at home, some Italians didn’t sleep,” he said with a grin. “We are very proud to be Italian. As I said, it’s a special country. We have amazing support, Italians are basically everywhere. So it’s great to be Italian and, yeah, see you in the next round.”For Sinner, the victory stretched his unbeaten run against Italian opponents to 16-0 and secured a place in a fifth consecutive major semi-final. It was also his 86th win at a grand slam, tying Nicola Pietrangeli for the most by an Italian man. He will next face Felix Auger-Aliassime, the Canadian 25th seedwho rallied past Alex de Minaurearlier in the day. Auger-Aliassime has won two of their three previous meetings, though Sinner thrashed him for the loss of only two games in Cincinnati last month. “It’s going to be completely different, because conditions here are different,” Sinner said. “He’s had some big wins, so big confidence for him. From my point of view, I always try to look at myself. It’s going to be a very, very difficult match for both of us, because at a grand slam the energy and everything is different.”The quarter-final was a milestone for Italian tennis, the first time two men from the country had faced one another in the second week of any major. But there was never much doubt over which Italian would emerge. Sinner’s grip on Flushing Meadows remains firm, his authority undimmed, and the prospect of another deep September run now looks as routine as his latest victory.Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Jannik SinnerTennisUS Open tennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

With that work concluding, and a new chapter starting for the institute, now is the right time for new leadership and I am excited about what it will achieve.”One source familiar with the internal debate at ATI said Innes’s departure indicated that Kyle’s letter had been taken seriously. However, the source added that changes at board level would be needed as well if ATI was to focus fully on defence and national security. The reply letter to Kyle from the ATI chair, Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, said it would focus on defence and national security but would still work on environment and health.An ATI staff member, who said they had consulted on a range of concerns held by colleagues, said the resignation of Innes indicated governance at the institute was not working and that its leadership “needed to be held to account”. Many employees still want the institute to address “societal challenges” as well as focus on defence and security, said the staff member.Gurr thanked Innes, who will remain in her post until later this year, for focusing on “delivering real-world impact in priority areas for the UK”.‘Shut it down and start again’: staff disquiet as Alan Turing Institute faces identity crisisRead moreATI has been beset by internal strife since last year as staff protested against changes, culminating in a group of employeesfiling a whistleblower complaintto the Charity Commission last month. Citing references to funding in Kyle’s letter, they said they feared £100m of government backing may be withdrawn, which “could lead to the institute’s collapse”. ATI is a registered charity but relies on the government for most of its funding.The institute, which employs 440 people, had been undergoing a transformation programme before Kyle’s intervention, labelled Turing 2.0, in which it would focus on three key areas: health, the environment and defence and security. The overhaul has caused staff upheaval, with employeestelling the boardlast year that ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy”.A redundancy process is also under way at the institute, which recently notified about 50 staff that their jobs were at risk. ATI has dropped projects related to online safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality.ATI, named after the British mathematician widely considered the father of modern computing, was founded in 2015 as a national institute for data science before adding AI to its remit in 2017.Its goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as drive an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, University College London and Warwick, with its research work including teaming up with the Met Office toimprove weather forecasting, creatingcardiac “digital twins”to study heart disease, andimproving air traffic control.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The regularPixel10 costs £799 (€899/$799/A$1,349) – the same as last year’s Pixel 9 – undercutting the 10 Pro by £200 and matching rivals from Samsung and Apple while offering more for your money.The design is almostidentical to the Pixel 9, except for some new bold colours and the all-important new third camera in the pill-shaped lump on the back. The satin aluminium and glass body feels like a quality piece of hardware and the design certainly stands out in a sea of samey slab phones. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp, super-bright and smooth with a 120Hz refresh rate.View image in fullscreenThe fast screen and rapid under-display fingerprint scanner help the Pixel 10 feel very responsive in use.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe glass back hides another upgrade: Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support.

It also supports 15W wireless charging.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe new Tensor G5 chip is about 34-38% faster than Google’s previous top processor in testing, which is quite a leap for the brand, but still falls short of the raw performance of Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon chip used in rivals. The Pixel feels rapid in operation and will handle most things just fine.The battery life is solid if not class-leading. It manages roughly two days of light usage between charges or about 33 hours of heavy use, including five hours of 5G out and about with seven hours actively using the screen. Most people will need to charge it every other day.The Tensor G5 also includes a significantly faster AI processor that runs Google’s advanced AI quicker and handles more complex systems on-device, making the Pixel a showcase for Google’s AI prowess.Android 16 with AIView image in fullscreenGoogle’s new Magic Cue, Daily Hub and Camera Coach AI features.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Pixel 10 runs the latest Android 16 out of the box and comes with software supportuntil August 2032. Google’stake on Androidis full of bold colours, big buttons and fun typography with plenty of nice touches and haptic interactions throughout the system. It’s a quality experience even if you choose more subtle colour combinations.The Pixel is a vehicle for some of Google’s most advanced AI systems, running the latest version of Gemini Nano on-device, which powers all sorts of AI features including various writing, dictation and image-editing tools. A flashy new voice translation system for phone calls can speak to you in a simulacrum of the caller’s voice, rather than one of the default Gemini voices.But Magic Cue is the most advanced new AI feature which runs locally on your phone and aims to be your little assistant running in the background on your device to proactively help you do things faster on your phone. It combines information from your Google account with multiple data sources on your phone to pop-up suggestions of useful information when using certain Google apps. For instance, it pulled up my order confirmation emails in a little card in the phone app when I called to check where my delivery was, giving me one-tap access to the order number.Or if someone texts about when your flight is due to land, it shows the time and date pulled from your calendar ready to send them with a single tap. The weather app suggests locations for your upcoming trips from your calendar, too.These things don’t sound particularly exciting, but are a step in the right direction for AI away from flashy gimmicks to useful little background time savers. Magic Cue currently works with Gmail, maps, calendar, Keep notes, screenshots, contacts and messages, with Google Photos and a few other Google apps coming soon. The biggest problem is that it doesn’t work in third-party apps yet, so if you use WhatsApp rather than text messages it can’t help you.CameraView image in fullscreenThe camera app is fairly simple to use but has plenty of tools and modes to make the best of your photography.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Pixel 10 features a 10.5-megapixel selfie and three rear cameras: a 48MP main, 13MP ultra wide and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto. It addresses the main complaint about the base-model Pixel phones, which have lacked a telephoto cameras.The main and ultrawide cameras produce excellent images across a range of lighting conditions, doing better than rivals at this price in higher contrast scenes or dimmer indoor lighting. The new 5x telephoto significantly closes the distance to objects shooting great photos and reaching up to 20x digital zoom if needed. The photos from all three cameras show a little grain when viewed at full crop, but most will be very pleased with them.Google is still the best at reliably producing good images without much thought. The new auto Best Take mode improves on the popular group shot Best Take system by shooting multiple images to automatically blend them together for an image where everyone is looking at the camera. In most photos it won’t have to do too much, but the more people and the more complex the situation, the more the AI intervenes.View image in fullscreenThe large pill-shaped camera bump on the back acts as a rest for your fingers and stops the Pixel rocking around on a table.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe popular Add Me feature allows the photographer to be added in to larger and more complex group shots, and has been improved to support larger groups of people, more complex backgrounds and images of pets. The camera app also now addsC2PA content credentialsto photos that show how the image was captured and whether generative AI was involved.One of the most overtly AI tools is the new Camera Coach feature, which uses Gemini to help you compose and frame a shot for a better picture. Press a small button at the top of the viewfinder and it sends the current view to Google’s servers to analyse and suggest several different possible compositions. Select the one you like the look of and it guides you through the steps of moving the camera, framing the shot and taking the photo. In testing, the suggestions were pretty good, so for anyone interested in improving their photography, this could be a low-key way of getting a bit of help.Overall, the Pixel 10 shoots great photos and videos with generally helpful AI additions, particularly with Best Take and Add Me, but it is possible you end up with images of a moment that may never have actually happened.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenPixel 10s sold in US lack the nano sim slot in the top of the phone and must rely entirely on eSims.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe batteryis rated to lastin excess of 1,000 full charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is repairable by Google, third-party shops or self-repairwith manualsandparts available.The Pixel 10 is contains 32% recycled materials by weight including aluminium, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, plastic, rare-earth elements, tungsten and tin. The company breaks down thephone’s environmental impactin its report and willrecycle old devicesfor free.PriceThe Google Pixel 10 costs from£799(€899/$799/A$1,349) in a choice of four colours.For comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro costs from£999, thePixel 9acosts£399, theSamsung Galaxy S25costs£799and theiPhone 16costs£799.VerdictThe Pixel 10 sets a new bar for base-model flagship phones, offering a high-quality experience and great camera with a meaningful telephoto zoom that doesn’t feel like a poor second cousin to the Pro models.The outside has not changed a lot since last year but it is an attractive design that stands out in the sea of rather samey phones, at least from the back. It feels snappy in operation, even if it doesn’t have the fastest chip available, and the battery lasts a decent 1.5 to two days between charges.Some of the new AI features actually seem like meaningful improvements, particularly Magic Cue, auto Best Take and other small bits that run locally in the background while you are doing things. Combined with Gemini, Google is leagues ahead in the era of actually useful AI tools compared with rivals such as Apple, and it doesn’t get in the way of the core smartphone experience.It is not quite the killer bargain ofGoogle’s cheaper Pixel 9abut the Pixel 10 is one of the best phones you can get and great value nonetheless.Pros:seven years of software updates, great camera with 5x telephoto, great screen, Magic Cue and impressive local AI features, Qi2 wireless charging and magnetic accessory support, good battery life, good size, fast fingerprint and face recognition.Cons:face unlock option not as secure as Face ID, raw performance and battery life short of best-in-class, no physical sim card slot in the US.View image in fullscreenThe Pixel 10 is an attractive, quality-feeling flagship smartphone that is better than rivals.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsPixelGoogleSmartphonesAndroidMobile phonesreviewsShareReuse this content"

But the fastest the police have seized was capable of 70mph. What will stop the rise of these souped-up and potentially fatal vehicles?Sam WollastonThu 4 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareAbusy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate inLondonand Sgt Stuart Ford of the City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road. “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d still pull him over and have a look.”Not today, though, because the non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year.News comes over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the familiar green livery ofUberEats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which he thought was allowed.Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20, 30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.”E-bikes aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present background noise of urban Britain is theclick click click of a kid on a stolen Lime bike, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence, registration or insurance to ride one.The trouble is a lot of e-bikesaren’tlegal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of. While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard.He assumed the bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they wouldn’t catch me,” he says.The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike, and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the company’s.”Back at Bishopsgate police station, Ford shows me the pound with some of the other bikes they’ve seized over the past few days (from here they get taken away to be crushed). There’s one that’s probably 500 or 750W. The pedals aren’t even connected to the chain to turn the wheel – it’s not even pretending to be a bicycle. Several have been converted from regular pedal bikes, using kits, also readily available. Again, not illegal in itself, so long as the motor is not bigger than 250W – you can generally tell from the size of the hub on the rear wheel. A few seconds on my phone, and I’ve found a 3,000W conversion kit, made in China, that I can have delivered for £142.59. I can’t see anything about it being illegal to ride on the road in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘This is basically a motorcycle’ … PC David Parker (left) and PC Harry Rose stop delivery rider Mahede Hasan for riding an illegal e-bike in the City of London.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianFord estimates that about three-quarters of the illegal e-bikes they deal with are ridden by food delivery riders. They’re getting wise to the clampdown. “They’ll come down the road, see us, spin round, that’s usually a giveaway they’re on an illegal bike. We’ll then try to catch up with them if we can.”E-bikes – usually high-powered, ready-made ones – are also the vehicle of choice for gangs of phone snatchers, Ford adds: “Because they’re so quick, and they can’t be detected because they’ve got no licence plates and [if the riders are wearing helmets] you can’t see who they are.”What about the people who aren’t committing any other crimes, who just want to get around a bit quicker, most likely in order to make a half-decent wage? The issue is, says Ford, that these illegal e-bikes are in effect motorbikes. “These people have passed no test, have no road training and don’t have the road skills. They just get on and ride around without insurance, tax, the bike not conforming to lights and everything else it should conform to, it’s not registered with the DVLA, all these things.”Ford shows me another one they’ve just impounded; it looks more like a motorbike than a bicycle. He invites me to lift up one end to feel the weight of it. “Imagine if that hit you – or a child – at 30, 40mph.” The fastest one they’ve seized was capable of 70mph.Christine White doesn’t know how fast the e-bike that hit her dad was going. On the morning of 6 July 2023, 91-year-old army veteran Jim Blackwood was sorting the bins outside his house in Rochester, Kent, when a man on an e-bike coming down the hill ran into him. White, who was staying with her parents at the time, ran out in her pyjamas. “Dad had managed to get up and was hanging on next door’s gate,” she tells me.View image in fullscreenChristine White with her father, Jim Blackwood, who was killed after being hit by an e-bike.Photograph: Courtesy of Christine WhiteIt didn’t initially seem that bad – Jim had a scrape on his cheek and was bleeding from his finger. But in hospital they found he had internal injuries – a bleed on the brain and an artery in his kidney was ruptured. After an operation, there were more complications, a heart attack and infections. He ended up spending three months in hospital before being sent home for palliative care. He died on 13 October. Before the accident, Jim had been in great health. “I expected him to get to 100, no problem,” White says. The rider is now awaiting trial on charges of manslaughter and “causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving”. He has not yet entered a plea.White thinks the way e-bikes are classified should be updated, even legal e-bikes (she doesn’t know if the one that hit her dad was legal or not). “For me, an e-bike is no different to a 50cc moped, except it’s electric rather than petrol-powered. The government has been far too slow to bring in proper regulations. They should need insurance, and a registration plate, be identifiable.”Her father had four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. She says her mum has trouble coming to terms with the fact that her husband, who served with the British army for 26 years, in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and before that clearing mines in Malaysia, is no longer around. “Mum says he survived all that and then he gets killed outside his front door.”Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for Leeds North, calls the danger posed by illegal e-bikes “a crisis hiding in plain sight”. He’s chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, which this summer publisheda report on the issue. Its findings highlighted a surge in battery fires caused by unregulated e-bike conversion kits, low-cost batteries and poor-quality imports. In 2023, the London fire brigade attended 179 incidents involving e-bike or e-scooter fires. That December,28-year-old Mohsin Janjua diedwhen his e-bike battery caught fire at his home in Bradford. The APPGCW report also highlights the online marketplaces selling unsafe products with little or no oversight, enforcement or legal liability. “It never ceases to amaze me that you can sell a product that is illegal to be used on the roads,” Hamilton tells me.He’s a big fan of legitimate e-bikes, and has a British-made folding one himself. “I love it. When I finish this call I’m going to get on my e-bike and ride home. It will never catch fire because it is properly designed and has proper battery management systems.” And if he’s rushing home, at 15.5mph the electrical assistance will cut out. “I do go faster than that, but by using the muscles in my legs.” It cost £1,600 – cheaper than the equivalent Brompton, he says, but almost certainly not in Mahede Hasan’s price range.The exploitation of gig-economy riders, who are incentivised to use faster, illegal bikes to meet delivery targets, is also underlined in the report. “Deliveroohas been sold for £2.9bnto an American conglomerate [a takeover by rival company DoorDash], and that’s off the back of the most shocking exploitation of some of these riders, most of whom daren’t give their names because they’re in the country illegally,” says Hamilton. “What happens, I’m told, is that people who pay people smugglers to get into this country are told they can pay the money back by taking this job for the next three years and earning their way back out of it. So it’s even worse for them, because they don’t even get to keep the paltry amount they get paid for the deliveries that they make, which they have to do illegally. It’s a circle, isn’t it? And you’ve got to break that circle somewhere.”View image in fullscreen“It never ceases to amaze me that you can sell a product that is illegal to be used on the roads” … Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for Leeds North, on his legal e-bike.Photograph: EstarliHe compares it to what was going on in the 19th century. “When theFactory Actswere passed, MPs said we’re going to need to have inspectors to enforce them or they’ll just be ignored by the exploiters. So they introduced theFactory Inspectorate, which stopped children being exploited in factories to earn vast profits for the owners. This is a new form of industrial revolution where the most vulnerable are being exploited but now they’re foreigners, people who have come here for asylum or economic migration.”Hamilton, and the report, call for a number of things: for online retailers to withdraw unsafe e-bikes from sale; making retailers legally accountable for unsafe listings; ending the loophole that allows them to be sold under the guise of off-road use; and a safety Kitemark for legal bikes. Additionally, it calls for enforcing compliance from delivery companies, requiring them to run checks on the bikes used by couriers; and rights and protections for gig-economy riders.Celestino Pereira, originally from Brazil, came to the UK – legally – in 2019, and began working in London as a rider forDeliveroo. “You only need a phone and a bicycle, just show the number and pick up the order, no need to speak English, so it was good for me.”Pereira began on a pedal bike, but found it impossible to make the minimum wage, so when he had enough money he got an e-bike – a road-legal one, for about £500 – and was initially able to get a few more orders. But three weeks after getting it, the e-bike was stolen outside a block of flats in south London.That’s when he decided to give up on e-bikes. He thinks the legal ones aren’t suited to real-world working conditions. “Many models don’t allow for battery replacements, so riders have to sit idle for hours, waiting to recharge. When replacement batteries are an option, they are so expensive.” Pereira got a petrol moped, which meant he had to do CBT (compulsory basic training), have a licence, get insurance, all of which cost him money. He estimates that about 70% of food delivery riders in London are on illegal e-bikes, and he understands why. “They’re cheaper than legal ones and are faster, so you can complete more orders, and they can have more batteries so you don’t have to stop to recharge.”Pereira estimates that now, with his moped, he makes about £11 an hour. He knows people who are struggling to make seven or eight pounds. “The companies have no interest in the wellbeing of the workers, it’s about minimising the costs and maximising returns.” As soon as his son is old enough to go to and from school on his own, he will try to find other work, he says.A Deliveroo spokesperson says: “We take our responsibilities regarding road safety in the communities we operate in very seriously. All riders are provided with road safety information when they join, and we have a number of partnerships in place to give riders access to safe and affordable e-bike rentals. We will investigate and stop working with the rider if they are in breach of their obligations to follow the rules of the road.“Each rider has a minimum guaranteed rate of pay of £12.30 an hour for the period on an order, but in practice most orders pay more than this.An Uber Eats spokesperson says: “Uber Eats is fully committed to tackling illegal work and the criminal networks who are often behind it. We have taken a number of steps, including introducing state-of-the-art identity and document-video verification technology, but we are constantly reviewing our tools and finding new ways to make sure that everyone on our platform has the right to work.”And so back to Hasan, now speaking to me a couple of weeks later from the flat he shares with his parents in east London. His seized bike will probably have been crushed by now. He was also fined £300 and given six points on his driving licence. Again, he stresses that he didn’t know the bike was illegal, and can’t understand how online platforms are allowed to sell them. He also questions the £300 fine. “The first time, if people don’t know, they should give you a warning.”Hasan has got another e-bike; he needs to work. This one is legal, he was assured at the shop: 250W, 15.5mph limit, no throttle. It cost £900, he’s paying in instalments, and it’s going to take a while.E-bikes could slash our reliance on cars – but overpowered illegal models on the roads make us all less safeRead moreHasan says he makes £50-60 for an eight- or nine-hour shift. “On a busy day, sometimes £70. In a week I can make £350.” He hasn’t got a Bangladesh sticker for the new bike’s front mudguard yet, but he does have something to look forward to: he’s heading there at the end of the month to see his wife. They married in 2023, but she can’t join him in the UK. “Unless you earn good money, you cannot bring your spouse. You have to be earning nearly £30,000, and you can’t earn this money doing a delivery job.”There’s a reason illegal e-bikes are illegal: they’re dangerous – to other people on the road, to pedestrians, often to the riders themselves. Still, looking at the bigger picture – of an industry that exploits vulnerable people while making huge profits, and online marketplaces that sell unsafe products with no liability or retribution – it’s hard to see a 21-year-old from Bangladesh, struggling to make the minimum wage, as the bad guy in this story.Explore more on these topicsCyclingPoliceLondonDeliverooWork & careersUberImmigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Donald Trump is hastening Beijing’s riseThu 4 Sep 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 17.24 EDTShareOn Wednesday morning, Beijingers living near Tiananmen Square were issued with cold breakfast packs and ordered to refrain from cooking, lest smoke from stoves cloud the skies above themammoth military parade. China’s Communist party goes toextraordinary lengthsto ensure that nothing obscures the message of such performances – in this case, that Xi Jinping is reshaping the global order and that China is, in his words, “unstoppable”.The parade marked 80 years since the end of the second world war, positioningChinaas the critical force in victory in the east then, and a force to be similarly reckoned with today as “humanity is again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum”, in Mr Xi’s words. China is “not afraid of bullies”.Nationalism has becomeincreasingly centralto the party’s domestic message. For international observers, it was the guest list, even more than thesizeable nuclear and conventional arsenal, which spelled out the intent. The images of the Chinese leader flanked by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, with other autocrats paying court, could hardly have been more striking. It found its intended audience. Donald Trump – his pique perhaps sharpened by the contrast with hisown alarming but underwhelming paradein June – accused the trio of conspiring against the United States.Yet if China’s rise is the underlying force in the global shift of power, it is Mr Trump who has provided it with fresh opportunities as he divides and weakens his nation, bullies US allies andattacks the postwar global order. New Delhi was seen as a potential counterweight to Beijing. But Narendra Modi’s attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, another opportunity for Chinese grandstanding just before the parade, wasa clear riposteto Mr Trump’s punitive tariffs on India. To many governments, China now looks like the more predictable, if not friendlier, player.Despite the talk of an “axis of upheaval”, relations between the Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders are better understood as an alignment. There are limits to, as well as frictions in, the ties, though that need not prevent them enduring or causing lasting damage. Moscow has relied on Chinese diplomatic and economic support and equipment in its war in Ukraine – but has had to turn to Pyongyang for weapons and troops. Mr Xi embraced Mr Kim after Mr Trump wooed the North Korean leader. Now he keeps him close to prevent Pyongyang growing too close to Moscow.China’s military progress also faces challenges. Pakistan’s clash with India in May saw a Chinese fighter planetested in combatfor the first time. But it is decades since the People’s Liberation Army saw action anda widening purge, including of generalspromoted by Mr Xi himself, suggests he is still concerned about its corruption, political reliability or both.It would be folly to ignore Beijing’s statement of intent. But it would also be foolish to confuse it with a statement of fact. The future is still being written. Governments in Asia, Europe and elsewhere still have choices to make; and those will be shaped by US actions as much as Chinese. Mr Trump is surrounded by China hawks. Yet the biggest imminent threat to Taiwan is probably not that Chinese military confidence leads Mr Xi to risk war with the US, but that Mr Trump rats it out for a trade deal.Explore more on these topicsChinaOpinionXi JinpingVladimir PutinKim Jong-unRussiaNorth KoreaDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The comment came asreports emergedthat national guard troops from Texas – not yet federalized under direct presidential control – were preparing to deploy to Chicago in the coming days, in defiance of the opposition repeatedly and forcefully expressed by the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, both Democrats.The White House and the president’s allies have claimed that the deployment is a response to violent crime inChicago. This is a lie. Crime in Chicago has dropped dramatically over the past decades, as it has in every major American city – including Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the national guard and the marines earlier this year, and Washington DC, where armed federal agents have patrolled the streets for much of the past month. The deployment of armed forces to American cities – serving at his pleasure even when they are not officially under his direct command – has nothing to do with “crime”, except insofar as the administration has sought to redefine the term to mean Democratic governance, racial pluralism or the presence of immigrants. There is no violent crime in Chicago, or in any of these cities, that federal troops can be usefully deployed to quell.Soldiers are doing landscaping in DC parks. I’m thrilled for them | Dave SchillingRead moreInstead, the federal agents who will probably invade Chicago in the coming days are there to serve a very different purpose. They are there to assert Trump’s personal authority over government actions, to intimidate populations that did not vote for him, to terrorize and kidnap immigrants and destroy their families, and to make sure that every American knows that even if they succeed in electing Democrats to run their cities and states, the Trump regime can send armed men to their neighborhoods who answer to Republicans.As Trump expands his military occupation of opposition-controlled cities, the chances of a violent confrontation between armed agents of the regime and ordinary Americans rise dramatically. American city dwellers have not yet been terrified into silent submission; many of us still retain the self-respect that has been engendered by a lifetime of democratic citizenship. These people will inevitably, and righteously, protest the Trump administration’s incursions. They will shout with outrage when they see their neighbors dragged into vans by masked men; they will jeer and mock the jackboots sent to terrorize them. Eventually, it seems inevitable that someone will throw a rock, or slam a door too loudly, or frighten one of the masked, armed men who knows he has been deployed by an unpopular ruler to suppress a once-free public. And one of those men, terrified and hate-filled and ashamed, might, in that moment, fire his gun. By sending troops into cities that do not support him, theTrump administrationis assembling kindling in neat stacks around a frayed and fragile civic peace; they are pouring lighter fluid, and lighting a match. They are hoping for a conflagration that will provide an excuse for even more brutality.It seems almost naive to ask if any of this is legal. The supreme court has made it clear that the president – or, at least, this president – has virtually no limits on his authority under conditions of an “emergency”. That no emergency is in evidence in Chicago or any of the other opposition-controlled cities that Trump-aligned forces are invading is irrelevant: an “emergency”, like a “crime”, can be whatever Trump wants it to be. The supreme court will, eventually, either greenlight Trump’s actions or delay intervening against him for long enough that he will be able to accomplish his aims anyway.But lower courts are showing more willingness to check Trump’s more flagrantly illegal conduct – at least temporarily. In California on Tuesday, a courtruledthat Trump’s deployment of the marines and the federalized California national guard into Los Angeles earlier this year violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits the use of federal armed services to enforce domestic law. But in Chicago, the Trump administration is trying a workaround:according to Pritzker, the troops that are amassing are un-federalized members of the Texas national guard – technically under the command of Greg Abbott, the governor, though unambiguously serving the president’s aims. If Pritzker’s claim – which Abbott’s office hasdisputed– is true, then the theory is apparently that Republican-controlled states have the authority to send their own troops into Democratic- controlled states – against the wishes and without the permission of the local authorities – to enforce partisan policy preferences.Pritzker, in an attempt to calm his people and prevent needless violence, implored Chicagoans to “not take the bait”. And certainly the ground forces will create some viral video moments that the president will enjoy posting to his followers. But the line between what is a mere performative display of power and what is an actual seizure of power is no longer quite clear. The boots and the guns, at any rate, are real.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationUS militaryChicagoUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Maybe he should learn it firstSidney BlumenthalThe president seeking to overhaul the Smithsonian has a dark vision of the past that he’s using to advance his agendaThu 4 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 08.41 EDTShareOf all the presidents,Donald Trump– the man who wouldremake the Smithsonianand alter its presentation of “how bad slavery was”,as he put it– is surely the most ignorant of American history itself.What Trump doesn’t know fills the Library of Congress, whose chieflibrarian he has fired, along with driving out the heads ofthe National Archivesand theNational Portrait Gallery, as well asdissolving programsof the National Endowment for the Humanities anddefunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which as a result haspaused the acclaimed American Experiencedocumentary series.Trump claims he is tearing down the entire federal support for history in order to reveal the true story. In hisexecutive orderof 27 March, “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, he stated: “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.” The “improper ideology” that needs to be extirpated is a “divisive, race-centered ideology”.Pentagon to restore Confederate general portrait at West Point libraryRead moreThe White House issued amemoon 21 August, titled “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian”, citing a broad swath of scattered incidents ranging from “wokeness” to representations of immigration to a picture of the former leading health official Anthony Fauci, who is anathema to the right.Trump appointed areview panelto be headed by his vice-president, JD Vance, and the attorney and White House staffer Lindsey Halligan, who is actually the one in charge of the project. Echoing Trump, sheexplained: “We don’t need to overemphasize the negative to teach people that certain aspects of our nation’s history may have been bad.” ShetoldFox News, “What I saw when I was going through the museum, personally, was an overemphasis on slavery, and I think there should be more of an overemphasis on how far we’ve come since slavery.”A Trump White House aideelaborated: “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable.” The aide had the Trump formula down pat: after the purge comes the retribution. Trumptweeted: “I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.”When Trump met on 28 August with Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian and founding director of the Smithsonian’s African American Museum ofHistory, he brought along Halligan as his expert.Her credentials for this crucial assignment in the culture war – after twice competing in the Miss Colorado USA beauty pageant, then becoming an insurance lawyer in Florida – must have been her work as one of Trump’sattorneys involvedin the case overclassified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Trump initiallynoticed herat the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in 2021. She is now, in addition to her other duties, the de facto Trump White House historian-in-residence. She told theWashington Postshe was interested in the civil war and westward expansion. A former colleague described her as “a fan of history”.Beyond Halligan’scomments in a letterabout packaging the past into a palatable Happy Meal of “ideals” and “Americanism”, the administration did not present its actual alternative history or the policies that flow from it. Trumpbellowed that the Smithsonian contained“Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future”.But this gospel of positive-thinking twaddle aside, Trump, proudly ignorant though he is, has for years articulated a vision of American history. That vision does not emphasize the strides the nation has made through tumultuous struggle since the abolition of slavery. Instead, it honors the those who defended slavery, committed treason to preserve it and claim it to be a worthy American “heritage”.Trump has repeatedly sought toshield the Confederate statues and symbolserected as tribute to the “lost cause” myth. He has expressed and unqualified admiration for Robert E Lee as a quintessential American hero almost always coupled with belittling remarks about Lincoln. His view of history squarely aligns him with neo-Confederates, not least those who carried the Confederate flag at the US Capitol during the insurrection on 6 January 2021 and whom he subsequently pardoned.Trump’s version of history is not, however, simply reactionary nostalgia, or treacly kitsch for the restoration of “Uncle Herschel”, the “Old-Timer” to the Cracker Barrel logo. His use of the culture war is a key element to advance his policy agenda.After the civil war, in reaction to Reconstruction, the southern slaveholding oligarchy regrouped to form the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist militias, most under the direction of former Confederate officers, to destroy the possibilities of emancipation and civil rights in the name of what they called “redemption”. Nearly a century later, the civil rights revolution of the 1960s overthrew the southern segregationist regime to restore and expand the enforcement of the original civil war amendments to the US constitution – the 14th amendment securing equal protection under the law and birthright citizenship and the 15th amendment protecting Black voting rights. The great southern historian C Vann Woodward called the civil rights movement the Second Reconstruction.Trump’s neo-Confederate culture war is the symbolic cover for hisfull-scale political assaulton those civil war amendments and the further enactment of their intent in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He is directing a second redemption to tear down the Second Reconstruction.The attack on the constitution has been swift, comprehensive and sharply partisan. Trump is seeking to nullify birthright citizenship in the 14th amendment. He ischallengingthe Voting Rights Act and abandoning previous justice department positions on the constitutionality of remedying racially discriminatory voting maps in support of arguments in the supreme court case Louisiana v Callais.In fear of losing Republican control of the Congress in the 2026 elections, he has encouraged states to ignore the practice of redistricting congressional districts based on the census and instead to redraw racially discriminatory lines to create new Republican seats.The Smithsonian would do well to mount a proper exhibit dedicated to Trump’s historical ignoranceHe has dismantled the civil rights division of the justice department.Seventy per centof its attorneys have been fired or driven to resign. His administration hasplanned to closethe Community Relations Service, a unit created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to mediate racial tensions. He has withdrawn from numerousjustice department lawsuitschallenging voter suppression laws.He has issued an executive order to prevent federal agencies from enforcing regulations forbidding “disparate impact” discrimination. He has attacked grants, contracts and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), withhis justice department creatingan Orwellian-named “civil rights fraud initiative” to target what his agents choose to define as illegal DEI practices, and use it to leverage control over universities, law firms and private businesses.Perhaps no official presidential statement exemplifies Trump’s adherence to the “lost cause” mythology more flagrantly than his veto of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, which included the creation of theNational Naming Commissionto remove names honoring the Confederacy from nine federal military forts and thousands of other assets. “I have been clear in my opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to wash away history and to dishonor the immense progress our country has fought for in realizing our founding principles,” Trumpstated. The House and the Senate overwhelmingly overrode his veto.Once Trump reassumed office, he authorized wiping away the new names, some of them of Black soldiers, and reinstated the old last names of Confederate generals at the forts but with the cynical twist of claiming they werereally for different peoplewith the same names.The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, who called the National Naming Commission “woke lemmings” and its changes “garbage”,said: “Unlike the left, we recognize our history, we don’t erase it.” He announced the return of theConfederate memorialat the Arlington national cemetery, whose frieze depicts a faithfulenslaved woman taking careof a Confederate soldier’s child as he marches off to battle. In the West Point library,the Pentagon has rehungthe 20ft-tall portrait of Robert E Lee in his gray Confederate uniform with a faithful enslaved person tending his horse, Traveller, in the background.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The eulogizing of “the Four Seasons of the Confederacy” is now reframed with contemporary texts to explain the post-civil war romanticizing of the slave republic.The exhibit also features a widely circulated “lost cause”pamphletpublished by the United Confederate Veterans in 1919 that urged southern school districts: “Reject a book that says the South fought to hold her slaves … Reject a book that glorifies Abraham Lincoln and vilifies Jefferson Davis.”For perspective, around the corner from this exhibit, the Virginia Museum of History has stationed the white hood and sheet of a Ku Klux Klansman. In 2020 and 2021, the row of five towering Confederate statues along Richmond’s Monument Avenue of Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, Jeb Stuart, and Matthew Fontaine Maury, erected as “lost cause” icons during the Jim Crow era, were removed.In the interest of “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, the Smithsonian would do well to mount a proper exhibit dedicated to Trump’s historical ignorance and his “divisive race-centered ideology”.‘Political cesspool’: Lincoln, Davis and a battle with echoes for the time of TrumpRead moreThe exhibit could begin with a kind of preface, posting the remarks of Trump’s chief of staff in his first administration, the former marine general John Kelly, who revealed Trump to be the ignoramus-in-chief. “He doesn’t know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,” Kellysaid. Trump reportedly told Kelly that Adolf Hitler “did a lot of good things”. He alsoreportedly saidhe needed “the kind of generals that Hitler had”, people “who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders”. (Trump representatives deny he made the remarks.)Kelly described the conversation to Jeffrey Goldberg inthe Atlantic: “‘Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?’” Kelly asked. “‘Do you mean the Kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t meanHitler’sgenerals?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’” Trump asked Kelly who the “good guys” were in the first world war.Then the exhibit might move on to President William McKinley, whom Trump lately hasinvokedas the “tariff king” to justify his own tariffs, largely ruled illegal so far by the courts. Trump seems to care about no other aspect of McKinley or his presidency – say, the Spanish-American War – while he has revived his memory by removing the Native American name of Mount Denali in Alaska and renaming it Mount McKinley. Trump has ignored McKinley’s second thoughts about tariffs, including his final speech before his assassination in 1901, in which he abjured severe tariffs. But how would Trump know that?Next the exhibit would devote ample space to Trump’s relationship to Abraham Lincoln, the one president Trump has discussed more than any other. In 2018, as Trump’s poll ratings dived, hetweeted: “Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.” Of course, there were no polls in Lincoln’s time.In 2019, Trumpstated: “The radical Democrats want to destroy America as we know it … Abraham Lincoln could not win Texas under those circumstances.” In fact, Lincoln’s name was kept off the ballot in Texas in the 1860 election and, of course, in 1864 when Texas was part of the Confederacy. In 2020, staging aninterviewwith Fox News within the Lincoln Memorial, Trump used Lincoln as a prop to elevate himself as a greater martyr. “They always said, ‘Lincoln, nobody got treated worse than Lincoln.’ I believe I am treated worse.” He apparently had forgotten Lincoln’s assassination.On the third anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, in 2024, he appeared to blame Lincoln for the civil war. “So many mistakes were made,” Trumpsaid. “See, there was something I think could have been negotiated, to be honest with you. I think you could have negotiated that. All the people died, so many people died. You know, that was the disaster … Abraham Lincoln, of course, if he negotiated it, you probably wouldn’t even know who Abraham Lincoln was.” Of course, Lincoln held out an olive branch in his first inaugural address, appealing to the “mystic chords of memory” and “the better angels of our nature”, which was met a month later with the firing on Fort Sumter. But in Trump’s view he had failed the art of the deal. He was the 19th century’s Zelenskyy.Then the exhibit would come to Robert E Lee. In the aftermath of the neo-Nazi rally at Charlottesville in 2017 in which 35 people were injured and a young woman was murdered, about which Trump infamously said there were “some very fine people on both sides”, hedefendedConfederate monuments against a protest to remove a statue of Lee that had been erected as a tribute to the “lost cause”. “Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,” hetweeted.“So,” hesaidat a rally in 2018, “Robert E Lee was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia, he couldn’t beat Robert E Lee. He was going crazy … but Robert E Lee was winning battle after battle after battle and Abraham Lincoln came home and he said, ‘I can’t beat Robert E Lee.’”Lincoln had a clear and firm opinion about Lee. He considered him a traitor. Naming Lee high among officers of the army who had betrayed their oath to the United States, Lincolnwroteon 12 June 1863 that they were “now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now”. Lincoln wrote: “I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed” for not having arrested Lee and the others when their treasonous intent was known before they had joined the Confederacy to lead an armed insurrection against the United States.Of course, there is a memorial on the estate overlooking Washington where Lee lived before the war. Quartermaster General Montgomery Meigs, who had been a West Point classmate and friend of Lee, declared those grounds the Arlington national cemetery in 1864, planting the first graves of fallen soldiers in the rose garden as close to the house as possible, to ensure that Lee would never return.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

Unless this dangerous precedent is condemned and curtailed, it will enable US authorities to summarily shoot anyone they choose by simply declaring a “war” against them.Last month, it wasreportedthatDonald Trumphad signed a secret decree authorizing the Pentagon to use military force against certain designated Latin American drug cartels, claiming that they were “terrorist” organizations. On Tuesday, Trumpwrotethat on his orders the military had targeted Tren de Aragua “narcoterrorists”, accusing them of “operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro”, the Venezuelan leader, and being “responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere”.No reported attempt was made to interdict and detain the boatload of people. The video accompanying Trump’s statement suggests that the boat was simply blown up. When asked why the boat wasn’t stopped and its occupants arrested, Trumpduckedthe question andsuggestedthat the killings would force traffickers to think twice before trying to move drugs to the United States.Under internationalstandardsfor law enforcement, lethal force can be used solely as a last resort to meet an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. That rule makes sense because law-enforcement officials should ordinarily seek to arrest and prosecute criminal suspects. That is the best way to ensure they have committed the offense in question. It also respects the fact that for most crimes, the penalty upon conviction is a prison sentence, not the death penalty – let alone summary killing without trial.Trump has sought to evade those standards by in effect declaring war against Venezuelan drug cartels.Beginningwith Richard Nixon in 1971, US presidents have repeatedly referred to a “war on drugs”, but that was a metaphoric war, a rhetorical claim that the effort was important, not a literal war. The distinction is important, because in genuine armed conflicts, opposing combatantscanbe summarily shot unless they are surrendering or in custody. There is ordinarily no duty to try to capture or arrest them.There was nothing in the encounter in theCaribbeanSea that is indicative of a war. There has been no suggestion that the alleged drug traffickers were firing at US forces or otherwise engaged in what could fairly be described as combat. The US military simply blew them out the water. It wrongly applied wartime rules in what should have been a law-enforcement situation.That Trump calls drug-trafficking suspects “terrorists” doesn’t change the rules for law enforcement. Terrorists are criminals, not combatants. Absent an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, theymustbe arrested, not shot.That illicit drugs such as fentanyl cause enormous harm also does not alter the rules governing law-enforcement operations. Much criminal activity causes serious harm, but unless that harm constitutes an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury and cannot be stopped by other means, law-enforcement standardsrequirearrest and prosecution, not the use of lethal force.Nor does it matter that the people killed may have been hardened criminals. Even despicable individuals are entitled to arrest and prosecution rather than summary killing.If war rules could be applied to suspected terrorists or drug traffickers by a mere declaration of “war”, the risks would be enormous. Law-enforcement officers could shoot anyone anywhere on the mere assertion, never proved in court, that they were part of the group against which a “war” had been declared. What just happened at sea in the Caribbean could be replicated on the streets of New York, London or Paris.Until now, the most visible example of a leader treating a “war on drugs” as a genuine armed conflict has been the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Under his direction, Filipino security forces summarily killedthousandsof poor young men. The international criminal courtchargedhim for these executions, and he is now in custody in The Hagueawaitingtrial.Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator and a Republican leader on foreign policy, met the killing of the 11 with callousbravado: “I hope America’s adversaries are watching & now understand there’s a new sheriff in town.” But even a new sheriff must abide by policing rules. Trump did not.We have every reason to worry that the Trump administration intends to continue this lawless behavior. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state,warnedthat such operations “will happen again”.To avoid normalizing such flouting of law-enforcement rules, the Trump administration’s killing of the alleged drug traffickers must be broadly and firmly criticized. If we close our eyes to this instance of misapplied war rules because of dislike for Venezuelan drug cartels or fear of illicit drugs, we risk setting a precedent in which our most basic right to life is suddenly dependent on whether Trump or other leaders decide in effect to declare a war against us.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs. His book, Righting Wrongs: Three Decades on the Front Lines Battling Abusive Governments, was published byKnopfandAllen Lanein February.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsCaribbeanVenezuelaDrugscommentShareReuse this content"

Not any moreThu 4 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 07.30 EDTShareIf there’s the tiniest sliver of an upside to the latest news about ticketing for the 2026World Cup, it’s that we can finally dispense with the pretense that Fifa is interested in growing the game any more.Fifa confirmed on Wednesday that it will, for the first time,use a dynamic ticket pricing modelfor the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. While tickets will initially range from $60 for the cheap seats in some group-stage matches to $6,730 for the best vantage point at the final, those prices will then be algorithmically handed over to the market to respond to demand, which will probably cause them to skyrocket. After all, the first tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply.‘We get nothing’: residents fight back as Mexico builds big for 2026 World CupRead moreEffectively,Fifahas absorbed the secondary market of ticket sales – the bit of the ticket hustle that arbitrages the market – in the name of protecting the fans, while subjecting fans to the exact same extortion. But rather than being a lone tout loitering outside a stadium, hoping to scalp a few tickets for a profit, it’s Fifa itself making the deals.Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you. Instituting it for the world’s most popular sporting event is another mask-off, you’re-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa.The global governing body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport’s expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by potential profit margins but by regional footprint. It went to South Africa in 2010 and Brazil in 2014 not because they were the most moneyed markets, but to spread the sport around the globe. That was the supposed impetus for going to tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup.This World Cup, it is ever more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income is here. And Fifa will help itself to as much of it as it can.“It’s key to highlight Fifa’s mission and Fifa’s objective of providing funding, providing opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa’sWorld Cup 2026chief operating officer, told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we’re looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right? So, it’s always a balance between different factors.”It claims to do so out of a kind of fiduciary duty to its member federations, but to further constrain attendance at the sport’s signature event to the lucky few who can afford it gives the lie to serving the best interests of the sport writ large.Infantino’s latest Oval Office show reminds us Trump will be inescapable at the 2026 World CupRead moreFifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer expects. If this assertion is shaky –a YouGov pollshows that Americans, in fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio, among the highest margins in the world – it’s worth looking at how dynamic pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events.After widespread anger erupted at the dynamic pricing that more than doubled the cost of some Oasis reunion tour tickets in the United Kingdom,the band ditched the modelfor its US dates. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant leaving (even more) money on the table. “She didn’t want to do that to her fans,” an AEG executiveexplainedin an interview. Even Wendy’s faced ferocious backlashwhen it announcedthat it would introduce dynamic pricing in its fast-food restaurants, before it backed down.The argument in favor of dynamic pricing is that it’s also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club World Cup semi-finaltumbled from almost $500 to just $13in July. But this time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue.Fifa is doing nothing illegal. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn’t violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislatorshave taken an interestand Australia hasmoved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a disclosure.It is also legal to use the data you have on your customers – a browsing history suggesting, for instance, a desperation to snag tickets to a particular game – to set prices, which is known as “surveillance pricing”. Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into this practice, but that inquirywas swiftly abandonedby the Trump administration.Fifa, then, isn’t breaking any rules. And it was probably naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team is out in the spring of 2026.

The American people – and Epstein’s many victims – deserve transparencyThu 4 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 07.45 EDTShareIn 1986, my life went from black-and-white to color. It was the year I taped a Duran Duran poster to my rural Pennsylvania high school locker, and then months later hung out with band members backstage at the Paris runway shows. It was the year I went from cleaning bathrooms for $3.35 an hour to making $50k in a day for a Maybelline shoot. Modeling opened a door into a gorgeous, creative, elite world – a dream born of a biological accident.It is also what led me, decades later, into the very uncomfortable position of speaking out about the horrific legacy of the child sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, whom I briefly dated in 1993.I was introduced to Epstein at a dinner party, which I attended at the request of my then agent, Faith Kates. He was charming and smart, and didn’t condescend as we connected over current events and the state of the world, a rare experience for me in those scenarios.The brief relationship that emerged was consensual. But some of the events that took place within the confines of that relationship were not.Last October, Icame forwardwith a story I had kept private (with the exception of sharing with my closest friends) for decades: Epstein once walked me into Donald Trump’s office at Trump Tower, where I was groped by Trump as Epstein stood by and watched. (Trump denies that this ever happened). For years I stayed silent in order to protect my privacy and my family. But with the release of a documentary in which I was featured, I felt I had to tell the truth. To support my account, I waspolygraphedby a renowned examiner, my close friends were interviewed to corroborate that I had shared this story over the years, and Trump biographerMichael Wolff confirmedthat Epstein disclosed the incident to him.More recently, I have also shared something Epstein once told me over tea and Zabar’s walnut bread at his mansion: that he hadvideo of me disrobedin a bedroom in his home. He described it as “the most beautiful thing” he had seen. That comment chilled me then, and it haunts me still. When I watched FBI agentsraid Epstein’s homesin 2019, I grew nauseous at the thought that such videos could have ended up in the hands of other people.Let me be clear: I did not consent to being groped byDonald Trump, and I did not consent to being filmed by Jeffrey Epstein. I am speaking out not because of politics, but because the American people – and Epstein’s many victims – deserve transparency.This is not a partisan issue. Being a victim crosses party lines. That’s why I’ve been encouraged to see Representatives Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, from opposite sides of the aisle, standing besides Epstein’s victims on Capitol Hill,demanding the releaseof the Epstein files. Hundreds of women have lived in the shadow of this man’s crimes. They deserve truth, not secrecy.Yet what we’ve seen is a game of political chicken. TheWall Street Journal reportedthat the attorney general, Pam Bondi, privately told Trump his name appears in Epstein-related files. The justice department’s second-in-command, Todd Blanche – Trump’s former lawyer –met behind closed doorsnot with victims, but with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for helping Epstein abuse underage girls. And despite public assurances that there is “nothing to see”, Congressrecessed earlyrather than debate the issue. Maxwell, meanwhile, was quietlymovedto a more comfortable minimum-security prison in Texas, despite the fact that sherepeatedly deflectedand minimized facts during her interview.Two days ago, in a deceptive move supposedly intended to signal transparency, the House oversight committee released more than 33,000 files related to Epstein that it received from the justice department. As Representative Massie pointed out, 97% of those pages are “already in public domain”.So here I am, like so many women in my position, mustering the courage to disclose and jumping through hoops to prove my truth – while perpetrators and enablers enjoy the benefit of secrecy. It is baffling that leaders from the president on down insist there is nothing to see, yet refuse to release the actual files. It is equally baffling to hearAlan Dershowitz denythat surveillance tapes exist, when testimony and evidence suggest otherwise. Maria Farmer, one of the first women to report Epstein and Maxwell for sexual crimes,told CBS Newsthat Epstein had hidden cameras throughout his home. A recent New York Timesreport included imagesof video cameras inside Epstein’s mansion, even above his bed. And Epstein specifically boasted that he had video footage of me.I know my pain is shared by countless survivors. I think ofVirginia Giuffre, who tragically died by suicide this April, and of the retraumatization survivors endure as they watch Ghislaine Maxwell settle into a more comfortable facility while their stories remain buried. That is not justice.We deserve peace of mind. We deserve healing that comes with accountability. And that will never come so long as our trauma is reduced to partisan warfare. Sexual violence and trafficking have no political party.It is time to put politics aside, release the Epstein files and help free the women at the center of this tragedy from a nightmare that has lasted for decades.Stacey Williams is a former modelExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinOpinionDonald TrumpGhislaine Maxwell#MeToo movementcommentShareReuse this content"

Spray-painted on the wall outside Angela Rayner’s new flat in Hove, East Sussex, in purple, red and yellow, thegraffiti variously read“Tax evader Rayner” and “Bitch”.Politics comes scarily close to home these days, and that in turn makes politicians much more wary than they used to be of revealing anything about their home lives. Keir Starmer’s old house wassubjected to an alleged arson attack, the man whoultimately murderedthe Tory MP David Amess had previously staked outMichael Gove’s family home, and three years ago a man was jailed for telling Rayner that he knew where she lived so she had better “watch your back and your kids”. That’s not an excuse for how the deputy prime minister may have reacted when journalists started sniffing around her new post-divorce life by the sea, leading topictures of the Hove flatand her children’s family home in Ashton-under-Lyne appearing in the papers, and ultimately to her having to lift a court order protecting the privacy of her disabled son in order to explain exactly how she ended up apparently underpaying £40,000 in stamp duty on the new flat.Politicians must be accountable,as Rayner herself acknowledged, which remains true even if accountability means getting photographed drinking wine on the beach in your Dryrobe by an amused Daily Mail reader, journalists figuring out that you now live there, followed by the excruciating public unravelling of custody arrangements and post-divorce provision for a child with profound special needs. But a little accountability is long overdue, too, for all those who have remorselessly ratcheted up the temperature in British politics to the point of someone scrawling “Bitch” on the deputy prime minister’s home.All that said, a Labour housing secretary who has famously advocated for higher taxes getting her own taxes wrong – even if it was by mistake, as she claims, after faithfully following legal advice that has since been contradicted by a specialist tax lawyer – weeks before a likely tax-raising budget looks objectively terrible, and more so given it’s only months since the junior housing ministerRushanara Ali quitafter she allegedly evicted tenants from her rental property and then hiked the rent. If a forthcoming investigation by the ministerial ethics watchdog finds Rayner deliberately avoided any form of tax – for some are already questioning theinheritance tax implicationsof the family trust created to look after a compensation payout for her disabled son, to which she sold her stake in the family home before using the proceeds to buy in Hove – then she will simply have to go.But if the verdict is anything less cut and dried than vindication or damnation, then her future will depend in large part on how Downing Street thinks the nation feels not just about taxes or integrity in public life, or difficult personal lives, but about Rayner herself. And that’s not a simple question.Her famouslytough and scrappy startin life means she evokes both outrageous snobbery in some quarters and admiration for what she’s overcome in others. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, strikinglyrefused to call for her resignation, saying his and his wife’s biggest worry was providing for their own disabled son’s care after they have gone, and there will undoubtedly be much sympathy among parents caught in equally sad and complex situations. But some parents will get no further than the words “family trust” before bitterly concluding that her life is nothing like theirs. Some will see a witch-hunt, others a comeuppance. Rayner herself looked distraughtin parliament on Wednesday, sitting pale and mute as the prime minister some had expected her one day to usurprose to her defence.Until very recently, Rayner was viewed as the rising power in the cabinet, with colleagues noting that when she asks for something, she usually gets it. Popular with members, powerfully networked in the union movement and boasting her own elected mandate as deputy leader, it was long assumed that if Starmer fell under a bus, the race would be between her,Wes Streeting, and perhapsAndy Burnham. But now that balance of power in that quartet is shifting – though the other three all came out swinging on her behalf this week.Last year’s confected nonsense of a row over her supposedly failing to pay capital gains tax on the sale of her old council house years ago ended in her vindication, with HMRC concluding that shedidn’t actually owe them a penny. But it should have put her on her guard when buying her new flat. Sure enough, journalists who started sniffing around in Hove zeroed in very quickly on whether she had paid enough stamp duty, given that second homes attract higher rates. Why had she declared the old family house in Greater Manchester – which she no longer owns but where she still spends time with the children under a custody agreement designed to minimise upheaval – and not Hove as her main residence for council tax, but vice versa for stamp duty? What about the government flat in Admiralty Arch that she is also entitled to use? That she couldn’t swiftly produce a clear explanation – even though the process was complicated by the court order protecting her son – may leave some erstwhile backers wondering if she is really ready for the scrutiny that comes with the very highest office.Her survival now hinges on proving she took all possible steps to get the tax right at the time. As someone currently in the throes of a considerably more bog-standard house move, all I’ll say is that there’s a reason people say it’s almost as stressful as bereavement, and I’m not simultaneously trying to run a country. But assuming the story she has told holds water, Rayner could still be more asset than liability to aLabourparty that is painfully short of charisma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The settlement is still subject to approval by the federal court.While this may be the largest class action settlement in Australian history, there are roughly 450,000 people estimated to be affected so this will only produce an average payment of just over $1,000 per person. However, Gordon Legal said class action members will have the option of individualised assessments which implies that some will receive more than $1,000 – and some less.Gordon Legal sets out themost recent stages of this ongoing story, starting from their earlier class action in November 2019.The story began much earlier, however, and can be dated to the aftermath of thefailed 2014-15 budgetwhich had attempted to cut social security benefits for the unemployed, among other measures severely hurting households receiving social security payments.Robodebt victims win record $548.5m settlement from government, taking total payout to $2.4bnRead moreSubsequent work within government led to a 2015-16 budget measure called “Strengthening the Integrity ofWelfarePayments”. It was expected to save $1.7bn, of which about $1.2bn was to come from the welfare compliance program later called robodebt.The way robodebt worked was through an automated comparison of historic fortnightly social security income records against annual tax office data for the same period. This was found to be unlawful because an individuals’ entitlement to payment is based on the income they received in the same fortnight, not an average fortnightly income over a longer period. Robodebt also assumed that people had received stable incomes each fortnight.It was also found to be unlawful because it reversed the onus of proof; previously cross-checking of income was manually carried out byCentrelinkstaff. Now, former claimants had to provide records of wages or bank transactions to prove they didn’t have a debt. This allowed a massive scaling-up of debt recovery. Prior to the introduction of robodebt, Centrelink manually investigated about 20,000 income data-match discrepancies per year. Robodebt generated nearly 20,000 letters per week and DHS expected to undertake about 783,000 assessments in the 2016-2017 year.Between 2017 and 2020 the scheme was investigated by the commonwealth ombudsman, the Australian National Audit Office and the parliament (twice). Despite the public and political attention, what was actually happening was deliberately obscured until 2019.There were two federal court cases which finally found the program to be illegal in 2020, and the government settled the first class action lawsuit for $1.2bn later that year. That class action was approved by Justice Murphy of the federal court in June 2021, who inhis judgmentstated that “the proceeding has exposed a shameful chapter in the administration of the commonwealth social security system and a massive failure of public administration”.In 2022, a royal commission was established to investigate how the scheme came to exist. Thefinal report of the royal commissionin 2023 was even more scathing:It is remarkable how little interest there seems to have been in ensuring the Scheme’s legality, how rushed its implementation was, how little thought was given to how it would affect welfare recipients and the lengths to which public servants were prepared to go to oblige ministers on a quest for savings. Truly dismaying was the revelation of dishonesty and collusion to prevent the Scheme’s lack of legal foundation coming to light.In particular, the royal commission reportcontained the statementthat “on the evidence before the commission, elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office appear to exist”.The second class action was brought just under one year ago to make new claims of misfeasance in public office against the officials who allegedly knew that robodebt was unlawful but went ahead with it anyway.Robodebt has been an ongoing failure, with the least important aspect of it being that it was budgeted to produce savings of close to $5bn between 2014 and 2021 but has now actually cost the commonwealth over $2.4bn.I am a robodebt whistleblower. I know what it’s like to be punished for speaking out and why protection is urgent | Jeannie-Marie BlakeRead moreMuch more important is the impact it has had on many of the victims of the unlawful scheme, with trauma for very many, includingsome deaths by suicide. Asjournalist Rick Mortonhas noted, the scheme amounted to “the social engineering of shame”.The preface to the royal commission report emphasises that an important element of this shameful and traumatic episode has been the stigmatising of people receiving income support:Politicians need to lead a change in social attitudes to people receiving welfare payments. The evidence before the Commission was that fraud in the welfare system was minuscule, but that is not the impression one would get from what ministers responsible for social security payments have said over the years. Anti-welfare rhetoric is easy populism, useful for campaign purposes. It is not recent, nor is it confined to one side of politics, as some of the quoted material in this report demonstrates. It may be that the evidence in this Royal Commission has gone some way to changing public perceptions. But largely, those attitudes are set by politicians, who need to abandon for good (in every sense) the narrative of taxpayer versus welfare recipient.The trauma isn’t over. The federal court took around seven months to approve the first settlement, with payments being made three months later.As Acoss haspointed out, despite more than a decade passing since robodebt was first devised, the National Anti-Corruption Commission isstill considering investigatingsix individuals referred to it by the royal commission, reversing an earlier decision not to investigate.Peter Whiteford (FASSA) is a professor in the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University, Canberra.

Then I got cold and put a beanie onThu 4 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 17.57 EDTShareWhen I was a toddler, family and strangers alike would fawn over my crown of golden locks. I was often mistaken for a little girl.Then as I grew up, my parents – to save money – honed their craft as amateur hairdressers, with themselves, my two older brothers and I their sole clientele. They only took walk-ins, the small talk was awkward and intrusive, the reviews average at best. After each haircut there was always a nervous dash to the bathroom mirror to survey the damage. I often finished the job, trimming stray hairs around my ears with a pair of nail scissors.I didn’t visit a proper hairdresser until I was in my late teens. The first one I saw was my mother’s, an intimidatingly attractive and extroverted woman who described my hair to me and my mother as “pubey”.To be truthful, I never had a chance. I was locked in a futile battle against my genes. While my father still has his hair, it’s thin on top. My eldest brother went bald at 22. I watched him for years as he tried different shampoos, supplements and medications. All in vain.While nature had it in for me, I certainly didn’t nurture myself either.Losing my hair made me miserable. Now I’m as bald as an egg, I couldn’t be happierRead moreAs a child, I had a compulsion to twist strands of hair into knotted little clumps, then rip them out when I was unable to detangle them. I’ve now learned that this is adisordered behaviour called trichotillomania.I once required an emergency buzzcut when I managed to get a wad of bubblegum caught in my hair, after trying to replicate the behind-the-ear storage technique of Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.When I was 11 I took part in the World’s Greatest Shave. My teacher performed the cranial landscaping on a Friday lunchtime in front of a curious crowd. Buoyed up by an inflated sense of self-righteousness, I steeled myself as he hacked through hair with my parents’ old clippers. The novelty wore off with each painful pass of the shears.When the show was over and the crowd dissipated, I was left blotchy-scalped and sore. I had forgotten to pack another school shirt and was miserably itchy for the rest of the day.After high school, I watched in horror as the front of my scalp became thinner and thinner. I would tug and wrench my fringe this way and that, trying to get it to sit down and behave.Wind became my dreaded enemy. A stiff breeze would ruin any attempts at a coherent combover – and my day. I would constantly check how my hair looked on Snapchat’s front camera, closing the app in disgust at the wispy bird’s nest that stared back at me. With every visit to the barber, my hairline’s death march towards the back of my scalp became more obvious.About this time I started projecting my insecurities, becoming hyper-analytical of other men’s hairlines. I was obsessive. It was the first thing I noticed about someone. I began to recognise the hairstyles men would adopt to compensate for receding hair, their trepidation in removing their hats.Soon enough that trepidation became mine. Not even Tony Soprano could force me to take my hat off.As if psychically attuned to my vulnerability, Instagram inundated me with ads for hair loss treatments: scalp brushes, ointments, laser, you name it. My Instagram explore page appeared to be bought and paid for by the Turkey tourism board – limousines and luxury accommodation luring the follicularly challenged to take the surgical route.Many people have asked me if that was something I would do, and I have been unwavering in my response – no, thank you. If God wanted me to look like a half-sucked lollipop that fell behind the couch, so be it. But to those who proceed down the Turkish hairlines path, I salute you. We should empower gender-affirming surgery in all its forms.So, at the ripe old age of 24, I made the decision to go bald. Was I ready to let go, to embrace my new, more aerodynamic life? Or did I hate the way I looked and just want it over with? My final haircut, performed by my best friend with enthusiasm that made up for his lack of experience, was a euphoric moment. I was liberated, the old me swept off the floorboards in mangy piles. I felt like a reverse-Samson. Then I got cold and put a beanie on.Now I love being bald – I wear it as a badge of honour. I relish every dollar saved on haircuts. I cherish the unwarranted sense of seniority and maturity granted to me by strangers, though they quickly learn the error of their first impressions.While mypropensity toward self-deprecating bald jokes– fruit so low hanging that it’s rotten – indicate I still have work to do, I am humbled to grace the pantheon of bald brothers and sisters: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Jason Statham, GI Jane andBroden Kelly from Aunty Donna,to name a few.Would I trade my excess stomach hair for a head of thick locks? Sure. Am I mostly grateful that I can grow a beard?

Last year, a violent rightwing uprising tore through our streets – an attempted pogrom in which racists tried to burn asylum seekers alive, attacked homes and businesses thought to belong to migrants, petrol-bombed mosques and assaulted people of colour in broad daylight. That disgrace should hang permanently around the necks of the anti-migrant right, a warning of where scapegoating and toxic lies lead.Instead, the revolt succeeded. Anti-migrant rhetoric in politics and the press has grown more venomous. Reform UK now tops polls by a decisive margin. Its leader, Nigel Farage, raises the spectre of “major civil disorder” unless anti-migrant demands are met. Lucy Connolly – who was jailed after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire and is married to a former Conservative councillor – has beenrecast as a martyrby rightwing outlets and politicians. I don’t believe in jailing people for such speech, but her canonisation is chilling.Far-right activistscheered Robert Jenrick, the Tory leader-in-waiting, as he joined one of the anti-asylum protests sprouting across the country. Racist organisers boast that “the mainstream media are echoing our talking points”. Meanwhile, amosque in Portsmouthwas targeted, a nurse has beenracially abusedon camera in Halifax, aChinese takeawaywas daubed with racist slurs, andmasked mentried to force their way into a west London hotel housing asylum seekers. Every racist in Britain feels emboldened.And yet the shameful role of Keir Starmer’s floundering administration is what brings us to the brink. First, Labour refuses to confront a broken economic model that breeds insecurity and hands extremists their raw material. Witness the party’s botched attacks on support for pensioners and disabled people, and note thataverage disposable incomesare projected to fall on their watch.Second, rather than leading against anti-migrant hysteria, Labour feeds it. The party pumps outTrump-style videosof dark-skinned migrants being deported. Farage is chided for “moaning from the sidelines”, while the government gets on with the business of kicking out foreigners. In 2021 the home secretary, then chair of the home affairs select committee, warned that without safe legal routes for family reunion, more people would be driven into the hands of criminal gangs;now she blocks refugeesfrom reuniting with loved ones. Starmer, meanwhile, attacks the Tories from the right, accusing them of running an “open borders experiment”. He claimed immigration had done “incalculable damage” and warned Britain was becoming “an island of strangers”. He later disowned this Enoch Powell-esque language byblaming his speechwriters– confirming himself as the unprincipled frontman of a toxic faction.Hostility to migrants and refugees rests on lies that almost no prominent politician will challenge. That’s why Zack Polanski’s election as Green party leader is welcome: he unequivocally says thatmigrants are “not to blame”for crisis-stricken public services, and that we should instead focus our anger at “the private jets, the private yachts, and to multimillionaires and billionaires”.A Survation pollfound that a quarter of voters believe people crossing in small boats make up the largest share of migrants; in reality they account for 2%. Forty-four per cent think refugees and asylum seekers are the majority of migrants; the true figure is 16%.YouGov finds thatnearly half of the public believe most migrants here are “illegal”, though the vast majority arrived by plainly legal means.As for the law: the refugee convention forbids penalising asylum seekers for how they arrive. The greatest number of people arriving in small boatsare from Afghanistan: a country we first helped destabilise by backing the mujahideen in the Soviet-Afghan war, whichgave rise to the Taliban, before we participated in a disastrous 20-year military deployment in the wake of the “war on terror”.Despite our role in making nations like these unsafe, rich countries such as Britain take inabout a quarterof the world’s refugees, a figure that was much lower before Ukrainians fled Russia’s invasion. And by choking off safe, legal routes, governments have pushed more people on to dangerous boats. Seven in 10 voters supportpeople’s right to claim refugefrom war or persecution in Britain. The trick has been to demonise the tiny numbers arriving by small boat in order to smear migrants as a whole. Yet when asked aboutparticular groups– doctors, care home workers, catering staff, foreign students – the public mostly rejects cutting numbers.Labour chooses to cement, not challenge, these falsehoods. We know where that road ends.When France’s Emmanuel Macronadopted the right’s rhetoric and policies, Marine Le Pen proclaimed an “ideological victory” and only grew stronger. Austria’s mainstream parties championed anti-asylum detention and the veil clampdown; the Freedom Party surged in 2024.Germany’s Christian Democratsbroke the “firewall” against the far right, backing a migrant crackdown motion with Alternative für Deutschland; the AfD duly advanced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their arguments are legitimised, and they will always outbid you on ferocity and “authenticity”. The alternative is obvious: transformative policies that lift living standards – taxing the well-off to rebuild public services – forcing the right on to the defensive and exposing it as the tribune of vested wealth with no interest in ordinary people’s security. Labour’s leaders are ideologically opposed to that path. So they have capitulated to Faragism.

New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches and not get it down until tomorrow.This is the first and most pressing item on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am Inotgoing to eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and for all.Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way. Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that now.It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming from. Not the smoke alarm.What remains curious is that the primary impetus during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On. Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out. And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list.So it goes on, Gatsby-style, year after year, as we thrust ourselves forward against waves of small obligations. Pay the cats more attention. The business pages: like, be more on top of them. Stop playing Block Blast on my phone. Have a strong word with myself about my coffee-and-snack spending. And the big one, obviously: stop putting rocky road in my children’s lunches and instead, batch bake bran muffins stuffed with secret avocado and – maybe? – chia seeds. It won’t last, but who cares? In the meantime, I’m happy to be soothed by the vague but heartfelt conviction that putting things in Tupperware will save me.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How are you coping with life, now that we are a global pariah alongside Pyongyang? How do you feel about modern Britain having to vie with North Korea, Myanmar and Afghanistan for the wooden spoon on every international index of oppression?For that is the country Wednesday’s Daily Mail front page insists we have now become. It is tempting to laugh off a headline that asks “When did Britain become North Korea?” as just another here-today-gone-tomorrow piece of journalistic hyperbole. That’s even more the case when you read the cobbled-up pandemonium of provocations that form the contents of the headline-writer’s charge that Britain is being strong-armed into “Starmer’s socialist utopia” – nervy bond markets, the possibility of compulsory ID cards, the arrest of the Father Ted writer for his tweets and, of course,Angela Rayner.But there is something more at work here. The plain fact is that this list simply does not compare with North Korea’s place near the top of the global slavery index or at the foot of the international index of economic freedom. Some actions of the British state are undoubtedly annoying and wrong – even sometimes iniquitous. But there is still a gulf between the charge sheet and whatAmnesty International callsthe North Korean state’s untrammelled ability to “exercise total control over all aspects of life”.These things should hardly need saying, yet the increasing reality is that they now must be said. Parts of Britain’s political debate, if you can use that word any longer, are now routinely infused with a hysterical dystopianism, of which the Mail front page or the casual use this week by a Telegraph columnist of the phrase “Starmer’s Stasi” are classic examples. Both the old and the new media facilitate this, provoking governments –Labourtoday but previously also the Conservatives – into poorly thought-out legislative responses to manageable problems.View image in fullscreenThe net result, however, is that overstatement and exaggeration dominate our debates, squeezing out much-needed truth, proportion, fairness, reason and judgment in politics and government. Even now, a strong dose of all five of these qualities would surely have made a better job of clarifying – and in some cases, preventing – the four different genuine problems on which the Mail based its silly North Korea comparison.First, it is true the UK bond marketmoved up againthis week. The UK economy is stuck. But the main cause of nerves in the bond markets is global – caused by Donald Trump’s assaults on the Federal Reserve’s independence. That is washing over into many European markets, not just Britain. The idea that the UK market is uniquely spooked is false.Second, it is also true that ID cards are again on the UK government’s agenda. In other circumstances, the Tory press might be in favour, because digital IDs might bar unregistered migrants from working in the informal economy. But even a convert to ID cards, like me, who prefers the state rather than Elon Musk to control the digital world, needs to grasp that the system may not shrink the shadow economy very effectively. When Britain used wartime ID cards to enforce rationing, the black market still thrived.The Heathrow arrest of the Father Ted creator Graham Linehan looks, on the evidence, a very questionable use of police time. As theMet commissioner says, the law should be redrafted to be more sensitive to legitimate disagreements. All the same, one of Linehan’s tweets did suggest an act of violence. Social media, like the internet, has to be policed so that incitement is prevented and deterred, and I would rather the police did this than the untrustworthy tech giants.Unlike the Tory press, I have no problem with Angela Rayner’s ambition or dress sense. I also know a popular politician when I see one, and that popularity probably explains why Rayner is such a media target. Yet she herself now admits shepaid less tax on a propertythan she should have. Few of us know the full facts, so we must wait for the adviser on ministerial interests to report.In short, none of the four problems covers Britain in clouds of glory. None is the envy of the world. Yet none of them, either singly or in combination, justifies the level of panic and hyperbole that you read daily in the rightwing media. We all know that Britain is working badly. But what can explain something as egregiously unfair as the North Korea comparison?The answer may lie in the right’s abject craving for a British Trump in the shape ofNigel Farage. Farage appeared in Washington on Wednesday in front of the House judiciary committee. Misbilled as the Rt Hon Nigel Farage (I trust he corrected the US committee that he is neither right nor honourable), the Reform UK leader was there to attack the EU’s Digital Services Act and the UK’s Online Safety Act.Above all, though, he was there to pander to the lie, promoted by many Republicans, that Britain and Europe are intolerant enemies of free speech because they favour some degree of control of the terms of public debate rather than none. Yes, some of Britain’s and Europe’s laws on these subjects need to be rethought. But the real North Korea comparison is in places such as Russia, China and even, embryonically, in the United States itself. By their toadying to Trump, Farage and his sycophants are doing their utmost to bring to these shores the very thing by which they claim to be so outraged.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yes, in terms of people making policy and law in buildings that are world-famous for that purpose, the SW1 postcode is where it is at.But the heart of the machine beats with a weak pulse. The UK state is heavily centralised by the standards of most democracies, yet the people at the centre don’t feel powerful. Ministers can’t enforce bin collections in remote areas or call a halt to Middle East wars but they are made to feel answerable for all that is ill in the world, from hyperlocal to geopolitical.Convention portrays the chancellor as commander-in-chief of the nation’s economic wellbeing, but her arsenal of fiscal weapons has limited range in a world of volatile global markets. A gust of headwind from gilt traders blows Rachel Reeves’s budget plans miles off course.With control of the purse strings, the Treasury at least feels a grip onsomething. In Downing Street, the prime minister complains of levers that don’t connect to anything, civil service channels that are blocked, missing links in the chain of command. It doesn’t take much for No 10 to feel besieged, under pressure to react to every adverse twist of the news cycle at the risk of surrendering still more control of the agenda.Policymaking gets distorted by the demand for eye-catching announcements – another migration crackdown – with diminishing returns. A ceaseless, hostile roar carries from engines of online fury to newspaper front pages to BBC bulletins, drowning any message the government might want to transmit.These are the conditions that allow Nigel Farage, the routinely absent MP for Clacton, to rival Keir Starmer, the actual prime minister, for the title of Britain’s most influential politician. The Reform UK leader has overcome that constitutional disparity in status byamassing powerin the sprawling, informal, networked space where 21st-century politics happens.After a summer recess spent making hostile political weather for refugees, Farage has skipped Westminster and the resumption of Commons business. He is in Washington DC, bad-mouthing Britain as a benighted land of repression, where free speech is suffocated and dissenters are locked up. In support of that claim, hechampions the cause of Lucy Connolly, who was jailed in the aftermath of anti-immigrant riots last summer. She called for people to set fire to hotels housing asylum seekers and pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred.Farage’s message is intended to curry favour with Republicans in Congress, White House officials and big tech bosses who hate the UK’s online safety law, which imposes duties on social media platforms to restrict children’s access to harmful material. The Trump administration treats any requirement to regulate digital content as an aggression against American liberty and free enterprise. There could be retaliation in trade sanctions.An opposition leader travels to a foreign capital where he trash talks his home country and denounces its government in terms that solicit punitive action from a capricious despot. Under most circumstances there would be a domestic backlash against that kind of disloyalty. But Farage plays politics to his own rules, refereed by a partisan media that shares his disgust with modern Britain and calls the contempt patriotic. He is under no pressure to offer credible policy solutions to the complex problems he cynically exploits. When his rickety ideas wobble under scrutiny, as with last week’s pledge topay the Talibanfor taking shipments of refugees, including women and children, he changes the subject without penalty.Meanwhile, Starmer toils under the obligation to have plans that might actually work, which even in the best-case scenario can’t produce results fast enough to keep pace with the digital conveyors of doomscrolling public dissatisfaction. No one thinks Labour’s first year in office followed the best-case scenario.The prime minister’s frustration at slow progress has triggered a round of new advisory appointments and a reshuffle of Downing Street job functions. Tim Allan, a Tony Blair-era veteran, comes in as thenew director of communications, a role no one seems to keep for long in the Labour leader’s entourage. Darren Jones, formerly chief secretary to the Treasury, gets a newly invented job as chief secretary to the prime minister. He is tasked with unblocking pipes, connecting wires across Whitehall so Starmer can pull a lever inside No 10 and see something happen on the ground, for a change.In a generous interpretation, this is evidence of Starmer grappling with structural inadequacies of the British state that have thwarted most of his predecessors to some extent. It is consistent with his record as an incremental problem-solver who learns on the job, building the plane while flying it, shredding passengers’ nerves in the process, but somehow landing safely in the end.Keepers of that optimistic flame are a dwindling bunch in the parliamentary Labour party. It is easier to find anxious MPs who think the origin of the problem has not been a machine that refuses to do what the prime minister wants, but a leader who arrived in office not knowing what he really wanted from the machine. The difficulty getting the government’s message across has not been deficient comms strategists but incoherence in the agenda. There still isn’t a clear destination, the plane is losing altitude rapidly and the air keeps getting more turbulent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Someone’s marginally off-message “bold vision for Britain” will set the fringe sizzling with leadership speculation that will come to nothing. The prime minister will give a hotly anticipated speech that hardly anyone outside the hall will notice. There will be running commentary on channels no one is watching, looking for gamechanging moments in a niche sport with few fans outside the secure zone.Then it will be back to SW1, the familiar rhythm of parliament, the Downing Street “grid” of announcements, building towards a critical budget in November. Maybe the message will get clearer with a new team in place. Maybe systems will now work faster and voters will start to notice the delivery of better government. And yet it is hard to avoid the feeling that the problem goes much deeper; that politics delivered through the rituals of Westminster has lost the crowd and power, draining from the centre, is mustering elsewhere.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourNigel FarageReform UKRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

Sweden’s new cultural canon is a listicle that will soon be forgottenGabriel V RindborgWe should always be suspicious when states try to define a national culture – especially when the arts are in crisisThu 4 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 15.50 EDTShareSweden is often associated with a large and efficient bureaucratic apparatus. It is also often associated with minimalist interiors furnished by simple pale woods such as birch and pine. It was therefore fitting that, after two years of preparation, theSwedish cultural canoncommittee presented – in an anatomical theatre from the 17th century – its list of 100 works, ideas and brands that define Swedishness. In direct contrast to the anonymous grey conference rooms usually favoured by Swedish government officials, this unusual list was unveiled in a rather un-Swedish fashion. The contradiction is striking. It says something about how we think about culture, nationhood and identity today – not just in Sweden, but across the west. It also tells us why this canon is doomed to fail and yet for its creators, unfortunately, it has already succeeded.Originally a pet project of the far-rightSweden Democrats, the canon was commissioned by the sitting rightwing coalition, a minority government dependent on the Sweden Democrats’ parliamentary support. Since the canon committee’s creation in 2023, the tone in Swedish media has been critical. Some have voiced a worry that the project is authoritarian in nature, some have questioned the legitimacy and purpose of the list and others have bickered over the contents of the list itself.Even the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the Nobel prizes in literature,declined to participatein the project, seeing a canon as “a concept imbued with power and the exercise of power”. Criticism has not died down since the 100 “winners” came to light. Abba, for instance, did not make the cut, and neither did Swedish meatballs. The final selection is a smorgasbord (also excluded, ironically) of predictable choices scattered throughout history, from the Revelations of St Bridget to Pippi Longstocking.The project has also suffered from an ambiguous articulation of its purpose. Perhaps aware of the extensive criticism, the people behind the list have been unclear as to its ultimate goal. It “should be aliving and useful toolfor education, community and inclusion”, according to culture minister Parisa Liljestrand. Chairman of the canon committee Lars Trägårdh, meanwhile,called it“a departure hall, not a final destination”.What this means in practice is open to interpretation. When people are asked about what comes next, no one seems to have an answer other than a website and some vague hopes. Will it form a part of the school curriculum? Such a move might prove controversial in a country that shuns direct political interference. Will the list be updated regularly? Unknown. Perhaps it will be shelved in a cabinet in a moss-covered vault, abandoned to time like countless government inquiries.Stranger yet, this is the government’s flagship cultural “reform” project. For a decade, reactionaries worldwide have raged against the “woke” policing of words. Yet when in power, it is they who cling to lists of approved terms, to conceptual frameworks of consensus and to a strong state, pointing a guiding finger. Meanwhile the infrastructure of Swedish culture is decaying. The very institutions that sustain and disseminate the works and ideas in the canon – theuniversities,museumsandtheatres– are in crisis. Budget cuts and rising rents, as well as a culture minister who shamelessly defends her lack of cultural literacy, render the list a parody.There is something disingenuous about the whole venture. Denmark introduced a similar official cultural canon in 2006. It wasquickly forgotten, having failed in its goal to foster integration despite being included in the school curriculum. Swedish politicians could have learned from that.But perhaps the true object of the canon, beyond providing a useful smokescreen, is the debate itself. The introduction of the idea of a national cultural canon implicitly suggests Swedishness, unity – what Benedict Anderson would have called the “imagined community” of the nation state. Whether the reply is that a canon should emerge organically or merely that meatballs deserve inclusion, the premise is accepted: that there exists a national culture which can be defined. Scholars from Hobsbawm to Herrnstein Smith have shown that when states try to “fix” culture, they inevitably fabricate it – yet even that misses the point.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opposition is left fumbling within the new borders that the right has imposed on them. In this sense, the Swedish cultural canon is no sideshow. It epitomises a larger ideological struggle acrossEuropeand the world.If history is any guide, Sweden’s new canon will soon be lost to time, vanishing as quickly as any other listicle. Anyone curious about Swedishness can already find most of it online. The canon’s real success lies elsewhere: in framing what it means to become and to be Swedish. The very notion of a nation – of a community forged aroundculturerather than individuals engaged with singular cultural expressions – emerges triumphant. Culture has never been just a common inheritance or simply a series of atomised encounters. It is birthed in the tension between both – in the messy, continuous production and consumption of meaning across borders and generations.The canon freezes that process into a list, and in doing so triumphs as ideology even as it fails as culture. If the Swedish culture canon teaches us anything, it is simply to remain vigilant.Gabriel V Rindborg is a writer and cultural critic based in StockholmExplore more on these topicsSwedenOpinionEuropeThe far rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Earlier, former New South Wales premier Bob Carr sought to pre-emptively justify his possible attendance at the event (although he didn’t in the end) in anopinion piece.While it is difficult for the Australian government to control the actions of former officials, the photo still raises the question how the two former premiers found themselves in a situation where they were either in a photo or contemplated attending an event with all these known grave violators of human rights. Perhaps it is because the Australian government sends mixed messages about responding to human rights abuses when committed by some governments.During the Labor party’s last term and throughout this term, the government’sstated approachon China has been to “cooperate with China where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest”. The problems with this approach were obvious as soon as the policy position was first implemented, and they again became blatantly apparent this week.Australia scores a B- on its latest economic report card. It’s an improvement, but there’s still a long way to go | Nicki HutleyRead moreThis approach relegates human rights to something considered important only insofar as it doesn’t get in the way of trade. It indicates that human rights are open to disagreement or, as the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has suggested, “points of contention.” But they are not. Promoting human rights is squarely in Australia’s national interest.Human rights are universal and an essential system of global rules and governance that promote and protect all of our fundamental rights and freedoms. Ring-fencing human rights into a discrete issue that is routinely marginalised is solidly in China’s national interests.The prime minister and foreign affairs minister have on many occasions condemned human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang without any perceptible impact on Chinese government policy. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs remain arbitrarily detained as one of the Chinese government’s crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. In Tibet, the government escalates its forced assimilation of Tibetans.In Hong Kong, the authorities have dramatically dismantled fundamental freedoms. In the past week, Hong Kong courts concludedthe trial of Jimmy Lai, the owner of a popular newspaper who now faces life in prison for publishing a newspaper critical of Beijing. And yet, the Australian government has not taken concrete actions such as imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for abuses or banned products tainted with Uyghur forced labor – favouring expressions of concern and dismay – that is, “disagreeing where we must”.This reluctance has consequences. Violations left unchecked embolden the abusers and the long arm of the Chinese government has grown longer. The Chinese government intimidates those who do not follow the Chinese Communist party line in Australia, including inuniversitiesamongstudentsand professors, and on social media. Hong Kong national police have issuedarrest warrants and bountiesfor four Australian residents and citizens. It is demonstrably clear that ignoring human rights undermines Australia’s national interest.Media defensiveness and outright denial have been on full display in response to anti-immigration protests | Margaret SimonsRead moreThe Australian government has been unequivocal about its condemnation of the Kremlin. In recent days it imposednew sanctionson Russians implicated in abuses while also meeting with the widow of the late opposition figure Alexei Navalny. Equally, the Australian government has taken a strong position at the United Nations Human Rights Council on North Korean rights violations and crimes against humanity.While the current Australian government has been consistently critical of abuses by Russia and North Korea, the same cannot be said regarding its approach toChina. While condemning human rights violations in Tibet and Xinjiang at the UN general assembly last year, the Australian ambassador to China visited Tibet without issuing an official statement about the severe repression there while the Chinese government milked the visit for propaganda purposes, portraying it as an educational visit to teach the Australian ambassador about “Tibet’s development and prosperity”.The overall result of such mixed messaging is that, when rights abuses are committed by powerful governments, Australia is willing to look the other way.A government can’t half care about human rights. The Australian government’s “disagree where we must” approach with China sets a precedent that human rights issues can be ignored when they get in the way, and by doing so validates the abusers’ interests ahead of Australia’s national interest.The Andrews photo is a jarring reminder of the Australian government’s mixed messaging in its dealing with China.Daniela Gavshon is Australia director of Human Rights WatchExplore more on these topicsHuman rightsOpinionChinaDaniel AndrewsVladimir PutinXi JinpingKim Jong-unAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

The Voice of Hind Rajab is about thehorrifying ordeal of the five-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab, who was killed in 2024 by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza in her uncle’s car along with six family members, and two paramedics who tried to come to her rescue. Rajab herself, who survived the original assault by the IDF which killed those around her, stayed on the phone for hours to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), desperately begging for help. With startling audacity, Ben Hania has used the real audio recording of Rajab’s heart-wrenching voice, while fictionally reconstructing the drama of the emergency responders in their call-centre office, with real people played by actors, talking, shouting and emoting in response to Rajab’s actual voice.The result was greeted with a 23-minute standing ovationat Venice, about a quarter of the film’s running time, with journalists and festival attenders reportedly sobbing in the auditorium. Since that passionate reception, others have wondered if there is notsomething questionable or exploitativein presenting this authentic shattering recording in a Hollywoodised suspense drama, getting actors to cry and rage alongside a kind of docufictional hologram, almost instructing the audience in how they too should be responding. I wonder. Perhaps Ben Hania’s high-concept idea is debatable, and it might have been just as moving to present this extraordinary real-life recording in the straightforward documentary context of interviews with the responders and emergency workers. This might have made clearer what happened from their point of view, why they were impeded from helping Rajab and what continues to hinder them.But it must also be said: there is a reckless, ruthless kind of provocative brilliance in what Ben Hania is doing. Is it in bad taste? Problematic? Well, in a world where directors busy themselves and us with made-up stories about made-up people, Ben Hania is at least grabbing one of the most relevant issues of our time with both hands and finding a way to thrust it under our noses. I can’t agree with people who say there is “silence” onGazawhen it is so dominant in our discourse, but the director is right to reach for a way of engaging with the real world. In 20 years, there might be no debate about the propriety of telling this story in a docufictional mix. So why not do it now, when the issues are live?View image in fullscreenHigh-concept idea … The Voice of Hind RajabMotaz Malhees plays Omar, the emergency centre responder, taking calls on his phone headset, who first hears from Rajab’s desperate cousin in Germany, who had been called from the car. From there, Omar makes docufictional contact with Rajab herself, whose unbearably sad and unbearably real cries pierce the fabric of the drama: “My family – they’re all dead!”; “It will be dark soon – I’m scared!”. Omar’s own distress means he has to be calmed by his supervisor Rana (Saja Kilani).The Voice of Hind Rajab gets 23-minute ovation at Venice film festivalRead moreOmar works out that the little girl’s location is at a petrol station no more than eight minutes’ drive from the nearest ambulance, and some of the film’s most agonising moments consist of simply showing the PRCS’s digital map of the ambulance inching its way down bombed streets. But protocol holds up simply ordering the ambulance to drive there. The embattled coordinator Mahdi (Amer Hlehel) has to explain to hothead Omar that he can’t just radio the ambulance drivers and tell them to get moving. He must first establish a clear, safe route for them to drive down, and this has to be done in time-consuming cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, a unit in Israel’s Ministry of Defence. A mad ambulance dash through a war zone will simply result in the ambulance being hit and its occupants killed – people, he points out, with families and children.And so Ben Hania brings us to the issue that will always recur in this debate. Shouting with rage, Omar says: “How can you coordinate with the army that killed them?” Omar is making that familiar accusation: complicity. Mahdi has to keep his cool and explain to Omar that this is the reality he has to deal with. It is a fierce, vehement piece of work.The Voice of Hind Rajab screened at theVenice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIsrael-Gaza warGazaTunisiaVenice film festivalAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

With estranged bandmates among the other stakeholders, legitimate bidders may be hard to findMorrissey puts his business interests in the Smiths up for sale ‘to any interested party’Thu 4 Sep 2025 09.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 09.42 EDTShareThere is a well-trodden line about assessing the trustworthiness of online bargains: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. It comes to mind when looking at the extremely unusual way in which Morrissey is apparently seeking to offload his business interests in the Smiths. This is not like the forensic and formal processes behind huge catalogue sales in recent years such asSting,Bob Dylan,Queen,David Bowie,Bruce Springsteen,Pink FloydorPaul Simon.A post on Morrissey Solo – the outlet for all official Morrissey communiques – says the singer has “no choice but to offer for sale all of his business interests in ‘the Smiths’ to any interested party/investor” and that he wants out. Maybe psychologically this is the closure he needs – the band will never reform, given bassist Andy Rourke’s death in 2023 and Morrissey’s clear personal and political differences with guitaristJohnny Marr– but, in straight business terms, this is shockingly cavalier.It all has the musty whiff of a yard sale. There is a Gmail address listed as the only channel of contact for prospective bidders. Except when you email it, you get a bounce back saying no such address exists.“Putting a rights sale on a free email account feels like the corporate equivalent of scrawling ‘guitar for sale’ on a lamp-post,” says Cliff Fluet, a partner at legal firm Lewis Silkin, a highly respected veteran of catalogue sales. “Serious investors will expect data rooms, warranties and proper disclosure. A Gmail pitch says none of that is coming, so heavyweight bidders will either steer clear or mark the price down heavily to cover the risk.”Most of Morrissey’s Craigslist-style post is vague, talking about “all” Smiths recording and publishing rights, merchandise rights, trademarks and so on being bundled up for sale. Yet he does not own any of these outright and eventurned down an offer from Marrto share control of band-related trademarks. Uncertainty reigns. Will he sign a deal with Marr ahead of this sale to clear obstacles for potential new owners? That is the great unanswerable question. Marr’s management declined to comment when asked by the Guardian.View image in fullscreenMorrissey and Marr pictured in happier times.Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty ImagesThere is an argument that bitter in-fighting, non-communication and Morrissey’s own controversial political pronouncements in recent years have seriously damaged the Smiths brand. Repairing and reviving it is perhaps never going to happen under current ownership, so something has to change.“On the face of it, Morrissey is simply cashing out of a partnership that appears to be long past ‘irretrievably broken down’,” suggests Fluet. “It feels less like a strategic play and more like a desire to walk away with whatever value he can still extract.”Alan Wallis is CEO of Dynamite Songs and previously ran the music transactions practice at Ernst & Young in the late 1990s and early 2000s, so has seen the changing dynamics of catalogue sales up close for more than a quarter of a century. He says selling a major stake in a commercially and culturally significant music catalogue in this idiosyncratic manner is utterly without precedent.‘Record companies have me on a dartboard’: the man making millions buying classic hitsRead moreHow such sales normally happen, he says, is that “you put together a pack with all the information that someone who is buying it would need to make a non-binding offer. Then you go into a diligence process with financial information for the last three to five years.” After that, the seller needs to put all related contracts in place. “This is to show that you’ve got title for whatever these assets are and that you own these assets,” he says.From there, the process is typically to solicit a small number of serious bidders. “Normally, you wouldn’t go out far and wide,” says Wallis. “You’d do it to a limited number [of potential bidders]. You pick who the likeliest are. What you want is a little bit of tension between the two or three [bidders] to try to maximise the price. I don’t think this is going to achieve that.”Wallis’s concern is that offering a sale in this way could be read by the market as a sign of desperation. Its unconventional nature and structure may scare off serious bidders such as record companies or major rights investors. This could mean more mercenary players step forward, ones who are equally mercenary in their bids. “When you look at it and you read how he just wants to get away from [the Smiths], bidders would low ball,” suggests Wallis.Quick sales can happen, but invariably they are dramatically below market value.View image in fullscreenRourke, Marr, Morrissey and Joyce pictured in 1987.Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex FeaturesThe Smiths were originally signed to Rough Trade in 1983 but their catalogue of recordings is now owned by Warner Music Group. Thecollapse of the Rough Trade distribution network in 1991saw the Rough Trade label sell off its entire catalogue to helppay off debtson the distribution side. A source with inside knowledge told the Guardian that Warner paid £1m for the Smiths’ recordings in this fire sale (equivalent to £2.3m today). “In retrospect,” they say, “it was far too cheap.” As such, any plans for the band’s recordings would need the full involvement of Warner. Buyers will be getting an important share, not total autonomy.Then there is Marr himself. As co-writer of all the Smiths’ songs, he controls 50% of their publishing. He is also currently thesole owner of their associated trademarks, which will directly impact anything related to merchandise. Anyone scooping up Morrissey’s stake will still have to find common ground with Marr and he will have the power to overrule any commercial plans if he feels they are inappropriate or potentially detrimental to the band’s legacy and earning potential.“You’d be buying into joint ownership with a co-writer who holds the trademark – on behalf of them both – and who has veto power over most commercial uses,” explains Fluet. “Without Marr’s nod, you don’t get control; you get a near-permanent negotiation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

As their creator or creative director, he technically would have owned the IP in them since Rough Trade was not as obsessed as the major labels with nailing everything down contractually. The sale of the catalogue to Warner, however, is likely to have contained a clause whereby ownership of artwork and promo videos would be rolled into the sale of the master recordings.One resolution, of course, would be that Marr and his team buy out Morrissey’s stake, meaning all the creator rights sit in a single pot and there are no complications or fraught negotiations needed to clear uses such as synchronisation deals. Yet given Morrissey’s terse statement (“I am burnt out by any and all connections to Marr, Rourke, Joyce”), it may be the case that he would peevishly refuse to sell to his former creative and business partner.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Meat Is Murder, one of Morrissey’s designs for the Smiths’ record covers.Photograph: Album artworkThere is, argues Fluet, too much financial uncertainty here for any potential purchaser. “The only dependable cash for a buyer lies in Morrissey’s receipts of publishing and master recording royalties – the receivables that come in every quarter,” he says. “But even that income depends on the seller standing behind his paperwork and staying willing to cooperate on audits and future clearances. Right now, buyers can’t be sure of either.”With politics and relationships being as curdled as they are, and the impact this has had on the band’s legacy management in both creative and commercial terms, the asking price could be significantly lower than one might expect for such an important catalogue.“In a perfect world – clean chain of title, no arguments, full cooperation – a Smiths catalogue could fetch tens of millions,” estimates Fluet. “This is not that world. Overlapping claims, years of legal sparring and the hint of fresh litigation mean any bidder will apply a chunky discount.”This is, even if everything is as it claims to be, undoubtedly the most unusual tactic to sell a significant catalogue and bundle of rights.Wallis, wincing at the fact bids have to be submitted via a Gmail address (functioning or otherwise), says Morrissey really needs hardened professionals around him to strike an equitable sale price. “Someone’s going to have to help him do this deal,” he says. “I don’t know who’s going to be looking at the offers that come in.”This, frankly, is just not how music rights sales are done. “It might be a pathetic attempt at trying to get attention,” sniffs one highly knowledgable music industry source.Another well-placed industry name is partly sanguine and partly drily cynical: “It will be interesting to see if he actually means it.”Explore more on these topicsMorrisseyThe SmithsJohnny MarrIndieanalysisShareReuse this content"

Short Cuts (1993)To make a list of Lily Tomlin’s best performances, you run the risk of simply listing a bunch ofRobert Altmanfilms (they made four together; in The Player she just has a cameo). In the sprawling Short Cuts, even though she has a pivotal role – as the waitress involved in the accident from which the whole film hangs – Tomlin’s good-natured, moral performance has a habit of getting lost in the din of actors seeking to make their mark, only really coming to the fore after a few rewatches.9. The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981)View image in fullscreenSlyly feminist … Tomlin in The Incredible Shrinking Woman.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWritten by Tomlin’s wife Jane Wagner, this is a parody of 1957’s The Incredible Shrinking Man, in which Tomlin plays both the titular shrinking woman and her neighbour. While the film didn’t enjoy the kindest reception, subsequent generations have been able to see what its slightly muddled execution obscured: that this is a slyly feminist work about a woman buckling under the pressures of untrammelled consumerism.8. A Prairie Home Companion (2006)View image in fullscreenTime of her life … Tomlin with Garrison Keillor, Meryl Streep and Lindsay Lohan in A Prairie Home Companion.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyFor Altman’s final film, Tomlin found herself paired withMeryl Streep. They play Wisconsin sisters with an old-timey country music act. Tomlin’s approach to the film, she has revealed, involved impishly trying to throw Streep off her game wherever possible – and thereby having the time of her life. Witness, for instance, the moment where she interrupts Streep’s folksy introduction to the song My Minnesota Home by turning around and threatening to break the necks of everyone in the band.7. I Heart Huckabees (2004)Even if you haven’t seen David O Russell’s philosophical comedy, there’s a very strong chance that you will have seen its behind-the-scenes footage, in which Russell berates an unimpressed Tomlin in front of the crew. As you might expect from such a chaotic production, the final film is a bit of a mess, tonally and narratively all over the place. Nevertheless, it manages to showcase a range of terrific performances. Tomlin’s – as an existential detective who specialises in espousing transcendental interconnectedness – holds the whole thing together.6. Grandma (2015)Paul Weitz has become one of Tomlin’s most trusted collaborators in recent years, and this film – featuring her first leading film role in 27 years – feels tailor-made for her. Tomlin plays a poet mourning the death of her partner, who suddenly finds direction when her 18-year-old granddaughter (Julia Garner) asks her to scrabble together some money for an abortion. It’s a situation that allows Tomlin to play to every strength. She’s funny and short-tempered, and rightfully received a Golden Globes nod for the trouble.5. The Late Show (1977)View image in fullscreenPlayed to the hilt … Art Carney and Tomlin in The Late Show.Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy“The nicest, warmest, funniest and most touching movie you’ll ever see about blackmail, mystery and murder,” reads the poster for this hidden gem. Art Carney plays a private detective whose best years are behind him. Tomlin plays a woman with a missing cat who leads him into an ever-deepening conspiracy. What’s astonishing about this film is that all its contrasting tones are played to the hilt. As a thriller, it’s thrilling. As a drama, it’s tight as it comes. But, thanks mainly to Tomlin’s performance, you could easily confuse it for a comedy.4. Tea With Mussolini (1999)View image in fullscreenCutting through the stuffiness … Cher and Tomlin in Tea With Mussolini.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamyFranco Zeffirelli’s semi-autobiographical drama about an Italian boy surrounded by British and American women during the second world war boasts a stellar cast. Maggie Smith is obstinate and dismissive. Judi Dench emotes like never before. Cher sings. But it’s difficult not to be drawn to Tomlin’s Georgie Rockwell, an archaeologist whose presence single-handedly cuts through much of the film’s innate stuffiness.3. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)In the comic book pantheon, Peter Parker’s Aunt May is often a thankless role, the doddery old do-gooder left behind after the death of her husband. Tomlin’s version, in the Oscar-winning animated film, was anything but. Halfway through the movie, she effectively becomes Miles Morales’s Q, unleashing a world of cutting-edge technology on the young hero to vault him towards the finishing line. And in a series filled with tremendous vocal performances, her deadpan “Oh great, it’s Liv,” upon seeing Kathryn Hahn’s Doc Ock runs away with the film.2. Nashville (1975)View image in fullscreenSteals the show … Tomlin with Keith Carradine in Nashville.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Limited./AlamyThe ambition of Robert Altman’s vision here is impressive. An acid temperature check on the status of America in the 1970s, Nashville stars everyone – Ned Beatty, Jeff Goldblum, Shelley Duvall, Scott Glenn – and contains a full hour of songs. Tomlin plays a gospel singer with two deaf children, and steals the show. The stretch where she falls for Keith Carradine, only to leave with her dignity intact, is especially beautifully observed. Plus, she co-wrote one of the songs.1. 9 to 5 (1980)View image in fullscreenStroke of genius … Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda in 9 to 5.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe story goes that Jane Fonda settled on her co-stars for this seminal workplace comedy during a drive back from the theatre. She had been to see a Lily Tomlin play andDolly Partonwas on the radio. Whatever the reason, the casting was alchemic. And Tomlin’s performance as a long serving employee continually passed over for promotion represents its raging black heart. Not only was the film a stroke of genius, part of Fonda’s scheme to drip-feed serious issues as entertainingly as possible, but it kickstarted a double act with Tomlin that has lasted 45 years and counting.Explore more on these topicsFilmRankedLily TomlinDolly PartonJane FondaRobert AltmanMeryl StreepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So much has happened in the intervening period that it’s easy to forget that, initially, the record received amixed response. There was praise for its expansive and experimental approach: songs built on rhythms by Brian Eno were handed over to a wide selection of producers to tinker with, then Byrne compiled the finished product. Part of a larger multimedia project called Reasons to Be Cheerful, it attempted to engender a spirit of positivity, but there were complaints that this amounted to a blithe abdication of responsibility amid the first Trump presidency. Respectful long-service-medal reviews coexisted with angry fulminating over the completeabsence of female contributors.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Who Is the Sky?Photograph: Matador Records/PAA mixed response was business as usual as far as Byrne’s post-Talking Heads career is concerned. He’s pursued an idiosyncratic path – diversions into Latin American music, opera and trip-hop, collaborations with dance producers and St Vincent – but never with results that achieved sufficient acclaim or commercial success to overshadow his former band. But then, something weird happened. The ensuing American Utopialive shows, which used cutting-edge technology and choreography to demolish the conventions of a rock show, attracted deserved hyperventilating praise. A tour that began playing modest theatres wound up filling arenas, spawning a Broadway show, two live albums – one named after a critic’s breathless assertion that it was The Best Live Show of All Time – and aSpike Lee-directed movie.So Byrne arrives at Who Is the Sky? with his stock higher than at any point in the last 35 years. It abandons American Utopia’s patchwork approach for a more straightforward form of collaboration, the whole album recorded with Brooklyn’s 12-piece Ghost Train Orchestra and Harry Styles producer Kid Harpoon. But its raison d’être remains essentially the same: more primary-coloured musical optimism, to which end it variously employs Mariachi-style brass (What Is the Reason for It?), sweeping 40s-Hollywood-musical strings (A Door Called No), rhythms that join the dots between Cuban clave and George Michael’s Faith (Don’t Be Like That) and an off-kilter, vocoder-bedecked take on the sumptuous soul of former Byrne collaborator Thom Bell on I’m an Outsider.David Byrne: What Is the Reason for It? ft Hayley Williams – videoThus far, 2025 has proved so unremittingly grim that it makes 2018 look like a lost sunlit nirvana: you can understand why Byrne thinks the world needs positivity and uplift, and Who Is the Sky? frequently sounds fantastic. The arrangements are superb, particularly when driven by the woody thwack of double bass. The songs are often melodically strong. The climax ofEverybody Laughs, with the voices of Byrne and St Vincent belting out over a marimba-speckled backdrop, is suitably joyous, as are the key shifts in closer The Truth. When We Are Singing’s blend of an oddly (and one suspects unwittingly) Oasis-esque guitar line with a chugging funk rhythm really works, although it’s debatable whether it strictly needed the sound of Byrne’s miaowing extempore vocals.The sound of Byrne mewing like a cat highlights the album’s major drawback. The lyrical tone tends to jokiness, which is fine when the jokes are funny. Moisturizing Thing concerns an anti-ageing cream that works so well, it leaves the protagonist looking like a three-year-old, plagued by people talking as if he’s a toddler and constant demands for ID in bars. Or when they carry a certain potent undertow: the man singing an impassioned love song to his flat on My Apartment Is My Friend could easily be an isolated shut-in; the character bamboozled by his partner’s knowledge and understanding of films, literature and human nature inShe Explains Things to Meseems suggestive of Byrne’s self-diagnosed autism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Similarly, the tone of optimism can seem too pat and Pollyanna-ish without a hint of darkness. To the latter end, you could hear The Truth as a paean to love or an acknowledgment that the titular concept seems increasingly malleable in a world of disinformation and manipulation: “The truth cannot hurt me, I know what I know.” When We Are Singing at least acknowledges the pallid state of things – “we’ve got one foot in the pearly gates and one foot in the flames” – while it’s hymning music’s transportive power.It’s hard not to have mixed feelings about Who Is the Sky?: business as usual. But perhaps it’s worth keeping American Utopia in mind. Byrne has suggested his forthcoming tour will blend “visual art, storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”. Given what happened last time around – a good album elevated to greatness on stage – that sounds intriguing: a reason to be suitably optimistic.This week Alexis listened toAlabama Shakes - Another LifeA decade on from their last album,Sound and Colour, Alabama Shakes return: Another Life is murky, distorted, impassioned and out-there rock-soul.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekDavid ByrnePop and rockTalking Headsalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Blank-faced characters, dressed as if walking home from the night before, repeatedly spray-paint slogans on the pavement (“Tomorrow is cancelled”) before they’re wiped away. A film of a staged riot gives La Haine vibes. Political impotence cast through a bleak filter – that’s the intro to a takeover of the whole Southbank Centre by French dance collective(La)Horde. It puts films and live performances by a cast of 80 (with dancers from Ballet National de Marseille and Rambert) all over the complex’s buildings for a buzzing three hours.That’s as overtly political as it gets, though, because in (La)Horde’s world, everyone is too distracted by screens to engage, including a guy who walks around with a rig holding 40 phones, like a tourist with an elaborate selfie stick. In one piece called Deep Stream, the dancers, like avatars, go through the human motions, but it’s all fake laughter and glazed gazes. Across a lot of these performances, the mood is of eerie disconnect, joyless sex, aloofness, sadness. Is anyone happy in (La)Horde’s world? It’s a troubling depiction of gen Z. (The finale, though, offers a blast of primal energy that’s a thrilling tonic.)View image in fullscreenA troubling depiction of gen Z … Master’s Tools/Tomorrow Is Cancelled at the Southbank Centre.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian(La)Horde excel at reframing or repurposing street and social dance, as in guest choreographers Cecilia Bengolea and François Chaignaud’s GrimeBallet, where dirty bass is unexpectedly paired with the clean pink satin of pointe shoes. Or the techno lindy hop of Hop(e)storm, swing dancing to a strict beat. They strip a dance of one context and give it another in a way that’s simple and readable but also strange and compelling. In To Da Bone, they bring together “jumpstyle” dancers, bedroom amateurs from around Europe who dance like they’re doing football tricks with an invisible ball. It’s very specific, very technical, and treated with the seriousness of a ballet petit allegro. It also reminds you of step dances from Ireland, South Africa and Chicago and the way such ideas were spread or developed long before digital memes.The evening’s format, of short pieces you dip in and out of, echoes online life. All the artists need to offer is a tasty bite, a novelty, a sensation, and you can walk away before anything gets too demanding or boring.

Every episode has managed to pick on a new and different facet of his authoritarian rule – the silencing of his media critics, his use of Ice agents as an intimidation tactic – while simultaneously telling everyone what a tiny penis he has.So the anticipation levels were off the charts for this week’s episode, entitled Wok Is Dead, which promised to take on Trump’s tariff policy. And in fairness it did do this, but only in a couple of scenes where a Chinese character with an uncomfortablyMickey Rooney-esqueaccent complained about them. The rest of the episode just settled for a bunch of jokes aboutLabubu dolls, as well as calling Donald Trump “Satan” as many times as it feasibly could.For the most part, Wok Is Dead found itself split in two. The bulk of the episode was taken up with a very traditional South Park storyline about a cultural fad pushed to extremes. Everyone at South Park Elementary has become obsessed with Labubu dolls, a line of vaguely creepy collectible plush dolls sold in mystery boxes. In real life, the Labubu craze has been ramped up to the level of fidget spinners and loom bands before them, prompting the market to be flooded with a rush of carelessly manufactured fakes that potentiallypose a danger to children.In the world of South Park, however, the dolls prompt satanic rituals, with children sacrificing poultry and summoning plagues in their desire to find ever-rarer dolls, much to the dismay of Jesus, who is serving as the school counsellor. And that’s about it for that particular storyline. It’s South Park by numbers: find something newly popular, mock it for 20 minutes, and then go home.But that isn’t why people have been watching South Park in record numbers this year. No, they’re doing that because of how nakedly aggressive the show has been towards Trump. And this week it chose to achieve this by having as many characters as possible repeat the line: “Donald Trump is fucking Satan.”View image in fullscreenSuch a sweet couple … Satan and Trump in the South Park episodeSermon on the Mount.Photograph: Comedy CentralThis is for two reasons. First, throughout the season it has been evident that the cartoon Donald Trump has literally been having sexual intercourse with the devil, who makes a reappearance after his dalliance with Saddam Hussein in the South Park movie. Second, maybe the writers just wanted to call Trump “Satan” a bunch of times.In essence, this was South Park pulling the same trick it did with its controversial 2005 episode Trapped in the Closet, in which Tom Cruise locked himself inside a cupboard while everyone around him repeatedly stated: “Tom Cruise won’t come out of the closet.” On one hand, Tom Cruise was literally inside a closet. On the other, it was winking at unproven rumours about his sexuality.However, Trapped in the Closet had a grander aim, which was to describe the opaque beliefs of Scientologists. And it worked. Not only was it one of the best episodes of South Park ever made, but it changed the way the world talks about Scientology.Meanwhile, the aim of Wok Is Dead (aside from showing its disdain for Labubu dolls) seems to be to call Donald Trump Satan. Which, compared with the anger and specificity of the episodes preceding it, feels a little lazy. From everything we know about Trump, it feels like the jabs that land the hardest are the ones that undermine his ego, which is why he expends so much effort responding to claims about the size of his hands. Meanwhile, comparing him to Satan – the all-powerful embodiment of evil – feels as if it might actually be taken as a compliment.South Park has become the most important TV show of the Trump 2.0 era | Jesse HassengerRead moreStill, the payoff to everybody saying “Donald Trump is fucking Satan” so often is that Satan is now pregnant with Donald Trump’s butt baby, which is bound to play out in future episodes somehow.If you’re a fan of South Park, then Wok Is Dead’s scattershot cultural satire will have more than passed muster. But for those of us who have been tuning in to watch Trey Parker and Matt Stone take down Trump, it represents the first disappointment of the season. Perhaps it’s a blip, but this week’s episode suggests that Parker and Stone are starting to run low on ammunition, and want to broaden their horizons away from Trump in future episodes.Still, if that’s the case, the outcome would be a regular South Park season, and there are many worse things than that.South Park is on Paramount+Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are the five well-known mature quintets, as well as the early B flat work K174, for which Spuncunifait play two versions of its finale. All are composed for a quintet of strings with two violas (unlike Boccherini’s quintets and Schubert’s famous C major quintet, which employ two cellos).View image in fullscreenSpunicunifait: Mozart: Six String Quintets.Photograph: AlphaThe players – Lorenza Borrani and Maia Cabeza (violin), Max Mandel and Simon Von Rahden (viola) and Luise Buchberger (cello) – use a mix of 18th-century instruments and 21st-century copies; the recorded sound is close and involving. Not all aspects of the group’s approach will be to all tastes: vibrato is very sparingly used, and its absence can often be starkly effective, but the tendency to link notes in phrases with tiny glissandi can sometimes seem a little overdone. These are minor quibbles, though. The performances reveal the group’s musicality and deep understanding of these under-appreciated works in every bar.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Gail assumes she is next in line for the job, but the head tells her she doesn’t have the people skills and asks if she has considered retirement herself. Affronted, she walks out of the school and from her job without collecting the photo on her desk of her daughter, Debbie, who is about to get married. After Gail gets home, her ex-husband, Max, arrives. He is staying with her for the wedding weekend and tells her he has forgotten to bring a suit – although he has brought a cat. Not for the first time, Gail wonders “why it was that I had so many irritating people in my life”.Set in Baltimore, Anne Tyler’s novella spans the before, during and after of Debbie’s wedding. Told through Gail’s eyes, the plot is deliberately slim as it explores subtle family dynamics and the mundanity of everyday life. Thus, we accompany Gail as she collects her outfit from the dry cleaners and visits a hair stylist with whom she declines to make small talk. J Smith Cameron, best known for her role as Gerri in Succession, is the narrator, and adeptly captures Gail’s social awkwardness that, unbeknown to her, can come over as chilly and detached. As she ponders the breakdown of her marriage to Max, we see that the headteacher had a point. Although we root for Gail and her future happiness, it is clear her people skills need work.Available via Penguin Audio, 4hr 24minFurther listeningThe Story of a HeartRachel Clarke,Little, Brown Audio,9hr 1minClarke’s Women’s prize-winning book traces the remarkable journey of a heart from the body of a nine-year-old girl who is killed in a car crash, and transplanted to a young boy suffering from acute cardiomyopathy.

But a work by Nicholas Hilliard that has come to light is all the more exciting because it has a possible link toWilliam Shakespeare, and a 400-year-old enigma of a defaced red heart on its reverse, suggesting a love scorned.Hilliard was Queen Elizabeth I’s official limner, or miniature painter. His exquisite portraits, small enough to fit in the palm of one’s hand, are among the most revered masterpieces of 16th-century British and European art.This example depicts an androgynous, bejewelled young sitter with long ringlets, thought to be the earliest known likeness of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd earl of Southampton, Shakespeare’s friend and patron – and possibly the “fair youth” of the sonnets, as some have speculated.Shakespeare dedicated his two erotic poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, to Southampton, declaring: “The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end.”Such miniatures were painted on vellum as thin as onion skin that was pasted on to playing cards for a stiff support. This portrait’s reverse reveals a card whose red heart has been painted over with a black spear or spade, seemingly indicating a broken heart.View image in fullscreenReverse of the miniature with a red heart defaced by a black spade or spear, suggesting a love scorned.Photograph: handoutThe portrait has been identified by the leading art historians Dr Elizabeth Goldring and Emma Rutherford, who were taken aback by the defacement.Goldring, an honorary reader at the University of Warwick and author of an award-winning Hilliard biography, told the Guardian: “You always know that there’s a chance that there could be a clue on the back or tucked inside the frame, but there almost never is. On this occasion, there was – and it was absolutely thrilling. Shivers down the spine. Someone had gone to great effort to spoil the back of this work.”Rutherford, the founder of the Limner Company, a consultancy and dealership, said: “I can’t find any other evidence of this sort of vandalism. Everybody would have known that a miniature would be backed by a playing card, but the playing card back was never visible. Originally, this would have been encased in a very expensive, possibly jewelled locket. You’d have to get the miniature out of the locket in order to vandalise the back like this. So it is an extraordinary discovery, a 400-year-old mystery.”Their research, jointly written with Prof Sir Jonathan Bate, a leading Shakespeare scholar, is published in the Times Literary Supplement on 5 September.They write: “The fact that the heart has been painted over with a spade, or spear, inevitably calls to … mind thoughts of Shakespeare, whose coat of arms, drawn up c1602, incorporated a spear as a pun on his surname – though virtually nothing is known with certainty of Shakespeare’s interactions with Southampton.”View image in fullscreenSelf-portrait at age 30 by Nicholas Hilliard.Photograph: Granger Historical Picture Archive/AlamyGoldring said: “The discovery of this miniature will, I suspect, reignite debate about the nature of the relationship between Shakespeare and his patron Southampton, including the possibility that Southampton may have been an inspiration for some of the sonnets.”The historians suggest there is the possibility that this portrait was a gift from Southampton to Shakespeare who returned it, perhaps in 1598, the year thathe married.Within the late Elizabethan court, Southampton was known for his androgynous beauty, his vanity and his love of poetry.In the 1590s, John Clapham’s Narcissus – a retelling of the Ovidian tale of a beautiful youth who falls in love with his own image – was dedicated to him, and in the dedication to The Unfortunate Traveller, Thomas Nashe praised Southampton: “A dere lover and cherisher you are, as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They contacted Goldring and Rutherford after reading of their discovery of another Hilliard miniature.Rutherford said: “This has never been published. It’s never been seen in public.”They believe that it depicts Southampton in the early 1590s, when he was in his late teens, shortly before Shakespeare attracted his patronage.Addressing the “endlessly debated” identity of the addressee of Shakespeare’s sonnets, they write: “Again and again, the sonnets return to the fair youth’s androgynous beauty. So, for example, in sonnet 99 his hair is compared to ‘marjoram’, the tendrils of which are long and curly: could this be an allusion to Southampton’s distinctive long ringlets?”They argue that everything about this miniature, including the sitter’s gesture of clasping his cascading ringlets of auburn hair to his heart, suggests an intimate image.Long hair was unusual at the late Elizabethan court, Rutherford said. “We know there was some criticism of how long hair made men ‘womanish’.”Two pearl bracelets adorn the sitter’s wrist. Rutherford said bracelets, though frequently encountered in portraits of women in this period, were rarely seen in portraits of men.She added that when someone first looks at the portrait, they struggle initially to determine whether it represents a man or a woman. “It’s just extraordinary. It has to be one of the earliest English homoerotic images.”Explore more on these topicsArtWilliam ShakespearePaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

God bless and God speed.”She later expanded on her comments in follow-up Instagram stories, saying she had been explicitly told the production would not address her notes.“So I just butted out and left it alone because it’s not my project,” she said. “They’re going to make whatever they’re going to make. A big reason why I haven’t said anything up until this point is because I know a lot of you guys are gonna be happy with it.“A big section of the film panders to a very specific section of my dad’s fandom that still lives in the fantasy, and they’re gonna be happy with it.”Paris continued to critique the “sugar-coated” Hollywood biopic model generally: “The narrative is being controlled and there’s a lot of inaccuracy and there’s a lot of just full-blown lies. At the end of the day, that doesn’t really fly with me. Go enjoy it. Do whatever. Leave me out of it.”The biopic, which has been produced in conjunction with the Jackson estate, has been gestating since at least 2019.It attracted controversy whenPuck magazinereported that the film was facing rewrites and reshoots after a third-act plotline about one of Michael Jackson’s accusers could not be used for legal reasons.A source close to the production denied the reports. “The Michael Jackson biopic is not in total chaos,” the sourcetold Peopleat the time. “The inflammatory headlines about the movie halting are simply not true.”Jaafar Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, will make his feature debut as the pop megastar in the biopic, whose cast also includes Miles Teller, Nia Long and Kat Graham.Michael is set for release on 24 April 2026.The Guardian has contacted representatives for Domingo, as well as the biopic’s production company, for comment.Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsVenice film festivalnewsShareReuse this content"

Once in Venice, it was probably then modified to resemble the Republic’s emblem – the winged lion of St Mark.View image in fullscreenThe great bronze ‘Lion’ of St Mark’s square, VenicePhotograph: Scarfì, 1990A visual examination of the statue showed that it used to have horns, which meant it most closely resembled azhènmùshòu,a guardian lion that warded off evil spirits from graves during the Tang dynasty. It is believed the horns were later removed and ears shortened to adapt it more to the lion of Saint Mark.The symbol is omnipresent in Venice, featuring on buildings and coins. It is also the emblem of the Venice film festival’s top prize, the Golden Lion.However, little is known of the statue’s history. “We don’t know when the sculpture arrived in Venice, where it was reworked, who did it, or when it was erected on the column where it is still visible today,” said the study’s co-author Massimo Vidale. The scientists said their study did show the geographical reach of the Venetian Republic, one of the great trading powers of medieval Europe, and the interconnectedness of its world.Scholars have previously suggested that the sculpture hailed from Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq), ancient Persia or ancient Greece.“Venice is a city full of mysteries, but one has been solved: the Lion of Saint Mark is Chinese, and he walked the Silk Road,” Vidale said.Explore more on these topicsArtVeniceChinanewsShareReuse this content"

As if on cue, the castle’s daily gun salute fires overhead, scattering pigeons and punctuating our conversation with a jolt.Three years have passed since the 47-year-old anthropologist left her home in Kyiv for Edinburgh, after the Russian invasion. Celluloid warriors have long been replaced by the rhythms of life in a city she now knows like the back of her hand. So well, in fact, that she has launched a walking tour revealing a layer even locals might miss: the story of Edinburgh’s vibrant Ukrainian community.Bridges Across Borders: Tracing Ukrainian Roots in the Heart of Edinburgh started in June and is the latest in a growing portfolio of women-led immersive walks developed in partnership with Women in Travel CIC, the UK-based social enterprise that fosters gender inclusion in the tourism industry. It now offers seven tours celebrating multiculturalism in its many forms: from a Saudi-led deep dive into west London’s Edgware Road to a sensory stroll along Ealing Road in Wembley, north-west London, with its Hindu temples and sizzling street food. All tour leaders are trained through Women in Travel’s guiding academy, which aims to help women earn an income by sharing their stories with travellers seeking a deeper connection to a place.View image in fullscreenNataliya Bezborodova, right, with guests on her Ukrainian community walking tour of Edinburgh.Photograph: Simon WilliamsThe two-and-a-half-hour walking tour attracts a mix of locals and tourists, Nataliya tells me. “I’ve even had people from Ukraine join the group, who had no idea about our shared heritage with Scotland,” she says, as we stroll along Princes Street, the city’s main artery.Scotland’s Ukrainian population has grown since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, with about 5,000 refugees arriving via Edinburgh. But, as Nataliya points out, the ties go back centuries. Dominating the horizon, the crenellated outline of Edinburgh Castle looms large. It houses St Margaret’s Chapel, built in the 12th century and named after a queen thought to be a quarter Ukrainian. Edinburgh and Kyiv were also formally twinned in 1989, Nataliya adds. We pass the Scott Monument, its blackened gothic spires piercing the sky. At its base, a kilted busker skirls a haunting tune on the bagpipes.View image in fullscreenSt Margaret’s Chapel at Edinburgh Castle.Photograph: McPhoto/Ingo Schulz/AlamyWe are soon puffing our way up and down the leafy slopes of Calton Hill, pausing first at a plaque to Saint Wolodymyr – who helped bring Christianity to Ukraine more than a thousand years ago – and then at the Holodomor memorial stone honouring the seven million Ukrainians who died in the forced famine of 1932-33. “It’s a reminder that these things must never happen again,” Nataliya reflects.A short walk away lies Royal Terrace, on the eastern edge of New Town, a handsome Georgian sweep of sandstone townhouses by the Scottish architect William Henry Playfair. Tucked between swish boutique hotels and stately homes, blue-and-yellow flags flutter at the Ukrainian community centre.The arrival of recent refugees has rekindled pride among Edinburgh’s older Ukrainian diasporaInside, a plate of homemade potato dumplings, cooked by the centre’s summer camp children and topped with a dollop of sour cream, awaits. As we tuck in, Nataliya explains how the arrival of recent refugees has rekindled pride among Edinburgh’s older Ukrainian diaspora, whose first major wave came in the 1940s: “The newcomers helped them reconnect with a culture that had gone underground.” Today, the centre hosts coffee mornings, cookery classes and language lessons for the Ukrainian community, alongside a rolling programme of concerts and film screenings open to all.View image in fullscreenAerial view of Royal Terrace and Regent Terrace.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyBack out on the street, trams rumble by as we head west, passing familiar landmarks, including a bronze Sherlock Holmes, keeping watch at Picardy Place in tribute to his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, born just around the corner. In the shadow of the redbrick Scottish National Portrait Gallery lies our final stop: the Square, a Ukrainian-owned cafe that opened in 2023.This modest slip of a building, with its slate-grey facade and plant-fringed window, is easy enough to miss. Inside, though, it’s quietly pioneering: the first place in the city to serve both Scottish and Ukrainian staples (though not on the same plate). The full Scottish breakfast – haggis, tatties and all – sits alongside Ukrainian classics such asholubtsi(cabbage rolls stuffed with lightly spiced meat).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within minutes of sitting down, the table groans under bowls of steaming borscht, plates piled high with dumplings, andderuny(crisp golden potato pancakes drenched in parmesan sauce). Just as I think I can’t manage another bite, out comes the grand finale:syrnyky– sweet curd-cheese pancakes swimming in velvety berry juice – as Nataliya shares what creating the tour has meant to her personally.View image in fullscreenScottish and Ukrainian dishes are served at the Square on North St Andrew Street in Edinburgh’s New Town.Photograph: Simon WilliamsThe art of the city: a walking tour of Edinburgh’s best landscape sculpturesRead more“Putting the tour together made me realise just how many Ukrainian landmarks are hidden across this city,” Nataliya says. “It’s about finding connections between seemingly distant cultures.”As we wrap up, I’m handed a doggy bag for the journey home, a gesture that feels more like leaving a favourite grandma’s kitchen than ending a walking tour. An experience that initially seemed a little leftfield now makes perfect sense within the context of this city, I realise.

Of course, we already know it was Jim’s less talented writing partner, naughty Ken Franklin, who did it.At first, Joanna resists Columbo’s offer of something to eat, but he gently gets on with it, in his trademark raincoat: he cracks the eggs into a bowl, picks out a bit of shell that inadvertently falls into the bowl and asks Joanna where he can get a bowl for the empty shells balanced in his hands. It is a perfect scene and perfect Columbo: bumbling and absolutely certain, attentive to needs and tiny details.There is also an omelette in the Inspector Morse episodeThe Wench is Dead, made by DC Adrian Kershaw and served to Morse as they discuss the principles of detection and why the victim caught a boat. Morse notes that the omelette could have more paprika. I know this thanks to Chris Sullivan’s stupendousblog, which since 2014 has been keeping the Morse universe and author Colin Dexter’s legacy alive. Sullivan notes that this omelette is one of the few times we actually see Morse eat, although that is not to say we don’t see him at various tables, including with Dr Laura Hobson and a very nice looking bowl of pasta and bottle of wine in the same episode.There is no shortage of food consumed by my third favourite detective, although, rather disappointingly, no omelettes, or frittatas, so I turned to something that goes with an omelette, namely thepappanozzamade by Salvo Montalbano’s housekeeper, Adelina. The book and episode –La gita a Tindari– is seasonally appropriate and Montalbano (who is investigating the mysterious bond that unites a couple and an unrelated man in the same violent death) comes home to findpappanozza– that is, potatoes and onions boiled until soft, then mashed with a fork and seasoned with salt, olive oil, strong vinegar and plenty of black pepper. Perfect summer food. My partner Vincenzo, who is Sicilian, but sadly not a detective, adds green beans to this champ-like-mix, which I find brilliant, but I acknowledge makes it a different dish, in case anyone was thinking of reporting us to the British consulate for crimes against Sicilian food andAndrea Calogero Camilleri.If you don’t fancy a three-egg omelette with paprika, this delicious mess of potatoes, green beans and onion is terrific with hard-boiled egg, tuna or sausages, at a table or on a lap in front of any of the three episodes mentioned.Potatoes, green beans and onionServes45 medium waxy potatoes3 small onions400g green beans, trimmedSalt and black pepper4 tbsp olive oil1 tbsp red-wine vinegar1 pinch dried oreganoPeel the potatoes and cut them in half. Cut the onions in half, then pull away the skins, leaving the roots intact so the onion halves hold together. Top and tail the beans and cut them in half, too.Working in a pan big enough to accommodate everything, cover the potatoes with water, add salt and bring to a steady boil for five minutes. Add the onions and continue cooking for 20 minutes, adding the beans after 10; by the end of the cooking, the potatoes should be tender to the point of a knife. Drain everything.Use scissors to snip away the onion roots, so the onion halves fall into bits, and put these in a shallow bowl along with the potatoes and beans. Use a fork to break up the potatoes and onions – how much you mash depends on what you fancy. Whisk the olive oil and vinegar with a pinch each of dried oregano and salt, then pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss well. Grind over a generous amount of black pepper and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetarian food and drinkA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkPotatoesVegetablesBeans, pulses and legumesSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s back to the commute, back to work, back to school …We are also back at school – every Thursday for the past few years we’ve been taking pottery classes at college. From 10 in the morning until five in the evening we are covered in clay; our muddy fingers cannot check the phone every five minutes, and everyone at work knows not to contact us unless it’s an emergency – and even then, only if there’s something we can actually do about it.This also means that, for the first time since high school, we don’t have an obvious lunch solution. Our working life may lack many things, but as chefs our access to fresh, delicious food isn’t one of them. At college, though, we need to think ahead if we don’t want to rely on the canteen offerings (triangle-of-sadness sandwiches from the fridge or a lukewarm baked potato) – and we’re enjoying the weekly challenge.View image in fullscreenFirm enough to travel without toppling … Sami Tamimi’s courgette and leek ijeh (Arabic frittata).Photograph: Ola O Smit/The GuardianWednesday-night dinner needs to be strategically planned so it will taste good at room temperature the next day. Pasta is a good shout, but not in a creamy or oily sauce, and nothing too fishy. All baked pasta dishes are better the next day, especially lasagne. That’s where Rachel Roddy’spasta al forno with meatballs and mozzarellacomes in – a bouncy, comforting baked dish that holds up beautifully (and tastes even better as leftovers). If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, Tamal Ray’sSichuan-style lasagne– layered with fragrant spices, fermented broad bean sauce, mozzarella and bechamel – strikes just the right balance between bold and bowl-pleasing. Eggs are also great – particularly a frittata-style slab that’s firm enough to travel without toppling. And we always feel gloriously smug when we have a cold noodle salad with a little pot of dressing on the side.Of course, we’re not always organised, but we have developed a niche in morning salads: a slice of whatever’s lurking in the fridge, a chunk of feta, maybe a handful of mint, all tossed with that aforementioned dressing, which, if you ask us, tastes very much like victory at 1pm, when everyone else is queueing for a sad sandwich. And since a few of you might be in the same boat – new routines, toting packed lunches, feeling slightly frazzled but hopeful – here are some things to keep in your back pocket: Yotam Ottolenghi’ssoba noodle salad(it practically begs to be eaten cold), Sami Tamimi’sfrittata with herbs and veg, and our cheese and za’atar swirls (basically an edible hug that fits in a lunchbox). And if you do opt foran old-fashioned sandwich, Anna Jones has some inventive ideas for fillers (pictured top).We can’t promise these will make you better at throwing pots – ours are still wonky, though we’re calling it “rustic chic” – but they will definitely make our Thursdays more delicious.Wishing you all a soft landing back to the grind, smooth commutes and very smug lunches.Our week in foodView image in fullscreenFamily affair … chef Hyun Sang Ko, second from left, with his family at their restaurant Miga, in London.Photograph: Pål Hansen/The ObserverTransported by flavours|We will travel far for Korean food.

Plus a letter fromJoe CockerThu 4 Sep 2025 12.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 4 Sep 2025 13.08 EDTShareIsobel Lewis’s article on vegan restaurants suggests two reasons that they may be closing: general problems in the hospitality industry and a shift in cultural values (The plant-based problem: why vegan restaurants are closing – or adding meat to the menu, 2 September). Surely, it’s missing the real reason? I am vegetarian, but I rarely eat in vegetarian or vegan restaurants because I rarely dine out alone.People usually want to dine with their partner, or their friends. Quite a few people are vegan, but far fewer couples are likely to both be vegan. Even fewer friend groups are all vegan. To me, requesting that my non-vegetarian friends dine out at a vegan restaurant would be as selfish as it would be for them to request I eat at a steak house. We might occasionally agree on one or the other just to see how it goes, but most of the time we’ll go to a restaurant that caters to all our diets. This is why vegan-only restaurants find the going tough.Adam WilliamsonVancouver,CanadaI have not eaten meat for over 40 years and have gradually moved towards a more plant-based diet. I prefer my vegetables to look and taste like vegetables, not 3D-printed “vegan steak” (made of plant protein, with the fibrous feel of the real thing) and disarmingly realistic “tofish” (tofu fish). Maybe the demise of many vegan restaurants means that I am not alone.Fr Colin PateyAshby-de-la-Zouch, LeicestershireRendel Harris says that “if you really want to be kind to other species, go vegan” (Letters, 31 August). This is unfair. I really want to be kind to other species and as a result I have not knowingly eaten the flesh of mammals, birds or fish for the last 40 years. Yes, I could do more, but that is a reasonable start.I also use plant-based “milk”, margarine etc, and thus limit my use of dairy products. It does not have to be all or nothing.Joe CockerLeominster, HerefordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Look to the JuraFrom savagnin to vin jaune and poulsard, this relatively unheralded French region is a gold mine for interesting bottlesHannah CrosbieThu 4 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTShareIf you’ve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of theJura, this grape’s iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of them.It’s a grape variety that’s been grown in France for 900 years, with high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it’s known for the complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It’s also grown just over the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia, where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in thevin jaunestyle, for which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino.The curious character of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, asDonald Edwards, consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly discordant in the most thrilling way. ”Because of the region’s relatively small output (a quick glance atDecanterreveals 230 wineries and an average production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions), you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by everyone.Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the100% savagnin currently on the society’s websiteis £27, while a lot of other Jura frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty, savoury flavours of the Jura.Four Jura wines to pique your interestThe Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura£18.50 The Wine Society, 13.5%.
