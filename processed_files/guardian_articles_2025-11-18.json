Everywhere you look there’s a party leader giving a press conference. Demanding attention from a public that just wants to be given a break.Even the news channels are losing interest. Sending along a reporter more on the off-chance someone says something idiotic, than in any expectation of anyone committing hard news. Well, anything more idiotic than usual. This far out from an election we’re just dealing in political fever dreams.On Tuesday morning it was the Tories and Reform fighting for airtime. Appearing simultaneously, and less than half a mile away from each other in central London.It was hard to escape the feeling this was Westminster talking to itself. Existential crises being played out in real time as pre-budget statements of little importance fromKemi Badenochand Nigel Farage. Imaginary numbers in front of an imaginary audience made up of imaginary friends.Kemi’s presser took place in a tiny annexe of the British Academy. There was barely enough room for three rows of chairs. The front row reserved for a smattering of shadow ministers, there under duress. Armed with instructions to nod vigorously and laugh and applaud in the right places. A thankless task as they couldn’t even manage that. This was going to be an hour of their lives they would never get back. All out of some misplaced notion of duty.Every day is a four-flag day for Kemi. She won’t even appear for a selfie unless there is a minimum of four union jacks in the background. We live in a time of competitive patriotism. Satisfied that everything was in place, Kemi took the stage alongside the shadow chancellor,Mel Stride. This was her chance to shine. #WinningAtLife.“Rachel Reeves will tell you a story next week,” she began. And this story would be of how Brexit, energy prices and Trump’s trade tariffs had damaged the economy. But Kemi was here to let us know this was all fiction. None of this had ever happened.It’s curious how keen the Tories are to distance themselves from Brexit these days. It’s like it was an embarrassing affair that took place a while ago that no one can now bring themselves to talk about. It is a form of derangement. A clinical psychosis.The Tories had the answer. Rather than raising taxes, they would make £47bn of savings off the welfare bill. First by keeping the two-child benefit cap – it was apparently very important for some children to fall into poverty as it would teach them to live within their means if they didn’t die first – and then with various other benefit cuts that she couldn’t bring herself to mention as that was all top secret and she hadn’t yet found the back of an envelope on which to work out the numbers. All of which was code for she really didn’t have a clue.Next came Mel. The man with the demeanour of a downtrodden King Charles spaniel. Lovable but totally useless. He really should have been given a knighthood by Rishi Sunak for services to futility, in being the last person standing in the Tory party who could be persuaded to make a fool of himself on his boss’s behalf at the last election.Even Rishi had given up before Stride. Ideally, the Melster would have been put out to grass, but there appears to be no one better than him to act as shadow chancellor. Says it all really.Mind you, it wasn’t that hard being Mel, because his sole purpose was to repeat everything that Kemi had just said. The welfare budget was far too high, he said. Now let me think. Who was the work and pensions secretary on whose watch the benefits budget soared by 20% to record levels?Let me think. Oh yes, it was the Melster himself. Mel, meet Mel. Sometimes you wonder if politicians think we were born yesterday. Their capacity for self-forgiveness is unparalleled. Amnesia is their greatest friend. But really there’s no reason anyone should take anything Mel says about welfare seriously. The credibility gap is an abyss.He ended by reiterating Kemi’s insistence that freezing tax thresholds would be the greatest betrayal since … since the Tories had frozen them in 2021. You could sense his disappointment that Reeves hasdone a U-turn on increasing income tax by 2%. Quite taken the wind out of his and Kemi’s sails. No one has had the heart to tell them it makes no difference. They aren’t a government in waiting. They are an irrelevance.The rest of the press conference passed in a desultory Q&A. A necessary performance we all had to go through for the sake of completion. Kemi’s answers grew increasingly wild. Reform was a leftwing party but was somehow copying the Tories. Go figure. The problem with austerity was that it hadn’t been austerity enough. Go figure.Labour shouldn’t still blame the Tories for the economy they had inherited last year but it was fine for the Tories to blame Labour for their legacy in 2010. Go figure. Kemi was closer to God than the archbishop of Canterbury. It was a relief to get out into the late autumn air.Over in another part of Westminster, Farage and Zia Yusuf – whose ascendancy suggests that Dicky Tice’s days as chancellor designate are numbered – were indulging their own budget fantasies. No more foreign aid bar the absolute bare minimum. The poorest countries should learn to look after themselves. They were all far too lazy. Charity begins at home and all that.An increased NHS surcharge for foreigners. You know what they are like. They come over here and have far more babies than us. Using up all our NHS resources. Make them pay if they can’t be bothered to use contraception.Stop all universal credit payment to foreign and EU nationals. How did he know the EU wouldn’t retaliate with a trade war? Because Nige was the master negotiator. The EU would just stare into his millpond eyes and crumple. Brussels had always been so fond of him. Love at first sight. It was out and out insanity.There must have been something in the air. While all this was going on, Keir Starmer was giving his cabinet a bollocking. All briefings about the budget and against each other had to stop, he said. That would be the briefings for which he was mostly responsible. It’s politics, Jim. But not as we know it.Explore more on these topicsConservativesThe politics sketchKemi BadenochNigel FarageReform UKMel StrideBudget 2025Economic policycommentShareReuse this content"

It keeps the rainbow-coloured dreaminess and the Broadway show tune zinginess from part one, and we still get those periodic, surreal pronouncements given by the city’s notables to the diverse folk of Oz, those non-player characters crowding the streets. But now the focus narrows to the main players and their explosive romantic crises, essentially through two interlocking love triangles: Glinda the Good, Elphaba theWickedand the Wizard – and Glinda, Elphaba and Prince Fiyero, the handsome young military officer with whom both witches are not so secretly in love, as well as possibly having feelings for each other.Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the Wizard, who pretty much becomes the Darth Vader of Oz: a slippery carnival huckster who is realising that his seedy charm is corroding his soul.Jonathan Baileypivots to a much more serious, less campy, more passionate Prince and Ariana Grande is, as ever, delicate and doll-like as Glinda, though with less opportunity for comedy. But the superstar among equals is Cynthia Erivo, bringing her black-belt screen presence to the role of Elphaba, and revealing a new vulnerability and maturity. Elsewhere, Marissa Bode returns as Nessarose, Elphaba’s wheelchair-using half-sister; Ethan Slater is Boq, the Munchkin working as her servant; and Michelle Yeoh brings stately sweetness to the role of the Wizard’s private secretary Madame Morrible.We finished the last movie wondering what on earth happens when the action has to come up against the narrative “present” – ie, how the prequel would dovetail with what we know of the actual Wizard of Oz film. If Elphaba’s perceived evil is just patriarchal society demonising her differentness, then how are they are going to play her final embrace of out-and-out wickedness? And if Glinda repudiates her, will that just look heartless? Well, the film manages all this with a great deal of tragicomic brio.Slightly odder is the tangential appearance of Dorothy herself, carried into Oz in her Kansas shack on a whirlwind, an event that kickstarts the final act. Her three eventual companions – the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow – all get, in their various ways, little origin-myth-type backstories like villains in the Marvel or DC Universes; each little reveal in fact reminded me of Robin’s emergence in The Dark Knight Rises. But the Scarecrow’s story – which you might guess a few minutes before it happens – is weirdly muddled and deferred and it isn’t clear how or why the Scarecrow is lacking a brain in the way the Lion and Tin Man are lacking courage and a heart. It’s tangled and a bit bewildering; but then so is the original film, in which we never know whether to believe in the Wizard’s final benediction.But what a performance from Erivo; it is genuinely moving when the Prince has to convince Elphaba what we, the audience, have always known: that she is beautiful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if Australia have ever been there for the taking, it is now. Looking at how the two sides are shaping up before the opening game I feel punchy about England’s chances: the team are strong, settled, and I think that if Ben Stokes plays all five Tests they will win the Ashes and win them comfortably. I can’t remember ever being so confident before an away Ashes.That confidence is based on a strong group of seamers and a top seven that have now played a lot of Test cricket and have a lot of runs under their belt. They will look at an opposition that will be withoutthe injured Pat Cumminsand Josh Hazlewood in Perth and fancy their chances of racking up runs. Once you do that, you’re bossing the game.Mark Wood declared fit for first Ashes Test as England seamers ‘lick their lips’ at surfaceRead moreOf course over the years England haven’t won many times in Australia, so the data says they are up against it. But if you actually look at the two teams, the mentality and confidence that England have, and an opposition in transition, you see something different.I can’t remember seeing an Australia side in such disarray: it looks likea 31-year-old debutantwill open the batting alongside a 38‑year‑old in decline; the absence of Cummins means they are without their hugely influential captain, an excellent bowler who can bat, a leader who sets the tone for the side; andnow they have also lost Hazlewood, their Mr Consistent, who rarely leaks runs, who gives them control.They hope both will return for the second Test in Brisbane, but how much workload will they be able to sustain? Will they be able to guarantee their ability to bowl 20 overs in the first innings, then come back and do it again in the second? Their frailty ramps up the pressure on Mitchell Starc, who turns 36 in January and can’t be relied upon to play all five matches – something he managed against India last year, but before that only once since 2015.Australia have a couple of important strengths. Nathan Lyon is one and, though it is very rare for pitches in Australia to give him much help, he is such an obvious advantage that they will do everything they can to get him in the game. England certainly don’t have a spinner who can hold a candle to him. But I expect the tourists to challenge him with real aggression, and they have the batters, players such as Joe Root, Harry Brook and Zak Crawley, to win those battles. Against the kind of batting he is likely to face he’ll need to put some scouts out to protect the boundaries, and that means cheap singles. England can force Australia to spread the field, and Lyon won’t be able to dictate proceedings.Then there’s Steve Smith, who will captain Australia in the opening Test and is their one batter of undoubted form and class. There’s a lot riding on his shoulders and he will know he has to produce big time. Eight years ago, when I was with the England team as a batting coach, we just couldn’t get him out. He never gives his wicket away – and that’s the big difference between him and some of the Bazball exponents.View image in fullscreenEngland’s 16-man Ashes squad get used to the surroundings at Perth Stadium, the venue for the opening Test this week.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PAThe first Test is absolutely key and England have a chance to impose themselves against weakened opposition. With their mentality, it is a challenge they will relish. More than likely it’s going to be a good pitch: England will enjoy batting on it and then their bowlers will get to work. Mark Woodhas now been passed fitafter a hamstring injury scare but to me the first two guys on the team sheet are Gus Atkinson and Brydon Carse, and if Wood and Jofra Archer can play three games each it would be a wonderful bonus.But I am a bit concerned by England’s preparations. I toured Australia as a player in 1998-99 and a coach in 2017-18 and in both of those we started with several four‑day, first-class matches. As the outcomes of those tours show, that is no guarantee of success, and these games have often failed to replicate the conditions or the standard of opposition that is coming in the Tests. But still, players get familiar with the Kookaburra ball, and with batting, bowling and fielding in the heat for extended periods.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The kind of approach we saw from Brookagainst the Lions last weekwouldn’t be acceptable: he is about to embark on the biggest series of his career, any time in the middle is valuable, and after a few minutes he hares down the pitch and gives away his wicket. The bowlers must bowl a spell, field for perhaps an hour and then come back and bowl again, knowing there will be consequences if they bowl a bad ball. When players talk about the value of warmup matches, that is what they mean.Stokestalked aboutplaying “balls to the wall” cricket against the Lions – I’ve no idea what that means but I’m pretty sure we didn’t witness it. It is true that the schedule no longer allows the kind of preparation teams used to take for granted, but I think England would have benefited from playing a first-class game against a state side and not a runout in the park against the reserves.But, still, I am hugely excited about what is ahead. I always thought that the best thing about being a professional player was the travelling – and it doesn’t come any better for an English cricketer than touring Australia. What an opportunity this team have now, what a chance to seize the initiative in Perth – and then go and get the Ashes.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Earlier this year, Bill said that the breakup of his marriage, after 27 years, was the “mistake I most regret”.Bigger than allowing Google to develop Android?True, he has also said that has been his biggest mistake, but maybe he regrets that one less.And what about hisex-wife– how does she feel about it?Melinda French Gates says that post-Bill she is “very happy”.Jeff Bezos andMacKenzie Scottwere also “silver splitters” – couples who divorce later in life – weren’t they?Bezoswas 55 and Scott was 48 when they called it a day on their marriage in 2019.

I am now so much happier.”Are men less good atdivorce?Asurvey from 2005suggested that while women are more likely to feel relieved, liberated and happy after a split, it leaves men devastated, confused and betrayed. And in 2019, the behavioural scientist Paul Dolandid some research and wrote a book, Happy Ever After, on a similar subject. He found that unmarried and childless women are not just happier, but also more likely to live longer than their married and childbearing counterparts.So maybe don’tget married in the first place?Maybe not.Do say:“I want to break free!”Don’t say:“Yeah, but 31% happier still leaves 69% …”Explore more on these topicsDivorcePass notesMarriageRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is giving me a tour of the former gun factory on a London industrial estate gently disciplined into architectural calm. It has work stations for his staff (it’s quite an operation); store rooms; and a main space nearly empty but for some giant black lidded vessels he made in Denmark, as capacious as coffins. At either end, up discreet sets of steps, are the places of raw creation. One, with its potter’s wheel, is where he makes; the other, with its desk and bookshelves, is where he writes.He opens a door to the room housing his two mighty kilns, its back wall lined with rows of shelves with experiments in form and glaze, and tells me of his irritation when people comment on the sheer tidiness of the whole place. “It’sporcelain,” he says with passionate emphasis. Dust and dirt are the enemy. Potters, he points out, “have struggled for hundreds and hundreds of years to keep things clean so that they don’t blow up in kilns, or don’t bloat or don’tduntor all the other myriad things that can happen”. He is old enough, he says, to have had the kind of potter’s apprenticeship that involved the endless sweeping up of clay dust. Dust is the traditional bringer of potter’s lung – the chronic condition, silicosis. Clouds of dust surround any pottery-making endeavour, if you’re not careful.Anyone from 1680 onwards would have understood my studioSuddenly I’m deep in the memory of his descriptions of the dust-blown ceramics-manufacturing city of Jingdezhen, which he wrote about inThe White Road, a kind of memoir told through the history of porcelain; and then there is the dust he writes about in his bookLetter to Camondo, the dust of theshtetlnear Odesa which his family left when they rose into wealth and Second Empire luxury in the late 19th century, when amid “all that operatic nonsense around curtains and blinds and pelmets and trailing swags” they must have waged war on dust, with “servants to endlessly sweep away all those traces that might show where [they’d] come from”.He quotes WG Sebald: “Ash is a redeemed substance, like dust.” Dust and ashes preoccupy him: the matter that is left of us. The survival of things beyond the fragile lifespan of people is one of the subjects of his extraordinary 2010 bestseller,The Hare With the Amber Eyes, a family story told through a set ofnetsuke, tiny Japanese ivory carvings that, through all the violence and genocide of 20th-century Europe, were acquired, given away, stolen, smuggled to safety, hidden and retrieved.View image in fullscreenSpotless … de Waal has to keep his studio office free of dust and dirt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThere’s something about his scattering, passionate way of talking and writing that is infectious, and maybe I don’t need much encouraging, because now I’m thinking, too, about the sheer persistence of ceramics, how they are paradoxically easy to smash and yet, even if broken, survive as shards or fragments for centuries or even millennia. “You can’t destroy ceramics, you can only break them,” he says.Making things from clay is almost always deep in the heart of the human story – “every culture has mythic beginnings in squeezing clay and making form,” he points out. And though its methodologies have changed, “anyone from 1680 onwards would have understood this studio, could walk around and pick up materials, look at them, find a kiln, understand why all those things are things that have gone wrong in interesting ways.” He points at his shelf of ceramic failures and experiments as if he is an alchemist gesturing at base metals that have failed to turn to gold.Alchemy, the idea of the transformation of one substance into another through a dark magic, is on his mind: it is something that he associates with the potter Axel Salto (1889-1961),an exhibition on whom he has curated for The Hepworth Wakefield. He first encountered the Dane’s work 30 years ago, he says, and he was amazed by the artist’s strange, bulbous stoneware vessels, which might be sprouting weird tentacles, or be knotty and knobbly like galls. “I thought, ‘I have no idea what’s going on here at all. This is like nothing I’ve seen.’ I found them really disturbing, and then I got pretty obsessed by him, and realised that he was even more peculiar than I thought he was, and that gloriously, amazingly, he had written about all these pots. He wrote about the demonic in ceramics, about fear in ceramics, and he wrote about transformation.”With printing stamps one can make amusing, astonishing, indeed bewitching picturesSalto was, says de Waal, fascinated by the Roman writer Ovid’s epic poem Metamorphoses, a work about mythical transformations. “One of the glorious, gorgeous, complicated things about ceramics is that hold, at the centre of them, the image of something having changed,” says de Waal. “But Axel Salto says it’s not in the past, it’s in the present. That things are still moving, when you look at ceramics, you’re seeing the glaze as it melts.”Salto was more than a ceramicist: he also designed textiles, using repeated patterns – repetition being, in a different way, another key to a potter’s existence, as she or he throws the same shapes in clay over a lifetime, measuring their life in pots. Salto made stamps for printing and wrote a book for children about how to use them: “with printing stamps one can make amusing, astonishing, indeed bewitching pictures,” he wrote. “The imprint, not that interesting when printed only once, becomes more exciting the second time, when you put a new impression next to the first one. This rule always applies to the stamps:repetition is fun.”A section in the exhibition in Yorkshire is going to be an area in which children (if they manage to fight off the adults) get to play with printing stamps. The idea is to have a space where young people can “just try things out, not for any kind of curriculum needs, but because being a human being is about discovering what happens, bodily, with you in the world – which is play,” says de Waal. “Play makes you alive to the world in a material way. Stripping play and craft from children’s lives is just a disgrace.”View image in fullscreen‘Like nothing I’d seen’ … Axel Salto amonghis creations.Photograph: Aage Strüwing/© Axel Salto/VISDAIt’s a political point, and there are more “very pointed” politics in a much larger exhibition that has just openedover several venues at the Huntington, a library, art museum and botanical gardens in Los Angeles. It takes as its central idea that of porcelain as a migratory material: there is an installation in the Chinese garden, black porcelain shown in darkness in the Japanese garden, and a display of 18th-centuryMeissen plates, which were stolen by the Nazis then reduced to pieces by the British and American bombing of Dresden, now repaired using the Japanese art ofkintsugi, which keeps the breaks visible. And “I’ve made a new poetry library – of 200 poets who have all made their home in America from different places. So it’s a sort of library of sanctuary.”De Waal is scattering thoughts all round his studio; he is scattering projects in his wake, too. Aside from his exhibitions in Wakefield and LA, he is close to finishing the first draft of his next new book. This one, like The Hare With the Amber Eyes, draws on his remarkable family history – the unpublished correspondence between his grandmother and the poetRainer Maria Rilke, which ought to be surprising but is not at all, really, when one remembers that another of his relatives was one of the models for Proust’s Charles Swann.It is a busy place, de Waal’s brain. I ask him about a passage in his book The White Road, in which he describes being insomniac in China, and trying to send himself to sleep by remembering all the pots he’s ever made, right from when he was starting out, a young man, impoverished but idealistic in a tiny studio in rural Herefordshire. Can you seriously remember them all? I ask. He nods. “It’s obsessional,” he says. “It’s an obsessional testing out of things, and that heads very deeply into being interested in repetition. As in, not trying to make the same thing, but as trying to work out the breath between different things.”Playing with Fire: Edmund de Waal and Axel Salto is atThe Hepworth Wakefield, 22 November to 4 May. The Eight Directions of the Wind is atThe Huntington, Los Angeles, until 26 October.Explore more on these topicsArt and designEdmund de WaalSculptureCeramicsArtinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s exactly what I’ve aimed to do, testing different pillows of different heights, firmnesses and materials, so that you don’t have to. The good news is you don’t need to break the bank to get your hands on one of the best options because one of our top picks will set you back just £14 for a pair.At a glanceBest pillow overall and best memory foam:Otty Deluxe Pure pillow£69.99 at OttyBest budget pillow:Fogarty soft cotton back-sleeper pillows£14 a pair at DunelmBest feather pillow:Scooms Hungarian goose down pillow£105 at ScoomsBest value feather pillow:M&S duck feather and down medium pillows£39.50 a pair at M&SBest value memory foam pillow:Panda memory foam bamboo pillow£38.21 at PandaWhy you should trust meHaving written and edited sleep content for several years, I’ve tested my fair share of pillows,mattress toppersandmattresses. Indeed, my home has been known to resemble a scene from The Princess and the Pea on occasions when I’ve allowed a backlog of review samples to build up.I’ve always valued my sleep, and that’s truer than ever since having twins two years ago. I also sleep in various positions – on my back, side and front – which makes me better qualified than most to judge which pillows suit which style of sleeper.How I testedView image in fullscreenHead on down: the test pillows before their trip to sleepy town.Photograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianThe best way to test a pillow is, of course, to sleep on it, but first I needed to get my hands on review samples. I sourced and tested 10 of the latest and greatest pillows. When manufacturers offered a choice, I aimed to prioritise covering a range of different prices and materials.With any feather or down pillows, I ensured that the fillings were responsibly sourced. For the avoidance of doubt, that means that, at the minimum, the geese haven’t been live plucked and that the feathers are a byproduct of the food industry.Once the pillows had arrived at my house, I attempted to sleep on each one for no fewer than three nights each. I say attempted because there were a few occasions where I’d reach for another pillow out of sheer frustration during the middle of the night. It’s important to state that those pillows weren’t necessarily bad as much as they were a bad fit for me.When I received a two-pack, I gave the other pillow to a family member and invited them to share their opinions after a few nights sleeping on it. For all the pillows, I also invited my mini testing panel (which consisted of my wife and our immediate family) to offer their opinions.The best pillows in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianBest pillow overall and best memory foam:Otty Deluxe Pure pillowOttyDeluxe Pure pillow£69.99£69.99 at OttyWhat we loveIts size and memory foam design copes well with side and back sleepersWhat we don’t loveThe design is a little boxy, and it won’t convert memory foam scepticsPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£69.99 at OttyOtty’s Deluxe Pure is a brilliant memory foam pillow. Its boxy design might not look especially appealing, but allow it to conform to your head and neck, and it offers a superb balance of comfort and support, making it a great choice for a range of sleeping positions.Why we love itFirmer than some foam pillows but more cushioned than others, the Deluxe Pure manages to strike a happy middle ground, making it a great choice for those who move around between different sleeping positions. It’s supportive and bouncy, but not excessively tall, which means it works best for those who sleep mainly on their back and side, as I do.It excels in offering a consistent, flat sleeping surface. Indeed, as I moved around at night, I didn’t encounter varying levels of support, and it never needed plumping up. Despite memory foam’s reputation for retaining heat, I never found it to be a problem with the Otty. This could be thanks to its “cooling” bamboo cover, which can be removed and machine washed.Having said all that, memory foam is definitely an acquired taste, especially if you’re used to feather pillows. The Deluxe Pure is backed by a 14-night trial, so you can return it for a full refund if you decide it’s not the one for you.It’s a shame that …memory foam won’t be for everyone. If you’ve had bad experiences with foam in the past, this probably won’t be any different.Materials:memory foam with bamboo and charcoalDimensions:64 x 40cm x 13cm (WDH)Washing instructions:cover only (40C)Trial period:14 nightsOttyDeluxe Pure pillow£69.99£69.99 at OttyWhat we loveIts size and memory foam design copes well with side and back sleepersWhat we don’t loveThe design is a little boxy, and it won’t convert memory foam scepticsBest budget pillow:Fogarty soft cotton back-sleeper pillowsFogartySoft cotton back-sleeper pillows£14£14 at DunelmWhat we loveThis level of comfort from such a cheap pillow is astonishingWhat we don’t loveFront and side sleepers may find them a touch too shallow£14 a pair at DunelmThey don’t look like anything special, but I was seriously impressed by these Fogarty pillows, especially when you consider how cheap they are. If you have a limited budget or need to replace multiple worn-out pillows, there’s no better choice.Why we love itDunelm claims these pillows (which come in a two-pack) offer a medium level of support that’s perfectly suited to back sleepers, and I’d be inclined to agree. As with the Otty pillow above, I found them comfortable to use in all sleeping positions and never found myself reaching for another pillow during the night.However, I’d suggest the level of support and heightis better suited to those who sleep predominantly on their back and only occasionally on their side. If you spend most of the night on your side, you’ll likely prefer something taller and firmer, such as the Silentnight below.The 100% recycled polyesterfilling in the Fogarty pillows doesn’t initially feel different from any other cheap pillows. However, during testing, it felt wonderfully soft and cosy, and I didn’t overheat or get too sweaty, which I feared may be a problem. The cover is made entirely from cotton, and the pillows can be machine washed and tumble dried on a low heat.It’s a shame that …I can’t think of anything to criticise at this price point. When you consider they each cost less than an expensive pint of beer, you shouldn’t ever have to rest your head on anything worse than this.Materials:filling, 100% polyester; cover, 100% cottonDimensions:70 x 48 x 12cm (WDH)Washing instructions:machine wash (40C), tumble dry lowTrial period:noneFogartySoft cotton back-sleeper pillows£14£14 at DunelmWhat we loveThis level of comfort from such a cheap pillow is astonishingWhat we don’t loveFront and side sleepers may find them a touch too shallowBest feather pillow:Scooms Hungarian goose down pillowScoomsHungarian goose down pillow£105£105 at ScoomsWhat we loveHigh-end hotel quality feel, suitable for all sleep positionsWhat we don’t loveRequires daily shaking and plumping to maintain a luxurious feelPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£105 at ScoomsWith a price just a smidge over £100, these Scooms’ goose down pillows are the definition of luxury. Combining a supportive inner core with softer outer chambers, the medium/firm version I tested was supportive and sumptuous in equal measure.Why we love itScooms claims this pillow offers a medium/firm level of support, and the difference is apparent when you place your hand on the pillow – it’s taller and there’s a greater level of resistance when you apply downward pressure than on most pillows. On paper, this makes it best suited for back and side sleepers, but since feathers tend to give more than synthetic fillings, I was comfortable using it in all sleeping positions, including on my front. Its plump design can make it a bit of a squeeze to fit it in a standard pillow case, but once you’ve managed, you get that enveloped feeling you only tend to find with expensive hotel pillows.Scooms recommends shaking and plumping the pillow daily to maintain its height, and there’s a good reason for that – when I forgot to do so, the pillow became notably flatter and less sumptuous. When I did remember, I always found it adequately supportive by the morning because of its firmer feather core.It’s a shame that …the high price will put the Scooms out of reach of all but the most flush of prospective customers.Materials:filling, Hungarian goose down and goose feather; cover, 100% sateen cottonDimensions:65 x 38 x 18cm (WDH)Washing instructions:machine wash (40C), tumble dry lowTrial period:noneScoomsHungarian goose down pillow£105£105 at ScoomsWhat we loveHigh-end hotel quality feel, suitable for all sleep positionsWhat we don’t loveRequires daily shaking and plumping to maintain a luxurious feelBest value feather pillow:M&S duck feather and down medium pillowsM&Sduck feather and down medium pillows£39.50£39.50 at M&SWhat we loveSuper value if only feather-pillow softness will doWhat we don’t loveRequires occasional plumping, and you may feel the feather shafts£39.50 a pair at M&SThese responsibly sourced duck feather and down pillows from Marks & Spencer defy their relatively low price tag. Aimed at front and back sleepers, they’re also a great choice if you sleep with two pillows and want something to use as a luxurious top layer.Why we love itAs with the Fogarty pillows, these duck feather and down pillows represent excellent value for money at £39.50 for a pair. I tested the medium-support version, althoughthey’re available in firm variants too.M&S claims the medium firmness is best for back and front sleepers, and I found it comfortable when sleeping in both positions. If you’re a frequent side sleeper, I’d opt for the firm option, especially since feather pillows tend to flatten more than their synthetic counterparts.Made from 85% duck feathers and 15% duck down, the pillows have a 100% cotton, down-proof cover, and they can be machine washed at 40C, making them a highly practical choice. Just bear in mind that, like all feather pillows, you’ll need to regularly plump them up. You may also be able to feel the shafts of the duck feathers, but this didn’t ever make the pillows uncomfortable when sleeping.It’s a shame that …all affordable feather pillows aren’t this good. As with the synthetic pillows above, there’s little fault to find at this price.Materials:filling, 85% duck feather, 15% duck down; cover, 100% cottonDimensions:74 x 46 x 13cm (WDH)Washing instructions:machine wash (40C), tumble dry mediumTrial period:noneM&Sduck feather and down medium pillows£39.50£39.50 at M&SWhat we loveSuper value if only feather-pillow softness will doWhat we don’t loveRequires occasional plumping, and you may feel the feather shaftsBest value memory foam pillow:Panda memory foam bamboo pillowPandaMemory foam bamboo pillow£38.21£38.21 at PandaWhat we loveIncredibly soft, without overheating like some memory foam is prone toWhat we don’t loveIt’s one of the smallest pillows we tested, so not for everyonePhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£38.21 at PandaPanda’s memory foam bamboo pillow is one of the best-value pillows I tested, and it comes with a 30-night trial to boot. If you want to try a memory foam pillow for the first time, this is a great option.Why we love itDespite claiming to offer a medium-firm level of support, I’d put the Panda memory foam pillow at the softer end of the memory foam scale. Indeed, my mini testing panel all agreed that it’s less firm than the other foam models on this roundup.The upside to this is that it’s incredibly soft and comforting, making it a good choice for front and back sleepers. I found it adequate when sleeping on my side too, but regular side sleepers will probably prefer the extra support you get with the Otty.As with the Otty, I never felt excessively warm with the Panda, which may be due to its “thermoregulating” bamboo cover. It’s worth pointing out, however, that it’s one of the smallest pillows I tested. Panda claims it’s 60 x 40 x 12cm, but I found that it’s smaller in every direction than the Otty, which has the exact same claimed dimensions.It’s a shame that …as with other foam models such as the Otty, there was an off-gassing smell when we first unpacked the Panda pillow.Materials:filling, memory foam; cover,70% bamboo, 30% polyesterDimensions:60 x 38 x 13cm (WDH)Washing instructions:machine wash cover only (40C)Trial period:30 nightsPandaMemory foam bamboo pillow£38.21£38.21 at PandaWhat we loveIncredibly soft, without overheating like some memory foam is prone toWhat we don’t loveIt’s one of the smallest pillows we tested, so not for everyoneThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Did a decent job of keeping me from overheating’: the Simba Hybrid pillow.Emma Premium Cloud pillowEmmaPremium Cloud pillow£60£60 at EmmaWhat we loveClever adjustable design means you can adapt it to your tastesWhat we don’t loveSome build quality questions, despite the high price of entryPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£60 at EmmaBest for:a feather-like synthetic pillowIt’s difficult to match the feeling of feathers with synthetic fillings, but Emma has come pretty close with its soft and supportive Premium Cloud pillow. With an RRP of £80, it’s the most affordable adjustable pillow I tested, with the Simba product below the only other pillow to offer this feature.The adjustability is achieved via two removable microfibre layers, which give you the option to change the pillow’s loft in increments. It’s a nice touch, but before removing any of the layers, I was aware of them sliding on top of each other, which made for a slightly unusual sensation at times.Out of the box, I found it comfortable for side and back sleeping, but regular front sleepers will probably want to remove a layer or two. I didn’t ever find the pillow excessively warm, despite its entirely synthetic materials.It didn’t make the final cut because …I’m not convinced by the quality of the construction, especially at its relatively high price. One of the removable layers had lost a considerable amount of its microfibre filling when I inspected it, and there were lots of loose threads on the synthetic casing.Materials:filling, polyester, Outlast; cover, 100% polyester;dimensions:59 x 37x 21cm (WDH);washing instructions:machine wash (40C), tumble dry low;trial period:30 daysEmmaPremium Cloud pillow£60£60 at EmmaWhat we loveClever adjustable design means you can adapt it to your tastesWhat we don’t loveSome build quality questions, despite the high price of entrySilentnight Ultragel Premier pillowSilentnightUltragel Premier pillowfrom£25.50£25.50 at Boots£35 at SilentnightWhat we loveTall, firm design makes it a great choice for side sleepersWhat we don’t loveMight be too tall for some, and no trial period makes it a gamblePhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£25.50 at Boots£35 at SilentnightBest for:side sleepersSilentnight’s Ultragel Premier pillow is one of the tallest and firmest pillows in this roundup, which makes it a good choice for devoted side sleepers. It’s reasonably priced for a foam pillow, but it doesn’t offer the same cocooned feeling you get with the Otty and Panda. There’s also no trial period like you get with those pillows.As with most memory foam pillows, there’s quite a strong smell when you first remove the pillow from its packaging, but this largely dissipated within a few days. Silentnight claims the foam in the Ultragel Premier is five times more breathable than standard memory foam and I can confirm I didn’t ever find myself getting too hot and clammy.It didn’t make the final cut because …although it’s a reasonable choice for side sleepers and those who use two pillows when sleeping on their back, I think it’s a little too tall and firm to recommend more widely than that.Materials:filling, 100% polyester hollowfibre with ultragel foam core;cover, 100% polyester;dimensions:66 x 36 x 17cm(WDH);washing instructions:wipe clean only;trial period:noneSilentnightUltragel Premier pillowfrom£25.50£25.50 at Boots£35 at SilentnightWhat we loveTall, firm design makes it a great choice for side sleepersWhat we don’t loveMight be too tall for some, and no trial period makes it a gambleSimba Hybrid pillowSimbaHybrid pillow£109£109 at SimbaWhat we loveRemovable Nanocubes make it adjustable to personal tastesWhat we don’t loveA touch lumpy, and too pricey to recommend without a trial periodPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£109 at SimbaBest for:an adjustable pillowSimba’s Hybrid is a sophisticated pillow with a price tag to match. Indeed, you’ll have to part with a considerable £109 if you want to buy it when it’s not discounted (and even when discounted, it’ll cost the best part of £100).Its standout feature is that it’s adjustable, so you can alter the pillow’s firmness and loft by removing the foam “Nanocubes” that make up the core. This allows for subtle adjustments and makes it a good fit for people of all different shapes and sizes, as well as different sleeping positions.However, even after removing a large quantity of the foam cubes, I didn’t get on especially well with it – I found it supportive, but just a little too lumpy and lacking in cushioning for my tastes. Its cotton and “Stratos” cover (Stratos is only on one side, which is a little confusing) did a decent job of keeping me from overheating, at least.Unlike rival brand Emma, the Simba pillow doesn’t come with a trial, which I found a little disappointing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s just too pricey to recommend ahead of some of the other options on this list, especially with no trial.Materials:filling, polyurethane foam;cover, cotton and polyester;dimensions:65 x 36 x 18cm (WDH);washing instructions:cover only: machine wash (40C), tumble dry low;trial period:noneSimbaHybrid pillow£109£109 at SimbaWhat we loveRemovable Nanocubes make it adjustable to personal tastesWhat we don’t loveA touch lumpy, and too pricey to recommend without a trial periodWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianHow much should I spend?There are highly affordable options in this list that offer decent levels of comfort and support, but they won’t feel as luxurious as some of the more expensive models.Having said that, spending a lot of money on a pillow is by no means a guarantee that you’ll get on well with it. As I’ve touched on already, pillow preference is individual, so spending £100 may equate to more expensive materials, but you still need to do your research and pick something that serves your tastes.Spending more money can sometimes mean you get a money-back guarantee, so it’s worth checking your rights before you bite the bullet. Look out for pillows with a trial period if in doubt.Should I choose a soft or a firm pillow?How much support you require from your pillow is determined by several factors, including your physical size and weight, as well as how you lie on your bed – whether you sleep mainly on your side, back or front.As with mattresses, larger, heavier individuals will typically benefit from a firmer pillow, while smaller people will probably be happy with something a little softer. As far as sleeping positions are concerned, side sleeping requires a taller, firmer pillow in order to keep the spine in alignment, while front sleeping is much better matched with a flatter, softer pillow. Back sleeping falls somewhere in the middle, requiring decent support but not as much as side sleeping.If you sleep in a combination of different positions, it’s a good idea to choose a pillow that most closely matches the position you spend most of the night in, or something that strikes a happy middle ground.It’s also worth considering that the firmness of your mattress can also affect things. If you’ve got a softer mattress, your body will sink into it more, which will make a tall pillow feel even taller. Conversely, if you have a very firm mattress, you might feel that a soft pillow doesn’t have enough loft after your head has had time to sink into it.Which material is best for a pillow?The best pillow material for you largely comes down to personal preference, although different materials undoubtedly have different advantages and disadvantages.Feather and down pillowsoffer a soft, breathable experience that you’ll be unlikely to find from any synthetic material, but their biggest weakness is that they need regular plumping in order to continue offering consistent levels of support.As for allergies, it’s complicated. Experts once cautioned against feathers because they were believed to attract dust mites, butstudies have shownthat, in fact, synthetic pillows can attract dust mite allergens more quickly than their natural counterparts.Synthetic fillings such as microfibre and hollowfibreoffer excellent levels of support without needing the regular plumping that feather and down pillows require, although they too can flatten over time. Some synthetic fillings are less breathable than feathers but, as confirmed by my tests, there are plenty of great synthetic pillows that won’t leave you hot and sweaty.Memory foam, another synthetic material, is the last standout category when it comes to pillow fillings. Like other synthetic materials, it can provide superb levels of support, but it conforms to your body in a way that feels like nothing else. However, foam can feel unusually firm at first, and some users also complain that they get too hot and clammy with foam pillows.For more ways to sleep better from the Filter:The best mattresses, testedI tested the most-hyped sleep aids – here’s what workedThe best mattress toppers for a more comfortable night’s sleepEdward Munn is a writer and editor with a lifelong passion for finding a bargain.

Her listed interests include the UK’s Department for Transport and the Tony Blair Institute.Shen’s profile, also largely in English, describes her as a co-founder of Internship Union, based in Hangzhou, eastern China. She says it “has helped hundreds of students come to China” and she describes herself as “a positive Asia girl” who would “welcome friends all over world join us to get a magic Chinese experience”.Both appear to be young women but it is not known if the photographs are genuine. Chinese spies often use false personas, MI5 said in its alert, with a frequent archetype that of a young woman with an anglicised first name.The Labour MP Josh Simons was connected with Shen on LinkedIn, although he said they did not exchange any messages. He removed Shen as a contact on Tuesday.The security minister, Dan Jarvis, confirmed the alert had been sent out in a lunchtime Commons statement. “This activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it,” he told MPs.He said MI5 had warned that the espionage campaign was “being carried out by a group of Chinese intelligence officers, often masked through the use of cover companies or external headhunters”.China’s embassy in the UK accused Britain of engaging in “pure fabrication and malicious slander”. A spokesperson said: “We urge the UK side to immediately stop this self-staged charade of false accusations and self-aggrandisement, and stop going further down the wrong path of undermining China-UK relations.”Download original documentIt is understood that the rare decision by MI5 to issue the espionage alert was taken because of the intensity of the ongoing threat rather than because of any particular episode – though relations with China remain sensitive despite efforts by Labour to foster a positive trading relationship with Beijing.Earlier in the autumn, a political row about the scale of the threat posed by China followed asurprise decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to drop espionage chargesagainst Christopher Cash, a parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a friend based in China, a month before their trial.A similar parliamentary alert was issued nearly four years ago, warning MPs and peers about Christine Lee, a high-profile Anglo-Chinese lawyer, who had donated more than £500,000 to fund the office costs of the Labour MP Barry Gardiner and who had received a special award from the then prime minister, Theresa May.MI5 has previously warned about Chinese spies seeking to obtain information by using LinkedIn to recruit Britons working in sensitive areas. Posing as recruitment consultants, the agents, normally women, have sought to lure at least 20,000 Britons with potential job offers.The MI5 alert, a single-page slide, explains the recruitment methodology used by Chinese spies on LinkedIn. Targets “will typically be approached to work as freelance consultants authoring geopolitical reports”, though sometimes people are offered a job with a company, though the person hiring is in fact a spy.Red flags, MI5 said, were requests for details that were “‘non-public’; ‘timely’; ‘off the record’; ‘sensitive’; and ‘insider information’” – while preferred forms of payment were cash, for those willing to go China, or crypto currency.Last year, Qiu’s BP-YR Executive Search posted a job advert on LinkedIn for a “part-time adviser” who would be paid up to €20,000 (£17,600) a year to write five to 10 reports on “the ongoing policy which may affect foreign business in your country (UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy etc)”.The advert said the reports would be for Power Glory Battery Tech, a Chinese lithium battery company. It asked for a person who was “an expert or an ‘insider’ regarding to either politics or the economy” and who had previous experience in government, colleges or thinktanks, and offered them one to two free trips to Asia each year.Jarvis also told the Commons that he would ask MI5 to provide security briefings for political parties, issue guidance for election candidates and tighten rules on political donations as part of a plan to counter political interference.

Add this one to the list. Scotland’s long, long wait is over. You yearn for almost three decades to return to the men’s World Cup and do so with an overhead kick, a 22-yard stunner and a goal from the halfway line.Steve Clarke, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn; you shall go to the ball. So too Kieran Tierney, whose magnificent strike in stoppage time would have made all the headlines before Kenny McLean notched Scotland’s fourth. McLean broke forward, spotted Kasper Schmeichel in a state of desperation, and floated the ball over him. McLean was in the middle of the pitch when he shot. Cue bedlam. Cue wonderful bedlam.Scotland 4-2 Denmark: World Cup 2026 qualifying – as it happenedRead moreSo many years of frustration, when Scotland’s men have peered towards World Cups from afar, were obliterated as the 10Denmarkplayers fell to a defeat that felt unlikely for so long. Grown men in kilts shed tears. Denmark’s participation in next summer’s jamboree depends on playoffs next March. Clarke can start making plans, once he recovers from leading the celebrations here.PhD students could produce work on how on earth Scotland achieved this qualification. They appeared down and out at times, including on Saturday when they lost in Athens. It was almost as if someone, somewhere had decided the Scots had suffered for long enough. Tierney’s intervention was an extraordinary one. McLean’s? Something else. Clarke has become the first manager in history to guide Scotland to three tournaments.View image in fullscreenKieran Tierney curls in Scotland’s crucial third goal in the third minute of added time.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe night had supposedly opened in difficult fashion for the hosts. John Souttar, who had been due to partner Scott McKenna in central defence, was injured in the warm-up. Grant Hanley took Souttar’s place. Any sense of disruption was banished within three minutes.Ben Gannon-Doak jinked and weaved on the right. The Bournemouth winger’s floated cross should have been tricky for McTominay. He was facing away from goal, for starters. But the Napoli midfielder catapulted himself into the air and planted an overhead kick beyond the reach of Schmeichel. This famous old place erupted, not simply in recognition of the opening goal but the special circumstances in which it arrived.McTominay was like a man possessed. Gannon-Doak looked electric. Scottish danger resonated in attacking too ferociously; Craig Gordon saved from Rasmus Højlund after the Denmark striker was sent clean through on goal. The offside flag was raised but Højlund may well have survived a second check were it required. As Mikkel Damsgaard flashed a ball across the Scotland goal and McKenna blocked well from Victor Froholdt, the Scots were in a battle to maintain their advantage.Gannon-Doak had panicked the Danes with his pace. It felt a significant blow to Clarke, then, when the winger overstretched when looking to block a cross. Gannon-Doak departed the scene on a stretcher after just 20 minutes.View image in fullscreenScott McTominay opens the scoring for Scotland with a bicycle kick in the third minute.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAHøjlund soon had the ball in the net but was penalised for a push on Aaron Hickey. By the half-hour, Scotland were living far too dangerously. Yet they reached the break unscathed. Scotland were even denied a great chance of a second goal, Rasmus Kristensen taking out McGinn, earning a booking, after the midfielder capitalised on Danish slackness.Højlund forced Gordon into a smart, low save within 90 seconds of the restart. Given Denmark needed only a draw, the flow of traffic right from the onset of the second period felt ominous for the hosts. Scotland were succeeding – to a point – in breaking up Denmark attacks but promptly handing the ball back to those in red.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The referee originally saw nothing wrong with Robertson’s challenge on Gustav Isaksen, which took place on the angle of the penalty area. Indeed, it appeared Isaksen flung himself into the air. After being advised to look again by the video assistant referee, Szymon Marciniak pointed to the spot. Højlund smashed home. Parity was the least Denmark deserved but Scotland had cause to be sore about the circumstances.All this action-packed encounter lacked was a red card. It arrived on the hour, Kristensen’s second foul of the night on a marauding McGinn bringing another caution. Now Clarke twisted by throwing on the strikers Lawrence Shankland and Ché Adams.The move was to pay dividends. Denmark’s defending of an inswinging Lewis Ferguson corner was shambolic, allowing Shankland to strike from all of a yard. The Hearts man, introduced for his predatory instinct, demonstrated precisely that.Scotland had no time to build on their advantage. Within three minutes, Patrick Dorgu stroked home after Andreas Christensen laid the ball into his path 12 yards out. This time Scotland had been overly generous, Tierney’s defensive header rebounding back into Danish possession.Adams flicked a header wide. McGinn’s curling shot just missed the upright.

For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical.Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world’s leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives.A systematic review of 104 long-term studiesconducted for the seriesfound 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes.One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF.“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.”He and his colleagues in Brazil came up with the Nova classification system for foods. It groups them by level of processing, ranging from one – unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables – to four: ultra-processed.This category is made up of products that have been industrially manufactured, often using artificial flavours, emulsifiers and colouring. They include soft drinks and packaged snacks, and tend to be extremely palatable and high in calories but low in nutrients.They are also designed and marketed to displace fresh food and traditional meals, while maximising corporate profits, Monteiro said.Critics argue UPF is an ill-defined category and existing health policies, such as those aimed at reducing sugar and salt consumption, are sufficient to deal with the threat.Monteiro and his co-authors acknowledged valid scientific critiques of Nova and UPF – such as lack of long-term clinical and community trials, an emerging understanding of mechanisms, and the existence of subgroups with different nutritional values.However, they argued future research must not delay immediate action to tackle the scourge of UPF, which they say is justified by the current evidence.“The growing consumption of ultra-processed foods is reshaping diets worldwide, displacing fresh and minimally processed foods and meals,” Monteiro warned.“This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritising ultra-processed products, supported byextensive marketing and political lobbyingto stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating.”The second paper in the series proposes policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing and consumption. Although some countries have brought in rules to reformulate foods and control UPF, “the global public health response is still nascent, akin to where the tobacco control movement was decades ago”, it said.The third paper says that global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPF. UPF is a leading cause of the “chronic disease pandemic” linked to diet, with food companies putting profit above all else, the authors said.The main barrier to protecting health is “corporate political activities, coordinated transnationally through a global network of front groups, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and research partners, to counter opposition and block regulation”.Series co-author Prof Barry Popkin, from the University of North Carolina, said: “We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation.”The authors also proposed stronger marketing restrictions, especially foradverts aimed at children, as well as banning UPF in public places such as schoolsand hospitals and putting limits on UPF sales and shelf space in supermarkets.One success story is Brazil’s national school food programme, which has eliminated most UPF and will require 90% of food to be fresh or minimally processed by 2026.Scientists not involved in the series broadly welcomed the review of evidence but also called for more research into UPF, cautioning that association with health harm may not mean causation.Explore more on these topicsUltra-processed foodsFood & drink industryHealthLobbyingHealth policyAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

Others who knew Farage then remember he was bumptious, rude, provocative and enjoyed being the centre of attention, but do not recall the behaviour described by Ettedgui and others.There is no claim that Farage the man must still hold the same views as the ones ascribed to Farage the boy. But their memories of him left marks – ones that haven’t dissolved with the passage of time, and are often revealed again when he talks about issues such as immigration.They say they want to see more moral clarity from a man who could be Britain’s next prime minister.What is troubling, one explained, is the lack of contrition in the intervening decades. A couple of ex-pupils who have spoken to the Guardian say they are deeply ashamed of their own part in singing “racist” songs.The question some want answered is: what about Farage?Just hearing that aggressive, hectoring tone again, my blood ran coldPeter EttedguiWhen claims of this kind were first made about him more than a decade ago, Farage admitted saying “some ridiculous things … not necessarily racist things… it depends on how you define it”.Now, though, the man whose party is leading in all major opinion polls and says he expects to be in Downing Street, appears to have changed tack.In legal letters to the Guardian, he has emphatically denied saying anything racist or antisemitic when he was a teenager.He has also questioned whether there is any public interest in airing allegations that date back over 40 years.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But I wasn’t his only target. I’d hear him calling other students ‘Paki’ or ‘Wog’, and urging them to ‘go home’. I tried to ignore him, but it was humiliating. It was shaming. This kind of abuse cuts through to the core of your identity.”Ettedgui said he didn’t feel he could talk about it with his family or teachers. “So I just buried the whole experience and got on with life. Many years later, a friend sent me a link to a video of Farage berating EU commissioners. Just hearing that aggressive, hectoring tone again, my blood ran cold.”View image in fullscreenRight to left: Peter Ettedgui, Ian Bonhote, Robert Ford and Lizzie Gillett after winning the Bafta for best documentary for Super/Man: the Christopher Reeve Story this year.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hogan Media/Rex/ShutterstockFarage could suddenly “switch from hostility and become disarmingly affable, even charming”, Ettedgui says.“But from my experience, there’s no doubt in my mind that he was a profoundly, precociously racist teenager … I’d like to know why he’s never owned up or shown the slightest contrition.”Farage at the time was 13 or 14. Too young to know better? A second pupil from a minority ethnic background claimed he was similarly targeted by a 17-year-old Farage.“I was very small in one of the junior classes of the time, and you know that the sixth-formers were probably 17, very tall, much taller than me,” he said. “And that person’s walk, it’s the same walk he has now, I’ll never forget it.“He walked up to a pupil flanked by two similarly tall mates and spoke to anyone looking ‘different’. That included me on three occasions; asking me where I was from, and pointing away, saying: ‘That’s the way back,’ to wherever you replied you were from.“And it was a very horrible ordeal. Honestly, at the time it was just quite perplexing. Walking from the upper school, via the middle school, past different amenities, through a gap into the lower school playground, right?“You’ve walked all that distance to do what you want to do. I thought to come over and just say that? I mean, he will never be forgotten.”View image in fullscreenDulwich college, where there was disagreement about whether Farage should be made a prefect.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe former pupil said sometimes Farage and others would wait at the lower school gate for pupils being dropped off by their parents.“The thought of it still creates fear and anger within me, and the look you get from a person who does not see your humanity but just that you look different and has reached a conclusion about you before you even open your mouth to speak.“It’s a look I have received many times in my life and it’s a look you simply never forget. That feeling you get when being dropped off at school and just as you have got out of the car, happy to go to school, you can see the group of taller pupils waiting to inflict mental damage and then you are totally deflated. Aged nine, no one should have to go through that.“It is hard to understand why such a person would dedicate so much time to [it], but it is even more worrying that if such a person misused his minor position of power at that time so instinctively, what such a person would do with more power.”‘It’s a trust thing’Critics and supporters of Farage may argue over whether it is fair to judge him on what he is alleged to have said as a teenager, but one thing seems certain: the scrutiny of his life will continue and probably intensify.For more than three decades, he has been a fixture of the British political scene, arguably a weather-maker like no other.He helped to secure Brexit in 2016, and Reform is posing an existential threat to the Conservative party, as well as eating into Labour’s vote.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage standing with a Brexit supporter during Ukip’s Brexit ‘battle bus’ tour in Kingston, London, in 2016.Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PAIt is why Keir Starmer made Farage the focus of his speech at the Labour party conference, accusing him of crossing a “moral line”.In the run-up to it, the prime minister had labelled Reform’s policy of scrapping indefinite leave to remain as “racist” and “immoral”.The deputy prime minister, David Lammy, went on to claim in a television interview that Farage had“flirted” with the Hitler Youthas a young man, a comment that was described as “disgusting and libellous” by unnamed Reform sources. Lammy subsequently clarified that Farage had denied such claims.The deputy prime minister had been referencing allegations reported by Michael Crick when he was a reporter for Channel 4 News in 2013, and then in a book he published in 2022.Crick had obtained a letter from an English teacher at Dulwich college, Chloe Deakin. In it, she had opposed a decision in 1981 by the master of Dulwich college to make Farage a prefect when he was 17, describing him as having “publicly professed racist and neo-fascist views”.Deakin, who did not know Farage personally, went on to say that a colleague had reported that at a combined cadet force (CCF) “camp organised by the college, Farage and others had marched through a quiet Sussex village very late at night shouting Hitler Youth songs”.Bob Jope, 74, a teacher at the school at the time, told the Guardian he remembered Deakin’s letter, and how it had been written after a staff meeting where the issue of prefects was discussed.“On this particular meeting … it was by Dulwich standards quite dramatic. A number of people spoke up expressing anxiety about Farage being a prefect.“And a few spoke in his defence, fewer in fact. The main thing seemed to be that his attitude towards some of the younger boys and his attitudes towards those of other races weren’t necessarily making [him] an ideal prefect.“That was the feeling – that [he] wasn’t kind of the right thing to be sort of prefect material. Some staff had heard things about things he’s meant to have said on CCF training weekends and so on. Which he later denied having ever said or done, but again, these things came [out] at the meeting.“The reason I think things were so controversial was that at the end of the meeting the master said words to the effect: ‘This doesn’t sound quite the right sort of person to be made a prefect.’ Very soon after, the list of new prefects went up on the board and his name was there.”You can’t defend it as being a joke, or that he was too young to know better. We were 18Tim FranceThe CCF at Dulwich college was a youth organisation sponsored by the Ministry of Defence, and Farage was a keen member in the army division.The Guardian has spoken to seven fellow members of the CCF, including two who marched with Farage in Sussex where Deakin alleged he sang Hitler Youth songs. None of them recalled those specific songs being sung.But there are other memories that some feel have not been acknowledged in Reform’s angry denunciation of Lammy’s comments.“I was in the CCF with him from 1979 to 1982 or so,” said one former pupil.“[Farage] did teach the younger members of the CCF the infamous ‘Gas ’em all’ song, or at least led the singing of it on CCF coaches to training areas,” he claimed.The song, variants of which were heard on English football terraces in the 1980s, is sung to the tune of George Formby’s Bless Em All. One version runs: “‘Gas em all; Gas em all; Gas em all; And into the showers they crawl; We’ll gas all the niggers; We’ll gas all the Jews; Come on you lads gas em all’.The former pupil added: “There were black, Asian and Jewish CCF cadets on the bus. As I say, one of them asked me not to sing it or make those sort of comments. And I didn’t.“I liked him. I was just being a bit silly. I suppose from that perspective you could put it down to schoolboy racism,” he said, but added that he believed that with Farage a “sort of divisive behaviour seems to have persisted”.He added of his motivation for talking about events that took place more than four decades ago: “Just look at the Nolan principles [on the required standards in public office]: integrity, honesty, selfless commitment, that sort of thing. Nigel just doesn’t have these qualities.”The former pupil noted that Farage had previously conceded in response to Crick’s reporting that “he might have said silly racist things which some might consider to be racist or not” – but that a vehement denial had then been issued in response to Lammy’s comments. “You know there’s just no consistency, so it’s a trust thing. He would be a terrible leader,” the former Dulwich pupil said.View image in fullscreen‘He loved the sound of his own voice,’ said one former fellow pupil.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersPatrick Neylan, 61, an editor, who was in the year below Farage, recalled the singing of the “gas ’em” song on CCF camps and expressed his own shame at being involved.The song was sung in the CCF on coaches to annoy the teachers, he claimed, although he did not directly recall Farage being involved. It was “boys being naughty to annoy the grown-ups. You knew they were wrong, that was the thrill,” he said. He does not think Farage stood out in terms of his views and behaviour – but he added of the chants: “I’ve been deeply ashamed of it for 40 years.”View image in fullscreenA picture from a Dulwich college magazine of the combined cadet force with a boy believed to be Nigel Farage seated on the ground (centre, reaching towards his feet).Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianTim France, 61, was in the same year as Farage and sat near him in the final year as a consequence of the class being organised alphabetically. For him, Farage’s behaviour did stand out. He recalled a similar song being performed by Farage, who would also “regularly” perform the Nazi “Sieg heil” salute, he claimed.“In the sixth form, you know, he became much more kind of political and very rightwing and shockingly so,” he said.“We all kind of grew up in the shadow of the second world war, our grandparents fought in the second world war. So, you know, you didn’t question that Hitler was wrong.”“Somebody kind of outwardly doing Nazi salutes, strutting about the classroom, you know, doing, kind of saying things like ‘Hitler was right’ and all that stuff was pretty shocking and therefore very memorable,” France claimed.“It was habitual, you know, it happened all the time. He would often be doing Nazi salutes and saying ‘Sieg heil’ and, you know, strutting around the classroom. He was a member of the cadet force, [so] often being in uniform. And, yeah, it might have been for shock value, partly, but I think, you know, clearly, he also is very rightwing politically.“He was saying really, really unpleasant things, really things that you just knew were wrong. You can’t really defend it as being a joke, or that he was too young to know any better. We were 18.”The British Movement, later called the British National Socialist Movement, was an extremist organisation active in the late 1970s.France claimed: “He would chant, ‘BM, BM, we are British Nazi men,’ that really sticks in my mind.”He recalled going on coaches to Exeter and Yorkshire for geography field trips. “One of the buses was the smokers’ bus. It was like a fog of thick smoke. Farage called that the gas chamber. He was, you know, joking about it being the gas chamber: ‘Let’s get back in the gas chamber.’ Then he would be sort of singing these kind of ‘gas ’em all’ sort of songs.”France, who said he clashed with Farage at the time because he had leftwing views, added: “Look, the trouble with all of this is it is so easy to wipe the slide. If I was Farage, I’d just say, ‘It never happened, I don’t remember, they’re all making it up and trying to kind of bring me down,’ or ‘It was all a joke.’ At the very worst he could say it was all a joke. It would still be bad. But it’s easy to kind of sidestep all of that stuff. That’s why I don’t have a problem saying it’s true. I remember, very clearly; absolutely 100% true.”Andy Field, 61, an NHS doctor who said he knew Farage well because they took the same train to school, has similarly clear memories.“When I became a prefect, he [Farage] said, ‘I’ll show you how to do it,’” claimed Field. “He took me for a walk up to the lower school playground, where all the children from about nine years old to 12 would be. And he singled out, completely at random, a kid of Asian extraction, and just put him in detention for no reason whatsoever. I was flabbergasted, absolutely stunned. I was just disgusted, really. No rhyme or reason, just purely based on the colour of his skin.”View image in fullscreenFarage sparring with the media after making a general election campaign speech as Brexit party leader in Bolsover, Derbyshire, in 2019.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianA second abiding memory for Field is of a peculiar ritual-like show put on by Farage on a platform at West Dulwich station.Field claims Farage, dressed like a dandy, with sharp creases to his trousers and shiny shoes, set fire to a copy of the school roll. It was said to have more Patels than Smiths that year.“He took it as a symbol of a change in the tide, something that was beyond the pale, that we couldn’t possibly have that situation,” claimed Field. “He made a little public ceremony. Anyone who was around could watch. High jinks.”View image in fullscreenAndy Field.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianField said: “The bottom line for me is about whether Nigel Farage can be trusted as a leader. Having seen him up close and having watched his career, I am completely of the view that he cannot be trusted at all.”Mark Haward, 61, a driving instructor, who was a boarder at Dulwich college, said he had also found the tone of Farage’s response to allegations about his school days surprising, given he was “very proud and loud” about his views at the time.He claimed: “He loved the sound of his own voice; he would come in usually chanting something. He always wanted to be listened to – I distinctly remember him coming in several times chanting ‘Oswald Ernald Mosley’ [the name of the far-right leader of the British Union of Fascists].”Haward said he was speaking out now because he had “noticed he’d been denying the allegations” about singing Hitler Youth songs.Haward did not witness the singing of that song or indeed “person-on-person racism” by Farage, “but he absolutely used to” chant Mosley’s name quite regularly.Prof Dave Edmonds, 61, another Jewish pupil, claimed: “I have a very strong memory of him using the W-word for what we now call people of Afro-Caribbean origin and the P-word for those of south Asian origin.“I don’t remember being on the receiving end of antisemitic remarks, though of course he made outrageous comments about the war. I don’t think Jews were his main racial preoccupation. He was generally obsessed, as he is now, with the erosion of Britishness.”Another former Dulwich college pupil added: “What sticks in the memory most is not just his odious and prejudicial opinions towards black, Asian and minority ethnic students, but how central and public these views were to his whole school persona.“How brazenly and actively he identified with them, wearing them loud and proud as badges of honour.”The Guardian has also spoken to pupils who did not remember the use of such language by Farage.Crick had also found that for every person who recalled racist behaviour. there was one who had no such experience. Farage could be friendly with children from minority ethnic backgrounds.There is no evidence that Farage has ever been a member of far-right organisations. Crick has concluded that Farage the man is not racist. Yet concerns about his views have been raised throughout his political career. It is certainly the case that he has had to expel extremists attracted to the parties he has led.Sarah Pochin, the Reform MP for Runcorn and Helsby, apologised recently after saying on a talkshow that “it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people”. Farage said he believed Pochinhad not intended to be racist.View image in fullscreenFarage celebrating with Sarah Pochin after defeating Labour by six votes to win the Runcorn and Helsby byelection in May.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianNick Gordon Brown, 61, another contemporary at Dulwich college who regularly clashed with Farage, believes he can see a thread running through from Farage the boy, who he claimed was a “loud and frequent” supporter of the repatriation of immigrants, a policy proposed by the far-right National Front at the time, to Farage the man, seemingly on the cusp of the UK’s highest office today.“I always remember his words – he used to refer to our ‘black and brown friends’ with that grin, with that tone of voice, that anyone who sees him on the TV now will be so used to,” he said. “That was a constant narrative. I mean, arguably it was his only narrative and I think that remains his obsession to this day.”He said he thought it possible to draw a “straight line” from Farage’s alleged support for repatriation “to his recent policy proposal, about not feeling comfortable living next door to Romanians, not liking hearing other accents or languages on the tube, the Brexit‘breaking point’poster, theincendiary tweet after the Southport attack, the dubious figures he likes to come up with about the alleged ethnic breakdown of the UK population”.“The man I see on TV now saying these things is the 17-year-old I remember from school”, he claimed.He has a very, very consistent world viewRoger GoughIn his book, Crick quoted David Emms, a master of Dulwich college who has since died, as saying that he “thought of [Farage] as a naughty boy who had got up the noses of the teaching staff for reasons that are his chirpiness and cheekiness. They wanted to expel him. I think it was naughtiness rather than racism. I saw good in him and he responded to being made a prefect. I saw considerable potential in this chap and I was proved right.”The Rev Neil Fairlamb, a teacher for 21 years at Dulwich college, agrees. He said he helped Farage and others in the political society to invite guests to the school, including the former prime minister Ted Heath and Enoch Powell, just over a decade after his notorious“rivers of blood” speechabout immigration.In more recent years, Farage has said that while Powell got it wrong about people of different nationalities and races being unable to mix, the central thrust of his arguments about immigration held true.Fairlamb also recalled taking a group, including Farage, who pronounced his name as “Farridge” at the time, on a trip to France.“He said: ‘Thanks very much, sir. Done that now, no need to go back,’” said Fairlamb. “I asked why. ‘Because it’s full of the French.’” Was Farage – who today lives with his French partner – joking? “Not entirely,” he said.But the former teacher, who twice stood as a Conservative parliamentary candidate, said he did not see racism in Farage, and that he believed Deakin’s letter was motivated largely by her dislike of the college’s culture.Fairlamb kept in touch, even visiting Farage in hospital after he was hit by a car at the age of 21. They have corresponded on and off since.“He was objectionable, but I like objectionable pupils,” added Fairlamb. A harmless contrarian, then, who liked to shock?Roger Gough, the Conservative leader of Kent county council until Reform took it in May, was in the same year as Farage at school and has watched his career closely since. That summary does not quite ring true for him.“I think the truth lies somewhere between the view of him as a consistently extreme rightwinger and that that he was a gadfly that likes to stir things up,” he said. “He was a contrarian, but I don’t think that is the whole story. From my recollection, he was quite preoccupied by immigration … He has a very, very consistent world view.”Reform UK claimed the Guardian was attempting to smear the party.“It is no coincidence that this newspaper seeks to discredit Reform UK – a party that has led in over 150 consecutive opinion polls and whose leader bookmakers now have as the favourite to be the next prime minister.”We fully expect these cynical attempts to smear Reform and mislead the public to intensify further as we move closer to the next election.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In 2024, more than 367,000 tourists visited the reserve, a rise of almost two-thirds compared with the previous year.Guillermo Ruiz, presidential delegate for the province of Ultima Esperanza, told reporters that the tourists became lost near the park’s Los Perros camp, reachable only by a four- to five-hour trek from the closest accessible point by vehicle.November is late spring in the southern hemisphere, with the busiest months in Torres del Paine coming in the summer months between December and February.Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, offered his condolences to the victims’ families in the “tragedy”, and paid tribute to the rescue teams who had “worked tirelessly from the very beginning in the search, rescue, and now evacuation efforts”.A spokesperson from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office could not yet confirm the identity of the woman, but said: “We are in contact with the local authorities following an incident in Chile.”Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

In a gruesome coda, it later emerged, the Saudi agents dismembered his body with a bone saw in order to dispose of the evidence.On Tuesday, Prince Mohammed was met with the most extravagant reception of the second Trump administration, as the two men said they would cement $1tn in deals and made a public show of bonhomie that marked perhaps the most important bilateral relationship of this administration.It was far more than a simple normalisation of relations as Trump abandoned concerns over Khashoggi’s murder to pursue his latest triumph as the self-declared dealmaker-in-chief.In an extraordinary moment in front of the press, Trump criticised the murdered columnist, whom he said “many people didn’t like” and deniedUS intelligence agencies’ conclusion that his murder was orchestrated by the crown prince.“You’re mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,” Trump said of Khashoggi. “Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen, but [Prince Mohammed] knew nothing about it. Why did you have to embarrass our guest by asking about that?”Watch the two strongmen sitting on the gilded backdrop of the Oval Office, and the message was clear: that the Kingdom ofSaudi Arabiawill usher in a new golden era for the United States. “We’re doing numbers that nobody has ever done,” said Trump, as he said that Saudi Arabia would invest up to $1tn in the United States, which he said would lead to “jobs, lots of jobs”.“You keep increasing Mr President,” said the crown prince, who smiled eagerly through much of the meeting, as he let Trump dominate the talking. “The opportunities keep increasing.”1:58Donald Trump says Mohammed bin Salman 'knew nothing' about Jamal Khashoggi murder – videoIt was a state visit in all but name as a marine band played and black horses carrying US and Saudi green flags trotted across the South Lawn. As Trump greeted Prince Mohammed with a handshake, the US president smiled and pointed to the sky over the Washington Monument – soon a squadron of F-15 and F-35 fighter jets soared overhead as both men beamed.Saudi entourage for US visit may include official implicated in Twitter spy plotRead moreThose jets will be some of the items on the Saudi leader’s shopping list as he eyes a series of deals that will illustrate the new security and economic ties between Washington and Riyadh. Those deals are being pursued over the objections of traditional allies like Israel – which has opposed the first transfer of F-35 jets to a Middle East ally that is not Israel – as well as critics within the administration worried that China may be able to intercept sensitive US military technology through their relationship with Saudi Arabia.The moment has marked the rise of the Gulf as perhaps the major international power broker for the new Trump administration, in relationships that have been bolstered by business dealings between some of Trump’s closest friends and own family members in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar.All three have combined to invest nearly $5bn in a fund managed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, while other close allies like Steve Witkoff have conducted diplomacy and personal business in the region simultaneously.“I have nothing to do with the family business,” Trump said when asked about the deal on Tuesday. “What my family does is fine. They do business all over.”Yet for all those involved, the business is personal. Shortly before the two men appeared on national television for a rambling press conference, Khashoggi’s widow appeared on MS Now to issue a lone call for the investigation into her husband’s murder to continue.“It is very painful, very heavy,” she said of Prince Mohammed’s arrival in the United States. Demanding the return of her husband’s body, she said there was “unfinished business”.Explore more on these topicsMohammed bin SalmanThe US politics sketchSaudi ArabiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a growing detachment there, because he knows I have lied to him.”Kim is an asylum seeker based in Yorkshire, England. The 35-year-old, who has asked to use only a pseudonym out of fears for her safety, is among those in the UK who do not know when – or if – they will be able to see their children again, as theLabour government cracks down on the asylum system.On Monday the government published apolicy documentsetting out sweeping changes, which, the prime minister said, were aimed at “tackling severe strain on both our asylum system and our wider social contract”.The changes would formally end the automatic right to family reunion for refugees, which allowed people’s relatives to join them in the UK once their asylum claim had been accepted.Instead, once an asylum seeker has secured refugee status, they would have to move on to what the government calls a new “protection work and study” visa, for a fee, “if they obtain employment or commence study at an appropriate level”.Then, they “could become eligible to sponsor family members to come to the UK”, but since the government warns the “same conditions may apply” to refugees as to “other legal migrants and UK citizens”, refugees do not know if they will face the£29,000-a-year minimum income requirementsbefore they can sponsor a loved one to join them.UK citizens must earn at least £29,000 a year to sponsor a family visa, and most students in the UK are not able to bring dependants.Kim is on an access course pathway to training as a nurse while awaiting a decision on her asylum case.This means that even if her asylum case is successful, it will be four years before she can hope to earn £29,000 – and, until the government provides further detail, she has no idea when she can hope to see her son, who is 13, again. The last time Kim saw her son in person he was four.She said: “I am grateful for the sanctuary I have here, but I’m missing so much of my son’s life and I worry for his safety. I try to pass my values on to him over the phone. I have a three-year-old daughter who was born here. I feel guilty giving her so much attention when I have another child who isn’t getting that attention.”Kim said she was visiting the UK nine years ago, raising awareness of political repression in Zimbabwe, when she was identified as a government critic back home, making it unsafe for her to return.She had hoped she would be quickly reunited with her son in the UK. However, the Home Office has refused all attempts to bring him over while she awaits a decision in her case, and, even if she could afford to travel overseas to see him, she cannot leave the UK while she awaits an asylum decision.“People like me want to contribute,” she said. “I want to work with elderly people, giving people comfort in their final days, like we do in Africa.“The decision to leave your culture is not one people make easily. Any country can face war or political trouble. Zimbabwe might not be safe for me, butmany people have moved there for refuge.“Anyone can find themselves in a position where they need help – and the UK isn’t the only country that gives people help, it’s what human beings do for other human beings.”The government suspended automatic family reunion in September, with Monday’s policy document outlining plans for “stricter requirements”, including plans for “domestic reform to the application of article 8 of the ECHR (European convention on human rights) … the right to respect for family and private life”.The policy document also proposes that leave to remain for refugees be reduced to two-and-a-half years, and a 20-year wait for eligibility for settled status.Nick Beales, of the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and Greater London, said: “It’s now clear that Labour’s shameful decision to suspend family reunion for recognised refugees was just the first shot in their war on asylum rights. The human cost of keeping vulnerable people separated from their loved ones is huge.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “This government has moved to suspend the refugee family reunion route, acknowledging the pressures it is putting on local authorities and public services.“We understand the devastating circumstances of some families, which is why there remain other routes which individuals may be eligible to apply for in order to reunite with family.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It has been linked with miscarriage by some studies.Photograph: Èlia Borràs/The GuardianThe first time I had dengue, I was starting my second pregnancy. I didn’t know I was pregnant at that time. But I didn’t feel well. It started with a migraine, which lasted a while. So I went to do a test, which confirmed that I was indeed pregnant.The migraines persisted. I took Efferalgan every day, but I still had headaches, it wasn’t getting better. I had pain in my neck, a kind of stiffness there, it wasn’t good. I had pain everywhere. I had pain in my joints, even to walk. I didn’t have appetite. I often had trouble breathing. I felt like I was suffocating. Honestly, it was a whole sport to be able to breathe. My mother-in-law told me that since I had a girl for my first pregnancy, with the hormonal changes and all, this time it must be a boy for my second pregnancy. That explained my headaches. So, I didn’t think it was an illness. I said to myself, maybe that was it. Maybe I was going to have my boy now.So, I stayed like that. Then one day, I lost consciousness in the morning. I wanted to prepare my first [child] so she could go to school. And then, it happened. Actually, everyone thought the worst, because, from what they say, when I fainted, my eyes were still open. I had the appearance of a dead person. My husband took me to hospital and it was only after half an hour, an hour that I was conscious again. Even the doctors at the hospital, they were scared. The next day they came back and told me: “Madame, you are really a fighter.” It was as if I was fighting against death. I was fighting for my baby. I was fighting for my own life, too. So, I was fighting for two lives at the same time.View image in fullscreenGowend: ‘You hear about dengue from afar but you don’t imagine it could ever happen to you.’Photograph: Èlia Borràs/The GuardianAt the hospital, they did a bunch of examinations, and they showed that I had an old dengue. The first time I had really taken notice about dengue was when a friend of mine died from it, from haemorrhage. In his case he had started self-medicating with anti-inflammatories, and that made it worse for this illness. Because when it comes to platelets, I don’t really know what happens, but it causes haemorrhage.You hear about dengue from afar but you don’t imagine it could ever happen to you. But once it touches you, you start realising how serious it can be for a person.The hospital said they’d need to keep me there the whole day. The next day, when I went home, it wasn’t good at all. During the night, I went to take a shower and noticed that I was bleeding. I immediately called my sister and she came right away to the house and they took me to the medical centre near home. The next day the midwives told me that it was better to do an ultrasound to see what was there. When I did the ultrasound, I asked the lady doing the ultrasound if my baby was OK. She told me that it was OK, that my baby was fine.She gave me the results. They had medical terms I didn’t understand. I tried to type them on Google.I felt that there was something not good. I thought I was going to have a miscarriage, seeing the results. But I told myself: “No, stay calm, go to the hospital, the doctor will interpret.”The doctor was also surprised. As soon as he saw the results, he said: “Why did they let you come here despite these results?” I asked why he said that to me.He told me that I had a miscarriage. I couldn’t believe it was true. When I lifted my head, I saw women sitting, pregnant. There were others who were in labour, in pain.I saw how I was going back without my baby. The bleeding was there, and I was feeling the pain little by little. It was a very atrocious pain. We had to go back to the hospital again to do a curettage [a procedure in which the uterine lining is scraped out].I had waited for this baby so much. I had already given it a name and everything, I cherished it already even in my belly and all.It wasn’t easy. I remember when I was going to the hospital, I asked my husband to stop because I wanted to see my mother. When I arrived, I told her that I had already given the name Akhbar to my baby. I asked my mother to pray that there is nothing wrong with my Akhbar. She told me: “Go, go my daughter, I will pray for him.” But despite everything I did, I lost my baby. My little angel.View image in fullscreenGowend: ‘The second time I got dengue I was pregnant again … I kept saying: “God, please grant me the grace to hold my baby in my hands.”’Photograph: Èlia Borràs/The GuardianIt’s only recently that I said to myself, maybe it’s the dengue that caused my miscarriage, but I told myself, it’s better not to try to dig deeper. Because anyway, you have lost your baby. But at the same time, I told myself, it’s better to know if it’s really the dengue.It feels better now, to talk about it a bit. To share also, I think, the pain. To see that you are not alone. Even if the pain is personal, right? That’s why I like to talk about it. Because sometimes, I think there are many women who live that. They stay alone, closed off, thinking that the problem comes from themselves. And yet, the problem, it’s not from the woman, right? It’s not that she didn’t take care of herself. It’s not that she did something wrong. It’s just that sometimes, it happens.I said to myself, what did I do? What didn’t work?Maybe I failed somewhere? Maybe I did something wrong that caused the miscarriage and everything.I was blaming myself, I felt guilty. But thank God, I had the support of my husband.Even in the results, there was never anything clear. It just said that the baby wasn’t alive any more, or that something was wrong. But the exact cause, no doctor ever told me clearly: “Madame, maybe it was this, maybe it was that.” No, it just stayed like that.The second time I got dengue I was pregnant again. This time, I was seven months pregnant. Even now, when I go for postnatal check-ups, most of the midwives recognise me right away. Because my case really marked them. Everyone was trying to understand it, to study it. I had to be in hospital again. The headaches were so unbearable, I almost tore my hair out because the headache was so unbearable. I was literally pulling at my hair. They put me on oxygen because I couldn’t breathe. For a while, I passed out again. And the people who were there said that even when I fainted, my eyes stayed open – wide open. I looked like a dead person.They had to help me eat. I couldn’t even eat by myself, they had to help me swallow a few spoonfuls. To get up, they had to lift me. To lie down, they had to help me lie down. I spent two days like that. That’s the only memory I have from those moments.About the seriesThis is climate breakdown was put together in collaboration with the Climate Disaster Project at University of Victoria, Canada.Read more.Production teamAnd I was afraid of losing this baby too, the one I was carrying. My prayer at that moment was that God would truly grant me the grace to have my baby, to hold my baby. I kept saying: “God, please grant me the grace to hold my baby in my hands.”I was also asking my little angel [Akhbar] to watch over the baby I was carrying. I knew he was gone, but from where he was, I was asking him to always watch over me – to watch over the baby to come, his sister to come.So even now, when I go to the hospital, some people call me the survivor, or the one who came back. Everyone gives me a nickname, because my case really wasn’t simple.It’s as if I escaped death. Just like that. Since then I’ve changed a lot of things. I didn’t like covering my whole body [to protect from mosquitoes], but I do it now. I use the mosquito coil, we spray the house … When I go out in the morning, I spray the house before leaving. I try to put a bit of order in my surroundings. I used to have little pots with flowers, but I tried to get rid of them so they don’t attract mosquitoes. In the evening and during the day I use the mosquito repellant cream for me and my children.I’ve become Madame Awareness. When family comes over, I try to organise things a bit, to eliminate water puddles. With the mayor of the district, we tried to spray the whole neighbourhood, because it was something close to my heart.

Nice of you to finally join us. Hope it was worth the wait. Yes, sometimes a late addition can improve a drama or comedy so much it becomes hard to imagine the show without them. Not every series gets the casting chemistry spot-on straight away. A select few of our favourite TV characters weren’t even on the show when it launched.We’ve selected 18 characters whose gamechanging arrival in later seasons lifted the whole show and added to its legacy. Behold the super-subs who came off the TV bench and scored a winner …Alexis Colby – DynastyView image in fullscreenSoap queen … Joan Collins as Alexis Colby.Photograph: Bob D’Amico/ABC Photo Archives/Getty ImagesShe has become the 80s super-soap’s signature character, which makes it even more surprising that Joan Collins’ archetypal diva didn’t arrive until the second season. When executive producer Aaron Spelling brought in Collins as the sharp-tongued ex of tycoon Blake Carrington, ratings went stratospheric. Dynasty would have been way less camp and culty without Alexis’s glam wardrobe, dastardly schemes, string of husbands and catfights with nemesis Krystle (Linda Evans).Spike– Buffy the Vampire SlayerView image in fullscreenBlond ambition … James Marsters as Spike.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe peroxide-haired, leather-coated bloodsucker sauntered into Sunnydale in season two and stole fans’ hearts. Victorian poet William “Spike” Pratt was intended to be a temporary villainous counterpoint to soulful vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) but he proved so popular that he stuck around. Played with cocky charisma by James Marsters, the Billy Idol-alike was equally skilled at fighting and verbal sparring. Spike’s trajectory from villain to ally to Buffy’s love interest led to showrunner Joss Whedon calling him the “most fully developed” of all his characters.Alfie Solomons – Peaky BlindersView image in fullscreenScenery-chomping … Tom Hardy as Alfie Solomons.Photograph: Album/AlamyOnce the Shelby crime family swaggered in slo-mo beyond their patch of Birmingham, they needed new adversaries and allies. Step forward scenery-chomping Tom Hardy as eccentric, rambling Alfie, leader of a Jewish gang in north London and runner of an illegal distillery under the Camden Town arches. The fan favourite, who popped up in five seasons of Steven Knight’s saga, got cancer and was shot in the eye but somehow survived. “Shalom, Ar-fur!”Leon Black – Curb Your EnthusiasmView image in fullscreenPartners-in-crime … Larry David and Leon Black (JB Smoove).Photograph: HBOIn early seasons of Larry David’s majestic cringe-com, the only character to have our gaffe-prone antihero’s back was his hangdog manager, Jeff. That all changed in season six, when Larry took in a family of Hurricane Katrina refugees – including sex-mad, potty-mouthed Leon (JB Smoove). The freeloading lodger became LD’s spiritual soulmate and unlikely partner-in-crime. Leon’s fast-talking energy made him the perfect foil, while enabling the resurgent show to explore race and class in fresh, funny ways. Leon also coined such bon mots as “long ball Larry”, “topsy-turvy that motherfucker” and “tap dat ass”.Amy Farrah Fowler – The Big Bang TheoryView image in fullscreenNerds’ eye view … Amy (Mayim Bialik) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons).Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesAlongside Melissa Rauch’s Bernadette, who also joined full-time in season four, Mayim Bialik’s Amy helped reinvigorate the CBS geek-com. The brainiac duo not only broke up the male-skewed sausage party of the first two seasons but neuroscientist Amy gave nerd-in-chief Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons) new narrative impetus by becoming his longsuffering girlfriend – and eventual wife. That 31-page “Relationship Agreement” clearly worked. The fact that Bialik was a neuroscientist in real life only made it more pleasing.Constable Shane Bradley – Blue LightsView image in fullscreenPartnered up … Annie Conlon (Katherine Devlin) and Shane Bradley (Frank Blake).Photograph: Christopher Barr/BBC/Two Cities Television“Smashy-smashy, breaky-breaky.” When the Belfast cop drama called in backup for its second series, actor Frank Blake – previously best known as Marianne’s abusive brother in Normal People – was first on the scene. As cocky constable Shane, he initially seemed like an ambitious rank-climber, while shamelessly flirting with patrol partner, Annie. Yet the camaraderie at Blackthorn police station softened Shane’s hard edges and he has become a pivotal member of the response team. The latest season saw him not only get the funniest lines but one of its most heart-rending storylines. One word: Westlife.Dr Frasier Crane – CheersView image in fullscreenShrink-wrapped … Sam (Ted Danson) and Dr Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer).Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyThe beloved Boston bar successfully introduced several regulars during its 11-year run, notably Kirstie Alley’s Rebecca and Woody Harrelson’s Woody. But by far its most inspired addition was Kelsey Grammer’s stuffy psychiatrist. Joining in the third season as Diane’s boyfriend, Frasier was both a love rival for Sam and a pompous intellectual contrast to beer-guzzling schlubs Cliff and Norm. He proved so popular that his role was expanded and he landed his own superior spin-off, Frasier. Incredibly, the snobbish shrink has now been on our screens for more than 40 years.Brienne of Tarth – Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenHard as nails … Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie).Photograph: 2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved.Gwendoline Christie’s armour-clad cult heroine didn’t show up in Westeros until Ned Stark had lost his head. Arriving in the fantasy saga’s second season, she became a firm fan favourite by being a hard-as-nails warrior, honourable knight and one of the few characters in the Seven Kingdoms who was unambiguously good. In a genre that is often reductive in its portrayal of women, Brienne became a rare feminist icon. Also, she fought a bear.Benjamin Linus – LostView image in fullscreenVillain of the piece … Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson).Photograph: Photo 12/AlamySeveral standout characters joined the twisty fun as the plane crash saga unfolded, including down-the-hatch dude Desmond and double-dealing Juliet, but creepy Ben was the best. Tipping up in season two, Emmy-winning Michael Emerson’s mercurial nerd initially posed as a crashed hot air balloonist. Once he had infiltrated the Oceanic flight 815 survivors’ camp, Ben was unmasked as the leader of the hostile Others. His cold-blooded betrayals and soft-spoken evil added human villainy to go with the supernatural mysteries and smoke monsters.Hot Priest – FleabagView image in fullscreenIt’s a sin … Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and Hot Priest (Andrew Scott) in season two of Fleabag.Photograph: BBC“I love you.” “It’ll pass.” He was nowhere to be seen in the 2016 debut series but during the follow-up three years later, Andrew Scott’s flirtatious Catholic priest became a bona fide phenomenon. With his gin-in-a-tin, “thing for foxes” and Irish twinkle, the charismatic cleric made a worthy love interest for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s tragicomic protagonist. Significantly, he was also the only character to notice her fourth-wall-breaking. Kneel!Chloe O’Brian– 24View image in fullscreenDammit, Chloe … Mary Lynn Rajskub  as Chloe O’Brian.Photograph: Chris Raphael/Publicity imageHard to believe that Kiefer Sutherland didn’t shout “Dammit, Chloe!” until Day 3 of the real-time thriller. Soon after her arrival at CTU, data analyst Chloe became Jack Bauer’s most loyal confidante, sticking her neck out for our maverick hero on many occasions. Played by comedian Mary Lynn Rajskub, nobody was better at sarcastic scowling while wearing a headset and typing fast. She appeared in 125 episodes, second only to Sutherland himself, eventually becoming a Lisbeth Salander-style goth hacker. A real-life homeland security surveillance tech initiative was even named Project Chloe in her honour.Newman – SeinfeldView image in fullscreenFeud for thought … Newman (Wayne Knight).Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyIt’s equally hard to believe that it was three seasons before JerrySeinfeldsnarled “Hello, Newman” through gritted teeth. The voice of the odious mailman, originally provided by co-creator Larry David, was heard in season two of the megahit sitcom but Newman didn’t become a physical presence until the following year. Now played by Wayne Knight, the best buddy of Kramer and arch foe of Jerry quickly became a cult figure. With an unquenchable but unexplained hatred for our hero, Seinfeld described him as “Lex Luthor to my Superman”. Their neighbourly feud would unfold across the next seven years.Chris Finch – The OfficeView image in fullscreenCruel intent … Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson).Photograph: BBC“How can I hate women? My mum’s one.” The beauty of The Office – and many great sitcoms – is that its characters are stuck going nowhere. But episode three of the peerless mockumentary saw a new addition to the stagnant staff at Wernham Hogg paper merchants of Slough. Sales rep Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson) allegedly had an IQ of 142, read a book a week and once threw a copper kettle over a pub. Brent described boorish, bullying “Finchy” as his best mate but was invariably the butt of his cruel jokes – until the climactic Christmas special, when he finally grew a pair and told Finchy to fuck off. A proper air-punch moment.Jack McCoy – Law & OrderView image in fullscreenLiving landmark … Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) with Serena Southerlyn(Elisabeth Röhm).Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyThe New York legal procedural has been in near-constant rotation for the past 35 years, with Sam Waterston’s district attorney its most recognisable stalwart. Yet despite being the longest-serving character with 19 seasons under his smart leather belt, John James McCoy Jr didn’t join until the NBC fixture’s fifth year. The unyielding “Hang ’Em High McCoy” grew so popular that Waterston was declared a “Living Landmark” by New York City’s architectural heritage board.Dobby – Peep ShowView image in fullscreenKindred spirits … Dobby (Isy Suttie) and Mark (David Mitchell).Photograph: Angus Young/Channel 4 Picture PublicityBig Suze, Sophie, American Nancy, neighbour Toni, Russian Elena … love interests for loser flatmates Mark and Jez came and went across nine series but Isy Suttie’s endearingly geeky IT worker, Dobby – AKA “the anxious self-hating man’s crumpet” – surely should have been a keeper. When she met David Mitchell’s Mark in the JLB canteen during series five, they recognised each other as kindred misfit spirits. Cue Mark convincing himself she was “the One” and royally ballsing-up their relationship. Again. But hey, everything’s cool in Dobby Club.Mike Ehrmantraut– Breaking BadView image in fullscreenIf you want a job done … Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks).Photograph: Album/AlamyMike was invented by happy accident. Breaking Bad’s second season finale was supposed to feature sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman but actor Bob Odenkirk was busy filming a guest role in How I Met Your Mother. Instead, writer Vince Gilligan created a new character to clean up after Jane’s death. Jonathan Banks’s hard-bitten underworld fixer was intended as a one-and-done but deadpan ex-cop Mike made such a big impression he returned for season three and became a key part of the Albuquerque ensemble, even reuniting with Odenkirk for the spin-off Better Call Saul.Richard Splett – VeepView image in fullscreenAccidental politician … Richard Splett (Sam Richardson).Photograph: Hbo/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockArmando Iannucci’s White House satire was populated by power-hungry backstabbers. Sam Richardson’s cheerful campaign aide, who arrived in season three, was a relative ray of sunshine. Affable and optimistic, if not always entirely competent, Richard even happily donated sperm for Catherine and Marjorie’s baby – probably writing about it on his oft-mentioned blog, splettnet.net. He became an accidental politician, failing upwards to become governor of Iowa, a successful president and Nobel peace prize winner. Not bad for a “Paddington Bear-looking fuck”.Ruth Evershed – SpooksView image in fullscreenEmotional intelligence … Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker).Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamySeconded to MI5 from GCHQ during series two, intelligence analyst Ruth (Nicola Walker) soon became a vital member of the spy squad, sharing a simmering unrequited romance with Section D chief Harry Pearce (Peter Firth). This made it all the more poignant when Ruth was forced to fake her own death to avoid being falsely jailed for terrorism. Later rising from the grave and returning to the Grid, she persuaded Harry to retire so they could live together – then was killed while saving his life.

It’s easy to see why it absolutely rocked DenmarkHannah J DaviesTue 18 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTShareAs film-maker Mads Brügger explains at the outset of this four-part documentary series, a black swan is the name given to an event so extraordinary that you could never have seen it coming. In this case, Brügger’s black swan isn’t an event so much as a person: a lawyer named Amira Smajic, a “once in a lifetime” source for a journalist and the person who – he says – could “force us to rethink Danish society”. Smajic has spent years acting on behalf of some of the country’s most infamous criminal gangs, and is now exposing their activities as part of this major investigation for the state-owned broadcaster TV 2. Crucially, it’s not just the criminal underworld that Smajic is laying bare, but also their white-collar accomplices – the seemingly respectable businesspeople and lawyers unfazed by escapades involving dirty money and fraudulent invoices. It’s a co-dependent arrangement – one section of society “is feeding the other, and vice versa”, says Smajic.It would be an understatement to say that The Black Swan made an impact on Danish viewers. Half of all Danes watched it when it aired in 2024, and it sparked a string of police investigations, as well as a tightening of laws around money laundering and gang activity. It has also turned the country’s almost prelapsarian vision of itself on its head. Brügger – a steely, often sandpaper-dry compere who has previously gone undercover in North Korea for the film The Red Chapel – claims making The Black Swan has shown him that the country could be “grim and dark”. Simply put: something was rotten in the state ofDenmark.It’s easy to see why the series has had such an impact. As well as the huge revelations it uncovers, the way The Black Swan unfolds often seems to go beyond the work of even some of the best Nordic noir dramatists. Our anti-heroine, Smajic, arrived in Denmark as a child refugee amid the Bosnian war. A legitimate career gave way to working with the mob, and she would go on to be dubbed the “ice queen” by her associates for her ruthless practices. And yet, as the series unfolds, Smajic uses those same practices to obtain a huge cache of evidence for Brügger and his team, often putting herself in seemingly imminent danger as she documents all manner of nefarious activities from a Copenhagen office rigged with hidden mics and cameras. While the production has arranged safety measures for Smajic during her six-month stint as their inside woman, it is still risky business. But as she explains, this could be her only way out of a life of crime that has become so innate to her being, and which she likens to being addicted to drugs.Many of the scenes that unfold defy belief, not least those that involve Fasar Abrar Raja, a Rasputin-esque former member of the Bandidos biker club whose rap sheet includes convictions for assault, possession of firearms and drug smuggling. His braggadocio and insolence slowly turn to something darker. By episode three, broadcast next week, he threatens to “crush [Smajic] with my bare hands”.Even where her clients are less outwardly menacing, many scenes are still unbelievable. Martin Malm – a man Brügger describes as “beyond a cliche of the Danish upper class”, with a taste for the high life and a love of naff Christmas jumpers – says openly that obfuscating his business affairs is like finding a cheat code for a video game.The real Scandi noir: how a film-maker and a crooked lawyer shattered Denmark’s self-imageRead moreThe Black Swan can feel a little protracted; indeed, by the end of the first two episodes, we are still only a fraction of the way into the story. However, while episode three is also slow and meticulous, episode four is a heart-stopper of a finale that sees Brügger baffled by what is unfolding around him, as the team considers the possibility that the entire operation has become compromised. Without ever becoming too insider-y, it offers a glimpse into journalistic ethics at a crucial point in an investigation, and a masterclass in finishing a story that is spinning out of control.“It’s like being in a bad movie,” says Smajic, as she finds herself in an ever more precarious situation. Luckily, this bad movie makes for a nail-biting series, and one that emphasises the real-world impact that television can make.The Black Swan aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDenmarkDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

While the latest specs and outrageous screen sizes may well be a temptation, perhaps you can save money (and the environment) by holding off a little longer. With some simple tips and tricks, you can level up your TV experience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, the Fomo is real. Back in the day, the only reason to buy a new TV was when the old one fizzled and died. One telly was much the same as another, and features rarely changed.The market is very different today. Every year ushers in a new wave of high-tech flatscreens, sharper than the generation before. What was once a bland box in the corner is now a pinnacle of technology, wall-mounted like a work of art.But I feel your pain. It doesn’t take long before that once-cutting-edge screen starts to feel a little dull around the edges. Your smart TV’s picture doesn’t seem quite as crisp as it did, and its operating system seems to be losing IQ points by the month. Apps take longer to load, menus feel clunky, and somewhere deep down, you know that a shiny new OLED would make everything better.But would it? I’m here to tell you that it’s perfectly possible to postpone the inevitable and improve your TV experience with a little fine-tuning, and perhaps some new (cheaper) kit.Upgrade your smart TV OSOne sure sign that your TV is running on borrowed time is its smart platform. Every telly worth its salt has a gateway to streaming services and smart home niceties, but as boffins fast-track ever smarter software, older platforms inevitably fall from favour. Streaming apps stop getting updates, and the slick interface that once impressed your mates now feels like it’s wading through treacle.It’s frustrating, but it doesn’t mean your TV is destined for the dump. Simply adding an inexpensive streaming dongle can breathe new life into an ageing set. Gadgets such as Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, Roku’s Streaming Stick or a Google TV streamer plugged into a spare HDMI port will instantly upgrade your streaming experience, with a faster interface, up-to-date services and nifty voice search.Amazon offers both HD and 4K streaming sticks. The basic 1080p model sells for £39.99, while4K models start from £49.99.View image in fullscreenAmazon Fire TV Stick HD£39.99 at Amazon£39.99 at John LewisNot an Amazon Prime subscriber? Pick up a Roku 4K UHD stick instead. It offers an equally expansive range of streaming apps and services for less than £50. AGoogle TV streamer, with built-in Chromecast, does much the same for £99.View image in fullscreenRoku 4K Streaming Stick Plus£24.99 at Argos£39.99 at CurrysIn all likelihood, your TV will have a spare USB port that can provide power to the stick, so you won’t even need to trail an extra wire to a plug socket.Alternatively, you can really level up your TV experience by adding aSky Stream. This diminutive box adds a full package of premium Sky channels, including movies and sports, along with embedded apps such as Netflix, Apple TV, Disney+, Prime Video, and mainstream UK broadcasters. The base subscription package costs £15 a month and includes Sky Atlantic, Netflix and Discovery+.What’s really clever is that there’s no requirement for a dish or aerial, since everything comes via your wifi network. Unlike traditional TV set-top boxes, there’s no built-in hard drive, either. Instead, your playlist is stored in a cloud personal video recorder (PVR), which never runs out of space.Dumb tricks that actually workThis may sound far-fetched, but if there isn’t really any issue with the tech, then pay attention to your room lighting. It might be worth moving things around to create a better viewing environment. Shift table lamps to prevent them from being reflected, and swap harsh overhead downlights for soft backlighting. A light placed behind the screen reduces eye fatigue and enhances subjective picture contrast. I see this style of bias lighting in studio mastering suites all the time.If you hanker after a bigger image, why not get closer to your TV? Sounds daft, I know, but there’s an inescapable link between screen resolution and viewing distance.Back in the day – I’m talking pre-HD era – TV resolution was so poor it made sense to keep your distance. But with today’s 4K UHD and even 8K TVs, pixel density is so much higher that it’s perfectly possible to sit much closer without frazzling your eyeballs.In an ideal world, your sofa sweet spot will be the distance of 1.5x the TV’s screen size away. For a 55in TV, that means perching no more than 2m from the screen. If it feels good, sit even closer. You’ll see more detail and finer textures when watching native 4K programmes.When it’s best to watch movies with the lights onView image in fullscreenAmbient lighting can do wonders for the picture of some shows and movies.Photograph: SeventyFour/Getty ImagesIf you like dark, dramatic movies, but are frustrated that your LED TV looks a bit grey when you dim the lights, don’t immediately feel you need to upgrade to an OLED. There’s a simple fix.LED backlighting enables your set to display a nice, bright image when room lighting is high; but in dim, or no light, that same backlight will cause black levels to grey out, as the backlight becomes more visible. For a more natural-looking image, watch your LED telly in a room with some ambient lighting, and try to avoid full darkness. That way, blacks stay subjectively black, and won’t turn grey.Make the most of what you haveIf your TV pictures generally look a bit washed out or unnatural, it could be your LED TV’s backlight beginning to fade.

Try switching to Dynamic or Vivid mode. This may well inject some welcome extra colour and pop into your pictures.Not all HDMI settings are equalPicture still looking pallid? Double-check your HDMI settings. If you’re watching an HDR programme, from an external source – perhaps a TV set-top box, games console or UHD Blu-ray player – and feel underwhelmed by your TV’s performance, it may be because you’re not watching HDR at all.Take a look at the HDMI setting in the Picture or General Settings menu, which will usually be designated either Standard or Optimal (or maybe Enhanced). Set this to Optimal to ensure you’re seeing both 4K UHD and HDR signals from your source component.Conversely, if HDR TV shows look too dark – and your TV was a Black Friday bargain-buy back in the day – then it may not have the inherent brightness to do HDR justice (despite what was stated on the box). In this case, set HDR to Standard, to enjoy a brighter overall image – and forget all about HDR (you’ll still receive 4K resolution).Improve your TV audio with a soundbarIf your TV’s sound isn’t up to scratch, with speech increasingly difficult to discern, the easiest and most transformative fix is a soundbar.Poor sound from thin TVs is par for the course. Even the latest models can sound awful, since slim panels leave little room for serious speakers, with audio quality inevitably suffering as a result. Adding a decent soundbar not only boosts volume but also improves clarity, expands the soundstage and restores the sense of scale that the TV speakers can’t match.If you own a smaller telly (let’s say 43in or thereabouts), consider the Sharp HT-SB700. This Dolby Atmos soundbar is just 640mm wide, but it can play at 140W. I reckon it’s a bit of a bargain.View image in fullscreenSharp HT-SB700£89 at Tesco£89.99 at CurrysIf you own a larger TV, consider the £999 Samsung HW-Q990F. A generous 1,309mm wide, it houses 23 speakers, boasts 756W of total power and comes with a wireless subwoofer and two wireless rear speakers, for a fully immersive cinema sound experience. It sounds positively epic.View image in fullscreenSamsung HW-Q990F soundbar£999 at John Lewis£999 at CurrysWhen all else fails – it reallyistime to buy a new TVAll that being said, there remain very good reasons to splurge on a new TV. If it’s toppled off its stand and now presents everything through what appears to be an 80s Top of the Pops visual effects filter, then recycling it is your only recourse (we’d recommendRecycle Your Electricals).Similarly, if the design is out of the ark (I’m looking at you, chunky TV with a ludicrously wide picture bezel), then an upgrade is equally understandable. Wide bezels will never be back in style. And if you’ve really set your heart on an OLED, I’m not going to stand in your way. I love OLED screens: they’re gorgeous, and make even rotten TV programmes look ravishing.However, if you’re simply bugged by niggling aspects of your trusty, dusty companion’s performance, or simply yearn for a smarter connected experience, then money spent elsewhere can definitely stave off that next big-screen buy.For more, readwhen it’s time to upgrade your laptopandhow to make your smartphone last longerSteve May is a technology and home entertainment specialist, with more than3o years’ experience writing about TVs,hi-fis and music.

His biographer reveals what makes him tickSteve RoseTue 18 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareIn arecent interview, Alex Karp said that his company Palantir was “the most important software company in America and therefore in the world”. He may well be right. To some, Palantir is also the scariest company in the world, what with its involvement in the Trump administration’s authoritarian agenda. The potential end point of Palantir’s tech is anall-powerful government systemamalgamating citizens’ tax records, biometric data and other personal information – the ultimate state surveillance tool. No wonder Palantir has been likened to George Orwell’s Big Brother, or Skynet from the Terminator movies.Does this make Karp the scariest CEO in the world? There is some competition from Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Palantir’s co-founderPeter Thiel. But 58-year-old Karp could give them all a run for their money in terms of influence, self-belief, ambition and – even in this gallery of oddballs – sheer eccentricity. In his increasingly frequent media appearances, Karp is a striking presence, with his cloud of unkempt grey hair, his 1.25x speed diction, and his mix of combative conviction and almost childish mannerisms. On CNBC’s Squawk Box, he shook both fists simultaneously as he railed against short sellers betting against Palantir, whose share price has climbed nearly 600% in the past year: “It’s super triggering,” he complained. “Why do they have to go after us?”Leaving aside for a moment questions about what Palantir actuallydoes, the company seems to be at the heart of many of the world’s pressing issues. In the US alone, its AI-powered data-analysis technology isfuelling the deportationsbeing carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Pentagon’s unmanned drone programme, police departments’ (allegedly racist) profiling of potential criminals and much more besides. Its software is being used by the Israel Defense Forces in its assaults on Gaza, by the Ukrainians against Russia and by police forces and corporations throughout the western world. In the UK, Palantir is at the heart of Labour’s plans to “modernise” the armed forces and the NHS: whenKeir Starmer visited Washingtonin February, his first stop after the White House was Palantir’s office, where Karp showed him its latest military kit.For the past few decades, Karp has stayed largely under the radar, but a new biography, The Philosopher in the Valley, reveals him to be a complex, thoughtful, often contradictory personality, with a background that explains many of his insecurities. “Fear is something that really drives him,” says the journalist Michael Steinberger, the book’s author. “One of the many fascinating things aboutPalantiris the way that it is the embodiment, in a lot of ways, of Karp … he created Palantir to make the world safer for himself, or for people like him.” Whether that remains the case is up for debate.View image in fullscreenFitness obsessed … Karp has been known to lead tai chi classes for employeesSteinberger’s book reveals Karp to be an idiosyncratic CEO with a singular lifestyle. He is obsessed with fitness, especially tai chi (he has been known to lead classes for employees) and cross-country skiing (he often wears ski gear day-to-day) and has a coterie of super-fit, mostly Norwegian bodyguards. Karp, who waspaid $6.8bnin 2024, owns an estimated 20 homes around the world, many of which are apparently sparsely furnished ski huts. He is not married and has no children but has been described as “geographically monogamous” – he has two concurrent female partners in different parts of the world. He claims to run Palantir like “an artists’ colony” but he also likes to joke around in the workplace, comparing himself to Larry David, and once, according to Steinberger’s book, suggested that his own comic stylings “might be called Karp Your Enthusiasm”.This is not just tech-bro quirkiness for its own sake, says Steinberger. “In this case, it is legitimately him. He is himself. And that is what he’s always been.” Steinberger went to the same college as Karp (Haverford, a private college in Pennsylvania, though the two did not know each other). He has spent the last five years snatching interviews with Karp whenever the CEO could fit him into his busy schedule – including, on one occasion, during his midday roller-skiing workout. Steinberger had to cycle alongside him, holding out his Dictaphone.Karp grew up very much feeling like an outsider, it seems. The son of a Jewish paediatrician father and an African American artist mother, he was raised in Philadelphia, in an erudite, relatively privileged, leftwing environment. In a2023 interviewhe said: “I always thought if fascism comes, I will be the first or second person on the wall.” As much as ethnicity, he considers his defining point of difference to be his dyslexia, which, he tells Steinberger, “fucked me but also gave me wings to fly”. He also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (he claims the tai chi helps him to focus).View image in fullscreenAt the heart of Labour’s plans … Keir Starmer and Karp at the Palantir offices in Washington DC in February.Photograph: @10DowningStreet @PalantirTechKarp and Thiel first met as students at Stanford law school, where they hit it off despite being ideological opposites. But, while Thiel went off to found PayPal (with Musk) and embark on a fruitful tech investment career, Karp went to do a PhD in neoclassical social theory in Frankfurt. As a Jew, Steinberger says, Karp “wanted to understand how Germany, a pillar of European civilisation, had descended into barbarism.” While so many tech titans have amassed a fortune then used it to promote their “philosophy”, Karp has effectively done it the other way round. When he reconnected with Thiel and joined Palantir Technologies in 2004, he couldn’t write a line of code but he did know something about “ontology” – how information is structured and organised. He was also, apparently, a persuasive personality; good at recruiting and motivating eccentric talents like himself.Palantir’s founding mission was “defending the west” – a nebulous and pliable goal admittedly, but also an unfashionable one, at a time when early 00s Silicon Valley was all about giving tech a consumer-friendly face. While the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft shied away from working with the military, Palantir – which was never a consumer company – embraced the prospect, arguing that Silicon Valley should be helping the US to maintain its edge over threats from countries including China, Iran and, latterly, Russia. The company’s name is derived from JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings mythology: a palantir is a “seeing stone” – something like a crystal ball – a surveillance device, in other words. Karp has spoken of Palantir’s mission in terms of “saving the shire”, and employees were sometimes referred to as “hobbits”.In its early days, Palantir assisted the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it devised powerful tools for identifying enemy locations and attacks, arguably saving American lives. Even so, it sued the army in 2016, when it was being passed over for contracts. Palantir was also implicated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in 2018, in which Facebook users’ data was used to help influence their voting in national elections. But during the Covid pandemic, its tech assisted the US and the UK, among others, in tracking the spread of the disease and the distribution of vaccines and aid. Today it has contracts worth billions across US military and government agencies including the CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency, as well as Ice. You can see how the Big Brother comparisons started.But, there are “some fundamental misconceptions about the work they do,” says Steinberger. “They don’t collect the data, they don’t store the data; they provide software that helps companies and organisations make better use of their own data.” That could mean devising software to integrate complex supply chains for a large corporation, such as Airbus. Or it could mean analysing huge amounts of data, and spotting patterns and connections in real time, so as to identify, say, a battlefield enemy, a domestic terrorist or an illegal immigrant (or, potentially, any other kind of individual). Palantir argues that it has acode of conduct, and builds in guardrails to prevent abuses, including “civil liberties protections” – though it is not easy to verify such claims. “If abuses of data are taking place with Palantir software, it’s not because Palantir is doing it, it’s because the clients are doing it,” says Steinberger. “I think of Palantir software as like a toaster. If you burn your toast, you don’t blame the toaster.”View image in fullscreenKarp has spoken of Palantir’s mission in terms of ‘saving the shire’ … Karp in Idaho on 10 July.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesPolitically, Karp is difficult​ to pigeonhole. While the conservative, libertarian Thiel was an early Silicon Valley cheerleader for Trump, and campaigned for him in the 2016 presidential race, Karp was not. “I respect nothing about the dude. It would be hard to make up someone I find less appealing,”Karp said of Trumpin 2015. He voted for Hillary Clinton in that election, and backed Kamala Harris in 2024. Thiel had soured on Trump by 2024, but was instrumental in placing his protege, JD Vance, as his running mate.Since Trump’s re-election, though, both Thiel and Karp seem to have fallen more into line. Karp wrote a million-dollar cheque for Trump’s inauguration but did not attend. As a key defence contractor, Palantir also donated $5m towards Trump’s military parade in June. Ina recent interviewwith Axios, Karp described himself as “an independent who admires what Trump has done on many things.” In Karp’s mind, “the price of doing business with the government is making nice with Trump,” Steinberger says. Karp’s argument, he says, is: “Look, we got into business to work with the government, you can’t sit here and pull that support when someone you don’t like is elected.”Having once declared that fascism was his greatest fear, though, Karp could well be enabling it – by helping Ice to grab people off the street, some of whom could be innocent citizens, for example. Steinberger acknowledges the irony: “How do you square that circle? Well, in his case, I guess one thing is, he would deny that Trump is fascist. Karp would argue that we still have a functioning, independent judiciary, and a free press, for example.” Karp also claims that Palantir hasprevented “innumerable terror attacks”in Europe, which has actually helpedsave itfrom fascism. His argument about immigration, says Steinberger, is that “if the left doesn’t take this concern seriously, voters are going to turn to people who do, and the left isn’t going to like the outcome. That’s how you got the first Trump presidency, and arguably it’s one of the reasons you got the second one.”View image in fullscreenCheerleader for Trump … Peter Thiel in 2022.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APIt would seem that Karp believes there is no contradiction, but the “western values” he is defending appear to have evolved. When Steinberger first met him in 2019, he was talking about defending liberal democracy – making Palantir a “civil liberties juggernaut”. “Judging by his own words … he does not see multiracial, pluralistic democracy as the thing about the west that should be defended,” argues Steinberger. Now, “he sees it much more as just a collection of countries bound by a shared Judeo-Christian heritage, and, to varying degrees, by an attachment to free enterprise. That’s kind of where he is, I think. And it can lead you down some pretty dark paths.”In Karp’s own book The Technological Republic, co-written with Nicholas W Zamiska and published in February, Karp seems more concerned with US dominance, in tech and the military, including defeating rivals such as China in the AI race. He has railed against identity politics: in an earnings call earlier this month, he declared Palantir to be “completely anti-woke”. He believes that the west is too self-flagellating about its own superiority, and that “everything you learned at school or college about how the world works is intellectually incorrect”. In his quarterly letter to shareholdersin February, Karp referenced the political scientist Samuel Huntington’s belief that “the rise of the west was not made possible ‘by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion … but rather by its superiority in applying organised violence’.”In May, a group of former Palantir employees wrotean open letter(titled “The Scouring of the Shire”) stating that “Palantir’s leadership has abandoned its founding ideals”, and that its principles of protecting against discrimination, disinformation and abuses of power “have now been violated, and are rapidly being dismantled at Palantir Technologies and across Silicon Valley”.View image in fullscreenActivists protest against the federal government’s possible adoption of Palantir security software in Berlin in September.Photograph: Omer Messinger/Getty ImagesAs perplexing, objectionable and perhaps terrifying as some might find Karp, Steinberger did not come away disliking him. “I find him fascinating. I enjoyed our conversations,” he says. “He’s very fun to talk to. He’s very smart, but sometimes he’s going at a million miles an hour and it’s hard to follow his train of thought.”Karp likes an argument, says Steinberger. That’s the way Palantir is run – “It’s always been a culture where pushback is welcome” – and, he says, Karp would often seek to get into a debate with Steinberger personally. “It got to be a running joke. I’d say: ‘Who cares what I think? I’m not here to interview myself, I’m here to interviewyou.’ And that would piss him off. He would laugh and say: ‘No, no, no, let’s argue.’” When Steinberger did engage with Karp, he usually regretted it: “About 99% of the time he is convinced he’s absolutely right … You’d walk out after a conversation with him, and hours later you would be sitting there having a silent argument, firing back rebuttals, but he’s not there.”Palantir is firmly cemented into military-industrial infrastructure, and business is booming, but Karp is not letting up. He has said he wants Palantir ​to be as dominant and indispensable as IBM was in the 1960s, when it was the world’s largest computing company and shaped the way government and private companies did business. He also seems to view the world in terms of an existential war between “the west” and its enemies. You could see this as irrationally paranoid, terrifyingly prescient or simply what happens when you read too much Tolkien – but Karp clearly feels that he has work to do. In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, he wrote: “We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades.”The Philosopher in the Valley by Michael Steinberger is published by Simon & Schuster (£25).

But in Europe, a technologically superior rival was making it look like an ancient relicKeith StuartTue 18 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 16.14 ESTShareThere’s an old maxim that history is written by the victors, and that’s as true in video games as it is anywhere else. Nowadays you’d be forgiven for thinking that theNintendoEntertainment System was the only console available in the mid-to-late 1980s. If you were brought up in Nintendo’s target markets of Japan and North America, this chunky contraption essentiallywasthe only game in town – the company had Mario after all, and its vice-like hold on third-party developers created a monopoly for major titles of the era. But in Europe, where home computers ruled the era, the NES was beaten by a technologically superior rival.TheSegaMaster System was originally released in Japan in the autumn of 1985 as the Sega Mark III. Based around the famed Z80 CPU (used in home computers such as the Spectrum, Amstrad and TRS-80) and a powerful Sega-designed video display processor, it boasted 8kb of RAM, a 64-colour palette and the ability to generate 32 sprites on screen at one time – making the NES (based on the older 6502 processor) look like an ancient relic.At first it was marketed domestically as a continuation of Sega’s SG-1000 series of machines, which were closer to affordable home computers than games consoles, with their optional keyboards and printers. But as the NES exploded in both Japan and the US, Sega had a rethink, removed some computing features and re-released the Mark III in 1986 as the Master System – an unapologetic games machine with a sleek, slimline, angular look, contrasting the beige Betamax visage of the NES.View image in fullscreenSega Master System games came on two formats: a cartridge and a Sega Card for shorter, cheaper titles.Photograph: booksR/AlamyIt also came with a light gun, and Sega even released a pair of 3D glasses for the system and a range of compatible games. “I am going to call out the 3D version of OutRun,” says coder Chris White, who wrote a Master System emulator later used by Sega on its PlaySega website. “Sure it made your head hurt and the alternate flickering of the lenses was enough to trigger a mild seizure, but it’s reflective of an era when Sega wasn’t afraid to try wild experiments.”Sega oversaw the distribution of the Master System in the US (at least initially), but looked to local companies to tackle the more fragmented European market. For the UK and France (and later Spain), that role would go to Virgin Mastertronic. “Sega’s partners had better marketing positioning in Europe,” says Nick Alexander, who was Virgin Mastertronic’s managing director at the time. “They also had better retail and distribution relationships than Nintendo did in those days. The video game industry magazine Computer Trade Weekly had a running joke that Nintendo saw Europe as where the dragons lived – they didn’t understand it, they were nervous of it. So they put their effort into the US.”Alexander, who had run VirginGamessince 1983, embraced that company’s edgy, youth-conscious approach. “I was trying to think of the video game equivalent of a band going on tour,” he explains. “So we bought a double-decker bus and drove it around the country. We took it to school playgrounds and shopping centres. It got an awful lot of coverage. Nintendo had always marketed their games as family entertainment, but the only market in Europe where that worked was Germany. We pitched to teenagers and we knew if we got them, their younger siblings would want a Master System too. That’s how we beat Nintendo in Europe.”And while Nintendo had Mario, Sega had a valuable asset of its own: its arcade heritage. The company set out to bring many of its hugely popular coin-op hits to the machine including Space Harrier, OutRun, Golden Axe and After Burner, marketing its new machine in the west as an arcade in your own living room. Although hardly perfect ports of the original titles, these were much faster and more colourful than any earlier home computer translations. To those of us who were teenage arcade addicts at the time, it felt wildly futuristic.View image in fullscreen‘An arcade in your own living room’ … Shinobi on Sega Master System.Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy“The games are visually superior to other Z80 based systems as a result of Sega’s graphics hardware,” says White. “It presents the programmer with scrollable tilemaps and freely placeable sprites. They are both easy to use and offload a significant amount of processing from the CPU. The design had a number of parallels to Sega’s arcade hardware. In fact, the Master System’s graphics chip is actually based on theTMS9918, used by Sega’s older arcade machines.”For European developers, the Master System hardware was a dream. “We’d been working on the Spectrum and Amstrad and our games were being ported to the C64,” says Andrew Oliver, who with his brother Philip was making the Dizzy games for Codemasters. “We went to the CES show in Las Vegas and I remember seeing the Sega stand. It was massive, and right alongside Nintendo – and their message was: ‘It’s all about speed.’ Back in the day, computers really were all about what was colourful and fast. So Codemasters cut a licensing deal, we got the dev kits – it’s a Z80, so we program it like a Spectrum, but the graphics chip is like a C64. The code ran really fast and you had all the nice parallax scrolling and sprites. It was very easy.”UK developers also found Sega to be more helpful than Nintendo. Mike Simpson was a coder at the British publisher Personal Software Services, later owned by Mirrorsoft. “We had set up a little internal development studio in Coventry, only about 20 people, and we were doing a variety of ports,” he says. “Someone asked us to port Xenon 2, a really high-end 16bit Amiga game, on to the Master System. It looked impossible, so we had to have a go! I was actually invited to Japan to learn how to program it: I spent a week at Sega in Tokyo being taught by Mark Cerny [later lead architect of the PlayStation 4 and 5]. I remember rows and rows of tightly packed desks, and the meeting room chairs were all being used to sleep on!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The spin-off title Sonic Chaos, developed for both the Master System and Sega’s Game Gear handheld (which was based on the same hardware as the Master System), was one of the highlights of the series. Later, Sega rolled out a redesigned sequel, Master System 2, priced at a relatively affordable £50 with Sonic thrown in.But the Master System wasn’t just a repository for arcade classics and ports from other machines. It has its own heritage. The beautiful platformers Wonder Boy III: The Dragon’s Trap, Psycho Fox, Fantasy Zone and Alex Kidd in Miracle World, the seminal role-playing adventure Phantasy Star, the excellent Zelda-alike Golvellius: Valley of Doom – these are genuine classics, up there with the NES-era titles for which they are often overlooked. For modern collectors, they are also more accessible, being free of the inflated pricing attached to many classic Nintendo titles.It’s true that in the US, the NES was so dominant that the word “Nintendo” became a synonym for gaming. But in Europe, Brazil and elsewhere, the Master System won out. The history books have been cruel to it, but for those of us who were there, who read European gaming mags, or who studied the annual Argos and Grattan Christmas catalogues for Sega goodies, the Master System was the home arcade machine that hinted at the future of gaming. It was the promise that the Mega Drive would go on to fulfil.Explore more on these topicsRetro gamesGamesGames consolesSegaNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Frank Bienewald/AlamyAs GenAI becomes the primary way to find information, local and traditional wisdom is being lost. And we are only beginning to realise what we’re missingThis article was originally published as‘Holes in the web’onAeon.coByDeepak Varuvel DennisonTue 18 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTShareAfew years back, my dad was diagnosed with a tumour on his tongue – which meant we had some choices to weigh up. My family has an interesting dynamic when it comes to medical decisions. While my older sister is a trained doctor in western allopathic medicine, my parents are big believers in traditional remedies. Having grown up in a small town in India, I am accustomed to rituals. My dad had a ritual, too. Every time we visited his home village in southern Tamil Nadu, he’d get a bottle of thick, pungent, herb-infused oil from avaithiyar, a traditional doctor practising Siddha medicine. It was his way of maintaining his connection with the kind of medicine he had always known and trusted.Dad’s tumour showed signs of being malignant, so the hospital doctors and my sister strongly recommended surgery. My parents were against the idea, worried it could affect my dad’s speech. This is usually where I come in, as the expert mediator in the family. Like any good millennial, I turned to the internet for help in guiding the decision. After days of thorough research, I (as usual) sided with my sister and pushed for surgery. The internet backed us up.We eventually got my dad to agree and even set a date. But then, he slyly used my sister’s pregnancy as a distraction to skip the surgery altogether. While we pestered him every day to get it done, he was secretly taking his herbal concoction. And, lo and behold, after several months the tumour actually shrank and eventually disappeared. The whole episode earned my dad some bragging rights.At the time, I dismissed it as a lucky exception. But recently I’ve been wondering if I was too quick to dismiss my parents’ trust in traditional knowledge, while accepting the authority of digitally dominant sources. I find it hard to believe that my dad’s herbal concoctions worked, but I have also come to realise that the seemingly all-knowing internet I so readily trusted contains huge gaps – and that, in a world of AI, it’s about to get worse.The irony isn’t lost on me that this dilemma has emerged through my research at a university in the United States, in a setting removed from my childhood and the very context where traditional practices were part of daily life. At Cornell University, New York, I study what it takes to design responsible AI systems. My work has been revealing, showing me how the digital world reflects profound power imbalances in knowledge, and how this is amplified by generative AI (GenAI). The early internet was dominated by the English language and western institutions, and this imbalance has hardened over time, leaving whole worlds of human knowledge and experience undigitised. Now, with the rise of GenAI – which is trained on this available digital corpus – that asymmetry threatens to become entrenched.For many people, GenAI is emerging as the primary way to learn about the world. Alarge-scale studypublished in September 2025, analysing how people have been using ChatGPT since its launch in November 2022, revealed that around half the queries were for practical guidance, or to seek information. These systems may appear neutral, but they are far from it. The most popular models privilege dominant ways of knowing (typically western and institutional) while marginalising alternatives, especially those encoded in oral traditions, embodied practice and languages considered “low-resource” in the computing world, such as Hindi or Swahili.By amplifying these hierarchies, GenAI risks contributing to the erasure of systems of understanding that have evolved over centuries, disconnecting future generations from vast bodies of insight and wisdom that were never encoded yet remain essential, human ways of knowing. What’s at stake, then, isn’t just representation: it’s the resilience and diversity of knowledge itself.GenAI is trained on massive datasets of text from sources such as books, articles, websites and transcripts – hence the name “large language model” (LLM). But this “training data” is far from the sum total of human knowledge, with oral cultures and even languages underrepresented or absent.To understand why this matters, we must first recognise that languages serve as vessels for knowledge. Each language carries entire worlds of human experience and insight developed over centuries: the rituals and customs that shape communities, distinctive ways of seeing beauty and creating art, deep familiarity with specific landscapes and natural systems, spiritual and philosophical worldviews, subtle vocabularies for inner experiences, specialised expertise in various fields, frameworks for organising society and justice, collective memories and historical narratives, healing traditions and intricate social bonds.When AI systems lack adequate exposure to a language, they have blind spots in their comprehension of human experience.Data from Common Crawl, one of the largest public sources of training data, reveals stark inequalities. It contains more than 300 billion webpages spanning 18 years, but English, which is spoken by approximately19% of the global population, dominates, with45% of the content. However, there can be an alarming imbalance between a language’s demographic size and how well that language is represented in online data. Take Hindi, the third most popular language globally, spoken by about 7.5% of the world’s population. It accounts for only 0.2% of Common Crawl’s data. The situation is even more dire for Tamil, my own mother tongue. Despite being spoken by more than 86 million people worldwide, it represents just 0.04% of the data.In the computing world, approximately 97% of the world’s languages are classified as “low-resource”. This designation is misleading when applied beyond computing contexts: many of these languages boast millions of speakers and carry centuries-old traditions of rich linguistic heritage. They are simply underrepresented online or in accessible datasets. Astudy from 2020showed that 88% of the world’s languages face such severe neglect in AI technologies that bringing them up to speed would be a herculean – perhaps impossible – effort.To illustrate the kinds of knowledge missing, let’s consider one example: our understanding of local ecologies. An environmentalist friend once told me something that has stayed with me – a community’s connection with its ecology can be seen through the detailed and specific names it has for local plants. Because plant species are often regionally specific or ecologically unique, knowledge of these plants becomes equally localised. When a language becomes marginalised, the plant knowledge embedded within it often disappears as well.View image in fullscreenA wattle-and-daub cottage designed by Indian architects Thannal, who specialise in natural building techniques.Photograph: ThannalWhile writing this essay, I spoke to various people about the language gaps in GenAI – among them Dharan Ashok, chief architect at Thannal, an organisation dedicated to reviving natural building techniques in India. He agreed that there is a strong connection between language and local ecological knowledge, and that this in turn underpins Indigenous architectural knowledge. While modern construction is largely synonymous with concrete and steel, Indigenous building methods relied on materials available in the surrounding environment.Amid concerns over unsustainable and carbon-intensive construction, Dharan is actively working to recover the lost art of producing biopolymers from local plants. He noted that the greatest challenge lies in the fact that this knowledge is largely undocumented and has been passed down orally through native languages. It is often held by just a few elders, and when they pass away, it is lost. Dharan recounted an experience of missing the chance to learn how to make a specific type of limestone-based brick when the last artisan with that knowledge died.To understand how certainways of knowing rise to global dominance, often at the expense of Indigenous knowledge, it helps to consider the idea of cultural hegemony developed by the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci.Gramsci argued that power is maintained not solely through force or economic control, but also through the shaping of cultural norms and everyday beliefs. Over time, epistemological approaches rooted in western traditions have come to be seen as objective and universal. This has normalised western knowledge as the standard, obscuring the historical and political forces that enabled its rise. Institutions such as schools, scientific bodies and international development organisations have helped entrench this dominance.Epistemologies are not just abstract and cognitive. They are all around us, with a direct impact on our bodies and lived experiences. To understand how, let’s consider an example that contrasts sharply with the kind of Indigenous construction practices that Dharan seeks to revive: high-rise buildings with glass facades in the tropics.Far from being neutral or purely aesthetic choices, glass buildings reflect a tradition rooted in western architectural modernism. Originally designed for colder, low-light climates, these buildings were praised for their perceived energy efficiency, allowing ample daylight into interiors and reducing reliance on artificial lighting.However, when this design is applied in tropical regions, it turns into an environmental contradiction. In places with intense sunlight,studies have shownthat glass facades lead to significant indoor overheating and thermal discomfort, even with modern glazing. Rather than conserving energy, these buildings demand more energy use to remain cool.Yet glass facades have become the face of urban modernity, whether in San Francisco, Jakarta or Lagos – regardless of climate or cultural context. As climate breakdown accelerates, these glass buildings are gleaming reminders of the dangers of knowledge homogenisation. Ironically, I’m writing this from inside one of those very buildings in Bengaluru in southern India. I sit in cooled air with the soft hum of the air conditioner in my ears. Outside in the drizzle, it seems to be a normal monsoon afternoon, except the rains arrived weeks early this year – another sign of growing climate unpredictability.In Bengaluru, I see yet another example of the impacts of lost knowledge: water management. How can a city flood severely in May, submerging cars, yet scramble for water even for domestic use in March? While poor planning and unchecked urbanisation play their part, the issue also has epistemological roots.Bengaluru was once celebrated for its smart water-management system, fed by a series of interconnected cascading lakes. For centuries, these lakes were managed by dedicated groups, such as the Neeruganticommunity (neerumeans “water” in the Kannada language), who controlled water flow and ensured fair distribution. Depending on the rains, they guided farmers on which crops to grow, often suggesting water-efficient varieties. They also handled upkeep: desilting tanks, planting vegetation to prevent erosion and clearing feeder channels.View image in fullscreenInterior of Thannal’s wattle-and-daub cottage.Photograph: ThannalBut with modernisation, community-led water management gave way to centralised systems and individual solutions such as irrigation from far-off dams and bore wells. The “Green Revolution” of the late 1960s – when India embraced modern industrial agriculture – added to this shift, pushing water- and fertiliser-heavy crops developed in western labs. The Neerugantis were sidelined, and many moved on in search of other work. Local lakes and canals declined, and some were even built over, replaced with roads, buildings or bus stops.Experts have realised that the key to saving Bengaluru from its water crisis lies in bringing these lake systems back to life. A social worker I spoke with, who’s been involved in several of these projects, said they often turn to elders from the Neeruganticommunity for advice. Their insights are valuable, but their local knowledge is not written down, and their role as community water managers has long been delegitimised. Knowledge exists only in their native language, passed on orally, and is mostly absent from digital spaces – let alone AI systems.While all my examples so far are drawn from India due to personal familiarity, such hierarchies are widespread, rooted in the global history of imperialism and colonialism. In her book Decolonizing Methodologies (1999), the Māori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith emphasises that colonialism profoundly disrupted local knowledge systems – and the cultural and intellectual foundations on which they were built – by severing ties to land, language, history and social structures. Smith’s insights reveal how these processes are not confined to a single region but form part of a broader legacy that continues to shape how knowledge is produced and valued. It is on this distorted foundation that today’s digital and GenAI systems are built.Irecently worked with Microsoft Research, examining several GenAI deployments built for non-western populations. Observing how these AI models often miss cultural contexts, overlook local knowledge and frequently misalign with their target community has brought home to me just how much they encode existing biases and exclude marginalised knowledge.The work has also brought me closer to understanding the technical reasons why such inequalities develop inside the models. The problem is far deeper than gaps in training data. By design, LLMs also tend to reproduce and reinforce the most statistically prevalent ideas, creating a feedback loop that narrows the scope of accessible human knowledge.Why so? The internal representation of knowledge in an LLM is not uniform. Concepts that appear more frequently, more prominently or across a wider range of contexts in the training data tend to be more strongly encoded. For example, if pizza is commonly mentioned as a favourite food across a broad set of training texts, when asked “what’s your favourite food?”, the model is more likely to respond with “pizza” because that association is more statistically prominent.More subtly, the model’s output distribution does not directly reflect the frequency of ideas in the training data. Instead, LLMs often amplify dominant patterns or ideas in a way that distorts their original proportions. This phenomenon can be referred to as “mode amplification”.View image in fullscreenThe glass facade of DLF’s Gateway Tower in Gurugram, India.Photograph: Danny Lehman/Getty ImagesSuppose the training data includes 60% references to pizza, 30% to pasta and 10% to biryani as favourite foods. One might expect the model to reproduce this distribution if asked the same question 100 times. However, in practice, LLMs tend to overproduce the most frequent answer. Pizza may appear more than 60 times, while less frequent items such as biryani may be underrepresented or omitted altogether. This occurs because LLMs are optimised to predict the most probable next “token” (the next word or word fragment in a sequence), which leads to a disproportionate emphasis on high-likelihood responses.This uneven encoding gets further skewed through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where GenAI models are fine-tuned based on human preferences. This inevitably embeds the values and worldviews of their creators into the models themselves. Ask ChatGPT about a controversial topic and you’ll get a diplomatic response that sounds like it was crafted by a panel of lawyers and HR professionals who are overly eager to please you. Ask Grok, X’s AI chatbot, the same question and you might get a sarcastic quip followed by a politically charged take that would fit right in at a certain tech billionaire’s dinner party.Commercial pressures add another layer entirely. The most lucrative users – English-speaking professionals willing to pay $20-200 monthly for premium AI subscriptions – become the implicit template for “superintelligence”. These models excel at generating quarterly reports, coding in Silicon Valley’s preferred languages and crafting emails that sound appropriately deferential to western corporate hierarchies. Meanwhile, they stumble over cultural contexts that don’t translate to quarterly earnings.It should not come as a surprise that a growing body of studies shows how LLMs predominantly reflectwestern cultural valuesandepistemologies. Theyoverrepresent certain dominantgroups in their outputs, reinforce andamplify the biasesheld by these groups, and aremore factually accurateon topics associated with North America and Europe. Even in domains such as travel recommendations or storytelling, LLMs tend togenerate richerand more detailed content for wealthier countries compared with poorer ones.And beyond merelyreflectingexisting knowledge hierarchies, GenAI has the capacity toamplifythem, as human behaviour changes alongside it. The integration of AI overviews in search engines, along with the growing popularity of AI-powered search engines such as Perplexity, underscores this shift.As AI-generated content has started to fill the internet, it adds another layer of amplification to ideas that are already popular online. The internet, as the primary source of knowledge for AI models, becomes recursively influenced by the very outputs those models generate. With each training cycle, new models increasingly rely on AI-generated content. This risks creating a feedback loop where dominant ideas are continuously amplified while long-tail or niche knowledge fades from view.The AI researcher Andrew Petersondescribes thisphenomenon as “knowledge collapse”: a gradual narrowing of the information humans can access, along with a declining awareness of alternative or obscure viewpoints. As LLMs are trained on data shaped by previous AI outputs, underrepresented knowledge can become less visible – not because it lacks merit, but because it is less frequently retrieved or cited. Peterson also warns of the “streetlight effect”, named after the joke where a person searches for lost keys under a streetlight at night because that’s where the light is brightest. In the context of AI, this would be people searching where it’seasiestrather than where it’s mostmeaningful. Over time, this would result in a degenerative narrowing of the public knowledge base.Across the globe, GenAI is also becoming part of formal education, used to generate learning content and support self-paced education through AI tutors. For example, the state government of Karnataka, home to the city of Bengaluru, has partnered with the US-based nonprofit Khan Academy to deploy Khanmigo, an AI-powered learning assistant, in schools and colleges. I would be surprised if Khanmigo holds the insights of elder Neerugantis – grounded in local knowledge and practices – needed to teach school students in Karnataka how to care for their water ecologies.All this means that, in a world where AI increasingly mediates access to knowledge, future generations may lose connection with vast bodies of experience, insight and wisdom. AI developers could argue that this is simply a data problem, solvable by incorporating more diverse sources into training datasets. While that might be technically possible, the challenges of data sourcing, prioritisation and representation are far more complex than such a solution implies.This was brought into focus by a conversation I had with a senior leader involved in the development of an AI chatbot which serves more than 8 million farmers across Asia and Africa. The system provides agricultural advice based mostly on databases from government advisories and international development organisations, which tend to rely on research literature. The leader acknowledged how many local practices that could be effective are still excluded from the chat responses, because they are not documented in the research literature.View image in fullscreenLiquid-cooled servers at the Global Switch data centre, London.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe rationale isn’t that research-backed advice is always right or risk-free. It’s that it offers a defensible position if something goes wrong. In a system this large, leaning on recognised sources is seen as the safer bet, protecting an organisation from liability while sidelining knowledge that hasn’t been vetted through institutional channels. So the decision is more than just technical. It’s a compromise shaped by the structural context, not based on what is most useful or true.This structural context doesn’t just shape institutional choices. It also shapes the kinds of challenges I heard about in my conversation with Perumal Vivekanandan, founder of the nonprofit organisation Sustainable-agriculture and Environmental Voluntary Action (Seva). His experiences highlight the uphill battle faced by those working to legitimise Indigenous knowledge.Formed in 1992, Seva focuses on preserving and disseminating Indigenous knowledge in agriculture, animal husbandry and the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in India. Over the years, Vivekanandan has documented more than 8,600 local practices and adaptations, travelling village to village.Still, the work constantly runs into systemic roadblocks. Potential funders often withhold support, questioning the scientific legitimacy of the knowledge Seva seeks to promote. When Seva turns to universities and research institutions to help validate this knowledge, they often signal a lack of incentives to engage. Some even suggest that Seva should fund the validation studies itself. This creates a catch-22: without validation, Seva struggles to gain support; but without support, it can’t afford validation. The process reveals a deeper challenge: finding ways to validate Indigenous knowledge within systems that have historically undervalued it.‘I have to do it’: Why one of the world’s most brilliant AI scientists left the US for ChinaRead moreSeva’s story shows that while GenAI may be accelerating the erasure of local knowledge, it is not the root cause. The marginalisation of local and Indigenous knowledge has long been driven by entrenched power structures. GenAI simply puts this process on steroids.We often frame the loss of Indigenous knowledge as a tragedy only for the local communities who hold it. But ultimately, the loss is not just theirs to bear, but belongs to the world at large.The disappearance of local knowledge is not a trivial loss. It is a disruption to the larger web of understanding that sustains both human and ecological wellbeing. Just as biological species have evolved to thrive in specific local environments, human knowledge systems are adapted to the particularities of place. When these systems are disrupted, the consequences can ripple far beyond their point of origin.Wildfire smoke doesn’t care about transgressing postcodes. Polluted water doesn’t pause at state lines. Rising temperatures ignore national borders. Infectious germs don’t have visa waiting periods. Whether we acknowledge it or not, we are enmeshed in shared ecological systems where local wounds inevitably become global aches.The biggest contradiction for me in writing this essay is that I’m trying to convince readers of the legitimacy and importance of local knowledge systems while I myself remain unconvinced about my dad’s herbal concoctions. This uncertainty feels like a betrayal of everything I’ve argued for here. Yet maybe it’s exactly the kind of honest complexity we need to navigate.I have my doubts about whether Indigenous knowledge truly works as claimed in every case. Especially when influencers and politicians invoke it superficially for likes or to exploit identity politics, generating misinformation without sincere inquiry. However, I’m equally wary of letting it disappear. We may lose something valuable, only to recognise its worth much later. And what’s the collateral damage of that process? An ecological collapse we could have prevented?The climate crisis is revealing cracks in our dominant knowledge paradigms. Yet at the same time, AI developers are convinced that their technology will accelerate scientific progress and solve our greatest challenges. I really want to believe they’re right. But several questions remain: are we capable of moving towards this technological future while authentically engaging with the knowledge systems we’ve dismissed, with genuine curiosity beyond tokenism? Or will we keep erasing forms of understanding through the hierarchies we’ve built, and find ourselves scrambling to colonise Mars because we never learned to listen to those who knew how to live sustainably on Earth?Maybe the intelligence we most need is the capacity to see beyond the hierarchies that determine which knowledge counts. Without that foundation, regardless of the hundreds of billions we pour into developing superintelligence, we’ll keep erasing knowledge systems that took generations to develop.I don’t know if my dad’s herbal concoctions worked. But I’m learning that acknowledging I don’t know might be the most honest place to start.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.

You didn’t account for the US president and his Fifa soulmate, Gianni InfantinoTue 18 Nov 2025 09.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 13.06 ESTShare“It’s very clear,” claimed haunted Fifa cue-ball Gianni Infantinonot so long ago, “that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics.” But is it clear? Is it really? On Monday, the worst man in world sport was – yet again – to befound in the Oval Office, this time nodding along to Trump’s declaration that games could be moved from host cities for next summer’s World Cup if the US president deems there’s “a problem” with security or that the cities are non-compliant in some other way. In practice, that seems to mean if they’re run by a Democrat/“communist”. Amazing that the Fifa president will gladly allow his tournaments to be held in any old violent autocracy but, for the purposes of the White House cameras at least, might need to draw the line at Boston.Honestly, the very sight of Infantino these days causes decades of writing about Fifa to flash before my eyes. How could it have happened? How could we have ended up with an even bigger horror in charge of world football’s governing body than the various ones who went before? WhenSepp Blatter was thrownfrom a moving gravy train in 2015 amid an explosive corruption scandal, it would have felt like a genuine feat of sporting excellence to have beaten his record for craven awfulness.Tell us: have you bought tickets for the 2026 World Cup yet?Read moreAnd yet here we all are. This year, the Fifa president has been the Forrest Gump of Trump’s administration. Back in May, he attended the US president’s Middle East peace summit, causing him to be so late for Fifa’s own congress that even Uefa accused him of prioritising “private political interests” and staged a delegate walk-out. Last month, Gianni was back on the political trail at Trump’s Gaza peace talks in Egypt, and earlier this month instituted somepreposterous Fifa peace prizethat he’s going to inaugurate at the final draw for the 2026 World Cup in Washington next month, quite possibly so that the orange organ grinder can be the first winner of it. He spent yesterday grinning alongwhile Trump announced things such as the possible ordering of “strikes” on one of the US’s 2026 World Cup co-host nations, Mexico. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Gianni kicked off the year of ceaselessly grim politicking by attending Trump’s inauguration, where he was filmed giggling appreciatively during the bit where the US president announced he’d be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.Back then, in January, Infantino looked like a competition winner. Now he resembles a fully operational member of Trump’s troupe of winged monkeys. It used to be host governments that got co-opted into Fifa’s supra-national edicts – I remember South Africa being forced to set up highly dubious “Fifa World Cup Courts” for errant fans during the 2010 tournament. But now Fifa is a wholly owned tool of whoever will have it. Like all parasites, it relies on its host organisms.As far as I can tell, a political leader removing a game from a host city has never happened in the entire 95-year history of theWorld Cuptournament, which should perhaps confirm the increasing global impression that the US might just be a uniquely backward country. Football fans considering buying expensive tickets and making even more expensive travel arrangements should consider that they are journeying somewhere so apparently volatile that even its own president talks its safety down. Hopefully here in the UK there will be official Foreign Office advice warning of the logistical and political dangers of watching a remorselessly poor match between two of the 48 countries that Infantino has triumphantly ruined the group stages with. Or, indeed, watching no match at all, because Seattle’s mayor has been deemed less politically acceptable than anyone connected to the leadership of the last two host countries, Qatar and Russia. Which, by way of a reminder, were not actually even democracies.Or as Trump’s White House World Cup taskforce head, nepo gimp Andrew Giuliani, put it on Monday, the next World Cup could only have happened because of Trump’s “vision”, and is going to be “one of the greatest cultural events in world history”. Infantino went with different superlatives, promising that it would be “the greatest and most inclusive World Cup ever”. Mm-hm. In the hands of marketing men, of which Mr Infantino is most certainly one, there are few more telltale red flags than use of the word “inclusive”. If you ever hear the word inclusive in what amounts to an advert, you can be sure someone’s about to get done over or excluded – and in this case, would you believe, it’s the fans. Not only has the Fifa overlord allowedWorld Cup game tickets to be subject to the loathed dynamic pricing, but those games might be shifted hundreds or even thousands of miles away due to politics.No doubt Infantino is patting himself on the back for all this. But his true achievement – so far – is presiding over an era in which “sportswashing” stopped being some niche critical term of art, and became something that all football fans know the minute they see it. Because they see it all the time. As for that peace prize, please don’t limit yourself to thinking it will be annual. The last time Gianni invented a prize – Fifa’s The Best Awards – he held them twice inside nine months. So there is every chance Trump could win it again before next summer’s World Cup kicks off. It’s all thanks to the least political man in world sport – or certainly, the least sporting man in world politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But true progressives must have lost count of the red lines it has crossedTue 18 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 12.41 ESTShareYou can learn a great deal about a government by who it chooses to fight. In the 16 months since this shambolic, soulless rabble were handed power by Tory collapse, they have trained their fire on pensioners and disabled people. Their latest target:refugees fleeing violence and persecution.In time-honoured fashion, a desperately unpopular government lacking answers to the country’s multiplying problems opts to kick asylum seekers. No 10 is plainly in a panic.Barely one in 10voters are satisfied with its performance – a figurecomparable to the proportionof the public who believe the moon landings were staged.The government has no moral compass, but some of its remaining supporters do. Where, exactly, is their red line? They surely did not vote for Labour expecting a refugee policy so extreme that one Reform MP offered the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, anapplication formto switch parties. Nor did they imaginetheir vote would helpproduce an immigration stance applauded by Tommy Robinson.No wonder Reform spots a potential recruit in Mahmood. She’s willing to spout the most deceitful claims about vulnerable people. “We have become the destination of choice in Europe,”she claims, “clearly visible to every people smuggler and would-be illegal migrant across the world.”This is false. There were more thantwice as manyasylum claims in Germany last year, and about 1.5 times as many in Italy, Spain and France. Detected irregular arrivals aresignificantly higherinall of these countriesexcepting France, which does not publish figures.Adjust for population, and the UK sits 17th on the table of its former EU partners for asylum applications. The UK offers no “golden ticket” for asylum seekers, as Mahmood claims. The home secretary decries how “divisive asylum has become in our country” when it’s the sorts of myths and deceit that she’s peddling that are fuelling the fury.What noble cause can Labour’s remaining loyalists believe these fabrications serve? Under the government’s plans, refugees willspend two decades in limbobefore even being allowed to apply for permanent status, leaving them unable to set down roots. This answers pleas for integration how, exactly? Indeed, with refugee status now temporary, people embedded in communities for years will be uprooted, and children who have known no home but Britain could find themselves deported to countries they have never set foot in. When the former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, asked for an assurance that no child would be placed in detention under the policy, Mahmood declined. “Vote Labour to throw screaming children in the back of vans” might never have graced a campaign leaflet, but at least it would have been honest.Our rulers also plan tosteal the “assets”of asylum seekers to pay for accommodation. Originally, the government briefed that this could include jewellery. No politician believes any meaningful revenue will be raised this way. This has been proposed merely to appeal to the most sadistic impulses.These last few years, politicians of all stripes have crassly exploited identity politics to justify imposing more misery on those who are already suffering.Mahmood’s allies briefthat her background as the child of migrant parents leaves her with “an authentic outrage over illegal migration”. Why, then, as a backbencher just a few years ago, did she support “a general amnesty for all people so they can regularise their status and start playing a full part in British society”? She spoke then of “undocumented workers”, not “illegal immigrants”. When did this “authentic outrage” arising from her heritage bloom, exactly?Keir Starmer – her boss, for now –pledged to back free movementwhen he campaigned to become leader,denounced the “hostile environment”for migrants, and reprimanded his party for being “a bit scared of making the positive case for immigration for quite a number of years.” What these people genuinely believe is anyone’s guess; it is unclear whether they themselves know. Here is a government with no moral anchor, no guiding purpose, no overarching vision. It is a government in power for its own sake.Successful governments shape the political culture of their nation, as Margaret Thatcher’s, regrettably, did. A Labour administration is supposed to drive the country in a vaguely progressive direction. Having taken the scalpel to the winter fuel payment and disability benefits, Labour is now constructing one of Europe’s harshest asylum systems. It clearly presumed its previous callousness would buy it respect: it did the opposite, and this will have the same result. Across Europe, mainstream parties that raided the rhetoric and policies of anti-migrant parties succeeded only in legitimising them, and Labour has alreadycatapulted Reform to the top spot.Denmark is cited as the exception; there, the Social Democrats maintained the cruelanti-refugee policiesof their predecessors. Leaving aside that this is a tiny Nordic country with a different political system, the Social Democrats secured support by committing to theexpansion of the welfare state: the exact opposite of British Labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Becoming an AI detective is a job I never wanted and wish I could quit.By now, the problems with generative AI are well documented: it’s built upontheft of people’s creative labour; it’saccelerating environmental degradation; it’sclaiming productivity gains but actually producing the opposite; itrelies upon exploited workers; itsbiggest champions are socially reprehensible losers; and so on. In my online circles, it’s also deeply uncool – using generative AI to make silly little videos signals you either don’t understand its consequences or you’re too much of an arsehole to care. Every AI-generated video that crosses my feed is a stand-in for the horrors associated with the technology and its politics.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreBut aside from these very important critiques, it’s also just downright irritating. Who wants to use so much energy playing synthetic media Sherlock Holmes?I consider myself to be relatively tech-savvy, which probably lured me into a false sense of security that AI content would always be obvious to me. This is becoming less true, thanks to many video-generation models becoming more sophisticated and producing content with fewer immediately obvious red flags. Combine this with the sheer volume of AI-generated material and the context we see it in – on platforms where the whole point is to move from one video to the next very quickly. You barely have time to do a reality check before moving on. Consuming an algorithmically curated social media feed feels like drowning in a soup of slop. Whatever croutons of reality you might come by are only there to keep you drowning, sorry, scrolling, for longer.And here’s the sick joke of it all: the more you linger on a video to discern if it’s AI-generated, the more of its kind you’ll see. Perhaps you watch it a few times, trying to spot the classic AI body horror. Maybe you’re annoyed enough to leave a comment. Perhaps you share it with a friend like: “Thanks, I hate it!!” All of these are signals that screammore! more! more!to the algorithm. And so we’re trapped in a nightmare in which even the act of hating AI-generated content only serves to fuel it.Platforms aren’t interested in stopping the onslaught of AI spam. Rather, they’re embracing itAll of this makes me feel like an unwilling traveller through a hellish hyperreality – a concept theorised by Jean Baudrillarddecades before generative AI took off. Would Baudrillard feel vindicated or repulsed by Sora 2? (You can ask ChatGPT.) But aside from waxing lyrical about poststructuralist theory and the collapse between reality and simulation, I didn’t anticipate all of this to be justso annoying.In some perverse way, it makes sense why people might choose to create adeepfakeof a politician saying something outrageous, or generate sexually explicit material depicting someone without their consent. I don’t like it or support it, but the intent is pretty easily discernible (a political agenda, straight-up misogyny). Those kinds of videos are bad in an obvious, illegal or violent way.But I also find the inane content particularly unsettling. Why bother making an AI video of a pickle in a car chase? Well, there’s money to be made. Insipid and puerile AI content created for the express purpose of going viral to turn a profit is a disturbing reflection of the absurdity of late-stage capitalism. When it comes to social media success, reality becomes a hindrance to revenue.JournalistJason Koebler arguesthis content isn’t actually designed for humans, its intended audience are the algorithms. The content of the AI slop is irrelevant – it doesn’t matter whether it’s high or low quality, political or mundane, in touch with reality or complete delusion. What matters is the ability to churn outa lotof it, spam the platform, find what gets engagement, rinse and repeat all the way to the bank.Cute fluffy characters and Egyptian selfies: Meta launches AI feed VibesRead moreAs always, it’s important to remember this is happening because the world’s most powerful companies and their billionaire leaders decided that mass adoption of generative AI is good for business. Platforms aren’t interested in stopping the onslaught of AI spam. Rather, they’re embracing it, incentivising it andbuilding tools to enable it. It doesn’t matter howpeople use it or for what purpose. It doesn’t matter if people like it. And because the platforms benefit, there’s no indication it will relent any time soon.Maybe I’m being stubborn in my desire to grasp on to reality; maybe I’m deluding myself that such a thing is possible. But it still matters to me if what I am seeing is real or not. Maybe it matters to you, too. So for now, we have to begrudgingly hold on to our magnifying glass and digital deerstalker hat.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights advocate and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

If you want to achieve that sort of brand name recognition, there are a few tried-and-tested ways to do so. You can spend years working your way up the ranks until you’re a power-broker like Nancy Pelosi. You can burst on to the scene anddramatically unseatan incumbent like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did. Or you can go the Marjorie Taylor Greene route and achieve notoriety by being utterly unhinged.Since becoming a congresswoman for Georgia in 2021, Greene has kept herself in the news by spoutingconspiracy theories,fighting with colleagues, and being one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders. Inrecent months,however, something strange has been happening. Greene has continued to generate headlines, but largely because she has turned on her party and is part of a growing Maga civil war. Greene was the first Republican lawmaker, for example, to say that there is agenocide in Gazaand has been one of theloudest voicesdemanding that the Epstein files be released. She has also criticised the Maga movement for not focusing on affordability or puttingAmerica first. Now, things have escalated to the point where Greene is making Trump see red; the pair are in a full-blown feud.On Friday the president, who stood by Greene when she voiced conspiracy theories aboutschool shootingsand claimed that wildfires were startedby space lasers,announcedon Truth Social that he was finally withdrawing his endorsement of the congresswoman. “All I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” he complained. Adding: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”Greene, meanwhile, has said that Trump’s comments are “hurtful” but she still supports his administration andhopes they “make up”. She has also said she believes that his comments have fuelled threats against her safety. When asked on Sunday about these threats,Trump said:“I don’t think her life is in danger … I don’t think anybody cares about her.”But that last bit isn’t quite true. If Greene learned anything from her apprenticeship with Trump, it’s how to generate media coverage. The congresswoman’s face is everywhere. And while she may no longer be buddies with the president, she is building bridges with former foes. On Sunday, for example, she appeared on CNN’s State of the Union and apologised for her role in“toxic politics”. And earlier this month, she went on the high-profile talkshow The View and criticised her party for not having ahealth care plan. “You are a very different person than I thought you were,” the presenter, Sunny Hostin, said.SoisGreene a different person? I’d love it if that truly were the case; it would be heartening to believe that some of the most toxic people in US politics might be capable of introspection and change. Alas, I don’t think this is some sort of road to Damascus moment. Rather, as Ocasio-Cortezhas posited, this is more likely a case of sour grapes. AOC’s theory is that the Trump administration shut down Greene’s ambitions to run for Senate and she “has been on a revenge tour ever since”. Greene said at the time that she didn’t believe she could make a difference as a senator and wanted to continue to serve her congressional district.She’s not alone in her revenge tour. The Republican congressman Thomas Massie, who along with the Democrat Ro Khanna is leading abipartisan pushto release the Epstein files, has also beentrading barbswith the president. In a dramatic U-turn, Trump has now had to concede defeat on the files, declaring on Sunday that he’s happy to have a vote on the issue, as“we have nothing to hide”.Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s had ‘warnings for my safety’ after posts by TrumpRead moreTrump has bounced back from scandals that would have buried most people. He is, let’s not forget, the first convicted criminal elected to the presidency. But it’s not just the Epstein files and traitorous deputies that he’s battling at the moment. According to a recentNBC News poll, 63% of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said that Trump has fallen short of their expectations on the economy. The president has been building ballrooms and blowing up boats instead of lowering the price of bread. While his base is still loyal, hisapproval ratings are eroding. Whatever Greene’s motives, her political instincts are sharp: there’s a real opportunity now to turn the Republican party against Trump. May the revenge tour roll on. Perhaps, with all this infighting, Greene will turn the electoral map blue.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female LeadDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Are its robots just too fancy?Nils PratleyDelivery company struggling to convince US chain Kroger, its most important customer, of the virtues of automationTue 18 Nov 2025 14.05 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 15.29 ESTShareThat’s quite a stock market journey: from 180pat listing 15 years agoto the mighty heights of £29 during the locked-down Covid year of 2020 and now – oh dear – all the way back down to 180p. Welcome to Ocado, which looked like the future of grocery retailing once upon a time but now seems to be struggling to convince its most important customer of the virtues of robots and automation.There is no positive gloss to put on news that Kroger, the US supermarket chain,is closing three of its eight warehousesthat use Ocado’s technology. Kroger was the client thatput a rocket under the UK group’s share pricein the first place in 2018 by signing a partnership deal. If Ocado could prove the worth of its kit in the world’s largest consumer market, went the bulls’ argument, valuation doubts would disappear.In the event, the strain in the relationship has been showing for a while. But, when it came on Tuesday, the result of the US company’s review of its e-commerce operations was worse than feared from Ocado’s point of view. It wasn’t just the three closures, but also Kroger’s positive words about expanding its use of alternative delivery merchants – the likes of DoorDash, Instacart and Uber Eats.Therein lies the great philosophical divide in the world of online groceries. Ocado’s model is capital intensive and requires heavy investment in automated warehouses, state-of-the-art robots and refrigerated vans. The other setup is cheap, cheerful and, at its crudest, involves picking the goods off the shelves in a regular store and getting them to the punters as fast as possible via people on bikes.In truth, there’s room for both approaches and others in between – but the debate has always been about how much room for each model. The crushing aspect of Kroger’s analysis is that it seems to be saying that Ocado’s high-spec formula works only in “higher-density” locations. Even then, it added it will be “monitoring the remaining facilities’ performance”. It is all a very long way from the original Kroger/Ocado vision of building 20 warehouses in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only small consolation is that Ocado gets $250m (£190m) in compensation for the early closures. Sadly, a full-throated endorsement from Kroger would have been worth far more.Back in 2020, when the pandemic forced everyone to log on, Ocado co-founder and chief executive Tim Steiner crowed that “a dramatic and permanent shift towards online grocery shopping” was taking place. It sounded hubristic when he said it – and the prediction has not improved with time.The UK operation, now a joint venture with Marks & Spencer, remains the fastest-growing grocery format on the home front. The customers love it. But the investment story for the shareholders – and the reason why the ultra-patient core group has remained loyal through the long loss-making years – has been about turning Ocado into a technology company. The eventual prize would be annuity-like revenues from licensing the proprietary technology to supermarkets around the globe.Ocado has other overseas customers, but Kroger was the most important in the expansionary story. The closure of warehouses in Maryland, Wisconsin and Florida on financial grounds is “a smelling salt moment” for the group, argued arch-Ocado bear Clive Black of Shore Capital.It’s hard to disagree. Steiner needs to address the burning question: is Ocado’s engineering so good and so state-of-the-art that it’s too expensive for mass adoption?Explore more on these topicsOcadoNils Pratley on financeRobotsRetail industrySupermarketscommentShareReuse this content"

Are we surprised that aLabourhome secretary would want to remove any prospect of permanent citizenship for all refugees, thereby ending Britain’s standing as a place of sanctuary? Petty, vindictive, counterproductive, narrow-minded, yes, but you could hardly call this surprising.Asylum seekers’ jewellery could be seized to pay for processing costs, says Home Office ministerRead moreBut, finally, a policy arrived that was so out of the normal run of things that I assumed it was a joke – a piece of satire, floated on X by some member of the wokerati, to make Shabana Mahmood sound truly heinous. Apparently,she wanted to seize the jewelleryand other valuables to pay for their accommodation.Deploying exaggeration to underscore how much like a cartoon villain a politician sounds is a little bit sixth form and so far hasn’t been effective. And yet it couldn’t possibly be real, right? Because it sounds like a cartoon villain.Except this is a real idea, borrowed fromDenmark’s similar provision in 2016. There was a lot of head-scratching about its compatibility with EU law at the time, but Denmark had opted out of the Common European Asylum System anyway, so that was all a bit abstract. The more trenchant critique came from the Danish police union which, though couched in the neutral terms of pragmatism, boiled down to (I paraphrase): “You seriously want us to find the most beleaguered people in the country and take away their jewels?”It may have been that lack of institutional buy-in that undermined the policy in Denmark, because six years later, in 2022, the law had been used only17 times in six years. Or it may have only ever been symbolic in the first place, like Theresa May’s “go home or face arrest” vans. For all the talk about them,there were only ever two of them; one to please the Daily Mail, the other so that they could describe them in the plural. There would have been something so pathetic about having to tell parliament about your racist “van”.In other words, it turns out the policy is a joke, in the sense that it is deeply unserious. But it’s not funny.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A Friday night news alert came through on my phone: “CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi’s assassination.” I collapsed into my couch, repeating the words.I am not Muslim. But Jamal, in life and death, has taught me a lot about faith and looking for hope in all the wrong places. As a writer with a history of criticizing America’s meddling in weaker countries, in normal circumstances, I should have been loath to celebrate the CIA.But given that, a month before, a group of Saudi hitmen not only kidnapped my friend and writer from a consulate in Istanbul but allegedly cut his body into pieces, I might have been forgiven for looking for any hope that the Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, would face consequences – cutting off leaders who think nothing of cutting up human beings should be a basic tenet of any healthy country’s foreign policy. (Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement or responsibility for Khashoggi’s killing.)This week, seven years almost to the day since the CIA announced the crown prince’s responsibility in the murder, Mohammed bin Salman returns to Washington, invited for an offical visit by America’s Temu pharaoh, Donald Trump. The reconciliation between Trump and MBS was perhaps inevitable, given that even before the first Trump presidency, Trump spoke often of his love for the Saudis and their wealth. (“I get along great with all of them; they buy apartments from me. They spend $40m, $50m,” he quipped in 2015. “Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much!”)In 2016Saudi Arabiabanned Jamal Khashoggi, a longtime editor, journalist and royal adviser from writing. His crime? He published an op-ed warning about the rise of Trump in 2016. He remained silent for a year, until Prince Mohammed unleashed a crackdown on businessmen, writers, and mild critics – imprisoning many of them. Jamal fled to the US in self-exile.In September 2017, while I was the editor of the Washington Post’s global opinion section, I asked Jamal to write for us. He published “Saudi Arabia was not always this repressive, but now it’s unbearable”, breaking his year-long silence. I hired him to continue to write for the Washington Post.A year later, Saudi Arabia had Jamal killed. In the aftermath of Jamal’s murder,Trump administrationofficials worked overtime to launder Saudi Arabia’s blood-stained image. Jared Kushner was advising Prince Mohammed on how to “weather the storm”. Last year, Kushner’s equity firm received $2bn from Saudi Arabia’s private equity firm.There’s much to say about the Saudification of western cultural spaces through the sheer sums of money the kingdom is so obviously throwing into what it sees as soft power. Writers and observers have commented for years about Saudi Arabia’s “sportswashing”, like the kingdom’s sponsorship of LIV golf tournament and the purchase of the Newcastle United soccer team.The kingdom invested heavily in tourism campaigns for Saudi Arabia, paying online influencers hefty sums to post pictures of their heavily curated trips to the country.Jamal warned about these hollow visions of Saudi Arabia. He warned that behind the glitz and glamour of the Saudi royal family, and promises of futuristic cities, there was poverty and discontent. He often told me how proud he was to have his words in the Washington Post, and he hoped the Post could be a model for voices like his to be heard. I still admire Jamal’s relentless optimism about media and America.In death, Jamal’s faith would prove to be misplaced. The Washington Post’s erasure of Jamal’s memory and the freedom he stood for has been brewing in the background.The global opinion section that Jamal wrote for was dismantled. The Jamal Khashoggi fellowship – which was offered to writers speaking out against authoritarian regimes – was left to fade away. Jamal used to tell me about his days as an editor chairing newspaper editorial meetings in Saudi Arabia, where editors were given marching orders from the top about the “red lines”, or what the royal regime wanted and did not want published.Today, the Washington Post opinion section is going through an increasing Saudification – imposing harsh red lines on who and what can publish. Under owner Jeff Bezos’s edict to write only about “free markets” and “personal liberties”, the Washington Post opinion section, the first major US paper to publicly impose such heavy censorship, purged nearly all its full-time voices that wrote against censorship, political violence and repression at home and abroad, myself included.To date, the Washington Post editorial board has not mentioned Jamal’s name ahead of Prince Mohammed’s visit. The Saudification of the mainstream news media means that other US media outlets and institutions are bending the knee to Trump, agreeing to multimillion-dollar shakedowns in exchange for eliminating diversity. He has sued outlets he claims were not fair to him. He has begun attempting to prosecute his political rivals. Pro-Saudi voices would argue that moralizing about chopped-up journalists does us no good, shouldn’t get in the way of the US-Saudi partnership, that there is too much money at stake, and that in order for the west’s colonial management of the Middle East, we need our friends in Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. They are effectively asking Americans to believe that America and Saudi Arabia will make the world a better place, together.This narrative only helps the billionaires and the deal brokers. The average American gains next to nothing from these elite arrangements. Rather, Jamal’s plight and murder was a warning sign for America, of the impending loss of freedom and censorship that would sweep the country.Karen Attiah is a writer and educator whose work focuses on race, global culture and human rightsExplore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaOpinionTrump administrationMohammed bin SalmanUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

And it is as brutal as ever. In barely six weeks, more than $1.2tn has evaporated from cryptocurrencies’ market capitalisation. The sell-off has sent bitcoin back to levels last seen in April. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly fell below $90,000 this week, shedding almost a third of its value since its October peak.The key to understanding crypto is that it has no “value” in any economic sense. It generates no income, commands no productive capacity and pays no dividends. Unlike state money, it is not backed by a tax base or a fiscal authority. What props up its price is not cashflow but expectation: the hope that someone else will validate today’s valuation tomorrow. When sentiment turns sour or people pull their money out, there is nothing to break cryptocurrencies’ fall. Prices don’t correct, they collapse. In 2023, MPsrightlysaid that cryptocurrency trading in the UK should be regulated as a form of gambling – a demandrejectedby the then Tory government.The volatility of cryptocurrencies is not accidental but structural. The Financial Timesreportedthat investors pulled out of crypto because there was a shunning worldwide of speculative assets amid concerns about sky-high AI valuations and the path of US interest rates. But while the crash is global, Britain is uniquely vulnerable to its fallout. No other large economy has so thoroughly hollowed out socialmobilitywhile selling to its young the myth ofentrepreneurialescape. No surprise then thatBritonsare more likely to have bought into crypto than their European counterparts.Regulatorswarn that too many young people in Britain are turning to crypto, oftenborrowingto do so because they want to “win big”. The UK has become, in effect, a one-shot society – a place where stagnant wages and unaffordablehousingleave millions clutching at any chance, however illusory, to escape. The US rapper Eminem captured this mentality in his hitLose Yourself, which begins: “Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted … would you capture it?” For a generation locked out of asset ownership, crypto ismarketedas that “one moment”.It is in may ways the clearest symbol of an economic system running out of road: a promise of freedom built on an asset class whose standing depends on decisions made in Washington. Cryptocurrencies rise and fall with theNasdaq; the dollar system is their unseenplumbing; and their values aredeterminedby theWhite House. But the current crisis has been viewed as an opportunity by the political right. They sell crypto to the masses as rebellious empowerment.Having once dismissed bitcoin as “based on thin air”, Donald Trump now revels in his role as “crypto president”. Under Mr Trump, crypto has become a machinery of patronage, deregulation andself-enrichmentthat is unprecedented in modern US politics. Joe Biden’s attempts toregulatecrypto businesses – which have provided routes forfraudand moneylaundering– have been eviscerated.Those on the right of politics who want to be supplicants to Trumpian power, whether that is Argentina’sJavier Mileior Britain’sNigel Farage, now embrace crypto aggressively. It lets them pose as the insurgent alternative to a “rigged” system – accepting donations in anonymous digital payments to prove the point – while sucking up to Mr Trump. Crypto is not the end ofpolitics in money. It resembles nothing less than the latest way for the powerful to profit from the powerless.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Apart from food and water, shelter is the most basic human need and relevant to almost everyone all the time – unlike, say, healthcare, which most people do not use on a daily basis.A rebalancing of the lawtowards renters and away from landlords, which the government has done in its Renters’ Rights Act, was sorely needed. Failures and abuses of power have been ignored for too long.With no-fault evictions outlawed from next May, and tougher oversight from a new ombudsman to follow, life should be about to get better for England’s 4.6m households in the private rental sector. But will it?Troubling analysisby the Guardian shows that two-thirds of councils in England have not prosecuted a single landlord in the past three years, while nearly half didn’t issue any fines either. Over the same period, fewer than 2% of complaints led to enforcement of any kind. Just 16 landlords were banned from letting homes – a shockingly low number, given the volume of complaints and what has been revealed about the sector by the worstscandals.The hope is that this seemingly lackadaisical approach is going to be replaced with something far more proactive. The introduction of amandatory decent homes standardfor private rentals – to match that in the socially rented sector – is being consulted on, and remains a dismayingly long way off. But from next year, councils will be legally required to report on their enforcement activity. A new landlords’ register should be a useful tool, giving local authorities and other interested parties clearer oversight of what is going on in their areas. Most importantly, section 21 evictions – which require no justification other than that the landlord wants their property vacated – are being banned.Yet the data from the past three years gives cause for concern. Currently, the number of landlords being held to account is tiny. If this is to change, councils will need resources. New rules and tools are of limited use if there is no one to use them. Recent history is rich with examples of harms caused not by inadequate legislation but poor enforcement.The appalling recordof the water industry in relation to pollution is a prime example. Some of the failures that led to thecatastrophic fire in Grenfell Tower– which was managed by a social landlord – are another.Ministers have pledged “burdens funding” to enable local authorities to carry out their new duties. But environmental health departments, which were cut back massively under austerity, cannot be built back up overnight. Councils are under huge pressure, withup to 70 facing the risk of bankruptcydue in part to overspent special educational needs budgets. Ministers need to explain how the enforcement of renters’ rights will be funded. Provision must be made for staff training and recruitment.Legal proceedings are time-consuming and expensive. Most complaints from tenants do not need to end up before judges. The new housing ombudsman is meant to provide a mediation service. But if the new law is to raise standards and improve lives, as ministers claim, there must be mechanisms that compel landlords to follow rules. This is the least that the millions of renters priced out of home ownership, and lacking the option of a socially rented home, deserve.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She had been sacked by the Nazis in 1942 for helping her Jewish friends, and then fell foul of the Soviets in 1946 for helping friends deemed to be “class enemies”.After retraining, she became a health visitor, later lecturing in health visiting at the Polytechnic of North London. She was immensely proud of her British citizenship gained in 1955, but her underlying sense of insecurity was profound. Suffering from dementia, she was admitted to hospital in 2001 after a heart attack and became very agitated and upset. “I am a British citizen,” she cried. “You have no right to detain me. I have a British passport!” Nothing I or the doctor said could reassure her.That asylum seekers today, even those with skills that can benefit our society, will have to live with uncertainty and the constant fear of deportation for 20 years appals me. That a Labour government also proposes weakening our commitment to the European convention on human rights beggars belief. No wonderTommy Robinson was so triumphanton X. Has any thought been given to the impact on foreign residents in the UK who will feel their existing status will inevitably come under threat, as Reform UK has already suggested, and take their much-needed skills elsewhere?I doubt Reform UK’s potential or present supporters will be persuaded to vote Labour by this craven capitulation to racist rhetoric, but I’m 100% certain that it will drive lifelong Labour supporters like me to find another home for our votes.Tessa ByarsCambridgeI was heartened to read Stella Creasy’s piece (ICE-style raids on Britain’s streets: that’s all Labour’s brutal asylum reforms will achieve, 17 November). The obfuscating and intentional doublespeak swirling around the emotive cauldron ingredients of “immigration”, “illegal immigration” and “small boats” has been intentionally leveraged into mainstream political and media jargon by Reform UK, big tech algorithms, and thence into the baying mob. That the government is cowing to this, at best, semi-manufactured “public opinion” is deeply worrying. Added to this, the state’s stripping of immigrants’ jewellery to pay for processing their applications has the whiff of something deeply unsettling. What next: spectacles, boots, hair?In 2024, around30% of the nursing staffand more than a third of doctors working in the NHS were non-UK nationals. To see this in action, I would point any reader to the Netflix documentary series Critical: Between Life and Death, which follows life in London’s main trauma hospitals. We are daily enriched by, and should feel deeply indebted to, the many people of colour in this and other sectors of our society.Quentin CowenLaxfield, SuffolkRe your editorial on Labour’s asylum plans(17 November) , I fear that the government may have succeeded in its plans to make this country less attractive to immigrants. Unfortunately, it has also made it a lot less attractive for everyone else as well. The great enshittification proceeds apace.Helen HaddonMilton KeynesThe good news is that the government has finally decided to introduce a wealth tax. The bad news is that it only applies to asylum seekers (Asylum seekers’ jewellery could be seized to pay for processing costs, says Home Office minister, 17 November).Martin StottOxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But she also places the responsibility on all of us. She wants the culture sector to make a better case. But can it?As commissioner for culture in the last government, I remain surprised that large funding decisions directed at culture have been forgotten, devalued and ignored, perhaps because the sources were then from a Conservative government.During Covid, culture was the only economic sector to receive its own rapid, specially designed, comprehensive rescue package. The £2bn culture recovery fund took care of more than 5,000 organisations around the country. Many large regional funds, such as those for levelling up, towns and borderlands, directed billions into culture-led projects. Aviva Studios in Manchester, Bristol Beacon, V&A East, Shakespeare North in Prescot, Wentworth Woodhouse in Rotherham and the incipient Eden Project in Morecambe are just a few examples – all hugely ambitious culture and heritage projects funded by the government, working closely with local authorities.Film tax reliefs are vital to encourage inward international investment. But when Rishi Sunak ensured tax credits were also extended to theatre, museums and orchestras, where was the welcome?When the Arts Council announced its (increased)funding roundin 2022, there was ferocious negative attention directed on the few organisations that were unsuccessful in their bids and no focus at all on the 275 organisations funded for the very first time all over the country.Follow the money. These were very large chunks of funding directed to the culture sector. Privately, some culture leaders were thrilled, but it was a gratitude that had to be hidden. The majority of recipients were silent because the Conservative narrative doesn’t fit their worldview. Of course, there’s much more that can be done. But if the culture sector won’t recognise and welcome attention from politicians of all parties and the hard graft of officials when it lands, they can’t expect politicians to stay the course – they must follow their voters.Neil MendozaConservative, House of Lords; commissioner for culture,Department for Culture, Media and Sport, 2020-2023Explore more on these topicsArts fundingArts Council EnglandConservativesV&ACoronaviruslettersShareReuse this content"

Ask the striking workers at the British Library, 11 November). For decades, libraries all round Britain have suffered successive cuts, which have meant many have closed or are run by volunteers.Librarians do not have a single high-profile trade union looking out for their pay and working conditions. So, unlike teachers, for example, they are unable to exert pressure to be paid on a similar level, given that the professional qualifications required are equally rigorous, and in some institutions exceed those of other professionals.It’s time to value all library workers and reinstate good, well-stocked libraries as envisaged by our Victorian predecessors, who saw libraries as vital to the education and cultural life of this country.Jane GhoshRetired librarian, BristolI’ve been a reader at theBritish Librarysince 1984 and recently renewed my pass for another three years. Zadie Smith is spot-on that the recent strike of library workers over low pay also points to a wider lack of respect for those who work hard to keep one of the country’s great cultural resources going. It points to a country that not only has a market economy but a market society, where things that don’t make a profit are not valued. Still, perhaps the local MP can help. His  name?

They showed that tonight. I couldn’t be happier for my players. It’s fantastic. It’s going to be good and it’s going to be a good Christmas in the Clarke household, I promise you.”Clarke explained the seeds of Scotland’s World Cup return were sewn when losing a playoff against Ukraine for the 2022 tournament. “I told them to remember how we felt after Ukraine and to bottle that feeling,” Clarke said. “I remember at the time when I spoke to them, I said: ‘You have to remember how bad you feel and make sure that next time you get to that stage’ – and I knew they would get to that stage again because they’re good – ‘you get over the line.’“They don’t want to be successful just for themselves. They want to share that success with the country.”Reflecting on the nature of Scotland’s goals, Clarke smiled: “Scott McTominay scored the best overhead kick I’ve ever seen and it might not have been the best goal of the night. When Kenny hit it, I thought: ‘What are you doing?’, but when I saw it in flight I thought: ‘That’s going to go in!’”Andy Robertson, the captain, said: “That just sums up this squad. Never say die, we just keep going right to the end. One of the craziest games of football. We’ve certainly put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it – we’re going to the World Cup and I can’t believe it.

The performance and result understandably left Craig Bellamy reaching for superlatives.“I said to the players at the end, I am not a perfect person, I haven’t come across anyone who is,” theWaleshead coach said. “But maybe I take a little bit of that back because that was as close to a perfect performance as I’ve seen. That was incredible.” He was not exaggerating.Tierney and McLean send Scotland to World Cup with thrilling win against DenmarkRead moreWales had lost experienced leaders to injury, their entire first‑choice central midfield was missing through suspension, but those available to Bellamy stepped up to deliver a complete and clinical team display. Harry Wilson excelled as he captained his country for the first time, capping a proud night with a hat-trick. Brennan Johnson, David Brooks, Dan James and Neco Williams also showed the Premier League quality that made the difference.North Macedonia arrived in Cardiff unbeaten in the qualifying campaign and having conceded three goals in total, including in two games against group-winners Belgium. They were torn apart as Bellamy’s side leapfrogged them into second place in Group J. A more favourable playoff draw is the prize. Wales were guaranteed a playoff courtesy of winning their Nations League group but victory ensured they will have a home semi-final in March and should avoid a top-ranked opponent in Thursday’s draw.Wales’s first seven-goal haul in 47 years was reward for individual and collective excellence, but also Bellamy’s bravery. His response to a lengthy absentee list was to flood his forward line and deploy Joshua Sheehan as a lone holding midfielder. Boldness paid dividends. “We didn’t play with a forward, we had three 10s,” he said. “But they were in the position where you drag someone out and someone runs, then the wide players were connected as well. We were so clean with the ball and that allows you to have good chances. Today was one of those days where we are able to take them as well.”The hosts set a dominant, positive tone from the off. James was at the heart of proceedings and released Brooks inside the area with a beautifully weighted pass. The Bournemouth winger appeared to be clipped from behind by Andrej Stojchevski and the Dutch referee, Danny Makkelie, immediately pointed to the spot. It looked a clear penalty in real time, debatable after numerous replays. Few inside the Cardiff City Stadium cared. The penalty stood and Wilson drove the spot-kick past Stole Dimitrievski’s left hand into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenDan James steered a fine fourth goal in the second half to score his ninth goal for Wales.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesBellamy’s side maintained the intensity and doubled their lead within three minutes. Jay Dasilva released Johnson down the left and the Tottenham forward swept over a first-time cross for Brooks to steer an excellent finish beyond Dimitrievski. Brooks’s effort, into the ground and over the keeper’s grasp, took a slight deflection off Stojchevski but was a difficult attempt made to look routine.Wales were in dreamland, but brought fleetingly back down to earth when North Macedonia reduced the deficit too easily. Darko Velkovski, advancing out of central defence, stepped around Wilson and Brooks before splitting the defence with a pass into Bojan Miovski. As the striker ran through on goal, Karl Darlow slipped on a surface dampened by the Cardiff rain. Miovski’s low finish met no resistance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wales’s reaction saw to that. Wilson slipped in Williams brilliantly but the Nottingham Forest full-back’s effort was tipped on to a post by Dimitrievski. A stunning effort from Johnson restored the hosts’ two-goal advantage before the break, however. Receiving Dasilva’s pass out on the left, Johnson exploded between three white shirts to beat the visiting keeper with an angled drive into the top corner.Number four arrived courtesy of a flowing team move that started in defence and invited Brooks to run at the North Macedonian backline. He dinked a pass into Wilson, who met it with a delightful back-heel into James, and he polished his evening’s excellent work with a clinical finish.Wilson was not finished there. Having been tripped 25 yards from goal, he swept the resulting free-kick high into the goal from a difficult angle. Another superb strike. Wilson was also fouled for number six from the penalty spot, which he drove into the opposite corner to his first, before Nathan Broadhead added a late seventh when tapping in from fellow substitute Isaak Davies’s header. A repeat in the March semi-final and Wales can start dreaming of a third World Cup finals appearance.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesNorth Macedoniamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the hosts’ pressure eventually paid off when Gregoritsch saw Marcel Sabitzer’s cross sail past the Bosnian keeper before bouncing off a post and into his path for a powerful finish and his 23rd and most memorable international goal.Spainsecured their place after a nervy 2-2 draw withTurkeyin Seville, finishing unbeaten at the top of Group E despite being given a genuine scare by their resilient visitors.The European champions led through Dani Olmo in the fourth minute but Turkey, who needed an almost impossible seven-goal victory to claim the group, managed to equalise through Deniz Gul in the 42nd minute. Turkey then stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Salih Ozcan strike from the edge of the box.However, Mikel Oyarzabal levelled the match eight minutes later to avoid what would have been Spain’s first home defeat in a qualifier and Turkey had to settle for a place in the playoffs for the 2026 finals tournament.“We didn’t celebrate as euphorically as we would have liked,” Olmo told TVE. “We wanted to finish with another win and another clean sheet.

Kosovo secured second place with 11 points and a berth in the European playoffs in March, as they chase a first World Cup appearance.After a flat first half with few openings, Vargas broke the deadlock 90 seconds after the restart, slipping in behind to meet a through-ball from Djibril Sow and beating Arijanet Muric with a low finish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would also rule him out of Premier League fixtures against Chelsea and Brentford at home and Aston Villa away, as well as the Champions League match at Club Brugge on 10 December. Mikel Arteta’s side – who have a four-point lead over Manchester City – then face Wolves at home before their rearranged trip to Everton on 20 December.It would be a significant blow to Arsenal’s title challenge to lose a player who has played every minute of the Premier League campaign, especially given Gabriel’s importance to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 11 games and had kept eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions before the2-2 draw at Sunderland.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres (centre) missed Arsenal’s final two matches before the international break and is not certain to return this weekend.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PACristhian Mosquera and his fellow new signing Piero Hincapié are in the frame to replace Gabriel against Spurs. There are also concerns about whether Viktor Gyökeres will be back to lead the line, after the £64m striker missed Arsenal’s final two matches before the international break because of a hamstring injury.The Germany manager, Julian Nagelsmann, revealed on Tuesday that Kai Havertz has experienced what he described as a “minor relapse” during his recovery from a knee injury after Arteta had been hopeful that the striker could return this weekend. “But overall, he’s doing well,” Nagelsmann said. “He is expected to return towards the end of the year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 19‑year-old uncapped wing Noah Caluori has been called into the squad and could profit from ­Roebuck’s absence.All three injured players startedthe 33-19 winagainst the All Blacks on Saturday, forcing Steve Borthwick into a significant reshuffle as his side targets an 11th successive victory and a clean sweep of four November Tests for the first time since Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016.As revealed by the Guardian, Lawrence’s participation to face the Pumas was in grave doubt after he picked up a hamstring injury in the closing stages of the win on Saturday. His absence is a blow to Borthwick given how his centre partnership with Fraser Dingwall has blossomed. It is also a considerable setback for Lawrence, who battled back from a long-term achilles problem ahead of schedule after missing the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia.The contenders to replace him include Elliot Daly, who is considered available for a first appearance since breaking his arm on the Lions tour , as well as Max ­Ojomoh and Henry Slade. More ­radical options include Henry Pollock, who was named on Tuesday on a four-man shortlist for the world breakthrough player of the year award, and Ben Earl. When Lawrence was replaced in the 79th minute against the All Blacks, Pollock moved to the backline.View image in fullscreenOllie Lawrence, pictured scoring England’s first try in the win against New Zealand, will miss the Argentina game on Sunday.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGeorge also has a hamstring injury and, though he endured lineout problems against New Zealand, the former captain’s experience will be sorely missed. Borthwick preferred to use Luke Cowan-Dickie as part of the “Pom Squad” against the All Blacks but could now hand the Sale hooker a start, while Theo Dan and the recalled Jamie Blamire will compete to take George’s place in the matchday 23.Roebuck misses out with a foot injury, as was the case against Fiji this month. The 24-year-old battled back to take his place against New Zealand and again impressed on the right wing, scoring the late try that put England out of sight. With Tommy Freeman also absent Borthwick’s wing options are suddenly depleted but Henry Arundell, who came off the bench against Fiji to score a stunning try, is in the frame, as is the versatile Daly.Alternatively, Borthwick may give a debut to the 6ft 4in Caluori, who has earned rave reviews for his aerial ability and scored five tries on his first Prem start for Saracens last month. He was also on the scoresheet for England A in their 29‑25 win against Spain at the ­weekend. Before the start of the autumn campaign, Borthwick said: “I think he could certainly feature this autumn. He has been on the radar for a considerable period of time.”The head coach has also talked up the idea of deploying Pollock out of position. “We’ve been looking at Henry Pollock on the wing,” said Borthwick, who has also added Charlie Ewels to the squad in place of Ollie Chessum, who is still out after missing the All Blacks game with a foot injury. “[Henry’s] pace is the match of a lot of wingers. That kind of versatility is really important to us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The jury is outThere is logic to the fresh international format, due to launch next year, but glaring issues and logistical challenges tooRobert KitsonTue 18 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.51 ESTShareOK, let’s just pick the ball up and run with it for a little while. A reimagined global Test landscape pitching the northern hemisphere against the south commencing next July. Twelve men’s national sides playing six games each with a final playoff weekend. Concluding with one champion team hoisting a shiny trophy aloft in front of, hopefully, a worldwide television audience of millions.On paper – and years of scribbling on the backs of envelopes have gone into this – there is some logic to it. Instead of seemingly random Tests scattered like distant dots on someone else’s map there is at least a discernible framework. Every game will, in theory, resonate. And, by virtue of pooling everybody’s TV rights, there are hopes of a collective commercial and promotional upside that can benefit the whole sport.England keep sights on rugby’s Everest in relentless climb to game’s summit | Robert KitsonRead moreEr, how long can we keep this feelgood momentum going? At first glance the new “finals weekend” in London on 27-29 November looks intriguing. Let’s imagine it was taking place this autumn with South Africa set to face up-and-coming England in a winner-takes-all finale. Would you tune in as a neutral? On the face of it there is a decent chance you would.But hang on. What’s that approaching noise? Sadly, it’s the sound of several sizeable “buts”. Because the more you start digging into the precise details, hidden costs and crazier aspects of the new Nations Championship concept, the more you start to think that sticking with the imperfect old touring model would have been significantly simpler.Take the competing nations for starters. You would assume – wouldn’t you? – that the top dozen teams would have been picked on merit. Instead we have Wales sitting around the table while Georgia, one place above them in the World Rugby rankings, are not. OK, but surely promotion and relegation will swiftly iron out that kind of injustice? Sorry, what’s that? There is talk of promotion and relegation but not quite yet? And not yet a concrete date for its introduction? Hmm.Then there are the obvious geographical oddities. Japan are classified as a “southern hemisphere” team despite being 4,000km north of the equator. And what’s this? Fiji are to play England in South Africa next July. So all that marketing blurb about home and away games is not quite what it seems. And England still won’t be sighted in Suva any time soon.So much for the old-school touring rhythms. Instead we have a series of hasty, logistically complicated business trips. England are slated to play the Springboks in Johannesburg and the Pumas in Buenos Aires next July but will sample fewer of the rich natural wonders of Africa and South America than if they visited London Zoo.And talking of elephants etc, there is also no avoiding the even bigger issue in the corner of the dressing room. Anointing a Nations Championship winner every two years might sound desirable in the era of shorter attention spans but what about the knock-on effects for the supposedly pre-eminent World Cup? Some will say it is similar to the world championships and Olympic Games in athletics but the last thing rugby union’s battered finances need is any dilution of the World Cup as its commercial pinnacle.We haven’t even yet touched on the long-term environmental message that will be sent by requiring the world’s leading rugby stars to spend even more time on long-haul flights. Nor the potential performance and player welfare implications of fronting up on different continents on successive weekends in wildly fluctuating conditions. International coaches with whom I’ve discussed the format are not exactly punching the air with delight.View image in fullscreenEngland players prepare to board a plane to Tokyo for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The Nations Championship will mean a lot of flying.Photograph: Steve Parsons/PAThere is also the potential impact on attendances in, say, Wales, if people are suddenly being charged top whack for what is now essentially a dead rubber rather than something with its own unique time-honoured flavour. And that’s even before the finals weekend disappears off to places where barely anyone locally gives a stuff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What will neutral venues and casual fans do for the crackle of expectancy that, for example, pervaded south-west London before the All Blacks’ visit on Saturday? And whose bright idea was it to launch this bold new venture at precisely the moment Fifa’s football World Cup will be rising to the boil next July?In short, will it really be a gamechanger? As theBritish & Irish Lions underlined in Australiathere is an unbeatable ebb and flow to a best-of-three series between two well-matched sides. You just don’t get the same richness of narrative at Test level or the same prolonged competitive edge, unless you strike very lucky with your grand final.Admittedly cricket was blessed this year with an absorbing final betweenAustralia and South Africa at Lord’s. But what if it had rained throughout. And let’s not lose sight of the wider picture. If someone had seriously proposed an itinerary requiring England to play a single Ashes Test in Perth this week before heading away to New Zealand and then the West Indies for further one-off Tests in subsequent weeks they would have been laughed out of the pub.Some hugely successful initiatives, in fairness, have ended up wrongfooting the initially sceptical majority. We also continue to await details of the venues and kick-off times, let alone a title sponsor, the points system or the finer print of the second-tier Nations Cup.

Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreEarpsannounced her retirementfrom international football shortly before last summer’s Euros in Switzerland, after Wiegman made Hampton the starting goalkeeper in place of England’s first-choice at the 2022 Euros and the 2023 World Cup. Hampton’s distribution is widely viewed as hugely important to the way England want to play.Earps accused Wiegman in her autobiography of “rewarding bad behaviour” by bringing Hampton back into the fold, then giving her opportunities, after she had been dropped by Aston Villa and Englandfor poor attitude and behaviourin 2022.“We had a very good goalkeeper unit and the two goalkeepers were competing for the No 1 spot,” Wiegman said. “We kept communicating and we tried to support everyone in the best possible way. I can’t control how it comes across and there’s always learnings, but I don’t think, looking at the bigger picture, I would have done things differently.“My reality and someone else’s reality can be different because how you experience things is very individual. I just know what I want to do is create an environment where we speak up, where I give clarity, where I always communicate with players when it’s necessary, and also, I make decisions to win.”View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton with her Yashin Trophy award for best women’s goalkeeper, and Sarina Wiegman with her Johan Cruyff Trophy for best Women’s coach in Paris in September.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesHampton shone at the Euros in Switzerland,helping England triumph on penaltiesin their quarter-final against Sweden andin the final against Spain, where she saved spot-kicks from Aitana Bonmatí and Mariona Caldentey.Wiegman would not be drawn on conversations she had with players. Earpsdetailed in her bookan exchange with Wiegman in a St George’s Park meeting room in which she accused the coach of previously not having been entirely “direct and honest” regarding the picture with Hampton.“I always keep conversations private,” Wiegman said. “I’ll keep that private because that builds trust … When they feel that things stay with me, they know the door is always open and will come in and keep sharing things. That really helps on and off the pitch and helps to connect people.“So, that’s my approach. We create an environment where we want people to be themselves. Everyone’s different and that’s nice too, because you want to get to know each other. What you’re trying to do is to know the person so well that you know how to support them in the best way, but also in moments challenge them if necessary.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An event last weekend suggests otherwiseTue 18 Nov 2025 07.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.04 ESTShareIt was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.Etan ThomasI listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.The fear was that they’d use the spray on Black and Brown students without hesitation, at the slightest perceived sign of trouble.Syracuse’s campus newspaper, the Daily Orange, printed a photo of myself and Roland Williams, who would go on to play in the NFL, standing at the rally alongside the sista with the megaphone. A few days after the protest, Kathy found me on the quad to thank me for lending my visibility and privilege as a basketball player to their cause. She said she seriously doubted the police would ever pepper spray one of us.She talked about how the university treated athletes as if we were different – valued and welcomed – while other Black and Brown students were made to feel like trespassers, constantly asked to show ID just to prove they belonged. (This was Rudolph Giuliani and Eric Adams’s stop and frisk before it was called that, but I digress).The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead moreThose memories came back to me on Saturday whena Texas state trooper was “sent home”after a run-in with South Carolina player Nyck Harbor during a game. Harbor, as a star athlete, was among the group of people that Kathy lumped into a protected class of Black people when we spoke all those years ago in Syracuse.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueA quick recap of what happened on Saturday.ESPN’s broadcast showedthe trooper appear to intentionally barge Harbor and his teammate Oscar Hadaway III after the receiver had scored a touchdown against Texas A&M in their home stadium. In doing so, the trooper came off like a school bully with low self-esteem – the kind of senior who gets his kicks plowing through a sea of freshmen, daring them to speak up so he can enjoy pummeling them in front of everyone. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), which employs the trooper, later said he had been sent home.There’s a lot to unpack here. Why didn’t the DPS call an immediate press conference and condemn the trooper’s actions? Why didn’t they say his behavior was appalling, disgusting, and unacceptable and not what they teach their state troopers to do?If this trooper behaved like this in the middle of a football stadium, during a nationally televised game, how does he behave whenever he stops a Black person on the side of the highway?Harbor did not retaliate, despite the trooper’s provocation – he turned around and made his way back to the field. But if he had responded, what would have happened? It happens all the time: the person being mistreated by police is expected to respond perfectly, or risk making things worse. Yet there’s no such expectation for the officer – no demand for restraint, professionalism, or even basic decency.Before they try to“no angel” Harbor, it’s important to note that he won the 2023 Franklin D Watkins Memorial Award, a prize which honors African American high schoolers who excel in athletics, academics and charity work. Aside from his football career, Harbor has won national titles in track, volunteered at a soup kitchen and worked with Generosity Global, which campaigns to improve women’s health in Africa. Harbor is majoring in public health and has been on the SEC Academic Honor Roll two years in succession.I asked retired police captain Sonia Pruittwhat she thought of the trooper’s behavior.“People say maybe he was having a bad day. But no, as an officer of the law, you do not get to abuse the public because you are having a bad day … People want to be treated with dignity and respect from their police officer,” she saidon my showThe Collision: Where Sports And Politics Collide. “However, far too often, in police training that simply isn’t the focus or conversation. And when it’s not a focus, you see acting out like what we observed with this Texas state trooper. That’s not a ‘bad apple’ issue, that is a bad system issue.”Captain Pruitt, I couldn’t agree more.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsCollege footballTexasUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

UNHCR said it was still waiting for details of the new routes.Mahmood faces anger from more than two dozenLabourMPs over the government’s plans, which will result in families being forcibly removed from the UK if they refuse cash incentives to return to their own country.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said people fleeing war, persecution and torture did not have the luxury of waiting months or years for “safe and legal” routes to be expanded.Solomon said: “A route that helps only a few hundred people, with no clear plan for when it will increase, won’t stop dangerous journeys or create the orderly system the government wants to see, and would in effect be meaningless.“The government must be clear about how many people will be helped each year and how quickly these routes will expand. When safe routes are properly resourced and designed to meet real levels of need, they can save lives and give families a genuine alternative to perilous journeys.”Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the government must be scrutinised and come clean about its plans. “Safe and legal routes are the key to a functioning and fair asylum system,” she said.On Saturday, Mahmood said the government would create new routes for refugees to come to the UK, including a beefed up “community sponsorship” scheme. This will build on the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people to offer support or accommodation to those fleeing the war there.There will also be a programme for “talented and skilled individuals displaced by conflict” to come and work in Britain. In addition, a study route will be created through which students facing war or persecution can continue their education in the UK.“I want to stop people getting on boats,” shetold the Observer. “We want to change the calculus that people are making and disincentivise illegal migration but also show that we have safe, legal routes that will incentivise people to come here under that route.”According to a policy document published on Monday, the home secretary will publish an annual cap on the new routes and will prioritise individuals identified by UNHCR.Questioned about the “safe and legal routes” by ITN’s Robert Peston, Mahmood said the numbers of people allowed into the UK under the new schemes would be “modest”.“A few hundred to begin with, but they will grow over time,” she said.Asked about the specifics of the new pathways, UNHCR said it was still waiting for details from the UK government and warned ministers not to treat refugees as though they were economic migrants.Vicky Tennant, UNHCR’s UK representative, said: “UNHCR urges that they [refugees] be given a stable status that allows them to rebuild their lives and reunite with their families, while a long-term, durable solution is sought.“Short-term stay arrangements and stringent limitations on refugee family reunion often create prolonged uncertainty and despair, undermining integration and social cohesion.”The Home Office said it would consult on measures to allow theremoval of financial supportfrom families with children under the age of 18 if they had been refused asylum. Ministers argue that the current system incentivises asylum seekers to subject their children to dangerous crossings.TheHome Officepolicy document said: “Our hesitancy around returning families creates particularly perverse incentives. To some, the personal benefit of placing a child on a dangerous small boat outweighs the considerable risks of doing so.“Once in the UK, asylum seekers are able to exploit the fact that they have had children and put down roots in order to thwart removal, even if their claim has been legally refused.”In response, the Labour peer Alf Dubs, who was a child refugee welcomed to the UK while fleeing the Nazis, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is a proper case for children, there is a proper case for family reunion when there are children who are on their own.”He added: “To use children as a weapon, as the home secretary is doing, I think is a shabby thing.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumShabana MahmoodRefugeesHome OfficeLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Corner is also charged with causing police officer Kate Evans grievous bodily harm. They deny the charges.Heer said a van driven by Head and carrying the other defendants, all wearing red jumpsuits, crashed through the fence surrounding the site, followed by people on foot wearing black jumpsuits shouting: “Free Palestine.”She said those in black jumpsuits threw fireworks at security guards, lit flares and cracked whips in an attempt to overwhelm them while the defendants’ job was “to cause as much damage as possible and obtain information about the company (Elbit)”.The prosecutor said the defendants were all armed with sledgehammers, which were intended to be used to damage property but that they were also carried as weapons “to be used if necessary to threaten and damage people”.She told the court: “The evidence demonstrates that all of these defendants used them for that purpose, to threaten or to attack the security guards and to lend support to one another as they did so.”“When the police arrived, as the defendants knew they would, Samuel Corner attacked them, going so far as to strike a female officer across the back with his sledgehammer while she was on the floor, facing away from him.”She said Corner hit PC Kate Evans twice while she was on all fours trying to apprehend Rogers.Evans, who “screamed in pain after the first of the blows”, suffered a fractured lumbar spine and could only return to work after three months, and on reduced duties, because she was still in pain, the court was told.Heer said the defendants used fire extinguishers filled with red paint to spray the walls and the floor and crowbars and hammers to damage computer equipment and boxes of technical products, which they smashed.The security guards who tried to stop the defendants were sworn at, told to leave, had sledgehammers swung at them and were whipped, while one was sprayed with a foam fire extinguisher, the prosecutor continued.The jury was shown footage of 6 August taken by police body-worn cameras as well as GoPro cameras worn by those involved in the action. Heer said that at one point Head and Zainab Rajwani grinned at the camera and said: “You’ve been ‘Pal Action’d’.”Before Heer opened the trial, Mr Justice Johnson told the members of the jury that, while they were entitled to their views on the war in Gaza, it was irrelevant to the case, as was the controversy over whether the home secretary’s decision to ban Palestine Action, which took effect in July, was lawful.“You will appreciate that it is vitally important that you judge the case on the evidence, not on the basis of what you or anyone else thinks about Palestine Action or the war in Gaza,” said Johnson. “You must not hold the proscription of Palestine Action against the defendants in any way.”The trial is expected to last 10 weeks.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Jasper Inventor, deputy programme director at Greenpeace International, said: “This could be the turning point ofCop30. This was a strong signal coming from global south and global north countries on the need to phase out fossil fuels.“They are following the call of 40,000 people on the streets of Belém and millions of people around the world. The presidency [of the Cop] and the rest of the parties have to heed this call. The climate needs it, the people demand it.”A commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels” was thekey outcome of Cop28, held in Dubai in 2023. But several countries, led by Saudi Arabia, subsequently started trying to unpick the resolution. At theclimate talks in Baku last year, attempts to follow up and flesh out the resolution failed.This year, the Brazilian hosts refused to put any mention of the “transition away from fossil fuels” on to the official agenda for the conference.It was even excluded from “presidency consultations” that have been taking place behind the scenes on the four trickiest issues on the agenda, which are finance, trade, transparency and the fact that countries’ emissions-cutting plans – known as NDCs, for nationally determined contributions – are too feeble to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, the goal of the Paris agreement.We are all saying very clearly that this issue must be at the heart of this conferenceEd MilibandBut the scores of countries that are in favour of a phase-out took a decision on Monday that they must make a stand. They believe there can be no response to the NDCs and no hope of maintaining the 1.5C goal without ending dependency on fossil fuels.Ed Miliband, the UK’s energy secretary, told the Tuesday press conference: “This is a global coalition, with global north and global south countries coming together and saying with one voice: this is an issue which cannot be swept under the carpet. We are all saying very clearly that this issue must be at the heart of this conference.”Rachel Kyte, the UK climate envoy, said a roadmap was needed to move forward the resolution made at Cop28 and turn it into action.“We agreed this at Cop28 but have not been able to find ways to implement it,” she said. “And this is an implementation Cop [the phrase used by the Brazilian hosts].”On Tuesday morning, the Brazilian presidency of Cop30came up with a draft text for a decisionfrom the summit that – to the surprise of many – included mention of a roadmap to the phase-out of fossil fuels as an option. But for some countries this was too weak.Ralph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for the Pacific island ofVanuatu, told the Guardian: “It’s not strong enough, it needs to be more action-oriented, it needs measurable targets, there need to be elements showing what this roadmap is going to look like.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These transitions are quite different, depending on your energy mix and other factors.”Brazil is expected to revise the text after input and consultations with all the groupings of countries at the Cop30 talks. The US is the only major country absent from Belém.There is likely to be stiff opposition to any restatement of the transition away from fossil fuels – from Saudi Arabia and perhaps Russia, Bolivia and other petrostates.Those in favour of a phase-out believe they have a majority of countries at the Cop, if their supporters and neutral countries are included. But as the process works by consensus, even a handful of naysayers can prevent progress.Brazil’s government has internal conflicts over the transition away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands.While Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – who may return to the conference as soon as Wednesday – made several mentions of the need to “move away from fossil fuel dependency” at the summit of world leaders that preceded Cop30, and at the official opening of the conference last week, there are sections of his government that are wedded to Brazil’s expansion of oil and gas drilling.But Marina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister,told the Guardianthat a roadmap was “an ethical answer” to the climate crisis and called on all countries to “have the courage” to consider it.Explore more on these topicsCop30Fossil fuelsClimate crisisEnergyMarshall IslandsVanuatuBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts say this is a risky method of treating sewage because of the risk that the beads could spill into the sea if one of the mesh screens holding them fails.What are bio-beads used for and how did they get spilled on to Camber Sands beach?Read moreThe government and regulators keep no record of which water companies use these beads, where the treatment works using them are located, or how many are in use, a government spokesperson confirmed, adding that it was a “matter for water companies”. This analysis reveals the scale of the problem for the first time.Campaigners have called for water companies to phase out the beads. Rob Abrams of Surfers Against Sewage said: “Once released, bio-beads behave like any other microplastic: they can be ingested by fish, seabirds and shellfish, enter the food chain, carry harmful pollutants on their surface, and pose risks to human health. And the risk is even greater as so many of these systems sit on the coast. Storms, sea levels rising, and increasingly extreme weather only heighten the chance of failures. Yet instead of investing in safe, modern infrastructure, water companies have siphoned money out to shareholders while letting environmental protections crumble.”The beads are used to create layers of biofilm, bacteria that purify water. Billions at a time are held in tanks, and all that separates them from the environment is a mesh screen. Most of the sewage works using these beads were built about 30 years ago.Map showing south-coast locations of sewage plants using plastic beadsBeverley Coombes, of the plastic pollution nonprofit Strandliners, said: “A loss from a coastal plant is much more of a pollution risk. The discharge goes directly out to sea, where the bio-beads can be carried along the coast for many miles or even across the Channel. I think existing treatment centres should be exploring alternatives to bio-beads. Anything that can stop billions of these potentially toxic bio-beads from entering our rivers and seas has to be a step in the right direction.”The vast majority of the sewage works using beads are in small towns on England’s south and south-west coastlines, in Sussex, Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. Coastal areas affected include Exmouth, Porthleven, Lyme Regis and Peacehaven.The Guardian scrutinised water treatment centre applications and reports to build a picture of where they are used, as well as drawing on data from the Cornish PlasticPollutionCoalition, which has been tracking the issue in Cornwall.Camber Sands in East Sussex faced a spill of an estimated 650m of these beads this month. They have found their way along the coastline, contaminating beaches including Hastings and Dungeness, and buried themselves into the shingle and salt marshes around the area. They were spilled due to a failure of the screen on their tank. Southern Water has apologised and committed to paying for cleanup operations.Plastic beads spreading on Sussex coast after ‘catastrophic’ spill, meeting toldRead moreThese beads contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been linked to cancer. They often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine. Once in the sea, they attract algae, making them smell like food to sea creatures, which then ingest them and can be poisoned.England’s coastal communities are some of its most deprived, and they have failed to gain investment over past decades, as tourism habits have changed and people fly abroad instead of visiting the coast.Helena Dollimore, the MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “Southern Water revealed at my public meeting last week that the use of plastic beads is outdated, and modern treatment works don’t use them. So why is our coastline being put at risk? Southern Water must urgently explain how they will ensure an incident like this never happens again. These beads are contaminating some of our most precious habitats, from the salt marsh at Rye Harbour to the sand dunes at Camber. Our area, and especially our wildlife, will be dealing with these beads for many months to come.”John Penicud, the managing director for wastewater at Southern Water, said: “In our new plant construction since the early 2000s we don’t use beads any more. We use something called membrane technology.” This uses fixed membranes rather than billions of floating plastic beads, so poses less of an environmental risk.Penicud blamed the government’s focus on sewage pollution for not retrofitting his sites: “Where we have put forward cases for how we can retrofit some of these sites instead, our focus from government has been to continue to improve the environment by reducing discharges, improving the quality of the sewage that we treat every day.” He added that retrofitting these sites was “always under review”.Cornish plastics campaigners have battled over this issue for years. Volunteers and beachcombers are still finding beads from a major 2010 spill from the Newham sewage treatment works near Truro. In 2017, vandals slashed some sacks holding beads at a treatment centre, causing a spill on to Tregantle Beach, Whitsand Bay.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Instead, it has replaced the smaller beads with newer, larger ones, which should be less likely to escape.Claire Wallerstein, from the Cornish Plastic Pollution Coalition, said: “We are very concerned that South West Water is using new beads to extend the use of these old wastewater plants beyond the end of their planned 30-year lifespan – we fear this is a recipe for potential disaster.“A breach in the containment mesh was what caused the devastating Cornish spill back in 2010 and now, 15 years on, the infrastructure of these plants is surely at even greater risk of rupture.”A South West Water spokesperson said: “Only eight of our 655 wastewater treatment works use bio-beads, which are all fitted with two levels of robust containment measures and are inspected to ensure beads are kept within the treatment works. Decommissioning these plants is very costly as it requires the whole treatment process to be completely replaced. We are aiming to remove the bio-bead process at our remaining sites when they are required to be upgraded in the future.”Wessex Water declined to comment but said none of its sites had released biobeads.Where the beads are usedCoastalGorran Haven (South West Water)Combe Martin (South West Water)Porthleven (South West Water)Slapton (South West Water)Exmouth (South West Water)Lyme Regis (South West Water)Plympton (South West Water)Eastbourne (Southern Water)Peacehaven (Southern Water)Sandown (Southern Water)Broomfield Bank (Southern Water)Beckley (Southern Water)Kingston Seymour (Wessex Water)InlandChilton Trinity (Wessex Water)Ivybridge (South West Water)Explore more on these topicsPollutionPlasticsWater industryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, it became only the seventh country to graduate from the UN’s least developed country (LDC) category, thanks to significant progress over the last three decades since transitioning to democracy in areas such as poverty reduction, education and life expectancy.It did so not by tearing up environmental regulations to incentivise economic growth but rather by tightening standards and prioritising air, water and land quality. “For us, gross national happiness is the goal, and GDP is just a tool which means economic growth cannot be detrimental to the happiness and wellbeing of our people,” Tobgay said.But while lifting itself out of the LDC ranking represented an important milestone, it also reduced access to international climate finance, aid and technical assistance – even as climate shocks such as floods, drought and erratic rainfall increased.Bhutan has contributed negligibly to global heating, and 72% of the territory is forested, making it a crucial carbon sink. It is among only a handful of countries with plans that are fully or almost compliant with the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, according to theClimate Action Tracker.Bhutan’s focus on environmental and climate protection is not driven only by its commitment to the UN climate process. Bhutanese people believe their deities reside within all parts of the natural environment, which means forests and certain water bodies are off limits and mountaineering is banned. Bhutan is home to the highest unclimbed mountain, Gangkhar Puensum, which rises to more than 7,500 metres above sea level.An entire article of the young democracy’s constitution is dedicated to protecting the environment, requiring at least 60% of the country to be under forest cover. It mandates the government and every citizen to contribute to the protection of the natural environment, conservation of the rich biodiversity and prevention of all forms of ecological degradation.Tobgay said: “We are sequestering around five times the amount of carbon dioxide we emit We are taking care of our biodiversity, taking care of our forests. We are nature positive, carbon negative. Yet, because we are a landlocked mountainous country, we bear the brunt of climate change impacts.”Mountain ranges are warming faster than the global average, causing Bhutan’s glaciers to melt and lakes to overflow. Floods have already displaced farming communities and the cost of road maintenance has more than doubled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They must help the developing world adapt and reduce emissions by providing finance and resource and technology transfers, but most importantly they must reduce their own emissions,” Tobgay said. “Small countries like Bhutan, we are actually doing a lot more than our fair share. The effects of climate change are disastrous, even for rich countries.”Last year at Cop29, Bhutanled the launchof an alliance with Panama, Suriname and Madagascar, three other carbon-negative or carbon-neutral countries, with the aim of gaining greater recognition and influence at the UN climate talks for the oversized contribution they make to global climate action.“In all the climate change discussions, the focus is on promises for the future, not on actual results,” Tobgay said. “We want our contributions and foregone opportunities to be acknowledged and compensated. This would incentivise other countries to not just aspire but actually work towards carbon neutrality as soon as possible. Too often bad behaviour is recognised and rewarded and good behaviour is not seen, it’s taken for granted. We’ve got to reverse that.”Leaders of the so-called G-Zero countries held talks during the UN general assembly in New York in September and agreed on an inaugural summit in Bhutan next year to showcase and share climate solutions and deliver a message to the developed world, which is lagging behind.“So you may be an industrialised country, you’ve reaped the rewards and spread the benefits of industrialisation throughout the world, but it’s time to now take stock of where we are. You don’t need to reverse industrialisation and economic growth but you need to make it sustainable,” Tobgay said.“GDP is for what? Reducing carbon emissions is for what? It has to be for the happiness and wellbeing of your people. Earth will survive no matter what we do. The urgency to control global warming, to fight climate change, is for us people now and for our future generations.“We are taking care of our people, our economy is growing, and at the same time we’ve been able to take care of our environment. If such small developing countries can do it, there’s no excuse that larger countries cannot play bigger roles. After all, they are the leaders of the world.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisBhutanCop30Greenhouse gas emissionsGreen economySouth and central AsiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

It was about cleaning up the “mess” left by colonialism “so that we can all go forward together”, he said.Speaking at a lecture in London on Monday, he said the CRC’s ultimate aim was for the UK and its former colonies to identify “mutual strategies for mutual benefits”.Hurricane Melissa a ‘real-time case study’ of colonialism’s legaciesRead more“Every week, we open the newspapers and we hear the most terrible things about these reparations people from the Caribbean. Some have said that we have come here to break the British Treasury by demanding millions and billions and billions of pounds. And they have consistently tried to discredit what is an ongoing moral and ethical argument for justice, the right to justice,” he said.During the lecture, Sir Beckles pointed to the consequences of enslavement, which continue to hamper the Caribbean’s development, including unfair debt accumulation, health and education challenges, and the struggle to build the resilience needed to face worsening natural disasters.This week, he is a leading six-member CRC delegation, which has been meeting with UK parliamentarians, Caribbean diplomats, academics and civil society groups to “raise consciousness, provide information to the public, provide historical knowledge and contemporary understanding” and facilitate a future dialogue between Caribbean and British governments.Between the 15th and the 19th century, more than 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped, forcibly transported to theAmericasand sold into slavery.Caribbean governments have been callingfor recognition of the lasting legacy of colonialism and enslavement, and for reparative justice from former colonisers, including a full formal apology and forms of financial reparations, such as debt cancellations.David Comissiong, ambassador to Caricom and vice-chair of the Barbados National Taskforce, told reporters on Tuesday that “the overburdened debt situation” facing many countries in the region resulted from centuries of European nations siphoning off and plundering Caribbean resources.This, he said, was linked to modern-day challenges facing the Caribbean, such as dealing with the climate crisis.“If we don’t, with proper goodwill, and the understanding that we are all in this together … address these lingering situations of injustice and fragility, then what happens? The climate crisis only gets worse. Developing countries only suffer more because they don’t have the resources to respond. The climate refugee situation only worsens.“Yes, we are looking for justice for ourselves. But by seeking justice for ourselves, we are also seeking universal justice. We are also seeking to cure and to heal wounds and inequities and unsustainability … [that] will wreak havoc not only on us but will wreak havoc on our entire world,” he said.The region is part of a growing global movement for slavery reparations. At the ongoing UNCop30climate conference in Brazil,hundreds of human rights groups and environmentalists have urgeddelegates to put reparations on the agenda.In their open letter they argued that “global warming began with the industrial revolutions that were made possible by the resources provided by imperialism, colonialism and enslavement, [and] that colonialism and enslavement skewed the global economy in favour of the material and financial interests in the global north”.The issue was also prominent when Commonwealth leaders met last year. At a summit,Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, saidthe slave trade was abhorrent but that countries should be “looking forward” and addressing current challenges such as the climate crisis.But the UK was among the leaders whoissued a statementsaying that “the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity”.Explore more on these topicsSlaveryCaribbeanColonialismBritish empireClimate crisisCop30Foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The claimant, known as YXN, has lodged civil proceedings against him “for damages for personal injuries and losses consequent on the defendant’s intentional infliction of harm, misuse of confidential information, infringement of privacy and deceit”.In documentsfiled at the high court and seen by the BBC, Wootton denies ever communicating “via any medium” with the man, who has been granted anonymity by the court.Wootton also denies that he “ever has been in possession” of any “explicit photographs or video” portraying the man.He denies he “was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant”.He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph.Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: “Maria [if that is really your name] ... we are in a catch 22. i can’t play without finding this out. won’t tell them as i’m not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then?

Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The sight of unelected hereditary peers blocking stronger rights for millions belongs in another century – not modern Britain.”Labour MP Justin Madders, a former employment rights minister, added: “These unelected peers, with jobs for life, should not continue to downgrade and delay our plans to give everyone proper security at work.“We have a democratic mandate to deliver this massive increase in workers’ rights and the Lords need to realise their obstruction makes them look out of touch, undemocratic and firmly against the interest of working people in this country.”Ministers have committed to throw out the Lords amendments, despite unease among some figures in government, with business leaders warning the changes could hurt jobs and the economy.A Labour source said the amendments were “pretty tone deaf” because the employment rights bill was a manifesto pledge. The Lords typically have an unwritten agreement not to vote against such measures. However, Labour is in the process of abolishing hereditary peerages.We can’t let the Tories sabotage this once-in-a-generation chance to reshape the world of work | Angela RaynerRead moreThere are 85 hereditary peers, including 44 Tories and four each from Labour and the Liberal Democrats.“They’re not representative of the wider population, and what we’re trying to do is to bring employment rights up to date and make sure people have rights at work which protect them,” the Labour source said.Industry leaders have stepped up lobbying against the workers’ rights changes, warning that employers are alreadyslashing jobs and putting up pricesin response to expected tax rises in the chancellor’s first autumn budget on 26 November.Those voting in the Lords against Labour’s plans included dozens of senior business figures and millionaires.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Public have no idea of value of top universities, study findsRead moreProf Lopa Leach, the Nottingham University and College Union branch president, said the union was holding talks with the university over the course closures but – with only a few days until the crucial council meeting – there remained little time to affect the outcome.Leach said: “They are suspending or closing degrees that they incorrectly believe are no longer affordable. But a Russell Group university without modern languages or music, I mean, come on. One of my colleagues says we will become known as the University of Little England.“This is not simply fiscally driven, it is a change of ideology by university leaders – they are worried about overseas students not coming to UK, given the hostile environment, although our PhD applications were still excellent this year.“Add to that the dialogue of undergraduates wanting more ‘useful’ degrees – our executive board are unfortunately buying into that. But it is an error to think that modern languages or music are not important or useful, given they are very highly regarded.”A spokesperson for Nottingham said that, like other universities, it had been hit by falling revenues and rising costs, forcing it to look closely at its finances.While it welcomed the government’s decision to increase domestic tuition fees, the spokesperson said any gains were likely to be wiped out by the proposedlevy on international student fees.“A societal shift has significantly affected student demand for music and modern languages degrees over recent years, with the downward trend in recruitment reflecting changing demographics and educational and career preferences,” they said.Quarter of UK university physics departments at risk of closing, survey findsRead more“We recognise the important place that music and modern languages have among our university community and are developing plans for skills provision separately from degree courses.”Prof Lonán Ó Briain, Nottingham’s head of music, said: “The department has educated thousands of composers, researchers, performers, educators and other creative professionals.“Our graduates have taken up leadership roles within the country’s leading arts organisations. We remain a world-leading centre for music research, ranking second out of all units in the university during the last national research assessment. We are also deeply embedded in the local community, working with schools, music hubs, community groups, venues and professional ensembles.“The closure of the department would not only dismantle a thriving academic and cultural institution but also severely diminish musical life and future opportunities across Nottingham, the wider East Midlands and the nation as a whole.”Nottingham said it currently offered about 1,000 taught courses, with the courses affected accounting for less than 5% of the total.Explore more on these topicsUniversity of NottinghamUniversity fundingLanguagesMusicStudentsHigher educationUniversitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

I think that is just being politically realistic.”In an unexpected move, the EU decided last week that the UK should pay towards its budget in order to join the European electricity market.It would mean the UK paying into the EU budget, although Britain alreadypays EU membership legacy costs. The two sides are also deadlocked over the EU’s demand for an entry fee of up to €6bn (£5.3bn) to allow British companies to maximise benefits from a €150bn (£132.1bn) EU defence programme.In more welcome news for the government, Byrne said he hoped both sides could strike a deal to ease food and animal checks at the border in the second half of 2026, during Ireland’s presidency of the EU Council. Last week, the EU agreed a mandate for theEuropean Commissionto negotiate this veterinary agreement. “I think that could be a gamechanger,” Byrne added.During alandmark summit in May that launched the government’s EU reset, Keir Starmer and the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed the two sides “should explore in detail the necessary parameters for the United Kingdom’s possible participation in the European Union’s internal electricity market”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen at the UK-EU summit in May.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThetextdid not spell out that the UK should pay for access – but since then, a large majority of EU member states have decided this should be the case. Several countries, including Belgium and Germany, have warned against allowing the UK to “cherrypick” the best bits of the European single market without abiding by common rules.Commission officials briefing EU ministers on Monday described the UK as a “complicated and challenging counterpart” and said “nerves of steel and unity” would be required through upcoming negotiations. The central challenge would be financial considerations, they added.Tensions over money have already emerged innegotiations over UK participation in the EU’s €150bn security action for Europe (Safe) fund. EU officials have suggested an entry fee of up to €6bn, far higher than the administrative fee the government had envisaged paying.Peter Ricketts, the veteran former diplomat who chairs the European affairs committee in the House of Lords, has described a rumoured €6.5bn fee as “so off the scale that it suggests some EU members don’t want the UK in the scheme”.Some media outlets have reported the entry fee could be between €6.5bn and €6.7bn, but the Guardian understands the commission has proposed a fee ranging from €1bn to €6bn, proportionate to expected UK benefits.Sandro Gozi, an Italian centrist MEP who co-chairs the EU-UK parliamentary assembly, said it was imperative to show voters that the reset meant something.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some states have followed suit, and some Democratic states have retaliated, pushing to add more blue seats to counteractRepublicans.A panel of three federal judges inTexassaid in a decision that the state must use previously approved 2021 maps for next year’s midterms rather than the ones that kickstarted a wave of mid-decade redistricting. The plaintiffs, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, are “likely to prove at trial that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map”, so the court approved a preliminary injunction to stop the map’s use for next year’s elections.Texas governor Abbott designates Cair and Muslim Brotherhood terrorist groupsRead moreTexas Republicans, under pressure from the Trump administration, redrew the state’s congressional maps earlier this year to make them more favorable to Republicans. But, Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote, the district changes were not purely partisan.“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics,” Brown wrote. “To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”Typically, redistricting happens after a new decade’s census results. Maps are often fought over, inviting lawsuits that can take years to resolve. In some states, the process is done by lawmakers, while in others, by independent bodies. Courts now cannot stop maps drawn for partisan reasons, but they can intervene if maps are racially gerrymandered.Brown pointed to Texas lawmakers’ responses to the justice department. Lawmakers initially resisted the idea of redrawing maps for purely partisan reasons, but moved forward after the Trump administration “reframed” the idea of redistricting around racial makeup.A July letter from the head of the department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, made the “legally incorrect assertion” that four of Texas’s congressional districts were unconstitutional. She threatened legal action if the state did not redraw these “coalition districts”, where no single racial group made up a majority of voters – “a threat based entirely on their racial makeup”, Brown wrote.“Notably, the [justice department] letter targeted only majority-non-white districts,” the decision says. “Any mention of majority-white Democrat districts – which [the justice department] presumably would have also targeted if its aims were partisan rather than racial – was conspicuously absent.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Membership of the board of peace, the body that is to oversee the ISF and a Palestinian civilian police force also remains unknown.Hamas, still dominant in Gaza, also rejected the requirement to decommission its weapons, saying that had not been part of the original agreement. “Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the militant group said.“Any international force, if established, should only be present at the border to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and it should be under full UN supervision and act solely in coordination with the Palestinian institutions, without the occupation having any role in this.”A British diplomat said weapon decommissioning would be the most difficult part of the process and was only likely to take place in the context of a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Many Palestinians are unhappy that the UN resolution only set out the most conditional path to a Palestinian state that brings together Gaza and theWest Bank.But Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, the Palestinian foreign minister, said: “The UN resolution is the first step in a long road towards peace. That step was needed because we could not embark on anything else before we had a ceasefire.”She said that although the US president’s plan alluded to possible Palestinian statehood taking place only after the Palestinian Authority carried out reforms, that issue could be taken up later. “As long as these elements are in there, we’re happy with this first step,” Shahin said.View image in fullscreenVarsen Aghabekian Shahin speaking to the press on Tuesday during a visit to the Philippines.Photograph: Rolex dela Peña/EPAMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, this month agreed to work with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on the drafting of a new constitution for the authority, the precondition for holding long-delayed elections and cleansing the organisation of endemic corruption.The security council resolutionwas passed on Monday by 13 votes to 0, with China and Russia abstaining.The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, said at the beginning of the debate: “This resolution presents a possible path to a Palestinian state if the Palestinian Authority meets the conditions. A vote against is a vote to return to war.”Speaking after the resolution’s endorsement he claimed it “showed the UN could remain a beacon for peace, and not just a bystander”. He added it would allow for a Gaza Strip that was “finally free of Hamas’s terror and reign” and that the vote allowed the Palestinians a future where they could determine their own identity.Ultimately the plan’s future depends on Trump’s willingness to remain engaged, including by putting effective pressure on the Israeli government not to use the many opportunities in the resolution’s text not to withdraw from Gaza.Much of the reaction to the UN resolution inside Israel was hostile, although Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, welcomed it, saying: “Israel extends its hand in peace and prosperity to all of our neighbours and calls on them to normalise relations with Israel.”“We believe that President Trump’s plan will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarisation, disarmament and the deradicalisation of Gaza,” including, the prime minister’s office added, receiving the remains of the deceased hostages left in Gaza “with no delay”.The Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, meanwhile, accused Netanyahu of having turned a “blind eye” to Hamas arming itself over the years, describing it as a “terrible strategic mistake, and it’s good that the Americans put an end to it”. He added: “The most rightwing government in the state’s history is officially abandoning annexation and defining principles for cooperation with the Palestinian Authority.”The UK managed to insert into the resolution text a reference to the delivery of aid in line with international law. That keeps open a role for Unrwa, a body endorsed by the international court of justice, to deliver aid. The text, however, only made specific reference to the UN, the Red Crescent and the Red Cross.The UK is also submitting ideas to the US on the disarmament of Hamas based on its experience with the IRA in Northern Ireland. But it regards the issue as the most difficult to resolve and it will largely depend on the political context. The security council text gives a role to the Palestinian police and to the ISF in the process of disarmament.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestineUnited NationsIsraelDonald TrumpGazaWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

The tech giant bought WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014. Losing either the image-based social network, which generates an estimated half of Meta’s revenue, or the world’s most popular messaging app could have done existential damage to Meta’s empire.Meta faces antitrust claims at trial over Instagram and WhatsApp ownershipRead moreThe US district judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May.“The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote, citing the rise of TikTok in particular as evidence of competition in the social networking market. Boasberg also chided the FTC, which brought the case against the tech giant, for failing to account for the YouTube video platform as meaningful competition. “Even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC’s case,” he wrote.Jennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, wrote at the start of the trial: “It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok.”The judge’s decision follows two separate rulings that brandedGooglean illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing a regulatory blow to the tech giant that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.In contrast to the victory over Google, the ruling in Meta’s favor dampens the regulatory crackdown initiated by the US government to rein in tech giants, some of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world. The FTC has also sued Amazon for anticompetitive practices. The US justice department has filed suit againstApple, accusing it of operating a “broad, sustained and illegal smartphone monopoly”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An offer to Kalifa to join Visma’s board may depend on London being chosen. Its executive chair, Øystein Moan, who was Visma’s chief executive from 1997 to 2020, could yet stay in that role.The Oslo-based company is running “early look” meetings with large fund managers to gauge likely demand for the shares and investors’ preference on listing venue and governance. The company is being advised by the investment banks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS.London was reported in the summerto have beaten Amsterdamto attract the listing in what was seen as a coup – Visma would be the biggest London listing for years. An eleventh-hour loss to Stockholm would be regarded as a heavy blow. “There are different routes this could go down and nothing is yet decided,” said one source close to the process.The potential recruitment of Kalifa may become important to London’s case. Kalifa was chief executive of Worldpay for more than 10 years and later vice-chair. He led the group through a period of rapid growth during which it was bought out of the Royal Bank of Scotland after the financial crash and later re-emerged as a stand-alone FTSE 100 company. Worldpay wasbought by US rival Vantiv for £9.3bn in 2017.A London listing would also represent a personal win for Kalifa. He wrote a high-profile report for the government in 2021 on how to boost the UK’s financial technology (fintech) sector by attracting investment and new companies – including how to encourage them to choose London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He assured me that Exxon are not suggesting that this closure was due to a lack of action or will on behalf of the government. It was a commercial decision made where the numbers simply didn’t add up.”An estimated £1bn of investment was needed to make the ageing plant commercially viable, McDonald said. Despite regular meetings between Exxon and the government since August, the support required was deemed too great.“We have stepped in to support businesses in the steel, shipbuilding and chemicals industries,” McDonald said. “But in all cases there was a sound business proposition underpinning our investment and sadly here this was not the case.”He said Exxon had reassured him that workers would be supported to find other jobs, including at the company’s Fawley refinery in Southampton, nearly 500 miles from Fife.McDonald added: “This is not the end of Fife’s industrial story. As Exxon gradually decommissions the site, we are committed to working with the local authority and the Scottish government to promote the benefits of this location for future industrial investment.”The decision has provoked anger within the SNP-led Scottish government. The deputy first minister, Kate Forbes, said she was “extremely disappointed” and promised to establish a Scottish government taskforce.“The news of the expected closure of the Fife Ethylene Plant and the loss of such high-value jobs is a very significant blow to Scotland’s economy,” Forbes said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our priorities are now to support our people through this challenging period, while ensuring continued safe operations through to end of production.”The closure emerged months after Exxon set out plans for a global restructuring of its business, including the loss of 2,000 workers, particularly in Canada and across the EU.Exxon said in February that about 1,200 roles would be cut in Norway and the EU by the end of 2027, but there would be no planned job cuts in the US.Explore more on these topicsExxonMobilChemical industryScotlandOil and gas companiesOilEnergy industryJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

Siemiatkowski told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday that it was “pretty remarkable, and unheard of as a number, among businesses”.He explained that Klarna has not hired “for a few years”. However, some of the resulting cost-savings had been used to increase pay for remaining staff, with average compensation – including employee-related taxes and pension contributions – rising by 60% over the past three years.“We have made a commitment to our employees that all of these efficiency gains, and especially the applications of AI, should also, to some degree, come back in their pay cheques so that they are fully … incentivised [and] aligned with the investors, to drive these changes through the company.”Average compensation for each employee has jumped from $126,000 (£96,000) in 2022 to $203,000 today, Klarna said.Siemiatkowski, who is a shareholder in a number of AI firms including OpenAI and Perplexity through his family investment firm Flat Capital, said he hoped to continue increasing a metric measuring revenue per employee, suggesting a further reduction in staff numbers in the years ahead.“We’re now at $1.1m per employee, and we hope to continue to do that acceleration.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So he decided it was time to live a more interesting – and stressful – lifeTue 18 Nov 2025 10.18 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTShareWhat’s the opposite of an overnight success? Should we call Ian Smith a slow burner, a sleeper hit? The Yorkshireman’s last two shows, both fantastic, were nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award, he has a popular Radio 4 series, Ian Smith is Stressed, and growing TV visibility. Now he’s embarking on a second UK tour. But breakout success was a long time coming for the 37-year-old. “I did my first gig when I was 17,” he tells me over coffee in London, “which I find horrific. It makes me feel old.”What took him so long? Might one factor be that Smith’s is a traditional brand of standup – fretful everyman sends up his own anxiety – in a culture that prizes the new and different? That can’t be it, he says. “Because I had so many gimmicks! That was a big part of my standup.” He cites the high-concept shows (comedy in a bath; comedy on a bed) that made Tim Key’s name. “I loved standup with slightly theatrical set-pieces. That was my voice for four shows. I got a review that said, ‘Ian substitutes writing jokes with standing on tables and shouting at people.’ And it was fair enough. I went through a real standing-on-tables phase.”I didn’t have loads going on in my life. I sometimes felt it was quite boringBut the world wasn’t taking much notice. “I didn’t have an agent for a couple of years, and I did feel in the wilderness. But my shows kept getting better.” Then one day, he says, “I wanted to prove I could do a funny show without PowerPoint, set-pieces or gimmicks. And that became my most successful show.”EntitledCrushing, it depicted the neurotic tizz Smith got himself into after a relationship breakup. Its follow-up,Foot Spa Half Empty, addresses Smith’s low sperm count, discovered when he and his partner began trying for a child. Neither show is remotely gimmicky. Quite the opposite: Smith ascribes their success to their actually addressing something meaningful about his experience of the world.View image in fullscreen‘I only ever want to make it as stupid and silly as I can’ … Smith.Photograph: Matt Stronge“I didn’t used to have loads going on in my life,” he says. “I would sometimes feel it was quite boring. So I made a conscious effort to put myself out in the world, to live a more interesting or stressful life. Maybe I just starteddoingmore stuff.” This included visiting Bratislava with his hairdresser, where (as recounted in Crushing) he drove a tank over a car to vent his pent-up rage.By cannibalising his fretfulness for comedy, Smith refined a persona to stand alongside those peevish titans of mouse-that-roared comedyRhod Gilbertand Victor Meldrew. “The best comedy,” he says, “comes from negative feelings: stress or anxiety or fear. Then you tell people about those feelings, and they realise they also get stressed about things they shouldn’t really worry about, and it’s all a big release. That’s where the best stuff comes from.”Maybe so – but it still took a deep breath for Smith to address his fertility struggles on stage. “It was a hard decision,” he says, “but I was strong-armed into it by the situation. Because if I’m writing a show, it’s going to be about things I’m stressed about in that moment. I would have struggled to motivate myself to write ‘self-service checkouts are really annoying’ when, really, I wouldn’t have cared about that at the time.” Unlike with his breakup show, written in retrospect, Smith wrote Foot Spa Half Empty throughout the spring of this year, while the process (the anxiety, the trips to the sperm clinic) was unfolding in real time.Bad dates and bath bombs: 10 of the funniest jokes from the Edinburgh fringe 2025Read more“It was like a live coping mechanism,” he says. “Which some people would say is not healthy. Comedians often tell audiences, ‘Don’t worry about me. I’ve processed this and everything’s OK.’ Whereas I had a line in the show – which I eventually dropped – that went, ‘I want to let you know I haven’t processed any of this! I’m stressed about it right now!’ I thought that was a bold way to tell people this is an ongoing thing. But it can take audiences away from being able to laugh at you.”Laughter, after all, is what Smith is in it for – on stage, on screen (he has sitcoms in development), or on his popular Northern News podcast with Yorkshire compatriotAmy Gledhill. This is emphaticallynota comic who classifies his anxieties as trauma or mental health. “It would be easy in this new show to say something sad or profound about how I feel about the [infertility] situation,” he says. “But I always feel the obligation to be as funny as possible. Whether I’m stressed about a serious subject or a trivial one, I only ever want to make it as stupid and silly as I can.”It’s an approach that has got him, finally, where he wants to be in comedy: a slow burner who has finally caught fire. “I can be full of self-doubt,” says Smith, “and you could chart my career doubt by how many times I would Google ‘law conversion courses’ in a year. But I haven’t done that in a while now.”Ian Smith: Foot Spa Half empty is atSoho theatre, London, 25-29 November.Then tours in the new year.Explore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025Fertility problemsHealthEdinburgh festivalSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now he arrives on stage – inside a trunk – to serenade the audienceChris WiegandTue 18 Nov 2025 08.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 08.52 ESTShareIn one of Hollywood’s nicer ironies, character actor John C Reilly finally made it big with a song about being invisible. His Oscar-nominated performance as the duped and devoted schmuck Amos Hart in Kander and Ebb’s Chicago was defined by his solo,Mister Cellophane. Director Rob Marshall had him sing it in an empty theatre so Amos doesn’t even get an audience for his big number.More than 20 years later, Reilly has dusted off a not dissimilar tailcoat and rouged his cheeks once more under a new moniker, Mister Romantic, and this time there’s a full house. Backed by a four-piece band he is here to win our hearts with 90 minutes of jazz standards and popular songs, plus the odd chanson and comic verse. After a dozen or so dates in the US, the show has a short run this week in London at Soho Theatre Walthamstow, whose beautifully restored interior andhistory as a music hallfits Mister Romantic like a glove.It’s vaudeville with the gentlest hint of grand guignol. The band wind their way through the auditorium, Charles De Castro doing double duty on accordion and cornet, opening with Tom Waits’ instrumental Just Another Sucker on the Vine. They proceed to drag our host on to the stage concealed inside a trunk. When he climbs out, hair likeShock-Headed Peter, he professes not to know the day of the week, his location or even his band. But if just one of us will love him for ever, he won’t have to go back in the box.View image in fullscreenSteve Coogan and John C Reilly in the 2018 film Stan & Ollie.Photograph: Bbc Films/AllstarAnd so the seduction begins. Reilly starts off with Pretend, a hit for Nat King Cole in 1953, its melancholic optimism here re-spun as if to honour the theatre audience’s role in all of this: “And if you sing this melody / You’ll be pretending just like me / The world is mine it can be yours my friend.” It’s a kind of promise: submit to the show and you won’t regret it.In between the lyrics Reilly drifts around the stage with some silent clowning that brings back memories of his Oliver Hardy on screen, opposite Steve Coogan’s Stan Laurel, intheir filmabout the double act’s 50s variety hall tour. As Mister Romantic lights up an invisible cigar, blows smoke rings and hulas inside them, he can’t conceal a smile at the whimsy. And who can blame him? Then it’s on to Irving Berlin’s Blue Skies, with Reilly miming the song’s bluebirds as if he’s a grizzled Snow White.The tone of the evening is equal parts wide-eyed ingenuity and seasoned world-weariness. He’s a kind of eternal troubadour and a gag on the show’s website lists tour dates going back to 1590 at London’s Globe (nine years before it was actually built) and the night before the famous 1903 fire at Chicago’s Iroquois theatre. Mister Romantic is apparently as ageless as his set list is timeless. But his innocent air also brings to mind Buddy the Elf, played by his Step Brothers co-star, Will Ferrell.View image in fullscreenJack White as Elvis Presley with John C Reilly in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007).Photograph: Columbia Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarStep Brothers gave Reilly a couple of goofy throwaway songs, as did several of the comedies he made at the time, but his lead role in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story relied on his prowess as a singer. The spoof music biopic about Cox’s bid to become a “double great” singer, after the unfortunate death by machete of his brother, rattles through pastiches of Johnny Cash, the Beatles and beyond, with Reilly’s musicality helping the jokes land.Most of Mister Romantic’s songs are done straight, his band (completed by Davíd Garza on piano and guitar, Gabe Witcher on violin and David Piltch on bass) wearing sombre expressions. But he gets all loosey-goosey on Earl Okin’s eccentric come-on, My Room, matching the bluesy humour with lascivious gestures. That’s a welcome gear change in a show that cleaves just a little too closely to one register and misses the more unvarnished emotion of the other Waits tracks featured onReilly’s album.On screen, some of Reilly’s musical highlights have been duets – see his cowboy pardnership with Woody Harrelson in Robert Altman’s swansong, A Prairie Home Companion. Mister Romantic sings instead on his lonesome, save for recruiting us as backing singers and riffing with the audience as he seeks out someone – anyone – to love him. The crowd work, done with a red rose microphone, is carefully managed and Reilly’s features are captivating in closeup – that face, halfway to its own caricature, veers from smitten to crestfallen as Mister Romantic is rejected time after time.This feeds into the drama of the songs when, for example, he dedicates You Don’t Know Me (written by Eddy Arnold and Cindy Walker) to those individuals – the song veering from the usual unrequited loyalty to the scorn of a spurned suitor. It’s a clever concept: here is a singer of soul-baring songs whose heart is broken by his own audience.All shades of love are here: pining and enduring, effortless and hopeless, yet none of it to ever be regretted or fully extinguished. “You and the song are gone / But the melody lingers on,” he sings as it approaches the end of the evening, another nod – like that opening number – to the alchemy between performer and audience.Reilly dreamed this enchanting show up after he “looked at our weary world a few years ago and tried to think of a way I could spread love and empathy”. It’s rare to feel that songs are being delivered straight to you but that’s what he achieves – never mind the goofing – through his unquestionable sincerity. “Hope I didn’t take up too much of your time,” mumbled Amos at the end of Mister Cellophane. On the contrary: I could have kept listening right through the night.AtSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, until 19 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreClownsJohn C ReillyMusicalsCabaretSoho theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And now we live in an era in which a chatbot can write a passable sonnet, it is perhaps surprising that there hasn’t been a huge shift in how film-makers approach this particular corner of sci-fi.Gareth Edwards’The Creator(2023) is essentially the same story about AIs being the newly persecuted underclass as 1962’s The Creation of the Humanoids, except that the former has an $80m VFX budget and robot monks while the latter has community-theatre production values. Moon (2009) and 1968’s2001: A Space Odysseyare both about the anxiety of being trapped with a soft-voiced machine that knows more than you. Her (2013) is basically Electric Dreams (1984) with fewer synth-pop arpeggios.No one is suggesting Hollywood should start making films about what AI actually does. It seems unlikely that film-goers would flood to multiplexes to catch a three-act tech farce in which a nefarious algorithm admits it can’t answer the hero’s question because it “doesn’t have access to data yet”. But we should at least be getting something that feels like it’s been inspired by recent developments, rather than expensively produced and lavishly recycled takes on stories we’ve all seen before.From the look of its debut trailer, Gore Verbinski’s Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die may not be the bold reinvention of AI cinema we might want, but it is at least gesturing towards something new. This time, the AI in question doesn’t seem hugely interested in saving or destroying mankind; instead it’s acting like a chaotic, reality-bending dungeon master, running humans through a cosmic escape room for reasons that make sense only to itself. Could machines of the future have taken a note from modern day YouTubers who spend all day and night livestreaming their own digital reality? Is this all just a great big laugh at the expense of humanity by a god-like deity?Perhaps this is more about the Deadpoolisation of modern blockbuster cinema, but the sense I get from this trailer is that Hollywood has finally run out of ways to make AI frightening, wise or soulful, and has decided to make it an endlessly glitched-out nonsense engine instead. A jittery man from the future (Sam Rockwell) bursts into a diner to inform a random assortment of strangers that they must help him prevent the AI apocalypse. Suddenly we’re pinballing between spider-legged dollbots, neon-lit dystopian alleyways and what looks like a giant ungulate striding through suburbia, all intercut with quippy one-liners from people who seem to want to narrate their own AI apocalypse in real time. Mystical triangular glyphs are everywhere and set-pieces arrive with the panicked rhythm of a timeline that’s clearly being reloaded every 30 seconds.There’s a definite hint ofEverything Everywhere All At Oncein the over-caffeinated speed-cutting chaos too, but at least we’re not being handed yet another ponderous parable about robot souls, digital enlightenment or the hubris of man. Verbinski’s film also stars Juno Temple and Haley Lu Richardson and is out in February, when we’ll presumably find out what unholy combination of prompts caused the timeline to glitch this badly in the first place.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekScience fiction and fantasy filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingSam RockwellcommentShareReuse this content"

You’re having a delicious mid-afternoon snack in the lobby of the Plaza hotel, which presumably cost all of $2.50, when suddenly you are abducted in broad daylight at gunpoint by two polite and well-dressed men. You don’t put up a fight. You merely walk with them to their car, trying to object in the only way you know how: asking nicely for them to stop. The kidnappers are gleeful; they’ve finally captured you, George Kaplan. That’s not your name, you exclaim, you’re Roger Thornhill! They must have the wrong man!Happy 100th birthday, Eva Marie Saint! Her best films – rankedRead moreThus begins Hitchcock’s funniest, most ridiculous and visually ambitious film,North by Northwest. All the hallmarks of a Hitchcock classic are here: Cary Grant as the leading man, a completely inexplicable MacGuffin (who is George Kaplan anyway? And more importantly, does anyone even care?), a director cameo, a mysterious and beautiful blonde (the darling and charming Eva Marie Saint), and a 20-minute opening so overstuffed with dialogue that you kind of tune out but it’s fine because once the inciting incident happens, you can’t look away. It’s so Hitchcockian that it borders on parody.Released in 1959 and coming in hot after Hitchcock’s most famous Technicolor nailbiters (including Rear Window and Vertigo, heard of them?), North by Northwest is clearly the work of a film-maker who already knows his success is preordained. He can go absurd, so why not? There is absolutely no reasonCary Grant, painted in three coats of fake tan as always, should be free climbing Mount Rushmore, dodging bullets from Lincoln’s giant rocky nose after being chased around the US by an underground anti-government movement.Grant as Thornhill is one of the most underrated comedic performances of the 20th century. Every single character he meets in this film is very clearly working to screw him over, yet he remains surprised at every turn. He is like a bronzed Homer Simpson in a well-tailored suit, blindly walking into every trap and then believing he can merely talk his way out of it. You want to shake him by the shoulders and scream: CARY, WAKE UP!View image in fullscreen‘As long as it looks gorgeous and the stakes are high, reason can be shoehorned into anything’ … including the film’s cornfield chase.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyDespite being made in the thick of Hollywood’s conservative Hays Code, North by Northwest is hornier than any modern blockbuster. Grant and Saint can barely keep their hands off each other in their shared train carriage, and the film ends with an infamous shot of a steam train racing full steam ahead into a snug and innuendo-heavy tunnel. It’s hard to imagine anything as erotic in a Marvel film.In one of the film’s most storied scenes, Grant flees from an aeroplane in an epic chase through a cornfield. Out of context, it seems random and illogical. In context, it still makes no sense. Why wouldn’t the villains just shoot him? Why concoct a plan to try to mow him down with a plane in the middle of nowhere? And that is the core thesis of the film. There is no reason other than it looks fabulous on screen, and that’s why Hitchcock is the master. As long as it looks gorgeous and the stakes are high, reason can be shoehorned into anything. Just as Grant dusts himself off after each life-or-death struggle and immediately emerges ready to trust again, it’s impossible not to enter every absurd scene in North by Northwest with blind wonder and intrigue. Over and over and over again.North by Northwest isstreaming on HBO Max in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US.

He loved to play women in drag, started a magazine about countryside ecology (Vole), founded his own real-ale brewery and was even once a columnist for this newspaper,beginning one piece in 2011like this: “In the 14th century there were two pandemics. One was the Black Death, the other was the commercialisation of warfare.” He even used to write jokes for Cliff Richard.It would be tempting in view of all this to call him a renaissance man, except that Jones rather despised the highfalutin Renaissance, preferring the earthiness of medieval times: his first published book was a scholarly reinterpretation of Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale, arguing that the hero’s fighting and pillaging was being presented satirically by the poet as something deplorable. Later he raided the Norse myth-kitty for the beloved children’s book (and, later, film)The Saga of Erik the Viking. His illustrator told him that Vikings didn’t really wear those massive helmets with horns sticking out at the sides, but Terry insisted on them. Historical accuracy could only get you so far.The spiritual heart of this biography, though, is the institution of the north London pub, in several of which Jones would happily chat about his latest projects to the author of this book, a friend and comedy historian. Many pints were quaffed, and it seems as though no showbiz minutiae emerging therefrom have been omitted in these pages. As an adoring account of the career of one of the men who ran away to join the Flying Circus, it could hardly be bettered, and is decorated with warm reminiscences from colleagues Eric Idle (“My finest time with Terry was playing Ratty to his Toad in his movie of The Wind in the Willows”), Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam.Jones’s brain was flash-frozen and donated to science, which itself sounds like the beginning of another Monty Python sketchSeriously Silly begins with Jones’s early childhood in Wales, before the family moved – to his lasting disgruntlement – to Surrey. Thence he rises smoothly to Oxford, where the author identifies some early influences on his subject’s comic style. Graham Midgley, one of his English tutors, followed up his lecture “Minor Poets of the 18th century” with an addendum unimprovably entitled “18th-century poets More Minor Still”. Jones gets involved with the Oxford Revue, with transfers to London, and before the reader can blink he and Palin are jobbing comedy writers at the BBC. The other future Pythons heave slowly into view, all working on this and that in different combinations before they come together as a boyband of six.After an impressively productive and carnivalesque career, the book ends, as all biographies must do, in decline and ill-health, though not before Jones begins an affair with an Oxford student 40 years his junior, later to become his second wife. In his last years, frontotemporal dementia gradually deprived him completely of speech, but Ross would still join him to nurse a half of ale in the pub, and the moving contributions here from friends and family testify to what Ross calls his “power of loyal friendship”. Michael Palin says: “The loveliest of collaborations was working with Terry. It just sort of grew and grew through a friendship. Terry was a chum. That’s the word for it. It’s a special thing. A chum is different from a friend. And Terry was a chum.” Upon his final expiration, Jones’s brain was flash-frozen and donated to science, which itself sounds like the beginning of anotherMonty Pythonsketch.Readers may be particularly intrigued, indeed, by the stories here about Python or Python-adjacent projects that, thanks to the vagaries of TV and film commissioning, never happened. Jones originally considered making the film of Erik the Viking with the Muppets, which would surely have been magical. In the 1990s, there was talk of making Monty Python and the Last Crusade, “with the Pythons as aged knights and archive recordings of Graham as the voice of King Arthur’s ashes”. And now would be a good time to be able to watch the sadly aborted Monty Python’s Third World War, perhaps as a charm against having to experience it in reality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

According to one historian, during the years 1617 to 1625, in Denmarka “witch” was burned every five days. The first time this happens in Danish author Olga Ravn’s fourth novel, the condemned woman is “tied to the ladder, and the ladder pushed into the bonfire”. Her daughter watches as she falls, her eye “so strangely orange from within. And then in the heat it explodes.”The child is watched, in turn, by a wax doll who sees everything: everything in this scene, and everything everywhere, through all space and all the time since it was fashioned. It sees the worms burrowing through the soil in which it is buried; the streets of the world in which it was made. It inhabits the bodies that walked those streets: “And I was in the king’s ear, and I was in the king’s mouth, and I was in the king’s loose tooth and in the quicksilver of his liver, and did hear.”On a basic level, the wax child is a useful narrative device. But it also complicates everything. The temptation, from the distance of the 21st century, is to assume charges against so-called witches to be baseless. But in this case, a well-known one in Denmark, the charges included the making of wax children – and Ravn begins with Christenze Krukow, a real Danish noblewoman who wasaccused of witchcraft three timesduring her lifetime, making this wax baby.In the 17th century magic was as much a part of the warp and weft of life as Christianity, if more secret. Ravn intersperses her narrative with spells taken directly from “black books” and grimoires. They are strange, but only really in the way that the deep beliefs of another time and place are strange; it is striking how often they are not about causing harm, but warding it off: attempts to neutralise anger, divine if an ill person might live or die, or will others to be kind.And then there are the everyday magics, which to the authorities were perhaps most threatening of all: of women working together, gutting fish, carding wool; women protecting each other, trying to intervene when one of them, Elisabeth, is beaten by her husband. The magic of friends, of laughter and dancing and love and a shared glass of wine. “Will you come with us to the Lucia fest, Elisabeth? Magic is possible. Laughter is possible. There is a way out, Elisabeth, there is a way out …” It isn’t entirely innocent, of course, and not all of it is kind. Lucia fest happens on a midwinter nightwhen dark spirits were said to roam; the wax child is sharp with nail parings and hair and scraps of metal.There is an argument that this type of feminine group magic is a form of psychological release in a world where this was hard to come by; it certainly stands in stark contrast to the public male narrative according to which the women are tried. “They consulted their books of demonology, and there read:The woman is more easily tempted by Satan, for she is weaker than the man in body and soul … When a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil…” Christenze and her friends don’t stand a chance.At its best The Wax Child is richly evocative, beautiful, creepy and visceral. At other times, there’s a bit too much research just out of sightOn the surface, Ravn’s three novels translated into English so far are quite different; The Wax Child was preceded by the brilliant International Booker-shortlistedThe Employees, set on a 22nd-century spaceship, andMy Work, a contemporary autofiction about motherhood that shares much in preoccupation and tone with Rachel Cusk. But all are novels of ideas – which is not the same as being abstract: one of Ravn’s great strengths is her harnessing of the close quotidian (breastfeeding, fish gutting) to existential vastnesses, often in the same sentence. So The Employees aimed to think through what Earth means to us; what is it to be human, what is love, what is worth living for? My Work enacted the fundamental self-estrangement, for many women, of becoming a mother; how a mother is made in the act of birth, and how a writer can be made in the act of writing about birth. In The Wax Child we see how a so-called witch is made along with a wax baby, or substitute child; how an act of witness can also be an act of creation.Ravn began as a poet, and even in English this lineage is clear. Her work asserts that knowledge inheres in objects, comprehension through smell and taste and blood and guts; through metaphor. “How do I know this?” demands the wax child, at one point. “It is like a gash in me to know it.”At times this physical knowledge begins to achieve a kind of all-pervading, shifting synaesthesia. “I see the king with the smell of the eye,” says the wax child. “Listening, I hear time as a clearing among trees.” The novel is full of things, and the power of things; it could be said that spells work by harnessing this power. Accusations of devilment cite the misuse of things: “Wax, thread, scissors, coin, nails, hair, the foreheads of the dead …”At its best The Wax Child is richly evocative, beautiful, creepy and visceral. “It is the darkest of times, December. From the curvature of the earth, minutes run like droplets from the day.” At other times, there’s a bit too much research just out of sight; the novel can feel elliptical, even baffling. One misses the space, the clarity and freedom of The Employees. But maybe that’s the thing about weaving spells. About poetry, too: demand it makes neat sense, and you begin to have too much in common with the witch-hunters.The Wax Child by Olga Ravn, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Viking (£14.99).

A jungle floats in the darkness on three big screens. Each depicts a riot of giant ferns, vine-tangled tree-trunks and sun-struck foliage in layered, dank profusion. With their jumbles of weathered rock, mossy wetness and tropical vegetation, you can lose yourself in these scenes. But, as I look, mist wafts over a patch of dense greenery as if someone out-of-shot were making with the plant spray.I’m reminded of those unconvincing jungles in movies and on TV, where the plants have been trucked-in from some garden centre warehouse and arranged on set. Only the camera angles and clever editing stop us from recognising the artifice of it all. In the foreground on one of the screens, you can see rivulets crossing what appears to be a floor of waterproof matting. A small puddle is also forming at my feet. Either the film is leaking, though that seems unlikely, or water is dripping from the ceiling. Through the day, I’m told, the water slowly inundates the sheets of metal that cover portions of the floor, but I arrived too early for the flood.View image in fullscreenAs you watch, the jungle deconstructs … The Story of Fixity.Photograph: Noémie Goudal/ArtangelNoémie Goudal’sThe Story of Fixityis a complex rumination on ecosystems and water’s fundamental role. Her work involves biology and geology, scientific research and what she calls “fixed points” regarding distances and depths and human perception. I don’t understand the half of it and I’m not sure it matters. In a soundscape devised by French electronic artist and DJ Chloé Thévenin, the air is alive with insect noise and chirrupings, animal cries and calls, devolving into electronic sizzle, percussive beats and hollow echoes.Naturalism is not a preoccupation in Goudal’s art. She gives us an illusion and then she takes it away again, transforms it and turns it into something else. On screen, the jungle is fading into something that feels like a green-tinted duo-tone illustration in an old encyclopedia, or a collage of engravings thrown together in some multilayered rendition of incomprehensible fertility and chaos. This too falters, as if the ink in the images were running, or turning into watercolour that slowly runs and curdles as it dissolves.Each screen becomes a pigmented abstraction. A projected film of grey and ochre pigments, iron-rich reds and tangy yellows slowly slide down the screens. As you watch, the jungle deconstructs. The screens themselves aren’t flat, but are made from a number of relief planes whose cut edges correspond, more or less, to the shapes of the foliage and rocks projected on to them. As the natural colour slowly bleaches out of the images, the cut edges of these layered screens become more apparent.View image in fullscreenConstant flux of creation and destruction … The Story of Fixity.Photograph: Noémie Goudal/ArtangelInevitably, I think of painting, of the innumerable artists who have turned landscape into abstractions of one sort or another. Goudal’s studio-bound jungles are all artifice, and she’s only a painter in an accidental sense. Less a jungly free-for-all mode of free abstraction than a thoroughgoing dissolution of an image, there’s pleasure in seeing Goudal’s illusory world washed away. But her use of filmed dyes and pigments, and real liquid, watery paint, dripping and puddling over the floor is a bit too theatrical for its own good.Goudal’s mix of photography and film, the real and the illusory, reveals its technical complexities even as it dissolves and deconstructs itself, over and over again in 15-minute cycles. This constant flux of creation and destruction leaves me none the wiser about the processes that support life on Earth, or about how we perceive the natural world. Instead it is a sophisticated theatre, awash in its own complications. I don’t mind the immersive, but I’m not going for a swim.The Story of Fixity is an ongoing Artangel commission at Borough Yards, LondonExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtInstallationDigital artreviewsShareReuse this content"

A new six-part season following police anti-corruption investigations was today announced by the BBC.“We couldn’t be more delighted to be returning for a seventh [series],” said creator Jed Mercurio. “Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I’ve been forced to use my imagination.”The return of the three lead characters has also been confirmed. The series will starVicky McClureand Martin Compston as detective pair Kate Fleming and Steve Arnott. They are joined once more by Adrian Dunbar as Ted Hastings, the uncompromisingly moral officer whose hatred of “bent coppers” is matched only by his passion for esoteric exclamations of rage involving the phrase “wee donkey”.In a change to the format of the previous series, the plot revolves around the previous police anti-corruption unit, AC-12, having been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards. The team will investigate a detective inspector who’s accused of being a sexual predator in an environment the BBC describe as one where “anticorruption work has never been more difficult”.“As we count down the AC-12 days of Christmas what a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year,” said Dunbar.“Line of Duty has been a job of a lifetime,” said Compston. “I can’t wait to pull the waistcoat on again and get the team back together.”The actor playing the suspect hasn’t yet been revealed. However, the show has a habit of introducing one big-name guest star a season, with previous participants including Keeley Hawes, Kelly Macdonald, Stephen Graham and Thandiwe Newton.Public pronouncements from the cast about their desire to film an AC-12 reunion means that there have long been rumours about its return. Some outlets even reported in 2022 thata three-part miniseries was imminent. The BBC’s latest announcement is a surprise, however, given that as recently as October, McClure was pouring cold water on the prospect of a return for the show in a Radio Times interview, saying she didn’t “have any updates, I’m afraid”.“I don’t want to give anyone any false hope,” said McClure. “We’ve all been very clear that we’d absolutely love to do another series.”“Adrian [Dunbar], Martin [Compston] and I have been talking about doing a travel show together, though. If any of us ever has any spare time, we’ll do it. Line of Duty gave us two brilliant things – our careers and our friendship.”Line of Duty has been off screens since its sixth season ended in May 2021. The finale was a ratings success, with arecord 12.8 million viewerstuning in – which the BBC said was the most watched episode of any drama, excluding soaps, since modern records began in 2002.It was largelyviewed as a disappointment, however, marking a season that failed to hit the heights of previous outings. The Guardian’s TV criticLucy Mangan said of it: “At the risk of sounding like a mere embittered fan shouting at Johnny-come-latelies …man, you should have seen it back in the days when it was good.”Explore more on these topicsLine of DutyDramaTelevisionAdrian DunbarVicky McClurenewsShareReuse this content"

She was cast in the lead role in the musical Annie when she was 10, and remained in it for 18 months in New York. “I was a Broadway kid, so I’ve always dreamed about doing a show in the West End,” she said. “To get to do that in one of Shakespeares’s most famous plays under Rob’s direction with Noah will be such an exciting challenge. London theatre has this incredible energy, and I can’t wait to be a part of it.” Sink becomes the latest in a line of US stars who have made their West End debuts in recent years, including Sigourney Weaver (The Tempest), Brie Larson (Elektra) and Susan Sarandon (Mary Page Marlowe).Jupe, whose early films included the horror movie A Quiet Place, plays Hamlet in Chloé Zhao’s version of Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel Hamnetstarring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. He will make his stage debut as Romeo. “Theatre is something I’ve always been intrigued by. It seems like such a challenging and rewarding experience for an actor,” he said. “So I was very excited to hear about this project. The combination of Romeo, Rob and Sadie is an opportunity you simply cannot turn down.”Icke, whose version ofOedipuswas a hot ticket in the West End and is now on Broadway, said that Romeo and Juliet is “an explosive play, filled with heat and life, which confronts us with the fragility of our lives are and the momentousness of every last second”. He added: “This is one of the plays I’ve returned to again and again, and the opportunity to tackle it in London with two wonderful young actors is hugely exciting.” Icke directed Romeo and Julietin 2012for Headlong theatre company, and was acclaimed for his 2017 Almeida theatre production of Hamlet,starring Andrew Scott.‘It’s time for it to end’: the stars of Stranger Things open up about their final, epic seasonRead moreRomeo and Juliet will have a set and costumes designed by Hildegard Bechtler, one of Icke’s regular collaborators, and will run at the Harold Pinter theatre from 16 March to 6 June. By thenStranger Thingsfans will know the fate of Sink’s character, Max, who was left in a coma at the end of season four. The new season of Stranger Things begins later this month, followed by three episodes on Boxing Day and the finale on New Year’s Day.While that series was in post-production, Sink starred in the playJohn Proctor Is the Villain, a high-school riff on Arthur Miller’s The Crucible – a performance that earned her a Tony award nomination. John Proctor Is the Villain is transferring from Broadway to London’s Royal Court, with its cast yet to be announced, and will open within a week of Romeo and Juliet.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndRobert IckeRomeo and JulietStranger ThingsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

When I hear a phrase in my head it is free of the confines of bar lines, but, in practical application, eventually it needs to get squeezed into recognisable shapes and containers. Every composer has their own strategy (some eschew bar lines entirely, or use alternative notational strategies outside the traditional western systems), but it’s always a negotiation: does the way the composer notates the rhythm correspond to how it should best appear on the flute player’s music stand?I have distinct memories of being 13, hearing a piece (specifically, Stravinsky’s Symphony in Three Movements), basically memorising it from the recording, and then being absolutely shocked when I finally saw the score. “That’s where the downbeat is?!” Stravinsky’s sense of time and my understanding of the same were at variance in a way I still find exciting: the idea that there are infinite superimpositions of a practical system (notation) over a medium (sound) most often experienced by an audience without the score. Understanding that notating rhythm is artificial yet crucial requires both personal precision and empathy with future interpreters.View image in fullscreenMaud Le Pladec’s Veins of Water, part of Marking Time triple bill.Photograph: Ecoute Cherie/Ecoute Cherie/PR HandoutWatching a dance rehearsal as a score-addicted musician is surreal. You can have 30 people in the room, and only two of them will have the score. What is fascinating is that the choreographer has imposed an entirely different, invisible form of notation on the form of their counting, which, in consort with the music, becomes what the dancers memorise and take into their bodies. What I find the most interesting is how the choreographers’ counting system interacts with the score: if my system of notation can feel like dividing a loaf of bread into slices this big or that big, often the dancers are feeling larger, more structural counts. I could have 16 fussy little bars of varying lengths, equalling about 30 seconds, which they will mysteriously but magically hear, and feel, as two cycles of 11 equal beats. Eavesdropping, you’ll hear dancers say “OK, so there’s thatpasdechatafter the three eights, then five … six … seven …” which is a fantastic alternative cartography.I don’t find this reality to be at variance with my own sense of time. Indeed, I have found myself, with over 20 years’ experience working with choreographers, learning so much more about the lengths of phrase and the subtle narratives they imply. I can have spent months on tiny details and can easily lose track of a bigger sense of shape, which choreographers and dancers have as a matter of physical instinct. We have a shared vocabulary (“line” or “phrase” come to mind) but I often feel humbled by their fluency in hearing, somehow, a larger heartbeat.I think about this relationship as a very zoomed-in way in which we are all mostly tethered to the Gregorian calendar, but there are superstructures and microstructures unique to different communities. Just last week, I had a meeting with a director of music at an Oxford chapel, and we spoke about a multi-year project and not a single date was mentioned – it was only “Epiphany” or “the Thursday before Trinity Sunday.” The year can have little gravitational pulls towards bank holidays, birthdays,yahrzeits;the exigencies of the garden and its various plantings and harvests can become the dominant way of dividing up time.View image in fullscreenNobodaddy by Michael Keegan-Dolan, at Sadler’s Wells, November 2024.Photograph: Emilija JefremovaMost of my work with dance comprises commissions where the dance and the music are developed together, sometimes in a round-robin way where I’ll provide some sketches, videos of movement will appear in an inbox, more sketches, and so on. I’ve found the best way to operate in that environment is to have the world’s fastest conversation about structure – Benjamin Millepied, my oldest collaborator, and I try to figure the whole thing out over a meal – followed by a list of things we both want to try out. A giantpassacagliafor me, a sextet of just men for him. A section with only metallic instruments for me, an incredibly kinetic sequence of motion against spare, severe music for him.This month, I have the enormous pleasure of havingthree works of mine choreographed by three very different choreographers: Michael Keegan-Dolan, Maud Le Pladec and Jules Cunningham. It goes without saying that their work is incredibly different, but what I’m finding most fascinating about the process is watching them juxtapose their own sense of time on the music.Michael Keegan-Dolan, for instance, has taken a piece that sets a traditional murder ballad,The Two Sisters. The narrative of the ballad is still there, sung live by the singer Sam Amidon, but what Michael has done is to impose a sort of ritual, informed by his own deep theatrical engagement with any source material. It both amplifies and offsets the patterns of the folk music in a way I could never do with music alone.Jules Cunninghamhas been working with a set of drone-based pieces. The solo lines are notated such that the rhythms are tight within the phrases, but there is room between them to play. Jules’ note to me after the first read-through with the ensemble was that they wanted a bit morebreathbefore the phrases: a comment indicated with a small exhalation. It’s a musical request (happily obeyed!) stemming directly from their own embodied experience of moving to the music. We use the same term in rehearsals (“could you just put a little bit of a breath between bar 13 and 14”) but it usually comes from a more distant or abstract musical instinct, often given top-down from the conductor or composer.View image in fullscreen‘Choreographers and composers have a shared vocabulary but I often feel humbled by their fluency in hearing, somehow, a larger heartbeat.’Nico MuhlyPhotograph: PR HANDOUTAnd Maud Le Pladec has made a piece where her trio of dancers adhere to the music in an incredibly precise way. All three movements of the music are quite fast, but sometimes, fast music can be quite slow, and slow music can be hiding a rapidly beating pulse. Her movement picks up on this, and in response, the Britten Sinfonia are invited to imbue their performance with this fast-within-slow energy, “visualising” semiquavers even though the notes they’re playing are much, much longer. It’s an interpretative strategy informed by bodies – for me it’s also a welcome change from the sometimes theoretical and arbitrary practices which can govern modern performance.The next time you find yourself at a dance show, opera or musical, take a moment and pay attention to how tightly the movement is adhering to the music. If the music feels as if it’s in comfortable cycles of four bars, is the dance reinforcing that, resisting it, or complicating it? If the music feels as if it’s floating in outer space, is the dance offering it a scaffolding?View image in fullscreenMark Morris Dance Group’s 2013 Crosswalk, which sets chamber music by Weber.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen I first moved to New York in 1999, I found myself going to dance more often than I would go to the symphony. Often, my first experience hearing a piece of music live was choreographed: I cannot think about Stravinsky’s violin concerto without seeingBalanchine’s choreographyin my head; there is a giant catalogue of chamber music which I can scarcely imagine without seeingwhatever brilliant thing Mark Morrismade out of it. I’ve also found that music to which choreographers are drawn can be found in a different aisle than whatever is at any given moment in concert halls and opera houses. Their sense of which music compels them is rooted in the body, and the immediacy of that engagement makes me hear music differently, and know it in a more complex and rich way.Marking Time: Nico Muhly / Michael Keegan-Dolan / Maud Le Pladec / Jules Cunningham and the Britten Sinfonia is atSadler’s Wells, London, from 20-22 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That made their collaboration, which will continue for three years, all the more timely, they said.The play, A Trial – after An Enemy of the People, is being staged by the celebrated Brazilian director Christiane Jatahy, who has previously worked closely with all three festivals. She said the play was informed by modern battles with fascism.In a joint press conference with the three festivals, Jatahy said Brazil had suffered very recently with the authoritarianism of former president Jair Bolsonaro, while theCop30climate talks in Belém in Amazonia had been the stage for environmental conflict, with Indigenous leaders fighting security guards for access to the talks.The Bolsonaro regime was a “horrible moment”, she said. “Fascism is everywhere now, and it’s this new fascism that used the economy and the instruments of democracy to stay in power.” This was “really understood” in Brazil, she said.Brazilians were “very connected” with the environmental and climate crises, she added. “So we really know about that. And we live this in the present moment, not in the past … how this destruction affected the very direct, personal life of the people.”She said the play featured the main protagonist of Ibsen’s play, Thomas Stockmann, who in Ibsen’s production had raised the alarm about contaminated water in his town’s spas, being put on trial.In her production, 11 audience members would act as the jury each night. While nearly all the dialogue was scripted, about 5% would be improvised, based on the actors’ interactions with the jury’s decisions.Moura, who will play Stockmann and helped write the script, became the first South American to win best actor at Cannes for the Secret Agent earlier this year, as well as winning a Golden Globe nomination for the Netflix series Narcos in 2016 and a Golden Eye award for career achievement at the Zurich film festival this year.TheEdinburgh international festivalis putting many of its tickets for The Trial on sale later this month, alongside tickets for three other major productions: the first performances in Edinburgh by theBerlin Philharmonic, regarded by many as the world’s pre-eminent orchestra, since 2006; a production of Verdi’s The Masked Ball; and a new San Francisco Ballet piece featuring an original score by the electronic music producerFloating Points.The Holland festival will be selling theirs from late November while tickets for Avignon’s performances will go on sale in coming months.Roy Luxford, the EIF’s creative director, said the bulk of next year’s festival tickets would go on sale in March as usual, but the festival needed to innovate by increasing choice. Some festivalgoers could appreciate the opportunity to plan further ahead while “these tickets would make great Christmas gifts”.Tiago Rodrigues, the director of the Festival d’Avignon, which focuses primarily on theatre and takes place in July, said their cooperation was “probably needed more than ever because of all the threats to both the economy of the arts, but also to the presence of arts in democracy”.Ibsen’s original play was prophetic, he added. “This piece deals also with ecology, with justice and with corruption, with the organisation of society. Let’s say that it’s a piece that is able to put in a nutshell many of the great issues of our day.”Despite their shared history, Emily Ansenk, the director of the Holland festival, which takes place in June, said the festivals had worked with one another in pairs before but never all three at once.“We are not afraid to put bold art and bold artists on stage, and I think that’s something where we can find each other very, very easily,” Ansenk said. “So the artistic conversation is very interesting also about our positioning. We are different from each other and we have different focus points, but in the end, we artistically really connect.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreEdinburghCop30ScotlandHenrik IbsenEuropeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Look for something light, with a low stand-over height (the height from the floor to the bottom of the bike) so that it fits a greater height range (and small riders can get their feet flat on the floor) and a proper headset with bearings rather than plastic bushings (both reduce friction but bearings are preferable becauseplastic bushings can wear out easily) as this makes the bike much more responsive and easier to learn to balance.View image in fullscreenBerg balance bike£49 at Berg£59.99 at OnBuyNot raising the next Tom Pidcock?

But if Emerald Fennell’s forthcoming adaptation is anything to go by, it’s also about bows.In thetwo-minute trailerfor the film, Cathy wears red bows and black bows, navy bows and pink bows. There are bows around garden pots, and bows around “baddy” Edgar Linton’s throat. Some bows flutter in the fell wind, others are unlaced at speed. In one memorable shot straight from the Jilly Cooper precoital playbook, a pretty white bow is cut from Cathy’s bodice using a labourer’s knife, which would be unforgivable hamminess were it not incredibly hot. Never mind that Emily Brontë rarely mentions bows in the book; that one is an entire plot device.View image in fullscreenAll tied up … Margot Robbie in Wuthering Heights.Photograph: Warner Bros./AvalonBows are, of course, not new. Victorian children wore them, Marie Antoinette wore them. So did Jojo Siwa, and Minnie Mouse. But today’s versions sometimes carry more weight. Take the Welsh rugby player Georgia Evans, who was attacked by trolls earlier this year forwearing pink hair bowsduring a game, leading to a volunteer-led “ribbon station” and more than 1,000 bows being worn in solidarity at a game against Fiji. “When we sign up to this as a professional athlete, you sign up for the scrutiny of your performance,” Evans told the BBC. “But … it’s bigger than a bow, it’s bigger than the game and it’s bigger than myself.”In 2025, bows are big, garish and ostentatious. They are the centrepiece of a look, not the accessory – see the gold Marc Jacobs dress Lily Allen wore to her album launch party, with a giant bow at the bust. The modern bow has range, too. They can be pretty and demure (seeAmanda Seyfried at the Venice film festival wrapped up like a giftin Prada), but also dark and gothy (Cynthia Erivo’s huge green velvet one at the Oscars).And it is not just celebrities: on the UK high street, Next is selling nine (nine!) different bow-covered cardigans, while M&S has two bow-festooned little black dresses for Christmas – one withsmall white bowsat the bust,the other with a big bow as the main event. AtJoseph, a white cotton tuxedo shirt comes with a detachable grosgrain bow, and I counted at least five pairs of bow-shaped earrings at Oliver Bonas and four bow hair accessories at Damson Madder. During his first womenswear collection for Dior in September – the most anticipated collection of five-figure clothes in recent times – the designer Jonathan Anderson opened the show with a white dress topped and tailed with two large organza bows. It’s no wonder the internet is calling 2025 the year of the bow-pocalypse.View image in fullscreenThe rugby player Georgia Evans was attacked by trolls for wearing pink bows during a game.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesThere is a risk of overthinking this. After all, bows are easy to tie and an affordable way to zhoosh something up, especially as we creep towards Christmas, the bow’s most riotous season. But there is something bigger at play. From the pandemic-era microtrend of cottagecore through to the tradwife, the last few years of womenswear have cycled through a strangely Arcadian idea of femininity. Dressing as a woman, or the idea of it, has changed – and bows have become a means of demonstrating femininity in the most blunted way possible.“There has been a gradual shift from women no longer feeling they have to dress like men to be taken seriously,” says Elisa De Wyngaert, a curator at Momu fashion museum in Antwerp, whose current exhibition, Girls, looks at the impact of girlhood on culture. The bow revival, she says, comes at a time when other traditionally girly items – Mary Jane shoes and white socks, for example – “have been readopted and embraced by people who see girlishness not as a weakness or lacking in intellectual rigour, but as something to be proud of”.View image in fullscreenLily Allen at her album launch party in October.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Perfect MagazineTake young designers such as Sandy Liang, Chopova Lowena and Simone Rocha, who have all made bows their trademark, popping them on grownup handbags, grungy slips and even wedding dresses. “For these designers, a bow has become a sort of code or an identity,” says the fashion historian Valerie Steele. “They are a signifier of femininity, but they are also ironic.” A pretty bow worn in an unexpected context is subversive.The Danish designer Cecilie Bahnsen knows this all too well. She designs voluminous dresses for all body shapes, using bows in place of zips and buttons, and even placing them at the shoulder of a dress to hold it together. “I like that a bow can be feminine, but frivolous, but mostly not overtly sexual,” she says. “It’s about women dressing for women.” De Wyngaert agrees: “The way bows are used today is often in contrast to something darker, a joyful element in a dark time,” she says. “They’re really not about the male gaze.”View image in fullscreenKate Garraway in a bow-adorned T-shirt, and Joe Marler in Celebrity Traitors.Photograph: PHOTOGRAPHER:/CREDIT LINE:BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryAnd yet it was men who first wore bows, when Croatian soldiers, whose uniform included a knotted scarf, inspired a new trend in Louis XIV’s court for aristocratic men to wear bows on their clothing. Then came Marie Antoinette, who really deployed the bow as a fashion item, says Dr Sarah Grant, a curator at the V&A who specialises in 18th and 19th century design. She describes Antoinette as “history’s peak bow”. “She wore them in her hair, on gowns, on her bust, and they’re woven into cushions and furniture,” says Grant. Back then it was about “showing off your finest French silks, of course”, but their placement was also strategic – “there they are, winking on typically feminine areas”.View image in fullscreenQueen of the bows … Marie Antoinette.Photograph: Christophe Fouin/© Château de Versailles, Dist. Grand Palais RMNThese days, there is rarely a red carpet without a few men bowed up to the hilt (see Andrew Garfield and Harry Styles, and Ncuti Gatwa at the Met Gala wearing an Ozwald Boateng suit and a large, detachable bow). Back in the 18th-century court, men largely wore bows for status. In today’s fashion, flouting the gender binary has become an alpha move in itself.Of course, not all bows are tied equal. In the appallingly watchable TV show All’s Fair, Sarah Paulson’s stuffy lawyer wears one around her neck that is so large she can barely see over it – apt for a character who is suffocated by her own desire to be in the girls’ club.Then there’s Kate Garraway. It would be a stretch to describe the TV anchor as a style icon, yet among Claudia Winkleman’s gothy knits and Jonathan Ross’s chaotic prints on Celebrity Traitors, it was Garraway’s strategic use of bows – a red beret covered in pink bows and a white jumper covered in delicate black ones – that jumped out. Eagle-eyed viewers spotted that the jumper was from Debenhams and the hat from H&M, real woman-of-the-people stuff. But others saw something else: a contestant on a show that hinges on players forming robust alliances, desperately trying to soften her imageby using one of the most loaded accessories in the history of fashion. The bow seemed to say Garraway “doeshave a softness – we’ve just missed it”, says de Wyngaert.View image in fullscreenNcuti Gatwa in Ozwald Boateng at this year’s Met Gala.Photograph: Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty ImagesIn all this, it’s easy to forget that bows are also just a way of tying something. “Bows have always been decorative and feminine,” says Bahnsen. “Personally, I use them as an adjustment system to change the shape or size of something.” The Danish designer would always choose a bow over a button or a zip: “A big bow around the waist can completely change a garment.”But even that comes back to sex. “Yes, they’re a way of closing or opening something, but depending on where the bow is, you can’t escape from the fact that you’re tying yourself up as a gift for someone,” says Steele. “It’s a gender signifier but also an erotic signifier – a bow says: untie me!.”Explore more on these topicsAccessoriesWomenWuthering HeightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can I cook to please us both?Victoria,by email“I have three words for you, Victoria,” says Anna Ansari, author ofSilk Roads, who grew up in a predominantly vegetarian household: “Di si xian.” Typical of northern China, this stir-fry of aubergine, potato and peppers (otherwise known as the “three treasures”) is laced with soy, Shoaxing wine, white pepper, sugar, cornflour and, in Ansari’s case,doubanjiang. She also adds tofu (the fourth treasure, if you will) for “a rounded, one-pot/wok dinner” to eat with steamed rice. “It reminds me of being a teenager in Beijing, far from home and in need of warmth and comfort,” she says, and we could all do with some of that right now. “It’s also cheap as proverbial chips, not to mention quick to make, and it will knock both your socks off. Promise.”Mushrooms could also pave the way to harmonious dining. “Surely they’re the closest thing to a natural meat substitute,” says Zak Hitchman, chef/owner ofOtherin Bristol. He’d be inclined to layer them up in a lasagne: “Slice a load of mixed mushrooms [chestnut, shiitake, oyster], then saute them in oil and butter with some seasoning.” Next, fry onion, garlic, celery, diced carrot, maybe some rosemary or thyme, until softened, then return the cooked mushrooms to the pot with some tinned tomatoes and tomato puree. “You could bulk it out with tinned lentils,” he says, but either way be sure to include a splash of soy and some miso for “that meaty flavour”, plus any vinegar you have knocking around “for balance”. Cook slowly until reduced, then layer between driedlasagnesheets. “Top that with bechamel [or simply dollop on some mascarpone] and lots of grated parmesan [a vegetarian one, if need be]. Drizzle with olive oil and bake until the pasta is soft, the sauce bubbling and the top golden.”Rob Howell, chef/patron ofRoot, which recently opened in Bath, also suggests smoothing relations with mushrooms: “Roast a load of them with warming spices [cumin, coriander, allspice] and oil in a hot oven, then skewer for akebabvibe.” Grill and brush with molasses or “anything a bit soy, a bit sweet, a bit umami”, and serve with flatbread, tahini yoghurt, herbs and pickled red cabbage.We all know that the key to any healthy relationship is compromise, so dinners that welcome a bit of meat or fish plonked alongside are also good to have in your back pocket. You could, Howell suggests, combine butter beans and roast cauliflower puree “for a take on cauliflower cheese”, or cook borlotti beans with veg, blend and top with grilled onions, hazelnut salsa and chilli. Risottos also fall into this happy camp, with pumpkin/squash roasted, mashed and stirred through arborio rice topping Hitchman’s list. Serve sprinkled with roast chestnuts and pumpkin seeds, plus a chicken thigh or pork chop for the boyfriend.Otherwise, Ansari would be inclined to do a dumpling date: “Roll out the dough, stuff the dumplings – I’m into ground lamb and onion, and mushroom and tofu – grab a drink while they steam, then smother them in browned butter.” There is one final option, Ansari says: “Dump the guy?” Although, surely everyone loves a dumpling, so maybe give those a go first.Got a culinary dilemma?

I would recommend eating this with fluffy white bread (or khanom pang, sweet bread), grilled onions and smoky tomato chilli sauce for a seriously jazzed up “Bunnings” snag.Prep20 minCook15 minServes42 tbspvegetable oil1 large onion, sliced into rings1 tbspsoy sauce4 slices white bread, to serveSmoky tomato chilli sauce, to serve (recipe below)Corianderto garnish (optional)For the sausage mince500gpork mince2 tbspfish sauce2 tbspfinely chopped lemongrass1 tbspcrushed garlic1 tbspfinely chopped corianderstems1 tbspsoy sauce1 tspsugar½ tspwhite pepper1 tbspfinely shredded makrut lime leaves4 sausage casings, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes (optional)First, prepare the sausages. Preheat your barbecue or grill to a medium heat. Combine all the sausage mince ingredients thoroughly, then with damp hands form into sausage shapes about 10 to 12cm long, pressing together firmly so they won’t fall apart during grilling. If using sausage casings, rinse them thoroughly after soaking and fill with the sausage mince (use a sausage stuffer or a piping bag fitted with a large nozzle), then prick a few small holes in each to avoid bursting while grilling. Grill the sausages for 10 to 15 minutes, turning regularly until fully cooked and slightly charred on the outside.Next, fry the onions. While the sausages cook, heat the oil in a frying pan and add the sliced onions. Brush with the soy sauce and stir-fry for five to seven minutes until caramelised and slightly charred.To serve, place a grilled sausage on a slice of white bread and add a generous amount of fried onions on top. Drizzle with smoky tomato chilli sauce and garnish with fresh coriander if using, and serve immediately.Smoky tomato chilli saucePrep10 minCook15 minMakes250ml(1 cup)With the tanginess of tomatoes, the heat and smokiness often found in sriracha, plus charred chillies, this sauce is reminiscent of nam prik noom (green chilli dip).4 large red chillies(not too hot)1 tbsp vegetable oil2 tbsp crushed garlic1 small onion, finely chopped2 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped2 tbsp brown sugar2 tbsp rice vinegar(or white vinegar)1 tbsp fish sauce1 tbsp soy sauce1 tsp smoked paprika(optional, for extra smokiness)1 tsp saltOn a barbecue or open flame, char the red chillies all over until blackened (you can also use the oven grill on high heat, but make sure your kitchen is well ventilated). Allow them to cool, remove the skins (and the seeds if you want it to be less hot), then roughly chop.Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook until soft and fragrant, about two to three minutes. Add the charred chillies, tomatoes, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fish sauce, soy sauce, smoked paprika and salt. Stir to combine.Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have broken down and the sauce has thickened. Reduce for longer if you want to intensify the sauce. Transfer the sauce to a blender or use a hand-held blender to puree until smooth. Pass through a sieve if you want an even smoother texture.Nam prik sai oua (Sai oua curry paste)This curry paste can be stored in the fridge, in an airtight container, for up to one week, or freeze for up to 3 months.Makesabout 125g(½ cup)1 tbsp coriander seeds1 tsp cumin seeds1 tspblack peppercorns10 dried red chillies, soaked and deseeded (or to taste)3 redshallots,chopped6 garlic cloves2 tbspfinely chopped lemongrass2 tbspchopped galangal1 tbspshrimp paste1 tbspground turmeric1 tbspsaltView image in fullscreenIn a dry pan, toast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and black peppercorns until fragrant, about one to two minutes.

Life on the family farm was busy, so a pot of lamb would often be bubbling away while she worked and, by the time we all sat down for lunch, the whole house smelled incredible. November takes me straight back there. It is the month for food that warms you, dishes made to sit in the centre of the table and to bring everyone close.Lambshoulder loves a slow cook, turning soft and rich, especially when cooked withalubias blancas(white beans) to soak up the sauce, while a good splash of oloroso gives it a deeper, rounder flavour than any red wine ever could.Braised lamb and kale cazuela with white beans(alubias blancas)Prep15 minCook3 hr 20 minServes64 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper1.2kg lamb shoulder, cut into chunks1 large onion, peeled and finely sliced5 garlic cloves, unpeeled but bashed open2 tsp smoked sweet pimentón1 small handful fresh thyme and oregano leaves200ml oloroso400g tin chopped tomatoes500ml good chicken stock1 tbsp plain flour2400g tins butter beans, drained and rinsed250g curly kale, tough stems removed and discardedHeat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2.Put a tablespoon of the olive oil in a large casserole on a medium heat. Season the lamb, then fry it in batches until nicely browned all over, adding more oil as necessary (you’ll probably need another two tablespoons’ worth). As each batch of meat is browned, scoop it into a large bowl.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same casserole and fry the onion, stirring to lift all the gnarly brown bits off the base and sides of the pan, for about five minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, pimentón and herb leaves, stir for a minute, until fragrant, then pour in the sherry and leave to bubble away for a minute or two.Return the meat to the pan, then tip in the tomatoes and stock, and season with black pepper and some more salt. Cover the pot, bring the mix to a boil, then transfer the pot to the oven and leave to cook for two and a half hours, until the meat is lovely and tender.Take the pot out of the oven and leave to stand for five or so minutes, until the fat rises to the surface. Scoop this out with a spoon (you don’t have to get it all). Blend about a tablespoon of the fat with the flour (discard the rest), then add this paste to the lamb mix and stir it in well. Put the pan on a low heat and leave to bubble gently for about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the beans and leave to bubble gently and warm through.Meanwhile, blanch the kale in a large pan of salted boiling water for about three minutes, until tender, then drain and roughly chop. Stir the kale into the lamb mix, then serve hot with good crusty bread to mop up all those juices.Explore more on these topicsFoodSpanish food and drinkLambMeatMain courseVegetablesWinter food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Such is the case with De Alde Feanen, in Friesland. One of the most peaceful national parks in the Netherlands, this 4,000-hectare wetland slows down naturally after the summer season. Its waterways shrug off their summer flocks of kayakers, paddleboarders, boat trippers and terrace diners. Museums and galleries close. The local tourist office winds down. Even the park’s population of nesting storks fly south.Map showing position of De Alde Feanen in northern part of the NetherlandsA 20-minute drive south-east of Leeuwarden, in the country’s north-east, the lakes, ponds, ditches and canals of “The Old Fens” are the remains of the peat-cutting that began there in the middle ages. Now awash with reeds, rushes and sedges, its watery habitats are richly biodiverse, home to more than 100 bird species as well as otters, pine martens, roe deer and dragonflies. Hay meadows and wetland forest add marsh thistle, reed orchids, alders and willows to the list. Ribboned with well-marked hiking and cycling trails, the proximity to nature draws spring and summer tourists but treasures can be found there in autumn and winter too; among them thousands of ducks and geese, and some of the starriest skies in the Netherlands.In search of a place to be rather than do, my son and I book a simple cabin, De Ooievaar (“the Stork”), with a plan to walk, cycle, read and sleep. Upcycled from an old barn during the pandemic by owner Jurjen Veldboom, the cabin’s galley kitchen and wooden sleeping platforms give it the cosy feel of a boat but it’s the picture window in its living room that sells it to us. With a sofa to one side and a wood burner on the other, it’s the perfect winter roost: a place to sit and sketch, or watch deer bouncing through the alders.View image in fullscreenWooden heart … De Ooievaar cabin.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenTo get our bearings we start with a gentle walk, spotting a white heron almost as soon as we step outside. A skein of geese skim the sky above us as we wander along a blustery 15-minute track through the reeds to the park’s gateway village, Earnewâld. Winding between its doll’s house-like buildings to thePrincenhof Hotel, we eat bowls of salty fish soup while watching the soporific ebb and flow of small cargo boats.When we arrived, Jurjen told us that canny marketeers have a new verb for winter holidaying in Friesland:opfriezenis a play on words that means embracing the cold (with the help of a cosy hot tub or sauna) in Friesland. Back at the cabin, we give it a go, slipping into the site’s sauna at dusk and listening to the soothing ticking of the heater’s timer, cocooned in its warm, timber embrace. What follows is even more uplifting, though: opening the door into the dark Friesland night, a huge gibbous moon is glowing above us, the skeins of geese replaced by stars and the cabin’s twinkling lights giving it the look of a giant gingerbread house.Opening the door into the dark Friesland night, a huge  moon is glowing above us, the skeins of geese replaced by starsThe following morning we hire two e-bikes fromHollemain Earnewâld (€25pp a day), where owner Rikele Hollema meets us with a map for a gentle 50km route looping through the eastern corner of the park and then out to the villages and forests around Beetsterzwaag.Cycling out along little paths crunchy with seashells is like pedalling through one ofJan Hendrik Weissenbruch’s paintings. Skirting low fields where the horizon is broken only by the odd birch tree or farmhouse, there’s more sky than land, and it’s filled with clouds that look like balls of scrunched-up paper, soft grey shadows tucked into creases in the white. Cycling along these flat, empty paths, hopping on and off little foot and bike ferries to cross bridge-less stretches of water, is a meditative experience. A feeling that’s later heightened when the sun emerges and we dip into forests where the light is sieved through golden beech leaves.Beyond the palatial houses of Beetsterzwaag, in Olterterp we stop atDe Witte Huisfor lunch – fat chips and bowls of mustard soup hiding slivers of sausage. It’s just the fuel we need for the long ride back along the windy polders, catching the whimsical sight along the way of three cows sailing past on a ferry, and two swans flying alongside us, their white plumage glowing against the rose gold of the rushes.View image in fullscreenWater wheel … Rhiannon’s son with his rented e-bike on a ferry.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThat evening, with Jurjen’s help, I track down Jannie Slot, project coordinator for a new mindfulness walking trail launched in the park this summer. Designed to get visitors offscreen, slowing down and reconnecting with their surroundings, those who want to try it have to borrow a physical copy of the guide and then follow its prompts as they walk the 5km route. She tells me of the tricky balance between welcoming visitors and protecting the park but believes that if people can connect with nature, they will love it and want to protect it.Cycling along these flat, empty paths, hopping on and off little foot and bike ferries to cross bridge-less stretches of water, it’s a meditative experienceFor now the guide is only available in Dutch or German but there are plans to produce an English version. Trying my best with rusty German, I leave my son sleeping and head out into the park at dawn the next day to try it out. The path leads through the reeds and forest paths behind our cabin and, as I walk, I follow the guide’s instructions to listen to the sound of the wind through the reeds. The ground is wet from overnight rain and the air is charged with the calls, rattles, clicks and chitter of blackbirds, goldcrests, reed buntings, wigeon and geese. At various points, I’m encouraged to do some gentle yoga, standing in poses inspired by birds or trees, or to look more deeply at the landscape. It’s not hard this morning. The rising sun is suspended in the ditches around me, coating the water with an ethereal bronze glow.View image in fullscreenLake placid … De Alde Feanen national park.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThe route leads to an observation tower and when I reach the top, it feels as if I’m at the very soul of the national park, a million shades of sugary golden brown spilling out around me. Towns glimmer on the horizon and a distant road rumbles, but here the hush is broken only by two geese honking away at eye level, and the reflective glint of a nearby windmill.Later, over coffee, I read that one of the park’s key plants is frogbit. In summer it floats above the water but in winter it retracts below, freezing until the spring, when it re-emerges in search of sunlight. The guide tells me: “It’s also very important, of course, for humans to slow down, take a breath, reflect and rest.” But De Alde Feanen has already taught me that.Transport from London to Amsterdam was providedEurostar, which is launching afifth direct weekday service on 15 December; advance return from £78pp. Onward travel to Earnewald by train and bus.

Plant forums are full of DIY polishing tips. One of the most popular? Banana peel.ThehackRub the inside of a banana peel on to your plant’s leaves to clean them and leave a glossy sheen. Some swear by it as a natural – and free – alternative to chemical leaf-shine sprays.The theoryBanana skins contain potassium and natural oils. In theory, these lift away dust while polishing, making the leaves look healthier. It’s also completely free, since it repurposes something you’d usually throw away.ThetestCurious, I tried it on a rubber plant. The shine was immediate; the leaves looked cleaner and brighter. But the peel left behind some stickiness. Within a few days, more dust clung to them than before. On textured leaves such as calatheas, it was messy, with bits of banana fibre catching in the ridges.TheverdictBanana-peel polishing is fun to try once, and briefly makes your plant look fantastic. But as a long-term strategy, it’s a no from me. A soft, damp cloth (or microfibre duster) will keep plants healthy and dust-free without any sticky side effects.Explore more on these topicsHouseplantsHouseplant hacksGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has been here before – seven weeks ago, to be precise. The second time, he says, is as terrifying as his first.Afran – not his real name – hit the headlines when he became thefirst asylum seekerto return to the UK in a small boat after being removed to France under the controversial “one in, one out” scheme on 19 September. He was sent back to Paris for the second time on 5 November.“France, UK, France, UK, France – it’s not my choice,” he says. “I went to UK twice because I felt I had no other option. The smugglers in northern France attacked me and threatened my life before I crossed to the UK for the first time on August 6. When theHome Officereturned me here the first time I believed the smugglers were still searching for me. I continue to believe that. I am frightened every time I go outside the shelter. I am not safe here.”View image in fullscreenAn asylum seeker from Iran. Human rights campaigners see the ‘one in, one out’ scheme as unduly harsh.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOP/The GuardianAfran is sitting with three other recent returnees from the UK, including the first woman removed under the scheme. Soon after they speak, the policy will be followed by draconian measures that the government says will deter asylum seekers from crossing the Channel in small boats. But the group’s stories – of danger, dislocation and a lack of protection even after removal – are a stark illustration of how those theories of deterrence can collide with the desperate logic of survival.Even before the latest measures, the scheme has proved highly controversial. The right view it as ineffective, with just 113 returns toFranceso far and 84 asylum seekers allowed to come the other way. On Friday alone, 217 people made the boat crossing – doubling the number removed so far in a single day. Human rights campaigners see the scheme as unduly harsh – and arbitrary in terms of who gets to stay and who must go.The four returnees are sitting at a cafe near a vast, traffic-clogged roundabout. The shelter is close by, concealed behind an inconspicuous locked gate, tucked away at the end of a long path. It is a marquee-type structure with single beds crammed together and the second in a series of staging posts for those returned to France – first a hotel for a few days, then here, then different temporary accommodation in different parts of the country.Eventually, some will be returned to other EU countries under the Dublin rules , which allow EU countries to request the return of an asylum seeker to the first member nation where they were fingerprinted. They say the chances of building a new, safe life in France appear slim and that their future is as uncertain as it was the day they fled their home country.Afran pushes fish fingers aimlessly around his plate and sips tea. The group, thrown together by circumstances, wear a jumble of donated tracksuits and lack weatherproof shoes and warm coats. All of them in turn laugh hysterically and weep at the hopelessness of their situation.“I know the security now in the detention centre I’ve been locked up in twice,” Afran says. “I told them I’ll be back for Christmas.” He laughs hollowly and then starts to cry.On the other side of the Channel, another man, an Eritrean, is awaiting his fate in a detention centre. He was the second to return to the UK after being forcibly removed to France. When he was detained the first time,he told the Guardianthat he was frantic with worry and unable to eat or sleep.View image in fullscreenA police officer looks on as people try to board a small boat in Gravelines, France, earlier this month.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAHe says he came back to the UK again because he felt unsafe in France. After getting medical help for several conditions from a charity in Paris, he returned to his shelter late and was refused entry because the gates were already locked. Forced to sleep outside, he says he was attacked by two men on the street, and left because he was frightened.“I was in shock after the attack,” he says. ”I called my family and told them about the bad things that had happened to me. They arranged for me to return to the UK in a small boat because they understood that France was not safe for me.”He adds: “I have suffered a lot and am terrified of being forced back to France. If the security at the Paris shelter had allowed me back inside when I returned from the medical appointment I would not have been attacked on that night – it was 23 October – and I would still be in France now. Because of the bad experience I had I no longer believe France can protect me.”Documents seen by the Guardian, written before he was removed to France, show that a detention centre doctor judged his account – that he had been trafficked and tortured in Libya after fleeing Eritrea and before first reaching the UK – to be “consistent with torture”.Lochlinn Parker, the acting director of the charity Detention Action, says: “In their rush to remove those seeking asylum to France, the Home Office is depriving them of the chance to explain their circumstances and is causing extreme distress. The result is that some of the most vulnerable, including survivors of trafficking, are being detained for long periods in prison-like conditions, and face the terrifying prospect of removal by physical force.”The charity Medical Justice surveyed 33 people detained for one in, one out. Twenty among them had expert medical reports conducted. Of this group, 17 were torture survivors and 14 trafficking survivors, with 15 of them suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.The three male asylum seekers around the table in the Paris cafe are protective of the woman who is with them. “Why did they send a woman back to France? This is really bad,” Afran says.“Even the security staff in the UK were shocked the Home Office was sending me back to France,” the woman says. She describes persecution in Eritrea because of her Christian faith, and says that she travelled through many countries in Africa andEuropeon her way to the UK, where her brother lives.View image in fullscreenA female asylum seeker from Eritrea holds up the diary she has kept of her experiences.Photograph: Julien Daniel/MYOP/The Guardian“It was very difficult and I had to be strong,” she says. “When I reached the UK I thought I would be safe, but they locked me up in a detention centre. The country I thought would be a haven for me was the first one to lock me up. They took my strength away. I am not asking for a passport from the UK, I just want to be safe and to be with my family.”Detention is an experience that all of those around the table say has been crippling.“I witnessed four people attempting suicide,” says a Syrian man. “We were released from the hands of the smugglers into a prison in the UK. I have been running since 2018. All I want to do is to stop.” Another man, from a former Soviet republic, describes one in, one out as a “political football”. He adds: “We’re not stupid. We know we are being used as the ball.”Within a few days, Afran will be on the move again, sent by train to new temporary accommodation in another part of France. At the cafe, he sits with his head in his hands. “For all of us there is no safe place to go,” he says. “If I had been safe in Iran I never would have left my life there and my family.“Before I came to the UK my mental health was normal. Now it is not. I do not know where I can go or what I can do to be safe. The Home Office is no good for humans. They have broken me. They have finished my life.”"

At 19, it was the first and only time anything like that had happened to her. “When I came to, I couldn’t work out who he was, where I was, what was going on. And it was utterly terrifying.”She had not asked to be strangled, or “choked” as it is often called, but the encounter had been consensual and she says she had accepted being strangled as “a normal part” of sex.“You create a narrative in your head where you wanted it or it’s a good thing or it’s OK, because you don’t want to face the fact that somebody could have hurt you in that way,” she says.She realises now she should have seen a doctor after the seizure, but the man “persuaded me not to because he didn’t want to get into trouble and I was worried about being shamed in some way”.The first major study on strangulation during sex found that more than half of people under the age of 35 had experienced it and it was common among teenagers as young as 16 who had seen it in porn and on social media.Despite being a profoundly unsafe practice that carries the risk of brain injury – even when there are no physical signs – and death, many people still believed it could be done safely, the study found.Sophie, now 21, says the proliferation of violent porn among her generation means they have grown up with “such a warped perception of intimacy”, and she feels the problem is only getting worse. “I can only imagine the anxiety I’d have in the future if I have girls,” she says.Other women described similar encounters, some that happened repeatedly during long relationships.Carrie*, who lives in the US, where the government is considerably slower to act on the multibillion-dollar violent pornography industry, says she first experienced strangulation at a “vulnerable” time in her early 20s, with a much older partner who had a powerful job.“He had said ‘Do you agree to submit to me?’ and I said yes, but I didn’t really know what that meant. I didn’t know what I was agreeing to. And then he was very violent with me, more than I expected. And I was really afraid. I was panicked,” she says.“I remember, frequently he would be strangling me, and I would be fighting to stay awake. And I felt like I was fighting to keep my eyes open. And sometimes that was something that I could not do. And then afterwards I would feel very dazed and sometimes, like, off balance. I would almost struggle to walk. And then it would be like I was, like, mentally slow for a couple days afterwards.”She looked online and discovered she had probably suffered injuries to her brain, and she says that was what gave her the courage to end the relationship. “[I thought] if only I had known this sooner, maybe I would have left sooner,” she says.Later on, she dated other men who put their hands on her throat, but when she said she didn’t like it they backed off. “I would guess they got the idea from porn.”Porn featuring strangulation and suffocation is due to be banned in the UK by the end of the year, meaning tech platforms will have a legal obligation to stop UK users seeing that content.Laura* says she knew her partner of more than a decade enjoyed watching violent pornography. “It was, I think, the only thing that could excite him – which is really worrying – and that’s what he got used to.”She would often feel dizzy while it was happening and was strangled unconscious multiple times during sex. “I realised he had no idea about the fact that any of those times he could have killed me,” she says.“I kept going back because of course I just was in such a huge amount of denial around it all. I think because it’s so traumatic and it’s so frightening, you almost get amnesia around it.”The last time they had sex he used a ligature to strangle her – something common in porn. “I knew instantly that I was starting to have a seizure and then I woke up on the floor,” she says.It was after that escalation that she found the courage to leave. Like Sophie and Carrie, Laura did not see a doctor. She says: “I would urge anyone that happened to, to go and get medical attention because it can cause strokes in the following days and weeks.”Laura, who is now in her 30s, suffers from memory issues and fatigue, problems that are common among women who have experienced “choking”. “I get a lot of headaches. I get weakness. I have a lot of tinnitus, light headedness, all sorts of things like that.”She gets support from the Brain Injury Association, which helps people who have suffered anoxic and hypoxic brain injury.The women who spoke to the Guardian all said they felt it was about power and control for the men who strangled them, and that these men got sexual gratification from hurting or frightening them. However, research shows some men also feel pressed into strangling a sexual partner. And while there is a gender divide – it is most commonly men strangling women – women are the perpetrators in a sizeable minority of cases.Sophie says that after the experience with the man who gave her a seizure, it was “refreshing” to meet her current partner.She says: “When we first started going out, I would have been like ‘Oh, you can choke me if you want to’, and he would say: ‘Why would I do that? I don’t want to do that. I care about you.’”*All names have been changedExplore more on these topicsSexual healthSexual consentSexViolence against women and girlsPornographynewsShareReuse this content"

They were there to discuss one urgent question: how to save the planet’s last great tropical forests from accelerating destruction.For those present, the question was existential. But to their dismay, almost no one noticed. “There was very little acknowledgment that this was happening, outside of the Congo basin region,” says Prof Simon Lewis, a lecturer at the University of Leeds and University College London, and co-chair of theCongo Basin Science Initiative(CBSI).“It didn’t really fly as a conference or a set of policy proposals to better invest in that region of the world.”The people of the Congo basin have tightened their belts so that the world can breathe – and we receive no compensationArlette Soudan-NonaultDespite being the second-largest rainforest on Earth – and one of the most vital carbon sinks – the Congo basin remains the rainforest the world forgot, often overlooked when it comes to global climate policy and funding.Spanning six countries across centralAfricaand home to roughly 130 million people, the basin is often called the “lungs of Africa”. Its vast canopy shelters thousands of rare species.“It has about 10,000 plant species and 30% of these can only be found in the region,” says Dr Yadvinder Malhi, a leading ecologist at Oxford University. Unlike the Amazon, the Congo’s forests remain largely intact – home to endangered animals such as forest elephants, okapis, mountain gorillas and bonobos.Its significance extends far beyond its borders. The basin’s rainfall feeds main river systems across the continent, sustaining life as far away as the Sahel.View image in fullscreenA forest elephant in the Lekoli River, Republic of the Congo. Rainfall in the Congo basin feeds river systems across Africa.Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images/Getty“Africa is largely an arid continent,” says Malhi. “This fountain of water in the heart of the continent circulates and [also] ends up feeding into the Nile. That sustains the lives of millions of people.”Crucially, while encroachments of logging and mining are increasing, much of the forest remains untouched. As a result, the Congo basin is believed to be thelast big rainforest to remain a strong carbon sink– with enough trees left to absorb more carbon than it emits.View image in fullscreenLogging is rising but much rainforest remains untouched.Photograph: Alamy“It’s what we believe,” says Lewis. “But we are lacking recent data to see if that is still the case. We know carbon-absorption rates have declined in the Amazon in the last decade or so, but we’re not sure what’s happening in the Congo now.”In areportreleased on Monday, as theCop30 climate conferencebegan in Belém, the Science Panel for the Congo Basin found that the Congo basin absorbs 600m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, but this number is falling due to accelerating deforestation. Prof Bonaventure Sonké, co-chair of the panel, said the researchers hoped it would bring international attention and support for “the Earth’s most important but least-studied tropical rain forest”.While scientists agree on the Congo basin’s critical importance, it continues to be funded at a far lower rate than its counterparts. A report published earlier this year by the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) revealed the scale of the financial imbalance.Between 2008 and 2022, the world’s three main rainforest regions received a combined total of $20bn (£15bn) in international funding. Of that, $9.3bn (47%) went to the Amazon basin, $7.4bn (37%) to south-east Asia, and only $3.2bn (16%) to the Congo basin.Germany was the leading donor for central Africa during this period, providing 24% of total funding, followed by the Global Environment Fund (12%), the World Bank (9.4%), and the US (8.8%). Most of the money (30%) went towards biodiversity protection, with another 27% supporting environmental policy. Yet funding for scientific research accounted for just 0.1%.“The basin countries don’t prioritise research,” says Dr Richard Sufo Kankeu, a scientist at ​CIFOR-ICRAF​ and one of the report’s authors.View image in fullscreenLoango national park in Gabon, which forms part of the Congo basin, the world’s second-largest rainforest.Photograph: Lee Dalton/AlamyThe result is a wide gap in scientific understanding. A2023 studyexamining relative levels of climate and biodiversity research on different rainforests found about 2,000 published academic papers for the Congo basin, compared with 10,611 for the Amazon.“You’ve got this critical ecosystem, but there just aren’t enough local scientists working to understand it,” says Lee White, an honorary professor at the University of Stirling and former environment minister in Gabon.White and Lewis have recommended that Congo basin countries aim to train at least 1,000 PhD-level scientists over the next decade to strengthen regional expertise. But better funding is also needed now.“We don’t want to wait 10 years,” says Raphael Tshimanga, a professor of hydrology and water at the University of Kinshasa, and co-chair of CBSI. “It needs to start happening now. How does this happen? By mobilising human resources and attracting funding. We don’t just want nice speeches at summits.”Part of the reason for the lack of resources lies in an enduring perception of the region asJoseph Conrad’s “‘heart of darkness’”, says White. “Central Africa has this reputation as a place of corruption and instability.”View image in fullscreenThe canopy in Republic of the Congo’s Odzala-Kokoua park.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyCorruption is a significant concern in the region,particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC) – however, it can also be wielded as an easy excuse for lack of investment.The Republic of Congo’s environment minister, Arlette Soudan-Nonault, describes that view as “the tree that hides the forest”, adding: “It’s very easy and lazy to say that Africans are corrupt.”Beyond reputation, there are obstacles such as security, infrastructure and capacity. The DRC, which contains about 60% of the basin’s rainforest, has endured intermittent conflict for more than three decades.Bonobos transformed how we think about animal societies. Can we save the last of the ‘hippy apes’?Read more“It’s not just an issue of instability,” Soudan-Nonault says. “We need to look at ways of creating sustainable economic growth.”While the Congo basin is often seen as humanity’s last line of defence against human-made climate breakdown, deforestation in the region has begun to rise. “It is the last frontier of climate change,” the minister says. “Supporting the Congo basin is not charity. It’s about recognising its role in protecting the Earth through its carbon sink.“The people of the Congo basin have tightened their belts so that the world can breathe – and we receive no compensation.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageThis article was amended on 18 November 2025 to add that Richard Sufo Kankeu is a scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry and to remove an incorrect reference to him being a lecturer at Le Mans University.

In 2024, more than 367,000 tourists visited the reserve, a rise of almost two-thirds compared with the previous year.Guillermo Ruiz, presidential delegate for the province of Ultima Esperanza, told reporters that the tourists became lost near the park’s Los Perros camp, reachable only by a four- to five-hour trek from the closest accessible point by vehicle.November is late spring in the southern hemisphere, with the busiest months in Torres del Paine coming in the summer months between December and February.Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, offered his condolences to the victims’ families in the “tragedy”, and paid tribute to the rescue teams who had “worked tirelessly from the very beginning in the search, rescue, and now evacuation efforts”.A spokesperson from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office could not yet confirm the identity of the woman, but said: “We are in contact with the local authorities following an incident in Chile.”Explore more on these topicsChileAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said on Monday, adding that he’s “not happy with Mexico” and that the US government has drug corridors from Mexico “under major surveillance”.Sheinbaum said that theTrump administrationlater clarifiedit would only intervene with Mexico’s permission.“We are not going to ask for it because we do not want intervention from any foreign government,” she said.Sheinbaum denies reports US will send troops to Mexico: ‘It’s not going to happen’Read moreSheinbaum pointed to the 19th-century Mexican-American war as a warning of what could happen if US troops were allowed into Mexico: “The last time the United States came to intervene in Mexico, they took half of the territory.”Sheinbaum, who took power a few months before Trump returned to the White House, hasreceived plauditsfor her calm but firm handling of bilateral relations under intense pressure.Earlier this month, she denied reports that Washington planned to send troops into Mexico, noting that she had repeatedly rejected such offers from Trump. “We do not agree with any process of interference or interventionism,” she said.Nonetheless, Trump continues to demand that Mexico, the largest trade partner of the US, do more to reduce the flow of drugs and migrants across the US-Mexico border.“I have great respect for the president, a woman that I think is a tremendous woman,” Trump said of Sheinbaumin October. “She’s a very brave woman, but Mexico is run by the cartels.”Trump’s latest threat comes as he amasses an armada that includes the USS Gerald Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, in the southern Caribbean, close to Venezuela.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A newVenezuelais emerging from the ashes, renewed in spirit and united in purpose, like a phoenix reborn – fierce, radiant, and unstoppable,” wrote Machado, who claims to have a plan for the first 100 hours and 100 days after Maduro leaves power.Is US preparing to attack Venezuela and how has Maduro regime responded?Read moreMachado, who has not provided specific details of those plans, claimed a change of regime would protect Venezuela from “future oppressive tyrannies, dictatorships, and despots” and create a country where government opponents could “walk from the shadows without dread”.“The criminal regime must be held accountable,” for its brutality, added Machado, 58, a conservative politician who wasthe surprise winnerof last month’s Nobel peace prize.She predicted Venezuela was poised for a “rebirth” after years of economic chaos, environmental destruction, violence and a mass exodus that has seen an estimated 8 million Venezuelans flee overseas. “We will bring them home,” Machado vowed.But such claims have been made many times before and it remains unclear how Machado and her allies plan to fulfil their longstanding quest to force Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, from power.Since August, Trump hasordered a massive naval buildup off Venezuela’s northern coast, seemingly hoping to spark a military rebellion against Maduro or convince him to quit. The state department announced a $50m reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest – twice the value offered for the capture of the al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. On Sunday, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, arrived in the Caribbean Sea. “Trump has put the gun on the table,” his former national security adviser, John Bolton, told CNN. “The question now is, is he going to use it against Maduro or not?”So far, however, there has been no inkling of a split in Maduro’s regime and Trump has yet to pull the trigger on further military action.Speculation that Trump was poised to order airstrikes on Venezuela reached fever pitch last weekend. “Lots of people – even high up in the opposition … were convinced that it was about to happen, that bombs were about to fall,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for the International Crisis Group, adding: “[But] the bombs didn’t fall.”On Sunday, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, announced that as of next Monday,the US would declare the Cartel of the Suns – the supposed drug cartel it accuses Maduro of running – a foreign terrorist organization, offering a potential justification for an attack. Some observers read that move as an ultimatum for Maduro to decide on his future within the week.“But we know that for Trump these deadlines don’t mean a lot. He blows through deadlines – or he short-circuits them by acting as he did in the case of Iran, [launching his June strikes on its nuclear sites] while the clock was still ticking on his deadline,” Gunson added.On Monday, Trump refused to dismiss the possibility of putting boots on the ground in Venezuela – and said he didn’t “rule out anything” – but also anticipated negotiating with Maduro. “I probably would talk to him, yeah. I talk to everybody,” the US president said.The ratcheting up of the pressure has left many South American governments on edge, fearing chaotic repercussions and bloodshed if Maduro’s regime is brought down. Given Trump’s well-known aversion to sending US troops abroad, many suspect that even if Maduro is removed – and key opposition leaders can fly home from exile – the new US-backed government will struggle to control a potentially volatile security situation or the start of an insurgency.Others believe that even if Maduro falls, his shoes might simply be filled by another even more unsavoury authoritarian.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Her commentsprompted furyfrom China’s government, which issued warnings against Chinese travellers and students going to Japan.At least seven Chinese airlines, including the three state carriers, said they would offer free cancellations to travellers with flights booked to the country.China and Japan are in a war of words over Taiwan – what happens next?Read moreOne air travel analyst, Hanming Li, said departure data suggested about 500,000 flight tickets toJapanhad been cancelled between 15 and 17 November.The Chinese outlet Jimu News reported that Sichuan Airlines had cancelled all flights between Chengdu and Sapporo from January until late March, and the budget carrier Spring Airlines had cancelled “multiple” Japan flights. Both airlines cited “company planning reasons”.China is the second largest source of tourists to Japan, and its students form the bulk of Japan’s international student cohort. Shares in Japanese retail and travel companiesslumpedon Monday in response to the measures.Li told the Guardian it was the largest mass cancellation of flights he had seen since early in the Covid pandemic but would probably have little impact on China’s domestic industry.“It is not a huge loss for airlines because the Sino-Japan market is small when comparing to the whole domestic and international market,” Li said.The travel cancellations are among a growing list of economic countermeasures after what had until Sunday beenmostly a rhetorical reaction.An operator at one Chinese travel agency said it had stopped processing individual visa applications for Chinese people travelling to Japan, and other reports noted some local-level Japan-China cross-cultural events had been cancelled.The release of an annual Japan-China survey was cancelled at the request of Beijing. The Chinese polling partner told the Guardian that the questions were asked before the dispute began and the results “do not represent the current state of China-Japan relations” and would not be published. “They hold no practical relevance or reference value,” the staff member said.Last year’s survey found that more than 50% of respondents from both countries regarded each other as important economic and trade partners.Film distributors have postponed indefinitely the screening of at least two Japanese films in China, and state media have claimed that box office sales for an already released Japanese film, Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, have slumped in recent days. The turn away from the initially popular animation was due to “strong dissatisfaction from Chinese audiences” with Takaichi, the state broadcaster CCTV said.The row has rattled Japanese business groups, with industry leaders meeting Takaichi on Monday and urging her to calm the tensions. “Political stability is a prerequisite for economic exchange,” Yoshinobu Tsutsui, the chair of Japan’s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, told reporters.On Monday, Tokyo dispatched a top foreign ministry official, Masaaki Kanai, to Beijing where he was expected to meet his Chinese counterpart, Liu Jinsong, Japanese reports said.Takaichi has refused to withdraw her remarks – the primary demand from Beijing – although the Japanese government said its policy on Taiwan was unchanged. She had said an attack on Taiwan could signify an existential threat to Japan, permitting it to exercise “self-defence”. Japan’s postwar constitution forbids it from using force as a means of settling international disputes.The prospect of Japanese involvement in the event of an attack on Taiwan is alarming for Beijing. The US is Taiwan’s biggest backer in its resistance toChina’s annexation plansbut is not obliged to defend it, and as policy it refuses to confirm whether it would.A US-Japan security treaty commits both countries to defend each other if one is attacked in Japanese territory, and so Japanese involvement in a Taiwan conflict would almost guarantee US involvement.China’s state media have given the spat blanket coverage, including in Japanese- and English-language outlets and social media accounts, and the campaign has fuelled anger and nationalism online.Japan has warned its citizens in China to take extra safety precautions and reminded expats to respect local customs and exercise caution in their interactions with local people. Just over 100,000 Japanese were living in China in 2023, according to Japan’s foreign ministry.Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, said Tuesday’s advice – which included avoiding crowded places – was in response to a surge in anti-Japanese sentiment in the Chinese media.“We have made judgments based on comprehensive consideration of the security situation in the country or region, as well as its political and social conditions,” Kihara said.Japan’s embassy in Beijing also advised Japanese citizens to be aware of their surroundings, to not travel alone and to take extra caution when travelling with children.China’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it “always and will continue to protect the safety of foreign citizens in China in accordance with the law”.Additional reporting by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaJapanTaiwanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Let President Marcos work to stop all the corruption.”‘There is so much corruption’: hundreds of thousands protest in Manila over missing flood fundsRead moreAn independent fact-finding commission created by Marcos, a Senate committee and government agencies have been investigating allegations that influential members of Congress and the Senate have pocketed huge kickbacks from construction companies, which had won lucrative contracts to build flood-control projects that turned out to be substandard, incomplete or nonexistent. The scandal hassparked outragein a country long prone to deadly flooding and typhoons.In a speech Monday night before a huge rally by a religious group in a Manila park, Imee Marcos said that her brother’s drug addiction started when their father, the namesake of the current leader, was still a president and has continued to this day. She claimed it has affected his health and ability to govern.The president and his elder sister are the children of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, a former dictator, who was ousted in an army-backed “people power” uprising in 1986.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold signs calling for the resignation of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr, during an anti-corruption rally.Photograph: Rolex dela Peña/EPAImee Marcos alleged that the president’s wife and children were also drug users and added that she and her brother mostly haven’t talked since he rose to the presidency in 2022. Liza Marcos and her children, who include a key member of the House of Representatives, didn’t immediately comment.“His addiction became the cause of the flood of corruption, the lack of direction and very wrong decisions, the absence of accountability and justice,” the senator said without offering any evidence.Imee Marcos is a high-profile ally of her brother’s harsh critic and predecessor,Rodrigo Duterte.Dutertewas arrested on an international criminal courtwarrant in March and flown to and detained in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drug crackdowns that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead. Duterte has denied any wrongdoing.Duterte’s family and allies have blamed Marcos and his administration for what they claim was the ex-president’s illegal arrest and detention by the global court. His daughter, vice-president Sara Duterte, is also one of the most vocal critics of the current president.On Monday, Castro blasted the senator for not calling out Rodrigo Duterte, who has acknowledged using fentanyl in the past and his being linked, along with his daughter, the vice-president, by critics to alleged corruption. Both Duterte and his daughter have denied involvement in corruption, including her alleged misuse of confidential funds.Early last year, Rodrigo Duterte said in a speech that his successor was a drug addict, who was once on a law enforcement list of suspected drug users. Marcos then laughed off Duterte’s allegations and said he wouldn’t dignify the accusation with an answer, but claimed his predecessor was using fentanyl, a powerful opioid.In 2016, Duterte said he had used fentanyl in the past to ease pain caused by injuries from a motorbike accident. His lawyer later said that Duterte has stopped taking fentanyl before he became president in 2016.In 2021, when Marcos was a presidential aspirant, his spokesperson showed two reports from a private hospital and the national police laboratory that stated Marcos had tested negative for cocaine and methamphetamine.Explore more on these topicsFerdinand Marcos JrPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteFloodingAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

These stories … were written over a sort of 20 year period, so for me, it’s quite an important book.”Johnson said authors typically have very little to do with the design of their books, and she had no idea AI had been used to create her cover, which features a cat with human teeth.“I just thought it was a photograph of a real cat and the teeth had been superimposed, but apparently it wasn’t,” Johnson said, adding that unlike younger generations who are adept at identifying AI, she had trouble distinguishing images created with the technology.Johnson worried people would now assume she had used AI to write her book, which she “most certainly did not”.“Instead of talking about my book … and what the inspiration was, we are talking about bloody AI, which I hate.”In a statement, Smither said the designers spent hours working on the cover of her book, which features a steam train and an angel “half-obscured in the smoke”, inspired by artist Marc Chagall’s figures.“It is them I am most concerned about: that their meticulous work … is being disrespected,” Smither said.Both Smither and Johnson have previously judged categories of the Ockham awards, and both said the covers were given very little consideration.“The contents and the close reading were everything,” Smither said.The use of AI in creative fields has come underincreasing scrutinyas the technology has evolved, with some groupsdeveloping ways to counter its influence.Nicola Legat, the chair of the book awards trust, which administers the Ockham awards, said the trust takes a “firm stance on the use of AI in books”.“The trust does not take lightly a decision that prevents the latest works of two of New Zealand’s most esteemed writers from being considered for the 2026 award,” Legat said.“However, the criteria apply to all entrants, regardless of their mana [status], and must be consistently applied to all.”The decision to amend the criteria around AI was spurred by a desire to support creative and copyright interests of the country’s writers and illustrators, she said.“As AI evolves, there may well be a need for the trust to revisit and develop the criteria further.”Wilson said publishers and authors regularly use Grammarly and Photoshop, which draw on AI, and the situation highlighted an urgent need for carefully developed guidelines.“As an industry, we must work together to ensure that this situation does not happen again.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Such foods have become a “central part of dietary patterns for most of the population”.Long-established processing methods, such as fermentation and canning, largely preserve the natural structure of foods and increase shelf life.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBut new technologieschange the internal structure of food, chemically modify components, and use additives to produce ready-to-consume, long-lasting, and highly palatable products. These are known as ultra-processed foods.The Lancet series outlines the “urgent, coordinated” public policies and collective actions needed to address the growing impacts of UPFs.However, Prof Mark Lawrence, a co-author of the series from Deakin University, warned Australia was already behind.“We have, at the moment, no national food and nutrition policy in this country,” Lawrence said, adding that there had not been one since 1992. “Instead, we have these piecemeal actions in the policy space.“We’ve fallen behind international best practice. There areno taxes on sugar and soft drinks[like] other countries are doing.”Refined tastes: 11 foods you might not realise are ultra-processedRead moreIn their place, the health department’s healthy food partnership was “well intended”, but the strategies used had “unfortunately, very dire consequences” because they had been poorly designed, he said.‘New vision’ needed for food systemLawrence said the “classic example of a counterproductive policy” isAustralia’s health star rating system, which focuses on individual nutrients like salt and sugar.Because Australia’s largest food manufacturers were involved in developing the system, they influenced policymakers so that these ingredients could simply be replaced with ultra-processed alternatives and products could earn high ratings, research has found.Policymakers needed to consider the cumulative health impacts of the “cocktail” of these novel ingredients over time, Lawrence said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This included “a systematic review of ultra-processed food consumption [and its impact] on mortality and chronic disease risk to inform the updated guidelines”.Explore more on these topicsHealthUltra-processed foodsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

Gaming platforms have an exemption to the ban, but Julie Inman Grant said earlierthis month that eSafety had consideredthe game’s chat functionality and messaging.“If the online gameplay is the significant or sole purpose, if that were taken away, would the kids still use that messaging functionality to chat? Probably not,” she said.Speaking to Australian journalists on the planned changes, Roblox’s chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, described Roblox as an “immersive gaming platform” but added: “I like to think of it as games being scaffolding for social interaction. Sometimes it doesn’t matter what the game is. What really matters is you’re bringing people together to spend time together.”When asked whether this meant Roblox should really be considered a social media platform under the ban, Kaufman said Roblox considers social media more to be about posting content into a feed that other people then see.“Then people come back and they look at the feed, and that feed … creates a fear of missing out,” he said “It’s like a popularity contest in our mind that defines the core of what social media is. Roblox is two friends coming home after school and playing a game together. That is not social media.“And so we do not believe that the social media laws within Australia apply to Roblox.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The results revealed a 61.11% false positive rate for 15-year-olds who were told by the technology they were 16, and 44.25% for 14-year-olds.Kaufman said the technology is good within one-to-two years of estimation, and if users disagree with a ruling they can correct it using government ID or use of parental controls to set age. He said there were “strict requirements” to delete the data once age is verified. Roblox said ID images are kept for 30 days for purposes such as detecting fraud or abuse and subsequently deleted.People who do not wish to go through age assurance will still be able to use Roblox, but will not be able to use features such as chat.More than 150 million people play Roblox every day in 180 countries across the world, including Australia.

But Turkey’s president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has refused to withdraw or compromise on the hosting rights.Guardian Australia revealed in September Turkey was pursuing“innovative solutions”in the race with Australia, arguing both countries could win from drawn-out negotiations. But that plan was not taken up by Albanese and the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen.Bowen has pursued a dogged diplomatic strategy with Ankara, even lobbyingTurkey’s first lady, Emine Erdoğan, on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York.A longtime environmental campaigner, Erdoğan is considered important to her husband’s push to host the summit in Antalya, the resort city where world leaders met for the 2015 G20 summit.Bowen is representing Australia in Brazi and only hours before Albanese’s comments had restated Australia’s desire to host the event in Adelaide, in concert with Pacific countries.“In hostingCop31, we want to bring the world to our region to see the impacts of climate change and bring the world’s best innovators and businesses to invest in solutions,” he said.The event is expected to cost more than $1bn and is understood to have mixed support within federal cabinet.Albanese could meet Erdoğan on the sidelines of world leaders’ talks at the G20 summit in South Africa next week.This headline was updated on 19 November 2025.Explore more on these topicsCop31Breaking News AustraliaAnthony AlbaneseRecep Tayyip ErdoğanTurkeyPacific islandsAustralian politicsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

That is why I am saying that a certain line has been crossed,” he said.“In both cases we are sure … that the attempt to blow up the rails and the railway infrastructure violation were intentional … and their aim was to cause a railway catastrophe,” he said.He said that they were part of a broader pattern of “acts of sabotage and actions of Russian services across the whole ofEurope, not only in Poland, [which] are unfortunately gaining momentum”.Map of Russian rail sabotage attacks in PolandThe suspects, whose identities are known to Polish authorities but have not been made public, are thought to have arrived in Poland fromBelarusshortly before the attacks and returned to Belarus shortly after.One of the two men had previously been convicted for sabotage in Ukraine, and the other came from the Russian-occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine, Tusk said.The prime minister said the recruitment of Ukrainian citizens by Russia served to “stir up possibly radically anti-Ukrainian sentiments”, which he said were “particularly dangerous” in countriessuch asPoland, which hosts large Ukrainian migrant and refugee communities.The claim that the suspects fled to Belarus came just a day after Poland opened two border crossings with the country that had been shut for years due to political tensions. Poland cited economic reasons for opening the checkpoints.At the Bobrowniki crossing on Tuesday, several dozen trucks were waiting on the Polish side to cross into Belarus.Poland has suffered a wave of sabotage attempts and cyber-attacks in recent months, with authorities in the country usually blaming Russia. Polish authorities had detained 55 people in relation to such offences, Tusk said, with 23 arrested for acts of sabotage.Map of alleged Russian acts of sabotage and disruption until end of 2024Court files seen by the Guardian have shown that the perpetrators are often recruited on the secure messaging app Telegram by accounts believed to be operated by Russian intelligence, which promise them money for carrying out arson or other tasks.After hundreds of Russian spies operating under diplomatic cover were expelled from Europe after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, it is believed that Russia increasingly turned to this kind of “one-time” operative.‘These people are disposable’: how Russia is using online recruits for a campaign of sabotage in EuropeRead moreThe Russian services also use the tactic in Ukraine, where teenagers have beenrecruited as unwitting suicide bombers, paid to carry packages with explosives which are then remotely detonated when the courier is close to a police station or other sensitive site.However, the nebulous chain of command for such attacks and the difficulty of working out who exactly is on the end of the Telegram chat has often made it difficult to prove beyond doubt that Russia is involved.In the case of this week’s attacks, authorities have not yet explained what evidence they have gathered to support their claim that Russia is responsible for the attack.Poland is understood to be working on strong diplomatic reactions to Belarus and Russia, with the foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, saying he would demand that the countries work with Polish authorities and surrender the suspects.The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the accusations and said they were just an another example of Poland’s “Russophobia”.Explore more on these topicsPolandRussiaUkraineBelarusEuropeEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

I think that is just being politically realistic.”In an unexpected move, the EU decided last week that the UK should pay towards its budget in order to join the European electricity market.It would mean the UK paying into the EU budget, although Britain alreadypays EU membership legacy costs. The two sides are also deadlocked over the EU’s demand for an entry fee of up to €6bn (£5.3bn) to allow British companies to maximise benefits from a €150bn (£132.1bn) EU defence programme.In more welcome news for the government, Byrne said he hoped both sides could strike a deal to ease food and animal checks at the border in the second half of 2026, during Ireland’s presidency of the EU Council. Last week, the EU agreed a mandate for theEuropean Commissionto negotiate this veterinary agreement. “I think that could be a gamechanger,” Byrne added.During alandmark summit in May that launched the government’s EU reset, Keir Starmer and the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, agreed the two sides “should explore in detail the necessary parameters for the United Kingdom’s possible participation in the European Union’s internal electricity market”.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen at the UK-EU summit in May.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThetextdid not spell out that the UK should pay for access – but since then, a large majority of EU member states have decided this should be the case. Several countries, including Belgium and Germany, have warned against allowing the UK to “cherrypick” the best bits of the European single market without abiding by common rules.Commission officials briefing EU ministers on Monday described the UK as a “complicated and challenging counterpart” and said “nerves of steel and unity” would be required through upcoming negotiations. The central challenge would be financial considerations, they added.Tensions over money have already emerged innegotiations over UK participation in the EU’s €150bn security action for Europe (Safe) fund. EU officials have suggested an entry fee of up to €6bn, far higher than the administrative fee the government had envisaged paying.Peter Ricketts, the veteran former diplomat who chairs the European affairs committee in the House of Lords, has described a rumoured €6.5bn fee as “so off the scale that it suggests some EU members don’t want the UK in the scheme”.Some media outlets have reported the entry fee could be between €6.5bn and €6.7bn, but the Guardian understands the commission has proposed a fee ranging from €1bn to €6bn, proportionate to expected UK benefits.Sandro Gozi, an Italian centrist MEP who co-chairs the EU-UK parliamentary assembly, said it was imperative to show voters that the reset meant something.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johannes Volkmann, an MP for Lahn-Dill in westernGermany, argues that younger generations will be left carrying the burden for retirees and prospective retirees. Merz, who has a slim majority of just 12 in the 630-seat Bundestag, faces potential deadlock ahead of the vote due in December.Volkmann, who has become a mouthpiece not just for the group but for a growing number of disgruntled conservative voters, has said Merz’s proposals to guarantee current pension levels would lead to additional costs of about €120bn (£105bn) until 2040, “which will have to be carried by my generation … this is simply fiscally unsustainable”.Other “rebels”, including older MPs who say the plans need to be rethought, could bring the total number prepared to stand up to Merz to between 40 and 50.Merz added grist to the mill as he addressed a Junge Union gathering – of which he was once a member – in southern Germany at the weekend, telling them he would “vote in favour of this pension package with a clear conscience”.He said it was one of many adjustments that needed to be made to Germany’s burgeoning welfare state.Germany’s problems are not specific to Europe’s largest economy, though are exacerbated by the country’s size and a population that is ageing even faster than most other places inEurope.Now there are only about two workers supporting every pensioner, when just a few years ago it was three, and in the 1950s as many as six.Correspondingly, compulsory pension contributions, split between employers and employees, have soared to almost 19% of salaries, and face going even higher under the current plans.Retirees currently receive about 48% of their salary as a pension. While appearing generous by standards in other countries, pensioners’ lobby groups argue it is on the lower level of what they need, and anyway should reflect what they have paid into the system. However, it leaves the government with a massive hole to fill between pensions being paid out and contributions received.Experts also say the working-age population is unnecessarily carrying the burden, particularly as the population ages. The young MPs argue that a reduction by just 1% to 47% of the average salary is required, a small price for the older generation to pay in order to lessen the burden on the young.The concern expressed by the young MPs’ constituents is reflected in poll results, which show the lack of confidence Germans across all age groups have about their future pensions.An increasing number of Germans either believe or recognise that they will have to work beyond retirement age, which is gradually rising to 67.The German government is being called on to launch public information campaigns to encourage Germans to look for additional sources of income, such as stock market shares to fund private pensions. Currently only 60% of Germans have other sources of finance to fall back on when they retire.Volkmann said he had spoken to Merz, with the chancellor apparently acknowledging that the demands of his group “make sense”. Though after his remarks at the weekend there is doubt over how much he will be prepared to concede.Merz faces the challenge that if there is no shift on the pension issue, other widespread changes he has promised to oversee at a time when Germany is facing myriad challenges will stall, including arecent planto incentivise retirees to continue working.Explore more on these topicsGermanyFriedrich MerzEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

There were no mental health issues.”In an interview last year with Italy’sCorriere della Sera, the sisters said their wish was “to leave together, on the same day … The idea that one of the two will go first is very difficult to bear”.They told the German newspaper Bild that they wanted their ashes to be placed into the same urn one day and for it to be buried alongside their mother and dog, Yello.Born in 1936 in Nerchau, the sisters began as child ballet dancers with the Leipzig Opera, with their singing and dancing career taking off from the age of 16 after their family fled EastGermanyfor Düsseldorf.

They were made to wear thick black stockings during their performances.The Kesslers said in the interview with Corriere: “We were scantily clad on TV, but we think we were always elegant, never vulgar. There were criticisms, but that was a plus for us.”During their later career in Italy, they performed in films and in theatre productions.The sisters also enjoyed success in the US, where they performed with artists including Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire. They lived together in the Trastevere neighbourhood of Rome until 1986, when they moved back to Germany and settled in Grünwald.They both had romances – Ellen was with the Italian actor Umberto Orsini for 20 years, while Alice had relationships with the French actor Marcel Amont and Italian actor Enrico Maria Salerno.

        "Content": "15.15 ESTSummaryDonald Trump welcomed crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington on Tuesday, in the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia’s first White House visit since the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul. The shocking murder caused global outrage and appeared to set the Gulf kingdom on a path to international pariah status. In 2021 US intelligence concluded that bin Salman had approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi regime. The crown prince has denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Seven years on, that shocking murder seemed a distant memory, as MBS arrived to a lavish display including fanfare, a US Marine band and a military flyover as he stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House to meet Trump.Talking to reporters in the Oval Office, the US president brushed off questions from a reporter about MBS’s role in Khashoggi’s killing, saying “things happen”. “You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,” Trump said of the murdered columnist, before going on tocontradict US intelligenceon the Saudi crown prince’s role in the affair. “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him, or didn’t like him, things happen. But he [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.” While Trump castigated the reporter for the question, a calm MBS said:“It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.”The crown prince announced Saudi Arabia was raising its planned investments in the US to almost $1tn, up from $600bn that the Saudis said they planned to invest when Trump visited the kingdom in May. MBS said the kingdom has “huge demand” for computing power and desires US AI chips. Trump also said he “can see” a deal happening to transfer American nuclear technology toSaudi Arabia, but didn’t specify a timeline. Against a backdrop of subdued oil prices and MBS’s high spending on megaprojects at home, that figure is likely very unrealistic, but Trump seemed thrilled nonetheless.Trump also pushed back on the notion that there was a conflict of interest, given his family’s strong personal interest in the kingdom.“I have nothing to do with the family business,” said Trump, adding that his family has relatively little interest in the kingdom. In September, London real estate developer Dar Global announced that it plans to launch Trump Plaza in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. It’s Dar Global’s second collaboration with the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by Trump’s children, in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the two companies announced the launch of Trump Tower Jeddah.Trump confirmed that he had agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jetsdespite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the US technology behind the advanced weapon system. The agreement will be similar to the one the US has with Israel, which is significant as until now Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the jets. The move has the potential to alter the military balance in the region. As Politico noted earlier: “A major arms deal would signal a sea change in the US approach to Saudi Arabia: No longer would deeper ties between the two countries be so dependent on Saudi Arabia normalising relations with Israel.”On that subject, MBS made clear that normalisation with Israel (i.e. Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, which Trump really wants) could not happen without first securing a clear path towards a two-state solution.The crown prince said he wants Israelis and Palestinians “to coexist peacefully” in the region. Trump has been trying to nudge the Saudis to join the accords for some time and said today he felt he’d had a “positive response”. But it’s worth remembering that Israel, meanwhile, remains steadfastly opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state.Trump will return to the South Lawn later, with first lady Melania, to welcome the crown prince when he returns for the evening East Room dinner.In addition to today’s White House pomp, the two nations are also planning an investment summit at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday that will include the heads of Salesforce, Qualcomm, Pfizer, the Cleveland Clinic, Chevron and Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s national oil and natural gas company, where even more deals with the Saudis could be announced.ShareUpdated at15.17 EST"

The decision meant that legal cases against the crown prince, including a wrongful death civil case brought against him by the wife of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was murdered by Saudi agents, were dismissed. A US intelligence assessment, which was published by the Biden administration in 2021, concluded that Prince Mohammedhad ordered the hit.But even as Prince Mohammed returns to the US after a seven-year gap – without any fear of legal accountability – his chief of staff is entering the country having faced scrutiny by the Department of Justice.A superseding indictment states that Asaker met two of the men who were at the heart of the Twitter scheme and later charged with being illegal Saudi agents –Ali AlzabarahandAhmed Almutairi– while he and Prince Mohammed were on an official delegation to Washington in 2015.Ahmad Abouammo, a dual US-Lebanese national, was also charged.Prosecutors alleged thatAsaker promised Abouammo and Alzabarahgifts, cash, and future employment in exchange for non-public information about the Twitter users who were of interest to the Saudi government.Abouammo was later arrested and convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Saudi government. Alzabarah and Almutairi are on the FBI’s most-wanted list after they were charged but fled toSaudi Arabiabefore they could be arrested.Asaker was not charged by prosecutors but a superseding indictment filed in July 2020 alleges that the aide – who is identified 53 times in the document as “Foreign-Official-1” and was named during Abouammo’s trial – was at the heart of the conspiracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Canadian authorities have previously declined to comment on the specific claims, but have not denied the allegations.A US court is expected to conduct a hearing later this year in the long-running case, after a US appeals court ruling that allowed discovery to proceed in the civil case, in which both Asaker and another key aide to Prince Mohammed, Saud al-Qahtani – who was separately subjected to US sanctions for his role in the murder of Khashoggi – stand accused of “directing US residents in the US to locate and murder al-Aljabri”.Aljabri’s lawyers said in a recent filing that neither Saudi defendants had cooperated with the discovery process.Asaker’s lawyers have denied the allegations in the civil case, saying in legal filings that Prince Mohammed’s chief of staff has complied with court orders, and have claimed that he had “no communications or meetings with US-based Saudis, did not issue any directives or instructions to them, and did not discuss with them Mr al-Jabri, a search for Mr al-Jabri, or any other topic”.Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaXEspionageUS foreign policyMohammed bin SalmanJamal KhashoggiMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They are primarily manufactured by the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin and cost about $80m (£60m) to $110m each.“The Saudis will be spending a lot of money tomorrow on the US,” a senior White House official told Reuters on Monday.View image in fullscreenThe sale will mark the first delivery of the advanced fighter jets to a Middle Eastern state apart from Israel.Photograph: Axel Schmidt/ReutersKhashoggi’s widow said it was “very painful” to hear about the trip.

It will supervise an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), whose membership is also undetermined, but which the US wants to deploy by January. The countries who the US has approached – including Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates – are tentative. The resolution says the ISF will “ensure the process of demilitarising” Gaza – suggesting it will have to take weapons away fromHamas, which insisted immediately after the UN vote it will not disarm.US military planning for divided Gaza with ‘green zone’ secured by international and Israeli troopsRead moreThere is little appetite among the would-be troop contributors for a direct confrontation with its battle-hardened fighters. The ISF would meanwhile be supposed to take over security in territory now occupied by Israeli forces, but that too could be a recipe for clashes, especially if the Israelis are reluctant to leave.There is no greater clarity over the Palestinian committee of technocrats who will be tasked with the day-to-day running of theGazaStrip, under the guidance of Trump and his fellow leaders. It will be hard, to say the least, to find any such technocrats, prepared to work for Trump, who would hold any sway with the 2.2 million surviving Palestinians in Gaza. The same goes for the putative police force.Despite the miasma of vagueness, UN security council Resolution 2803 invested all these aspirational bodies with the force of international law, in an effort to turn Trump’s 20-point peace proposal into some sort of plan and solidify last month’s shaky US-brokered ceasefire into an enduring peace.The fact that theresolution passed 13-0with Russia and China abstaining, is testament to its calculated haziness as well as the global exhaustion and desperation over Gaza after two years of Israeli bombardment, which has left over 70,000 dead, some 70% of the buildings on the coastal territory razed to the ground, and a finding by a UN commission that Israel has committed genocide.After the vote, the US envoy, Mike Waltz, described the resolution as transformative – “a new course in the Middle East, for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike”.When it was the turn for the other council members to speak, they were altogether more cautious, framing their support or acquiescence more in terms of what might follow from the resolution, rather than what was actually in the text.This was especially truewhen it came to Palestinian statehood. On the insistence of the Arab and Islamic states, the resolution had been revised in recent days to at least mention a future Palestine. It did so however, not by referring to the fundamental right of Palestinians to self-determination and the international commitment to a two-state commitment, but in the language of a distant, conditional and elusive offer. If the Palestinian Authority reformed itself satisfactorily and Gaza’s rebuilding advances, it said “conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.Mealy mouthed as it sounds, European diplomats saw a significant victory in getting a Trump administration envoy to say the words “Palestinian self-determination and statehood” out loud, whatever the caveats.The veteran US negotiator and Middle East expert, Aaron David Miller, also saw the resolution as a step towards a future Palestine.“Whether the UNSC resolution can be implemented is unclear. But it reflects two new realities – Trump has internationalized the Gaza component of Palestinian issue and supported a two state solution as an end state,” Miller wrote on social media.The wording of resolution 2803 was certainly too much for the extreme right end of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, who reacted with fury, forcing the prime minister to restate his own visceral objections to any suggestion of Palestinian sovereignty.Those governments who held their noses and supported the resolution have drawn some solace from the discomfort of the Israeli hard right. In the view of the European and the Islamic states the passage of the resolution will keep Trump engaged, hopefully increasing the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in the immediate future, while holding a door wedged ajar to the prospects of lasting peace and Palestinian statehood.The more the international community is represented on the “board of peace” and the more Arab and Islamic countries take part in the ISF, so the optimists in these capitals argue, the harder it will be for Israel to maintain its exclusive, US-approved control over the occupied territory.In going along with the “Trump plan”, they hope to emulate and ultimately outdo Israel at its own game, riding the tiger of the American president’s ego, in the hope of eventually steering him in their desired direction.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelDonald TrumpUnited NationsBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The settlers are operating with total impunity,” said Aviv Tatarsky, an Israeli activist who has worked in theWest Bankfor decades.Early on Sunday, settlers vandalised cars on the outskirts of the town of Sinjil and “raided” farmland near the village of Mughayyir, according to local reports. On Saturday, a farmer was assaulted and his crops damaged by settlers in the town of Beit Furik, east of Nablus.View image in fullscreenAn attack on Beit Lid, near Tulkarm, last week, injured several Palestinians.Photograph: Majdi Mohammed/APAttacks by settlers on the West Bank have increased since the US-brokered deal stopped the war in Gaza almost six weeks ago after two years of devastating conflict. The UN logged more than 260 attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in the West Bank in October alone – the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.Records kept by the Palestinian Farmers’ Union (PFU) show incidents of violence against its members up fourfold, from three or four daily before the war in Gaza. The most recent attacks are “not random, but deliberate efforts to undermine Palestinian rural life”, the PFU said in a statement last month.Last week, settlers were reported to have assaulted agricultural workers and olive pickers in the town of Beit Duqqu, near Jerusalem, prevented Palestinians from plowing their land in al-Farisiyah in the northern Jordan valley, burned olive trees belonging to local Palestinians outside two villages near the city of Qalqilya andattacked farmers near Aqraba.Map of locations in West BankAnother attack by settlerstargeted the village ofBeit Lid, where a light industrial park was ransacked and 10 vehicles were torched. Four Palestinians were injured during the assault by dozens of masked settlers, who also attacked Israeli soldiers after they arrived to restore order.In Beit Lid, Mahmoud Edeis said he wanted merely “to feel that my children are safe, that when I go to sleep I can say: ‘OK, there’s nothing [to worry about].“But at any moment something could happen … This can’t go on. It can’t be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger.”1:23CCTV shows Israeli settlers attacking Palestinian food warehouse – videoIn Deir Istiya, a small town in the West Bank where there have been multiple clashes between settlers and Palestinian farmers, a mosque had been defaced and torched. The violence in Beit Lid prompted the president ofIsrael, Isaac Herzog, to condemn what he called a “shocking and serious” attack that “crosses a red line”.On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, blamed a “minority” that “does not represent the large settler public, who are law-abiding and loyal to the state” for violence which “will be addressed with full force because we are a state of law and a state of law operates according to the law”.Criticism by top Israeli officials of violence by settlers and their supporters is extremely rare. Palestinians and human rights campaigners say Israeli authorities make little effort to control settlers in the West Bank, with only one in 20 investigations opened into settler violence ending with charges and even fewer leading to convictions. Three of the four Israeli suspects arrested over the Beit Lid attacks were released, local media reported.There has also been a rise in violence involving the Israeli military. Palestinian health officials said on Sunday that a 19-year-old Palestinian man was killed by Israeli military fire near Nablus, the seventh person to be killed in the West Bank in the past two weeks by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said the man hurled an explosive device at the soldiers, who fired in response and killed him.In addition to Sunday’s clashes, the Palestinian health ministry in the West Bank said six teenagers – aged 15 to 17 – were shot and killed by Israeli fire in four separate incidents over the past two weeks. The total number of Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces and settlers since 7 October 2023 in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is now well over 1,000. One in five of the victims is a child including more than 200 boys and seven girls. The number also includes 20 women and at least seven people with disabilities.View image in fullscreenA protest against Israeli settler violence at Beit Jala, near Bethlehem, last week.Photograph: Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Friday, Israeli authorities stopped hundreds of Israeli activists and volunteers from reaching the village of Burin, where they were to assist Palestinians with their olive harvest.Authorities have repeatedly blocked such efforts. Hanna Uihlein, a UK-based volunteer, was among a group of more than 30 volunteers from Europe and the US who were held in prison for between 36 hours and five days by Israeli authorities after being detained near Nablus last month. All were eventually deported, accused of violating the conditions of their tourist visas.“We were there to observe and protect … We were treated as criminals and the whole experience was dehumanising. It was also very clear from the beginning that it was strategic – to intimidate, deter and prevent any form of solidarity with Palestinian farmers,” she said.‘Olives are everything for us’: West Bank farmers prevented from harvesting by settler violenceRead moreThe revenue from olives in the West Bank is now a fraction of the $130m (£99m) that it was annually before the war, compounding a deep economic crisis. About 110,000 farmers in the West Bank directly profit from the olive harvest with another 50,000 people earning much of their livelihood from working with the trees and produce.1:23CCTV shows Israeli settlers attacking Palestinian food warehouse – videoMany ministers in Israel’s ruling coalition, the most rightwing government in the country’s history, have close ideological and organisational ties with settler activists, including some of the most extreme, and frequently offer vocal support. Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, lives in a settlement and called in September for Israel to annex “roughly 82% of the West Bank”.Home to 2.7 million Palestinians, the territory has long been central to plans for a future Palestinian state, but successive Israeli governments have expanded existing settlements and allowed or encouraged new ones. The settlements are considered illegal under international law. The West Bank has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 six-day war.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In 2023, it became only the seventh country to graduate from the UN’s least developed country (LDC) category, thanks to significant progress over the last three decades since transitioning to democracy in areas such as poverty reduction, education and life expectancy.It did so not by tearing up environmental regulations to incentivise economic growth but rather by tightening standards and prioritising air, water and land quality. “For us, gross national happiness is the goal, and GDP is just a tool which means economic growth cannot be detrimental to the happiness and wellbeing of our people,” Tobgay said.But while lifting itself out of the LDC ranking represented an important milestone, it also reduced access to international climate finance, aid and technical assistance – even as climate shocks such as floods, drought and erratic rainfall increased.Bhutan has contributed negligibly to global heating, and 72% of the territory is forested, making it a crucial carbon sink. It is among only a handful of countries with plans that are fully or almost compliant with the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, according to theClimate Action Tracker.Bhutan’s focus on environmental and climate protection is not driven only by its commitment to the UN climate process. Bhutanese people believe their deities reside within all parts of the natural environment, which means forests and certain water bodies are off limits and mountaineering is banned. Bhutan is home to the highest unclimbed mountain, Gangkhar Puensum, which rises to more than 7,500 metres above sea level.An entire article of the young democracy’s constitution is dedicated to protecting the environment, requiring at least 60% of the country to be under forest cover. It mandates the government and every citizen to contribute to the protection of the natural environment, conservation of the rich biodiversity and prevention of all forms of ecological degradation.Tobgay said: “We are sequestering around five times the amount of carbon dioxide we emit We are taking care of our biodiversity, taking care of our forests. We are nature positive, carbon negative. Yet, because we are a landlocked mountainous country, we bear the brunt of climate change impacts.”Mountain ranges are warming faster than the global average, causing Bhutan’s glaciers to melt and lakes to overflow. Floods have already displaced farming communities and the cost of road maintenance has more than doubled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They must help the developing world adapt and reduce emissions by providing finance and resource and technology transfers, but most importantly they must reduce their own emissions,” Tobgay said. “Small countries like Bhutan, we are actually doing a lot more than our fair share. The effects of climate change are disastrous, even for rich countries.”Last year at Cop29, Bhutanled the launchof an alliance with Panama, Suriname and Madagascar, three other carbon-negative or carbon-neutral countries, with the aim of gaining greater recognition and influence at the UN climate talks for the oversized contribution they make to global climate action.“In all the climate change discussions, the focus is on promises for the future, not on actual results,” Tobgay said. “We want our contributions and foregone opportunities to be acknowledged and compensated. This would incentivise other countries to not just aspire but actually work towards carbon neutrality as soon as possible. Too often bad behaviour is recognised and rewarded and good behaviour is not seen, it’s taken for granted. We’ve got to reverse that.”Leaders of the so-called G-Zero countries held talks during the UN general assembly in New York in September and agreed on an inaugural summit in Bhutan next year to showcase and share climate solutions and deliver a message to the developed world, which is lagging behind.“So you may be an industrialised country, you’ve reaped the rewards and spread the benefits of industrialisation throughout the world, but it’s time to now take stock of where we are. You don’t need to reverse industrialisation and economic growth but you need to make it sustainable,” Tobgay said.“GDP is for what? Reducing carbon emissions is for what? It has to be for the happiness and wellbeing of your people. Earth will survive no matter what we do. The urgency to control global warming, to fight climate change, is for us people now and for our future generations.“We are taking care of our people, our economy is growing, and at the same time we’ve been able to take care of our environment. If such small developing countries can do it, there’s no excuse that larger countries cannot play bigger roles. After all, they are the leaders of the world.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisBhutanCop30Greenhouse gas emissionsGreen economySouth and central AsiainterviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a growing detachment there, because he knows I have lied to him.”Kim is an asylum seeker based in Yorkshire, England. The 35-year-old, who has asked to use only a pseudonym out of fears for her safety, is among those in the UK who do not know when – or if – they will be able to see their children again, as theLabour government cracks down on the asylum system.On Monday the government published apolicy documentsetting out sweeping changes, which, the prime minister said, were aimed at “tackling severe strain on both our asylum system and our wider social contract”.The changes would formally end the automatic right to family reunion for refugees, which allowed people’s relatives to join them in the UK once their asylum claim had been accepted.Instead, once an asylum seeker has secured refugee status, they would have to move on to what the government calls a new “protection work and study” visa, for a fee, “if they obtain employment or commence study at an appropriate level”.Then, they “could become eligible to sponsor family members to come to the UK”, but since the government warns the “same conditions may apply” to refugees as to “other legal migrants and UK citizens”, refugees do not know if they will face the£29,000-a-year minimum income requirementsbefore they can sponsor a loved one to join them.UK citizens must earn at least £29,000 a year to sponsor a family visa, and most students in the UK are not able to bring dependants.Kim is on an access course pathway to training as a nurse while awaiting a decision on her asylum case.This means that even if her asylum case is successful, it will be four years before she can hope to earn £29,000 – and, until the government provides further detail, she has no idea when she can hope to see her son, who is 13, again. The last time Kim saw her son in person he was four.She said: “I am grateful for the sanctuary I have here, but I’m missing so much of my son’s life and I worry for his safety. I try to pass my values on to him over the phone. I have a three-year-old daughter who was born here. I feel guilty giving her so much attention when I have another child who isn’t getting that attention.”Kim said she was visiting the UK nine years ago, raising awareness of political repression in Zimbabwe, when she was identified as a government critic back home, making it unsafe for her to return.She had hoped she would be quickly reunited with her son in the UK. However, the Home Office has refused all attempts to bring him over while she awaits a decision in her case, and, even if she could afford to travel overseas to see him, she cannot leave the UK while she awaits an asylum decision.“People like me want to contribute,” she said. “I want to work with elderly people, giving people comfort in their final days, like we do in Africa.“The decision to leave your culture is not one people make easily. Any country can face war or political trouble. Zimbabwe might not be safe for me, butmany people have moved there for refuge.“Anyone can find themselves in a position where they need help – and the UK isn’t the only country that gives people help, it’s what human beings do for other human beings.”The government suspended automatic family reunion in September, with Monday’s policy document outlining plans for “stricter requirements”, including plans for “domestic reform to the application of article 8 of the ECHR (European convention on human rights) … the right to respect for family and private life”.The policy document also proposes that leave to remain for refugees be reduced to two-and-a-half years, and a 20-year wait for eligibility for settled status.Nick Beales, of the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and Greater London, said: “It’s now clear that Labour’s shameful decision to suspend family reunion for recognised refugees was just the first shot in their war on asylum rights. The human cost of keeping vulnerable people separated from their loved ones is huge.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “This government has moved to suspend the refugee family reunion route, acknowledging the pressures it is putting on local authorities and public services.“We understand the devastating circumstances of some families, which is why there remain other routes which individuals may be eligible to apply for in order to reunite with family.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The Stoxx Europe 600, which tracks the biggest companies on the continent, fell 1.8%. Wall Street was also trading lower, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all down about 1% on Tuesday.It followed steeper falls in Asia, where in the Japan the Nikkei 225 index shed 3.2%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.7%.Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said in an interview with the BBC that there was“irrationality” in the current AI boom. He warned that in the event that the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune, including us”.Meanwhile JP Morgan Chase vice chairman, Daniel Pinto, said that booming AI valuations are due for a reassessment. “There is probably a correction there,” he said at the Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg on Tuesday. “That correction will also create a correction in the rest of the segment, the S&P and in the industry.”The chief executive of Klarna, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, also sounded the alarm this week, warning that huge sums being poured into computing infrastructure made him “nervous”.He told the Financial Times: “I think [OpenAI] can be very successful as a company but at the same time I’m very nervous about the size of these investments in these datacentres. That’s the particular thing that I am concerned about.”The Klarna co-founder added that the rising valuation of AI companies, including the chipmaker Nvidia, was also a source of concern. Nvidia became the first company to hit a market value of $4tn this year, later followed by Apple and Microsoft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The spot price fell by 0.3% to $4,033.29 an ounce on Tuesday morning, after earlier hitting its lowest level in a week.The drop comes amid fading expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Higher interest rates make gold relatively less appealing as the metal does not pay a yield.However, Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at the Swiss investment bank UBS, said the gold price was likely to fall further but would soon recover.“I would expect gold prices to bottom out soon, as I still see the Fed cutting rates several times over the coming quarters, and central banks’ diversification into gold remains strong,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesBitcoinStock marketsFinancial sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

They also often charge steep placement fees that serve as barriers for temp workers being hired permanently.“There are warehouses inFloridathat are entirely staffed by temp workers. The management is hired by the host employer. The entire line staff is temped out,” said Maya Ragsdale, co-executive director of Beyond The Bars, and co-author of the report. “What it really does is it suppresses wages across the board.”Workers at temp agencies in construction earn about $6.47 less per hour, and temp workers in warehouses about $3.38 less per hour than permanent direct hires, the report said: equivalent to $13,458 and $7,030 in lost income per year, respectively.Around 6.2 million people in Florida – about 36% of the state’s population – have a criminal record. Over 164,000 people in Florida are under some form of state supervision, not including county supervision. On any given day, 157,000 people are incarcerated in Florida’s state prisons and another 55,763 people are incarcerated in Florida county jails.“Before I went to jail, I was a manager at Office Depot. When I came out, I couldn’t get the kind of jobs I had before,” Felix, a member of Beyond the Bars, who said received a packet listing temp agencies before they were released, told the authors of the report. “Probation required a paycheck, and I had court fees due. With better jobs closed off because of my record, I ended up at a temp and labor pool – doing construction, which I’d never done before.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No benefits, no security – just years of labor, only to be treated like I was disposable.”A 2022 survey of temp workers by the National Employment Law Project found 24% reported their employers engaged in some form of wage theft, 17% reported experiencing a work-related injury or illness, and 41% reported that they personally covered their own healthcare costs. In addition, 71% of temp workers reported experiencing some form of retaliation for raising workplace issues with management.Beyond the Bars is calling for changes to probation requirements; more stringent standards and regulations of temp agencies and host employers; improved protections and organizing rights for workers at temp agencies; expansion of training programs, apprenticeships, and union jobs; and a crackdown on abuse of subsidies of these temp systems.“One of the things that has been really challenging for members of our organization is that labor pools kind of pop up and close very regularly. We have done a survey of all the temp agencies in south Florida last year, and then this year, we took that same list and looked through it again, and only like 50% of them are still open,” said Ragsdale. “I think one of the key reasons is the fact they’re trying to avoid their insurance rates going up when there’s worker complaints.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaUS economyShareReuse this content"

Quiet, piggy.”CBS News reporter Jennifer Jacobsfirst reportedthat Trump called a Bloomberg News reporter “piggy”, though she did not specify who it was.“Disgusting and completely unacceptable,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper wrote on X,sharing a clip of the incident. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlsonalso called the remark“disgusting and degrading”.When asked about the incident, Lucey directed the Guardian to a spokesperson for her news organization.“Our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor,” aBloombergNews spokesperson said on Tuesday afternoon. “We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.”The White House Correspondents’ Association, which has released statements in the past defending journalists who faced attack from Trump, did not respond to requests for comment.The insult is a familiar one for Trump. Alicia Machado, who won the Miss Universe pageant in 1996,has said that Trumponce called her “Miss Piggy” and told her to lose weight. Trump owned the pageant at the time.April Ryan, a longtime White House correspondent, was referred to as “Miss Piggy” by Trump administration official Lynne Patton in 2018 – thoughPatton apologized for the remark. (Trumphimself called Ryana “loser” who “doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing” that same year.)In an interview with the Guardian, Ryan said that Trump’s attack on the Bloomberg reporter was beneath the dignity of the presidency.“The president of the United States is supposed to be the moral leader, the leader of the country, and he’s acting like some thug on the street,” she said. “It’s one thing for his minions to say that, but for him to call a woman that? That also shows how upset he is about the Epstein files. It lets us know that there’s probably some fire there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While they talk about energy transition, they release oil into the Amazon’s basin and privatize rivers like the Tapajós for soy. For us, this is not development, it is violence,” said Vandria Borari of the Borari Kuximawara Indigenous Association of the Alter do Chão territory.The revelations come amid growing frustration at the unfettered access given to corporations that profit from maintaining global dependence on fossil fuels and/or the destruction of forests and other ecosystems vital for mitigating climate catastrophe.The industrialised food sector hascelebratedthe lack of action at recent climate summits, which failed to recommend binding targets for reductions in emissions, fossil fuel use or meat consumption.A 2020 study foundthat even if fossil fuels were immediately eliminated, business as usual in the food sector probably puts the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – and even the 2C goal – out of reach.Meat and dairy sent the largest number, accounting for 72 of the total 302 delegates. This is almost double the number negotiating on behalf of Jamaica, the Caribbean island nation left devastated by Hurricane Melissa last month – a superstorm scientists say was made more intense by human-made global heating. India, a country of 1.45 billion people facing major climate challenges, sent a delegation of 87 negotiators.According to a recent analysis from Friends of the Earth US, the emissions of the 45 largest meat and dairy companies areequivalentto those of Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer. JBS, the world’s largest meat company which alone accounts for a quarter (24%) of the emissions, has eight lobbyists at Cop30 including its CEO, Gilberto Tomazoni.Agrochemicals – pesticides and synthetic fertilisers – account for 60 delegates, and biofuels have 38 representatives – a 138% jump since last year. The pesticides giant Bayer sent 19 lobbyists, the highest number, while Nestlé has nine.Most synthetic fertilisers are derived from fossil fuels and emit nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas 300 times more powerful than CO2, of which agriculture is the largest driver.“These findings are proof that industrial agriculture has been allowed to co-opt the climate convention. Cop will never deliver real climate action as long as industry lobbyists are allowed to influence governments and negotiators,” said Lidy Nacpil of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development.Food is not a focus of this year’s negotiations, but the sector stands to benefit from multiple key topics on the table including decisions over biofuels – many of which are produced from agricultural commodities such as corn and soy driving deforestation.Brazil is pushing for aquadruplingof biofuel use, which is often marketed as a green energy – but a recent study found they can generate 16% more emissions than fossil fuels due to the land use impacts of growing monocrops.Also key is climate finance, of which the world’s largest agricultural polluters, already major recipients of public subsidies – arepositioningthemselves to receive large shares.“What’s happening in Belém is not a climate conference but a hostage negotiation over the future of the planet where those holding the detonators – the soy barons, the beef cartels, the pesticide peddlers – are seated at the table as honest brokers,” said Raj Patel, author of Stuffed and Starved: The Hidden Battle for the World Food System.“These food lobbyists are purchasing access and legitimacy through politicians willing to accept their checks while the planet burns, added Patel, research professor in the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.The analysis is based on the UNFCCC’s provisional list of 56,000 Cop30 delegates, and includes representatives of the largest corporations of meat and dairy, pesticides and fertiliser, food processors, commodity and seed traders, grocery retail and biofuels. The numbers also include global and regional trade groups, and national farmer unions and institutes with corporate affiliations and/or a history of lobbying aligned with industry demands.TheBrazilian National Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock (CNA), the agribusiness sector’s main lobbying arm in Congress, has supported several controversial anti-environmental laws including a bill that restricts the demarcation of and access to land for Indigenous populations, and attempted tooverturnthe Amazon soy moratorium, a landmark voluntary agreement to block the sale of soya linked to deforestation.The Meat Institute – which represents 350 meatpacking and processing companies that produce 95% of the meat and poultry in the US – has two delegates. The trade group has lobbied hard against regulations includingopposingefforts to force US companies to disclose the full extent of their emissions, and against changes to dietary guidelines around reducing red meat consumption.In the US, agribusiness corporations and trade groups spent wellover half a billion dollarslobbying Congress between 2019 and 2023 for favourable legislation, so it’s unsurprising to see big ag at Cop30, according to Karen Perry Stillerman, deputy director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.“Advocates are already calling for the fossil fuel industry and its disinformation to be banned from future climate talks, and the influence of big ag is similarly toxic … we won’t have sustainable, fair, healthy or climate-resilient food systems anywhere in the world as long as giant agribusiness and food corporations are making the rules.”The industrial agricultural participation is up 71% compared to Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, but down from therecord highat Cop28 in Dubai, which was the largest ever UN summit with 86,000 delegates, compared with 56,000 registered in Brazil.A spokesperson for Bayer said: “We have been transparent on our Cop engagements … we firmly support actions to avert the climate crisis. The process needs all hands on deck.”A spokesperson at JBS said in a statement: “JBS, as a food company, is concentrated on increasing farm productivity, enhancing food system efficiency, and reducing food loss and waste.”Nestlé, CNA and the Meat Institute did not respond to requests for comment. The Brazilian Cop30 presidency and UNFCCC also did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsCop30AgricultureClimate crisisFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

During Trump’s first term, he wasconsideredto head the Federal Trade Commission. In 2020, hepraisedTrump at the Republican National Convention as a “warrior against human trafficking”,servedas Utah co-chair for Trump’s re-election campaign and was reportedly encouraged by Trump to run for Senate in 2024.On 20 November 2023, officials with the Utah attorney general office’sSecure strike forceraided Rubicon’s offices, accompanied by a local Fox News affiliate crew, and charged the company with more than 50 crimes related to human trafficking.The lawsuits allege none of the crimes or allegations were true, but were filed under false pretenses days after the Utah legislature approved an audit of Reyes’s office amid questions about his ties to Tim Ballard, the founder of an anti-trafficking organization Operation Underground Railroad (OUR). Severalwomen are suingBallard over sexual assault allegations, though Ballard has denied the allegations and the Salt Lake City district attorney declined to file criminal charges.“It was known and foreseeable that when government agents submitted materially false and misleading affidavits, and then invited the news media to film the raid, that the businesses employing Utah citizens would be crippled and their employees would suffer serious financial harm,” the lawsuit filed by workers said.The lawsuit alleges the raid was conducted after the audit of Reyes and his ties to Ballard.The charges against Rubicon were dismissed in 2024 by the attorney general’s office after a judgefoundthey were filed prematurely and many of the warrants were obtained through false information.Dario Benitez, an employee at Rubicon and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said he was in “disbelief” when the raid and charges were filed.“Rubicon workers were hit very hard,” Benitez said. “The company was a very fast-growing business and never had any layoffs. Because of the actions of the Utah [attorney general’s office], the company had to do four different rounds of layoffs. Some of those employees laid off still have not found work, others struggled to find new jobs. Employees who were able to keep their jobs suffered pay reductions, including loss of bonuses and significant salary reductions. To date, salaries and bonuses have not been restored.”Benitez noted because of the raid, the company lost over 50% of its contracts, resulting in layoffs or reduced hours, forcing workers to get second jobs to make ends meet.“The goal of this filing is to correct the record and us as individuals to move forward with our lives,” added Scott Bennion, an employee at Scandia, Rubicon’s parent company, in a press release on the lawsuit. “When accusations are made without the evidence to support them, the impact does not simply disappear. Restoring accuracy is part of restoring trust.”The Utah attorney general’s office and Reyes did not respond to multiple requests for comment. They had declined to comment on the initial lawsuit filed by Rubicon and its parent company.Explore more on these topicsUtahDonald TrumpLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Siemiatkowski told analysts on an earnings call on Tuesday that it was “pretty remarkable, and unheard of as a number, among businesses”.He explained that Klarna has not hired “for a few years”. However, some of the resulting cost-savings had been used to increase pay for remaining staff, with average compensation – including employee-related taxes and pension contributions – rising by 60% over the past three years.“We have made a commitment to our employees that all of these efficiency gains, and especially the applications of AI, should also, to some degree, come back in their pay cheques so that they are fully … incentivised [and] aligned with the investors, to drive these changes through the company.”Average compensation for each employee has jumped from $126,000 (£96,000) in 2022 to $203,000 today, Klarna said.Siemiatkowski, who is a shareholder in a number of AI firms including OpenAI and Perplexity through his family investment firm Flat Capital, said he hoped to continue increasing a metric measuring revenue per employee, suggesting a further reduction in staff numbers in the years ahead.“We’re now at $1.1m per employee, and we hope to continue to do that acceleration.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first was the rising cost of living, propelled by the sharp burst ofinflationthat peaked at 9% a year in July 2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the economy. The other theme was race.The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’ economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is nowtrying to recoverhis economic narrative. But it may be too late.Ever since Trump launched his first successful run at the presidency in 2016, he has branded himself as a champion of a beleaguered white US working class that feels out of place in an increasingly diverse nation. In 2016, he branded Mexican immigrants as rapist thugs. In 2020, he suggested white suburban women needed his protection from violent urban minorities. In 2024, he kicked off the last week of his campaign at Madison Square Garden in New York City, promising to launch the “largest deportation program in American history to get these criminals out” and to get critical race theory “the hell out of our schools”.Trump reverses course and cuts tariffs on US food importsRead moreThe focus on race probably fits Trump’s worldview better. When he was born, about 10% of Americans were non-white, compared with about 40% today. In his heart, he probably agrees that the beloved white America of his youth is under siege. He shares the fearful gaze with which some of his base look upon the multi-ethnic pot that urban America has become.Politically, Trump’s emphasis on raceis not misplaced. There is abundant evidence that white Americans’ ethnic hostility has played a key role in shaping the US’s politics and its institutions. Work years ago by the economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote concluded that racial barriers – fear, contempt, mistrust – are a big reason the United Statesdid not develop the rich safety netthat the more ethnically homogeneous democracies of western Europe built to protect their people from economic calamities. Indeed, when he started building the American safety net, FDR tailored New Deal programs to exclude Black Americans in order to get white southern Democrats onboard. On the day he signed the Civil Rights Act into law, President Lyndon Johnson, a southern Democrat, adroitlyobserved to his aide Bill Moyers: “I think we may have lost the south for your lifetime – and mine.”In any event, ethnic resentment has become the central focus of Trump’s domestic policy. The Department of Homeland Security’s violent deportation tactics and the deployment of the national guard to big cities (not coincidentally run by Democrats) are proposed as strategies to combat rampant immigrant crime. The high-profile attacks against universities for their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs are justified as a defense of white Americans from unjust policies depriving them of their due. Federal government agencies have been ordered to do away with all efforts to promote DEI. Cities, the most ethnically and culturally diverse ecosystems in America, are portrayed as dystopian cauldrons of unrest.Trump seems not only to have forgotten his promises on the economy, he also appears to enjoy stoking Americans’ economic anxieties. Hisarray of tariffsagainst friend and foe has slowed the economy, stalling employment growth while it raises the prices of key necessities. His decision to end subsidies for health insurance plans under Obamacare will drastically raise premiums for millions of Americans. And there is probably no better strategy than ending Snap food assistance payments – as he did during the government shutdown – to deepen the economic misery of the poor.Many of his voters are increasingly unhappy. Last week, the University of Michigan reported a sharp decline in its index ofconsumer sentimentto near its historical lows. Other than people with very large equity portfolios enjoying the ride in tech stocks, everybody isfeeling more miserable. So it is perhaps not surprising that voters’ economic grievances are now coming back to bite him. Trump’s approval ratingis tanking, driven down most precipitously by disapproval of his handling of inflation, the economy and employment.The special elections earlier this month in which Democrats swept the races for mayor of New York City and governors of Virginia and New Jersey – and comfortably pushed through a redistricting plan in California that may cost Republicans five seats in the House – provided a sharp reminder of what is at stake. Discontent is seepingbeyond blue Americaand on to Trump’s turf. On 4 November it translated into Democratic wins in races for state legislatures, county executives and other officesin redder constituencies, from Mississippi and Georgia to Virginia and Pennsylvania.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he does seem aware of the political fallout from his economic policies: on Friday, he tried to engineer lower food prices by ending tariffs he had imposed; he has suggested a much-ridiculed50-year mortgageto address housing affordability; and he floated a$2,000 tax rebatefunded by the tariffs Americans have already paid.While Trump may have changed tack, in an echo of what happened to Joe Biden, voters living the reality of a moribund economy may find it harder to forget Trump claiming “we have no inflation”, especially as Democrats replay that message again and again in their fight to recover the House in midterm elections next year.Racial hostility is, for sure, a central driver ofUS politics. Its importance will probably grow as a shrinking white share of the population leads a scared Maga coalition to circle the wagons ever more tightly. But it seems evident today that stoking Americans’ racial grievances will not be enough for Trump to cling to power. He had to deliver on the economy too. And he hasn’t.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationRaceInflationTrump tariffsTariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was 10 June 2023, and his Union team were losing a physical match 2-1 to the San Jose Earthquakes. Jamiro Monteiro, a player Tanner had brought to the Union in 2019 before trading him to San Jose, was being substituted. Monteiro, clearly exhausted, trudged to the Earthquakes’ bench as referee Nima Saghafi extended his arm and ushered him along, briefly making contact.It wasn’t the first time Saghafi had touched the midfielder. In the first half, with Monteiro on the ground after being sent flying by a tackle, Saghafi placed his hand on Monteiro’s back, a small gesture meant to show concern.Both were throwaway moments, the type of thing a referee might do in any given game in any given league in the world.“Why don’t you just kiss him, you faggot,” Tanner allegedly said in response to Saghafi’s actions, loud enough to be audible to fans sitting below the box where Union staff were located.“Twenty people must’ve heard this,” one eyewitness said. “There was a woman in the stands who was clearly horrified.”The alleged incident is one of many involving Tanner in a wide-ranging complaint filed by theMLSPlayers’ Association (MLSPA) to Major League Soccer in January which was obtained and reviewed by the Guardian, and which MLS confirms they received. The account of the Saghafi incident in the complaint matches that of a source who claims to have witnessed the event and multiple sources who were told shortly thereafter.Sources said despite the public nature of the alleged incident, Tanner did not face any immediate scrutiny, suggesting he likely wasn’t recognized. MLS sporting executives are hardly celebrities and to anyone other than knowledgeable fans in San Jose, Tanner was likely little more than a random face in a box seat.In fact, Tanner is one of MLS’s most influential and renowned roster builders, portrayed publicly as a disciplined executive who arrived from Europe, mastered the North American league’s arcane rulebook, and turned a struggling franchise into one of MLS’s best.Privately, though, 17 sources have alleged numerous misbehaviors spanning nearly the entirety of Tanner’s seven-year tenure with the Union. These include six of the eight allegations in the MLSPA complaint for which the Guardian was able to find supporting evidence, including accounts from current and former Union employees. The Guardian can separately report additional allegations. Together, the claims suggest a different side of Tanner, who allegedly:Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on thePhiladelphia UnionII, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.“He thinks people are below him, and that he can get away with anything,” one source said. “because he’s given [the Union] some success.”Through his attorney, Tanner told the Guardian in a statement that he “firmly denies these accusations, some of which are six or seven years old.” The lawyer’s statement continued, “Throughout his career spanning over three decades in professional soccer around the globe, Mr. Tanner has worked fairly and effectively in a diverse, multi-cultural world upholding high standards of professionalism.”The Philadelphia Union said in a statement to the Guardian that Tanner was found to have made potentially insensitive gender-based comments early in his tenure, for which he underwent training and had discussions with club leadership. They said they were not previously aware of the allegations in the MLSPA complaint.“The Philadelphia Union takes all allegations of misconduct extremely seriously and is unwavering in our commitment to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all players, staff, and members of our community,” the club said.MLS confirmed in its own statement that it received the MLSPA complaint and launched an investigation into the allegations immediately afterward. The Guardian understands that Tanner was never placed on leave after the investigation began in January because MLS couldn’t corroborate the claims against him. The investigation was closed this fall. However, the league told the Guardian in a statement that it had required Tanner to go through a “structured remedial program focused on professional workplace conduct” due to the seriousness of the allegations in the MLSPA complaint, and retains the right to re-open the investigation if more information is brought forward.In the meantime, the Union have continued to win. The club compiled MLS’s best regular season record in 2025, and have advanced to the conference semi-finals. Their youth academy has produced multiple US national team players in line for a spot on the 2026 World Cup squad. Tanner has drawn continued praise for this success.These achievements, taken with the allegations, paint a picture of an MLS executive whose results have earned him an increasing level of power and influence, even as claims of workplace misbehavior were reported.“You wonder, how many lives does this dude have?,” asked another source.Allegations contained in the MLSPA complaint were supported independently, with recollections of Tanner’s alleged comments recounted by at least one person who claims to have heard them firsthand, with additional evidence via contemporaneous accounts, including emails, text messages and video. Allegations not contained in the MLSPA complaint were recalled separately by multiple sources who were present for the incidents, and were supported by contemporaneous accounts.No source, however, would go on the record – either because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, or because they feared repercussions for speaking out against a powerful sporting executive in the relatively insular world of American soccer. They expressed this despite MLS’s promises of anonymity via a reporting hotline and guidance issued to every club in the league.“100% you can get blacklisted for speaking publicly about any of this,” said one source, a sentiment shared by many others.“This is a small, small world,” added one. “And not just MLS – it’s easy to get a reputation as someone who speaks out about stuff like this and it will cost you your job, not just where you are presently. It will follow you around every league in this country.”View image in fullscreenThe Union won the 2025 Supporters’ Shield, awarded to the MLS team with the best regular-season record.Photograph: Isaiah Vazquez/Getty Images‘I like winning. A lot.’It’s no overstatement to call Tanner one of the most successful sporting executives in MLS history.In many other leagues, that type of respect would be earned through winning a haul of trophies. While the Union have won two of those (the 2020 and 2025 Supporters’ Shields, awarded to the MLS team with the best regular-season record), Tanner’s reputation has been gained more through shrewd business than silverware.Tanner arrived in Philadelphia in 2018, brought in by Union minority owner Richie Graham, the financial muscle behind the club’s wildly successful YSC (Youth Soccer Center) academy. Tanner was tasked with guiding a club that had qualified for the playoffs only once and lacked the resources of the league’s biggest teams. In MLS, though, a soft salary cap allows well-managed lower-spending teams to be competitive.“That was one of the reasons I thought it was good to go here,” Tannersaidin 2022. If you do your job right, you can be successful … here, you can win. To be honest, I like winning. A lot.”Under Tanner, the Union have qualified for the postseason every year except 2024 and made the 2022 MLS Cup final, a performance that earned Tanner the league’s executive of the year award. These successes have come on a threadbare budget: The 2025 team that finished with the league’s best record spends about $11m on its players – about a third of star-studded Inter Miami, who pay Lionel Messi about double what the entire Union first team earns.Nearly every one of the same sources who spoke to the Guardian about Tanner’s alleged misbehavior freely admit that the Union and some staff have benefitted from Tanner’s presence. The organization has brought in about $43m through player sales over the course of his tenure, often from their own academy products. Tanner has also displayed an uncanny ability to scout little-known players from abroad who become solid contributors on team-friendly deals before being dealt away for a tidy return. In a league that has encouraged parity, the Union under Tanner are proof that one can compete with big money in the league without needing to spend it.“I think there were some positives that came from [working with him],” said one former staff member who also supported several allegations against Tanner. “He’s been in some really impressive places and I think he used his knowledge to push me to be better at dealing with really challenging people. I can’t say my experiences were all negative – I certainly grew from it.”When Tanner arrived in Philadelphia in 2018, he worked alongside Chris Albright, who was then the club’s technical director. Sources said that in Albright’s time at the Union, reining in Tanner’s unprofessional and inappropriate comments became a regular part of his job.“When Chris Albright was there he was able to manage [the dynamic between others at the club and Tanner],” one source said. “He was kind of a buffer for everything. But that’s gone now.”Albright declined to speak to the Guardian. The Union declined to comment on Tanner and Albright’s dynamic.Perhaps Tanner’s biggest single decision at the Union was the 2024 dismissal of head coach Jim Curtin, a Philadelphia-area native who had been in the organization in some form since 2010, had experienced success under Tanner, and was widely respected by fans, players and the wider organization.In the absence of Curtin, Albright and other longtime staffers, sources say, Tanner has only become more empowered. In 2024, he was given a long-term contract extension by the Union, a year after he was connected to the vacant US men’s national team sporting director post. His vision for the club is directly cited by club owners as the driving force behind not just first-team coaching and tactical decisions, but also the way the youth academy operated at a granular level.“We’d always question how a sporting director has so much power over everybody,” said one former Union academy player. “Everything went through him, it was so strange. His face was everywhere, all over the stadium. Why is a sporting director so popular, or so public like that? Whether it’s the way he talks or because he’s so intimidating, who knows. It’s a strange thing.”In his statement, Tanner said he “remains proud of the team’s success this season and his work with the Philadelphia Union.”‘This is not women’s soccer’Allegations concerning Tanner’s behavior date back to his first year at the Union in 2018. During a large gathering of academy players and staff that year, Tanner was speaking about his plans for the Union’s academy and offering advice to those in attendance – a group that included young prospects, the director of the academy, and allegedly at least two members of ownership, including Graham. At one point, an academy player asked Tanner whether he had any advice on dealing with match officials.“You should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman,” multiple sources allege Tanner said, with another recalling that he added: “women should be in the kitchen, not being referees.”That alleged incident, which is not in the MLSPA complaint, was followed two years later by one that is. During a preseason game in February of 2020, Tanner allegedly went after head referee Tori Penso, then a newcomer to MLS and still half a year away from becoming the first female head referee to call an MLS regular-season game. Penso’s resume was long, though, having called games in the men’s lower leagues and NWSL. She has gone on to call a host of international matches since, including a Women’s World Cup final.After a foul late in the match, one source recalled Tanner saying “this isn’t women’s soccer, go back to women’s soccer – women don’t belong in men’s soccer.” Other sources who were present confirm this account, as does partial video of the match obtained by the Guardian in which Tanner can be heard raising his voice near the camera and yelling “this is not women’s soccer.”“A lot of us who were there were just incredibly uncomfortable,” said one source. “This wasn’t an uncommon thing for him when it came to female referees or just women generally.”“If these remarks are proven to be true, we are appalled,” said Mark Geiger, general manager of the Professional Referee Organization, which administers professional soccer officiating in the US. “Such comments – and any form of discriminatory language – are deeply irresponsible, wholly inappropriate, and have no place in our game or in society.”Tanner issued a statement through his attorney saying he “denies ever intentionally making insensitive gender-based comments.” Tanner’s legal representation also supplied supportive statements from five current and former coworkers. Of those, two work within the Union academy. Dr. Nooha Ahmed-Lee, who serves as the academy’s head of schools, said in part that Tanner has “shown a deep respect for our diverse community” and that “As a woman and person of color, I have always experienced Ernst as a thoughtful and principled leader who values professionalism, inclusion, and integrity.” Jon Scheer, the director of the academy, said Tanner has “fostered a culture rooted in accountability, development and respect.”In its statement, the Union said that “early in his tenure with the club, Mr Tanner was found to have made potentially insensitive gender-based comments,” without referencing any specific allegation.“The club took remedial steps to address this conduct, including through training and discussions with the club’s leadership on appropriate workplace conduct,” the Union said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The alleged incidents occurred during greetings between Tanner and the employee and involved Tanner grabbing the employee’s buttocks “numerous times,” according to the MLSPA complaint. The allegation and the existence of notice to Union HR are supported by emails reviewed by the Guardian as well as the accounts of nine sources familiar with the incidents, all of whom requested anonymity to protect their professional relationships. None of the sources saw any evidence of a response from the Union, who like MLS declined to address the topic specifically when asked by the Guardian. Tanner’s legal representation denied the allegation, saying that he “did not inappropriately touch a colleague.”The club’s handling of that complaint is par for the course, say several sources, who described situations in which Tanner avoided contact with them and circumvented their authority after they reported him to Union HR for other incidents. In total, over a dozen current and former Philadelphia Union employees say that complaints concerning Tanner’s behavior have been submitted to the club’s HR department but that they have seen no evidence of a response.“I know many people feel that stuff that has gone to HR has a way of getting buried,” said one source. “Everybody always said – ‘guys, all you can do is report things to HR.’ But sometimes it felt like anyone who reported shit to our HR department just ended up getting pushed out.”In their statement, the Union said: “When a matter has been brought to our attention, the Union has always acted swiftly and appropriately, including retaining outside counsel when appropriate to conduct thorough investigations in accordance with club policy and legal requirements.”The Guardian understands that while MLS expects its clubs to share allegations of workplace misconduct, the league was not previously aware of the allegations contained in the MLSPA complaint. A majority of those interviewed by the Guardian said that several of these incidents were among those reported to the Union’s HR department.‘Like they were subhuman’Another common theme among a majority of the sources who spoke with the Guardian was Tanner’s allegedly racist commentary about Black players, coaches and referees. Several such allegations are made in the MLSPA’s complaint to the league.“He consistently would speak about African players like they were subhuman,” said one source of Tanner’s workplace behavior, a description matching that of three other current and former Union employees. “That was pretty consistent. He would always sort of throw out – ‘well, he’s African, he’s not able to do that.’ Or, ‘we all know that Africans can’t perform like that, we can’t trust them.’”The MLSPA’s complaint contains a few allegations that fall within these lines. One, supported by a source close to the Union first team, said that Tanner criticized a Black player’s perceived lack of speed by saying “It’s like he’s not even Black.”Multiple sources supported another allegation from a Union match against Orlando City in March of 2023. During the match, Union forward Mikael Uhre was called offside by assistant referee Justin Howard, who is Black. In the MLSPA complaint, Tanner is alleged to have said in response: “This is the problem with MLS, they allow Black referees in the league. When did they allow this? They lack intelligence and capability.” This allegation is supported by three sources who either witnessed it firsthand or were told about it shortly afterward.The MLSPA complaint also references an alleged incident in which Tanner reacted to the dropping of a plate of food at a coaches’ training by saying “It’s a good thing we invited the African coaches; they’re used to eating food off the floor.” Multiple sources confirm this account, adding that the comment was said in a room full of people and was directed toward an attendee who had spent time coaching in Africa.A majority of sources interviewed by the Guardian said that a cultural disconnect was often raised among Union employees as a potential explanation for why Tanner, who is German, behaved in this manner. However, all of those sources were quick to clarify that Tanner’s behavior far exceeded anything that could be attributed to a cultural difference.“[The disconnect] was a thing, for sure,” said one source. “But a lot of [people at the club] were from Europe, too, though, and I don’t know anyone who comes from there to here who acts that way because of a ‘disconnect.’”It was, another source said, “absolute ignorance, things that aren’t acceptable but maybe he thinks they are.”In his statement to the Guardian, Tanner wrote that throughout his career he has “worked fairly and effectively in a diverse, multi-cultural world upholding high standards of professionalism.”Of the five statements in support of Tanner provided by his attorneys, three are from current or former coworkers who are Black. Union senior director for club welfare and compliance Sheldon Phillips said in part that Tanner’s “direct communication style encourages healthy dialogue, contributing to a space where diverse perspectives can thrive.” Union academy scout and assistant coach Idrissa Kone called him a “supportive person and boss” who “has been friendly and kind to me.” Former Union assistant coach Marlon LeBlanc expressed gratitude for Tanner’s hiring him at the Union and recommendation for him for a different job considering “it is very difficult for Black coaches to break into MLS.” LeBlanc said he was treated “with respect, and professionalism.”‘He stood up for it the entire time’In 2020, Tanner hired Sven Gartung to coach the Union II, the club’s reserve team that is often used as a proving ground for the club’s academy players. Gartung arrived after a very brief stint coaching a Malaysian Super League side, with past experience at academy level in Germany. The Union dismissed Gartung after just six months on the job, at the time offering no reason for his termination.“Sven was a weird one,” said one former Union II player, “because he came with what we believed was like zero or no coaching experience. It was so strange. His ideas and knowledge of the game were really the worst I’ve ever seen at the professional level. The things he was showing us was stuff you’d do at a U-7 training.”Internally, six separate sources said, it was clear that Gartung had been dismissed because of an inappropriate interaction with another Union employee. Two sources recall that at one point, Gartung threatened a prominent Union academy player after he was ruled out due to a concussion, saying “I’m gonna cut your testicles off and hang them on the wall” if the player missed a game. Gartung did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Guardian, while USL and the USL Players’ Association both said they had no record of any formal complaints filed against Gartung (Union II played in USL at the time).Another former Union II player remembers a situation where a player was forced to run “to where he was sick.”“And [Gartung] basically said the player should be able to do it because of where he was from,” the Union II player said. “He was African.”“There were issues with the way [Gartung] spoke with women on staff,” added another source close to the club. “And Ernst would say basically that there were cultural dynamics at play, that people talk differently here in the US. But it definitely was incredibly inappropriate.”One source characterized Gartung and three other Tanner-hired coaches in the Union organization who were similarly harsh in their dealings with players as “direct reflections of Ernst.”“Those were the people he wanted to be around on a daily basis, he defended them to a fault,” the source said. “I felt Ernst was going to be fired over that whole [Gartung] situation but he just stood up for it the entire time.”The Union and Tanner both declined to specifically address the hiring of Gartung, who has since left soccer entirely and landed back in Europe, where he is CEO of an AI startup.View image in fullscreenThe Union have qualified for the MLS playoffs in every year of Tanner’s tenure except 2024.Photograph: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images‘Ernst has done his job’MLS and the Union confirmed to the Guardian that the league ran an investigation into Tanner’s conduct alleged in the MLSPA complaint. The Guardian understands that the league relied on their own legal counsel to do interviews, doing so in order to better collaborate with the MLSPA. However, a source indicated that the league hadn’t followed up with the MLSPA concerning the status of the investigation until last week, after the Guardian approached MLS for comment.MLS told the Guardian that “more than a dozen current and former players and club employees” were contacted for its investigation, with a “majority” deciding to take part. The Guardian understands that a total of 13 people were contacted, with eight eventually participating, including Tanner. The Union said in its statement that the club “fully cooperated” with the investigation.MLS said it closed the investigation when it could not corroborate the allegations in the MLSPA complaint, but the Guardian understands that the league found the alleged behavior, if true, to be unacceptable, constituting a “clear violation” of league policy.Even though the league did not corroborate the allegations, it did require him to participate in a “structured remedial program focused on professional workplace conduct,” according to the league’s statement. The Guardian understands this to be a training on appropriate workplace behavior that lasts several hours. It is at least the second training of the type Tanner has been made to do aside from the Union’s annual sensitivity training, which the club says it requires all staff to complete.In their statements to the Guardian, both the Union and MLS stated that furthering their investigation into Tanner remains a possibility.“The League maintains an anonymous reporting hotline and will re-open the investigation if additional information is brought forward,” said an MLS spokesperson.“Should any new information emerge, the Philadelphia Union will act quickly and appropriately, in accordance with our policies, and will continue to cooperate fully with the league,” wrote the Union.MLS has a long history of investigating similar allegations of misbehavior, but they’ve largely been limited to on-the-field incidents. In terms of front office personnel, one recent high-profile investigation into racist behavior was focused on now-former Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hansen, who was eventually forced to sell his share in the club and the NWSL’s Utah Royals.Current San Jose Earthquakes head coach Bruce Arena was also at the center of a league investigation during his time at the New England Revolution in 2023. Arena was first placed on administrative leave by the league after allegations of “insensitive language” were made, reportedly by his own coaching staff. He eventually resigned and never publicly addressed specifics of the situation, citing “legal restrictions.”Tanner has remained at the Union, by most accounts in good standing with ownership.“To ownership, Ernst has done his job,” said one source. “I think when [chair and CEO Jay] Sugarman looks at it, his ROI is astronomical. Why would I get rid of the guy who’s done this for me, at this point?”If you have any relevant information to share about this story or others, you can contact the Guardian securelythrough these methods.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsPhiladelphia UnionInvestigative journalismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Add this one to the list. Scotland’s long, long wait is over. You yearn for almost three decades to return to the men’s World Cup and do so with an overhead kick, a 22-yard stunner and a goal from the halfway line.Steve Clarke, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn; you shall go to the ball. So too Kieran Tierney, whose magnificent strike in stoppage time would have made all the headlines before Kenny McLean notched Scotland’s fourth. McLean broke forward, spotted Kasper Schmeichel in a state of desperation, and floated the ball over him. McLean was in the middle of the pitch when he shot. Cue bedlam. Cue wonderful bedlam.Scotland 4-2 Denmark: World Cup 2026 qualifying – as it happenedRead moreSo many years of frustration, when Scotland’s men have peered towards World Cups from afar, were obliterated as the 10Denmarkplayers fell to a defeat that felt unlikely for so long. Grown men in kilts shed tears. Denmark’s participation in next summer’s jamboree depends on playoffs next March. Clarke can start making plans, once he recovers from leading the celebrations here.PhD students could produce work on how on earth Scotland achieved this qualification. They appeared down and out at times, including on Saturday when they lost in Athens. It was almost as if someone, somewhere had decided the Scots had suffered for long enough. Tierney’s intervention was an extraordinary one. McLean’s? Something else. Clarke has become the first manager in history to guide Scotland to three tournaments.View image in fullscreenKieran Tierney curls in Scotland’s crucial third goal in the third minute of added time.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAThe night had supposedly opened in difficult fashion for the hosts. John Souttar, who had been due to partner Scott McKenna in central defence, was injured in the warm-up. Grant Hanley took Souttar’s place. Any sense of disruption was banished within three minutes.Ben Gannon-Doak jinked and weaved on the right. The Bournemouth winger’s floated cross should have been tricky for McTominay. He was facing away from goal, for starters. But the Napoli midfielder catapulted himself into the air and planted an overhead kick beyond the reach of Schmeichel. This famous old place erupted, not simply in recognition of the opening goal but the special circumstances in which it arrived.McTominay was like a man possessed. Gannon-Doak looked electric. Scottish danger resonated in attacking too ferociously; Craig Gordon saved from Rasmus Højlund after the Denmark striker was sent clean through on goal. The offside flag was raised but Højlund may well have survived a second check were it required. As Mikkel Damsgaard flashed a ball across the Scotland goal and McKenna blocked well from Victor Froholdt, the Scots were in a battle to maintain their advantage.Gannon-Doak had panicked the Danes with his pace. It felt a significant blow to Clarke, then, when the winger overstretched when looking to block a cross. Gannon-Doak departed the scene on a stretcher after just 20 minutes.View image in fullscreenScott McTominay opens the scoring for Scotland with a bicycle kick in the third minute.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAHøjlund soon had the ball in the net but was penalised for a push on Aaron Hickey. By the half-hour, Scotland were living far too dangerously. Yet they reached the break unscathed. Scotland were even denied a great chance of a second goal, Rasmus Kristensen taking out McGinn, earning a booking, after the midfielder capitalised on Danish slackness.Højlund forced Gordon into a smart, low save within 90 seconds of the restart. Given Denmark needed only a draw, the flow of traffic right from the onset of the second period felt ominous for the hosts. Scotland were succeeding – to a point – in breaking up Denmark attacks but promptly handing the ball back to those in red.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The referee originally saw nothing wrong with Robertson’s challenge on Gustav Isaksen, which took place on the angle of the penalty area. Indeed, it appeared Isaksen flung himself into the air. After being advised to look again by the video assistant referee, Szymon Marciniak pointed to the spot. Højlund smashed home. Parity was the least Denmark deserved but Scotland had cause to be sore about the circumstances.All this action-packed encounter lacked was a red card. It arrived on the hour, Kristensen’s second foul of the night on a marauding McGinn bringing another caution. Now Clarke twisted by throwing on the strikers Lawrence Shankland and Ché Adams.The move was to pay dividends. Denmark’s defending of an inswinging Lewis Ferguson corner was shambolic, allowing Shankland to strike from all of a yard. The Hearts man, introduced for his predatory instinct, demonstrated precisely that.Scotland had no time to build on their advantage. Within three minutes, Patrick Dorgu stroked home after Andreas Christensen laid the ball into his path 12 yards out. This time Scotland had been overly generous, Tierney’s defensive header rebounding back into Danish possession.Adams flicked a header wide. McGinn’s curling shot just missed the upright. Enter Tierney. Enter McLean. Wow.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersScotlandDenmarkmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While Tomlin said Rodgers wanted to come back in, the four-time MVP remained in the locker room for evaluation while backup Mason Rudolph helped the AFC North-leading Steelers pull away to improve to 6-4.‘We love Marshawn’: Prescott shines as Cowboys win first game since Kneeland’s deathRead moreThe 41-year-old Rodgers, the NFL’s oldest active player, will not need surgery on the wrist. He will not practice on Wednesday, and what happens after that will depend on how Rodgers adjusts to the brace he will wear and how it impacts his ability to operate normally.Tomlin doesn’t expect pain tolerance to be an issue, though Rodgers will have to show he’s able to protect himself.Rudolph, who filled in capably in the second half against the Bengals, would start for Pittsburgh against the NFC North-leading Bears (7-3) if Rodgers can’t go.Rodgers has a long history with Chicago, dating to his highly successful run in Green Bay earlier in his career. He is 11-1 as a starter at Soldier Field and once famously proclaimed he “owned” one of the NFL’s oldest franchises.Tomlin brushed aside the idea that Rodgers’ dominance over the Bears will play a factor in whether he plays.“Aaron always wants to play. Opponent has nothing to do with it,” Tomlin said. “It’s his love affair with the game of football.”Tomlin isn’t sure exactly when Rodgers sustained the injury, though cameras caught Rodgers clutching the wrist after a second-down heave to the back of the end zone with Pittsburgh driving late in the first half. Rodgers was hit at the end of the play, though he did stay in to make one more pass, an incompletion to Roman Wilson.Rudolph completed 12 of 16 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown against the Bengals and will practice with the starters until Rodgers returns, whenever that might be.Tomlin has sometimes allowed veteran players to miss an entire week of practice and then play on Sunday. Former quarterback Ben Roethlisberger spent a week on the Covid-19 list in 2021 but was cleared to play the night before a visit to the Los Angeles Chargers.The unknown of how the brace will affect Rodgers means he won’t be given that accommodation. Tomlin said the team will need to see how the brace affects what he called Rodgers’ “functionality” before deciding whether he can play.Asked what kind of input Rodgers will have, the NFL’s longest-tenured head coach chuckled.“It’s his body, so certainly he’s gonna be a component of the discussion,” Tomlin said.Rudolph gives Pittsburgh a reliable fallback option. The 30-year-old – now in his second stint with the Steelers following a lengthy run as primarily a backup from 2018 through 2023 – memorably won three straight starts at the end of the 2023 season to help the Steelers make the playoffs.“He’s proven over his time here that he’s capable of coming in and playing winning football for us,” Tomlin said. “And that’s no small task.”While offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and Rodgers work closely in putting the game plan together, Smith also seeks input from Rudolph – one of the reasons Pittsburgh’s offense didn’t miss a beat against the Bengals and the NFL’s worst defense.The challenge will be more difficult in Chicago, where the Steelers have won just once in 13 tries. The Bears lead the NFL in takeaways and are second in third-down efficiency.Rodgers isn’t the only player whose status is uncertain for this week. Outside linebacker Alex Highsmith continues to deal with a pectoral injury that forced him to sit out against the Bengals. Cornerback Darius Slay could be back after spending last week in the concussion protocol.Running back Jaylen Warren, who injured his ankle in the third quarter against Cincinnati, will be limited this week but could be available. Kenny Gainwell compiled 105 total yards and two receiving touchdowns on Sunday while getting an expanded look, which seems likely to continue.While Warren was cleared to return late against the Bengals – and even went back onto the field at one point, only for the Steelers to call timeout – Tomlin opted to stick with Gainwell, whom he felt had the “hot hand”.The trip to Soldier Field begins a daunting three-week stretch for Pittsburgh, which has a tenuous one-game lead over Baltimore. Pittsburgh host Buffalo on 29 November, then open December by visiting the Ravens.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersNFLPittsburgh SteelersChicago BearsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction,was let go by the team last week, in a move Mavericks fans have beenloudly clamoring forsince news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood. And, as it turns out, the future is now.While Dončić’s breakup with the Mavericks was bothvery public and very messy(the Mavs were not shy about vocalizing their reasoning for the move, and painting the 26-year-old in an unflattering light in the process), the silver linings showed themselves quickly. Dončić might not have considered himself suited for the Los Angeles spotlight, but with his flair for the dramatic and a feel for the sport’s theater, playing for such a high-profile franchise has proved an unexpectedly good fit. And it couldn’t have worked out better for the Lakers: the team had been staring at an uncertain future, with the retirement of 40-year-old LeBron James looming, and Davis’s injury history creating a cloud of doubt around his ability to be the No 1 option in the eventual aftermath. Enter Luka stage right: a ticket to franchise salvation, equipped with the newfound motivation that can only be borne from being publicly and mercilessly dragged through the mud.Of course, James’s retirement has been far less imminent than anyone anticipated; his unprecedented longevity and level of play continue to shatter records and defy logic. So instead of a passing of the torch, the months after Dončić’s arrival looked more like a torch collaboration. But James’s bout with sciatica this summer, which has sidelined him for the first month of the season and caused him to miss the first opening night of his 23-year career, brought about a dress rehearsal for the post-LeBron Lakers era. The roster remains a bit clunky, but Dončić is beginning to lean into his newfound leadership role – and those around him are convinced he’s the man for the job. And not only because his 34.4 points per game lead theNBAby a wide margin. The Lakers are 10–4, fourth in the Western Conference behind only Oklahoma City, Denver and Houston, and the prospect of life after LeBron suddenly looks, well, not so scary after all.View image in fullscreenLuka Dončić will one day take the torch from LeBron James as the Lakers’ franchise talisman.Photograph: Eric Thayer/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesDončić has always been special, and the brightest minds in the NBA have recognized it from the start. When the Miami Heat visited Los Angeles in early November, I asked Erik Spoelstra what he believes sets Dončić apart. “Just an incredible competitive spirit,” he told me. “I remember the first time I saw him play – I’ll never forget it. I went to watch Goran Dragić at EuroBasket, so I stopped by their training camp. Luka was 18, and everyone in the gym was stunned by how cerebral his game already was. He could make all the rotations, all the reads, just pick you apart. His fundamentals, his footwork, his skill level – all elite. But more than anything, even then, he could rise to the level of competition. That’s what all the great ones do: competition brings out something most players can’t reach.”“Quiet” was the word Lakers guard Marcus Smart used to describe Dončić’s leadership style in the early days of the season, shortly after the former Defensive Player of the Year had logged his first few games with his new team. “He leads by example,” Smart said. But something is starting to shift for Dončić, whose career-long approach to leadership has largely been, as Smart suggests, to be brilliant without saying much.There’s a newfound maturity and commitment in Dončić’s approach this year, even if he still shows more youthful exuberance than almost anyone in the league. It became apparent as early as the summer, when rumblings spread that he’d undertaken a drastic overhaul of his diet – followed soon after by astriking Men’s Health featurerevealing a noticeably leaner, more sculpted Dončić. The transformation (and the PR push around it) was almost certainly fueled by the Mavericks’ smear campaign in the wake of Dončić’s exit, which sought to question everything from his work ethic to his relationship with alcohol.View image in fullscreenLuka Dončić is averaging 34.4 points and 8.9 assists in 39.0 minutes for the Lakers this season.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesOff the court, Dončić is soft-spoken and even-keeled, happiest laying low with his wife, his baby daughter and his video games. On the court he’s a demon: one of the league’s fiercest competitors, a player who seems to take genuine delight in tormenting opponents. For all his gifts, that almost manic competitiveness may be his defining trait. And seeing it up close makes something obvious: there was never a version of reality in which being cast off the way he was in February led to anything other than this, the moment he turned into the Terminator.Dončić acknowledges that his approach has shifted. He’s been noticeably more vocal this season, and when asked whether that’s intentional, he doesn’t hesitate. “Definitely [more vocal], just trying to help the guys,” he says. But he credits the change partly to improved chemistry, stressing that he still wants leadership to feel shared. “I think leadership shouldn’t be just one player – it should be more players, and I think we have that. Everyone talks a lot. It feels like everyone is on the same page.”Those around him have noticed the growth. Lakers head coach JJ Redick says he’s seen a real shift from last season: “I think he’s letting his teammates in right now,” he says. Austin Reaves – the Lakers guard who hasdeveloped an easy, teasing rapport with Dončićin the months since his arrival – sees it too, and isn’t surprised it took some time. “It’s human nature when things like last year happen. Nobody ever thought that was gonna happen … I’m sure he was in a state of shock,” Reaves says. “Having to move, move his family – it was tough. But now I think he’s just getting comfortable, having a good time.”When James returns to make his season debut, whichcould happen as soon as Tuesday nightagainst the Utah Jazz, the soft opening of the Lakers’ Luka Era will come to a temporary close. But the forward momentum won’t halt: the progress Dončić has made with the keys to the franchise in hand are palpable, and likely here to stay. He knows the future is his, and he seems more comfortable with that fact than ever.Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićLeBron JamesLos Angeles LakersNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An event last weekend suggests otherwiseTue 18 Nov 2025 07.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.04 ESTShareIt was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.Etan ThomasI listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.The fear was that they’d use the spray on Black and Brown students without hesitation, at the slightest perceived sign of trouble.Syracuse’s campus newspaper, the Daily Orange, printed a photo of myself and Roland Williams, who would go on to play in the NFL, standing at the rally alongside the sista with the megaphone. A few days after the protest, Kathy found me on the quad to thank me for lending my visibility and privilege as a basketball player to their cause. She said she seriously doubted the police would ever pepper spray one of us.She talked about how the university treated athletes as if we were different – valued and welcomed – while other Black and Brown students were made to feel like trespassers, constantly asked to show ID just to prove they belonged. (This was Rudolph Giuliani and Eric Adams’s stop and frisk before it was called that, but I digress).The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead moreThose memories came back to me on Saturday whena Texas state trooper was “sent home”after a run-in with South Carolina player Nyck Harbor during a game. Harbor, as a star athlete, was among the group of people that Kathy lumped into a protected class of Black people when we spoke all those years ago in Syracuse.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueA quick recap of what happened on Saturday.ESPN’s broadcast showedthe trooper appear to intentionally barge Harbor and his teammate Oscar Hadaway III after the receiver had scored a touchdown against Texas A&M in their home stadium. In doing so, the trooper came off like a school bully with low self-esteem – the kind of senior who gets his kicks plowing through a sea of freshmen, daring them to speak up so he can enjoy pummeling them in front of everyone. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), which employs the trooper, later said he had been sent home.There’s a lot to unpack here. Why didn’t the DPS call an immediate press conference and condemn the trooper’s actions? Why didn’t they say his behavior was appalling, disgusting, and unacceptable and not what they teach their state troopers to do?If this trooper behaved like this in the middle of a football stadium, during a nationally televised game, how does he behave whenever he stops a Black person on the side of the highway?Harbor did not retaliate, despite the trooper’s provocation – he turned around and made his way back to the field. But if he had responded, what would have happened? It happens all the time: the person being mistreated by police is expected to respond perfectly, or risk making things worse. Yet there’s no such expectation for the officer – no demand for restraint, professionalism, or even basic decency.Before they try to“no angel” Harbor, it’s important to note that he won the 2023 Franklin D Watkins Memorial Award, a prize which honors African American high schoolers who excel in athletics, academics and charity work. Aside from his football career, Harbor has won national titles in track, volunteered at a soup kitchen and worked with Generosity Global, which campaigns to improve women’s health in Africa. Harbor is majoring in public health and has been on the SEC Academic Honor Roll two years in succession.I asked retired police captain Sonia Pruittwhat she thought of the trooper’s behavior.“People say maybe he was having a bad day. But no, as an officer of the law, you do not get to abuse the public because you are having a bad day … People want to be treated with dignity and respect from their police officer,” she saidon my showThe Collision: Where Sports And Politics Collide. “However, far too often, in police training that simply isn’t the focus or conversation. And when it’s not a focus, you see acting out like what we observed with this Texas state trooper. That’s not a ‘bad apple’ issue, that is a bad system issue.”Captain Pruitt, I couldn’t agree more.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsCollege footballTexasUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

She progressed to the quarter-finals by overcoming defending world champion Caitlin Simmers, but was ultimately defeated by another teenager in Canadian Erin Brooks.“I’m mostly excited just to see how I go in these challenges again,” Gilmore said. “When you step away from competing full-time, you can really switch off, and it can be hard to get back into that headspace, but I’m excited to feel that energy and that challenge again.”Gilmore has won eight world titles, more than any other surfer, and her most recent success came in 2022. That year her improbable finals victory took her past Layne Beachley’s record of seven global crowns.But she withdrew from the tour in 2024 saying she wanted to pursue other passions, which have included playing guitar with rock group Spiderbait, and travelling the world for surf documentaries.Gilmore remains a woman in demand, and signed a new eight-year, multi-million dollar endorsement deal with Rip Curl even after she has stopped competing. “I’ve had incredible opportunities over the last few years, and it’s actually been busier than I could have imagined,” Gilmore said.She will be far from favourite next year in the season that begins at Bells Beach in Victoria in April. In her absence a new generation of surfers has emerged, including 22-year-old defending world champion Molly Picklum from the NSW Central Coast.“It will be nice to get back on tour and have a schedule mapped out for the year. It’s been fun, but I’m looking forward to getting back into a bit more of a routine, so we’ll see where that leads me.”Explore more on these topicsSurfingAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

You didn’t account for the US president and his Fifa soulmate, Gianni InfantinoTue 18 Nov 2025 09.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 13.06 ESTShare“It’s very clear,” claimed haunted Fifa cue-ball Gianni Infantinonot so long ago, “that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics.” But is it clear? Is it really? On Monday, the worst man in world sport was – yet again – to befound in the Oval Office, this time nodding along to Trump’s declaration that games could be moved from host cities for next summer’s World Cup if the US president deems there’s “a problem” with security or that the cities are non-compliant in some other way. In practice, that seems to mean if they’re run by a Democrat/“communist”. Amazing that the Fifa president will gladly allow his tournaments to be held in any old violent autocracy but, for the purposes of the White House cameras at least, might need to draw the line at Boston.Honestly, the very sight of Infantino these days causes decades of writing about Fifa to flash before my eyes. How could it have happened? How could we have ended up with an even bigger horror in charge of world football’s governing body than the various ones who went before? WhenSepp Blatter was thrownfrom a moving gravy train in 2015 amid an explosive corruption scandal, it would have felt like a genuine feat of sporting excellence to have beaten his record for craven awfulness.Tell us: have you bought tickets for the 2026 World Cup yet?Read moreAnd yet here we all are. This year, the Fifa president has been the Forrest Gump of Trump’s administration. Back in May, he attended the US president’s Middle East peace summit, causing him to be so late for Fifa’s own congress that even Uefa accused him of prioritising “private political interests” and staged a delegate walk-out. Last month, Gianni was back on the political trail at Trump’s Gaza peace talks in Egypt, and earlier this month instituted somepreposterous Fifa peace prizethat he’s going to inaugurate at the final draw for the 2026 World Cup in Washington next month, quite possibly so that the orange organ grinder can be the first winner of it. He spent yesterday grinning alongwhile Trump announced things such as the possible ordering of “strikes” on one of the US’s 2026 World Cup co-host nations, Mexico. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Gianni kicked off the year of ceaselessly grim politicking by attending Trump’s inauguration, where he was filmed giggling appreciatively during the bit where the US president announced he’d be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.Back then, in January, Infantino looked like a competition winner. Now he resembles a fully operational member of Trump’s troupe of winged monkeys. It used to be host governments that got co-opted into Fifa’s supra-national edicts – I remember South Africa being forced to set up highly dubious “Fifa World Cup Courts” for errant fans during the 2010 tournament. But now Fifa is a wholly owned tool of whoever will have it. Like all parasites, it relies on its host organisms.As far as I can tell, a political leader removing a game from a host city has never happened in the entire 95-year history of theWorld Cuptournament, which should perhaps confirm the increasing global impression that the US might just be a uniquely backward country. Football fans considering buying expensive tickets and making even more expensive travel arrangements should consider that they are journeying somewhere so apparently volatile that even its own president talks its safety down. Hopefully here in the UK there will be official Foreign Office advice warning of the logistical and political dangers of watching a remorselessly poor match between two of the 48 countries that Infantino has triumphantly ruined the group stages with. Or, indeed, watching no match at all, because Seattle’s mayor has been deemed less politically acceptable than anyone connected to the leadership of the last two host countries, Qatar and Russia. Which, by way of a reminder, were not actually even democracies.Or as Trump’s White House World Cup taskforce head, nepo gimp Andrew Giuliani, put it on Monday, the next World Cup could only have happened because of Trump’s “vision”, and is going to be “one of the greatest cultural events in world history”. Infantino went with different superlatives, promising that it would be “the greatest and most inclusive World Cup ever”. Mm-hm. In the hands of marketing men, of which Mr Infantino is most certainly one, there are few more telltale red flags than use of the word “inclusive”. If you ever hear the word inclusive in what amounts to an advert, you can be sure someone’s about to get done over or excluded – and in this case, would you believe, it’s the fans. Not only has the Fifa overlord allowedWorld Cup game tickets to be subject to the loathed dynamic pricing, but those games might be shifted hundreds or even thousands of miles away due to politics.No doubt Infantino is patting himself on the back for all this. But his true achievement – so far – is presiding over an era in which “sportswashing” stopped being some niche critical term of art, and became something that all football fans know the minute they see it. Because they see it all the time. As for that peace prize, please don’t limit yourself to thinking it will be annual. The last time Gianni invented a prize – Fifa’s The Best Awards – he held them twice inside nine months. So there is every chance Trump could win it again before next summer’s World Cup kicks off. It’s all thanks to the least political man in world sport – or certainly, the least sporting man in world politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is certainly no mean feat. But now think about trying to sustain that same pace for another nine hours. To most of us, the idea veers somewhere between the fantastical and the insane. Yet that is what Caitriona Jennings, a 45-year-old ultrarunner from Donegal, did this month when breaking the women’s world record for 100 miles.Her time for the Tunnel Hill 100 Mile in Illinois was 12hr 37min 4sec – an average pace of 7min 34sec a mile. Incredibly, until then Jennings had never run more than 60 miles in one go. Having smashed the record, she then jumped on a red-eye economy flight from Chicago that landed in Dublin at 5am. Then she cycled straight to the office, where she works for a company that trades and leases planes to global airlines.No time for sleep or a shower: endurance runner covers 764km over five gruelling days to win Backyard Ultra world titleRead moreSome say ultrarunners are a little kooky, a little out of the box. In truth, they probably are, but perhaps they can also teach us a thing or two about life, and how to live it.Jennings dismisses the idea she is any kind of superwoman. Sure, the thought of running 100 miles felt a bit crazy at first, she says. But, as an experienced runner, why not probe the boundaries of the possible? So she trained before work and during her lunch breaks, as well as running 48-64 miles every weekend, to ready herself for what lay ahead.“The hardest part in the race came after 60 miles because I hadn’t even got to the point where I could say: ‘Right, just one marathon to go now,’” she says. “But my body held up pretty well. It was just the mental side.”Her coach, Terry McConnon, reckons Jennings has an amazing engine and some capacity for pain. The fact she finished the London 2012 Olympic marathon despite suffering a stress fracture in her foot suggests he has a point.A little struggle, she says, is no bad thing. “You need to sustain a certain amount of pain because that’s just the nature of the game. If you are going to run that fast, for that long, you’re going to hurt unless you’re superhuman. I think I’ve had such a strong desire to do well and to win that I’m willing to suffer a little in order to get that.”Intriguingly, Jennings is not the only ultrarunner in her 40s proving it is possible to juggle the preternatural and the normal. In October, Sarah Webster, a 46-year-old vet from East Sussex, took down the women’s 24-hour world record at the world championships in France, running an astonishing 173.1 miles.View image in fullscreenCaitriona Jennings finished last in the 2012 Olympic marathon but ran with a stress fracture in her foot.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThen there is Jasmin Paris, who last yearbattled hallucinations and no sleepto become the first womanto complete the Barkley marathon, which consists of five 20-mile loops with more than 12,000 feet of elevation gain per loop, in the 60-hour time limit.That was the culmination of months of training from 5am to 7.45am, before her two children were up and she started work. “It sounds a bit corny, but you also find out more about yourself, when you strip away all the stuff that makes life easier,” she says.That theme is explored in a new film, Run Again, that charts the singer Dave Pen’s attempt to complete the 268-mile Spine Race along the Pennine Way. “People say are you mad?” he says at one point. “But it’s not madness, is it? It’s living. I wanted to do something other people don’t do. I like extremes.”At the end of the film, which has itsUK premiere in London on Thursday, Pen trudges to the finish in 145hr 44min 45sec – more than 62 hours slower than Paris when she won the race in 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And yet he promises to be back.From small-town New Zealand to Mont Blanc: how ultrarunner Ruth Croft made historyRead moreAdharanand Finn was on to something when he described ultrarunning as a metaphor for life, with all its ups and downs, its struggles and revivals. In his brilliant book,The Rise of the Ultrarunners, Finn cites a tattoo the Spanish ultra-athlete Azara García de los Salmones has on her leg, as indicative of what pushes competitors on. “The devil whispered in my ear: ‘You’re not strong enough to withstand the storm,’ it reads. “I whispered back: ‘I am the storm.’”Finn asks: “Is this the appeal of ultrarunning? To push ourselves to a place where we stand face to face with the devil, the depths of the struggle, but then to rise up to overcome it?”When I put this to Jennings, she laughs and calls it an interesting theory. But for her there is something else. “As humans we’re not really designed to be on screens all day. We crave being in nature and having breaks from the noise in our heads. But, yes, you do get a huge sense of achievement from accomplishing a challenge you’ve set yourself. It’s like a drug that’s a very safe and healthy one.”There is one thing that surprises her. “I would like for other women to see what I’m doing and realise it’s not actually that difficult.” I have people say to me quite a lot, ‘Oh, I’d love to do that, but I wouldn’t be able to.’ That still frustrates me. Because you can if you really want to and you’re willing to put in the work.”Jennings is certainly living testament to that.Explore more on these topicsSportUltrarunningcommentShareReuse this content"

But now the former management consultant, who won three World Series as general manager of the Astros and St Louis Cardinals using a data-driven approach that was dubbed “Extreme Moneyball”, is applying his philosophy to a different sport.The owner of a network of football clubs that includes Leganés in Spain and the Ligue 1 sideLe Havre, Luhnow has big plans to revolutionise the development of players in Africa and provide them with a clearer pathway into Europe’s top leagues. “It was pretty clear from the beginning that Africa was going to be the best place for us to find talent that we can integrate into our European clubs,” he says. “It’s not too dissimilar to what I experienced in baseball where a disproportionately large portion of talent comes from places like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Africa has 54 countries and a wide diversity of opportunities.“There’s a lot of infrastructure challenges because, generally speaking, young athletes in Africa don’t have the benefits that the young athletes in Europe or North America have,” Luhnow adds. “So you’re starting from a very different point. But what we have proven to ourselves and are starting to prove externally is that there is enormous talent. And if you do it the right way, the benefits to your teams, and to your entire business, can be incredible.”It is hoped that the sale of Yan Diomande – an 18-year-old from Ivory Coast who joinedLeganéslast year and made only 10 appearances for their first team before being sold to RB Leipzig for €20m (£17.4m) in the summer – could prove to be the first of many after the launching of recruitment and development programmes in several African countries, including Ghana and Zambia, during the past five years. Diomande was linked with some of Europe’s top sides including Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid after scoring three goals and providing three assists in his past three matches.“We’ve got more players like that in our pipeline,” says Luhnow, “and we expect to not only have once in a while those types of successful outcomes; we expect to make it an annual event. To have players in our first team from our Africa recruitment project that are helping the team win games.”View image in fullscreenYan Diomande made 10 appearances for Leganés before being sold to RB Leipzig for €20m (£17.4m).Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyLuhnow wassuspended by the Astroswhen the sign stealing scandal erupted, before he was subsequently fired. He later filed a $22m lawsuit as part of which he claimed he had been made a scapegoat for others. Six years on he has no regrets about the sharp diversion in career path. “It was about trying to read the signs between the catcher and the pitcher and communicate those to the batter, which has been done over the history of baseball,” says Luhnow. “The way our club did it during that particular season was against the rules, and since I was the general manager, I was held responsible for it.“Sometimes you look back at things that happened that, at the time, you perceive as negative and they end up being a blessing in disguise. I’d been in baseball for 16 years. I had won 20 championship rings. I had modernised two clubs and was getting the itch to do something else, and I had already started looking at football.”Luhnow, who grew up in Mexico before moving to California as a teenager, was persuaded to take the plunge into a new sport after talking to Billy Beane, the former general manager of the Oakland Athletics whose sabermetrics strategy revolutionised baseball and who is now a minority owner at Barnsley and advises the Dutch side AZ. After a failed attempt to invest in Sunderland when they were still in League One, Luhnow admits he “got the bug” and decided to look elsewhere. Having established his company Blue Crow Sports Group, which boasts the former baseball star Alex Rodriguez and several other former athletes as investors, he led the purchase of Cancún in Mexico’s top flight in June 2022 and completed the takeover of Leganés a few weeks later. Blue Crow bought Le Havre in the summer and have big plans for one of France’s oldest clubs, whose academy has produced Paul Pogba, Riyad Mahrez and Dimitri Payet.“We want to make Le Havre every English person’s second favourite team or favourite team in France, because we were founded by Oxford and Cambridge students,” says Luhnow. “I think that’s where we’re going to put our focus. We’re the closest major city to England and we should be every British person’s favourite team in France. That’s our goal.”View image in fullscreenJeff Luhnow says he was already ‘getting the itch’ to leave baseball after the Astros’ scandal broke.Photograph: Rob Tringali/MLB Photos/Getty ImagesLuhnow is also banking on the initiative that aims to develop the best talent from Africa to propel Blue Crow clubs to new heights. The Dubai-based investment firm 885 Capital bought a significant share in Blue Crow this year and is playing an important role in setting up the network of feeder clubs. “Our plan is to run an elite programme on the ground in Africa,” says the 885 Capital chief executive, Sudeep Ramnani. “The focus is on giving them [African talent] exposure to playing in European football and starting from the age of 14 rather than from the age of 16.“We don’t just want to focus on talent, but also personality development – often you get some great talent that fails because maybe they just haven’t had that exposure to the developed world early enough, and they haven’t had that kind of training from an educational standpoint.”Luhnow is aware of scepticism from Leganés supporters about being part of a multi-club network, especially in light of their relegation from La Liga last season, but he remains confident of achieving success on their part. “My most satisfying moments in sports have been the World Series parades in St Louis and Houston, especially Houston, where they won the first championship ever in history,” he says. “The first championship ever in Cancún, we won and took the trophy through town and just seeing people so excited. And then here at Leganés, when we got promoted to the first division a couple of years ago, it’s a town of 200,000. We went to the main square; there were 75,000 people there. People were crying.“You can’t get that in business and technology. You can only get that in sports, and that’s what drives me. So I really appreciated my time in baseball. I love it. I still am involved, talking to people. I track it. But football is where I need to be right now.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLeganésLe HavreBaseballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The performance and result understandably left Craig Bellamy reaching for superlatives.“I said to the players at the end, I am not a perfect person, I haven’t come across anyone who is,” theWaleshead coach said. “But maybe I take a little bit of that back because that was as close to a perfect performance as I’ve seen. That was incredible.” He was not exaggerating.Tierney and McLean send Scotland to World Cup with thrilling win against DenmarkRead moreWales had lost experienced leaders to injury, their entire first‑choice central midfield was missing through suspension, but those available to Bellamy stepped up to deliver a complete and clinical team display. Harry Wilson excelled as he captained his country for the first time, capping a proud night with a hat-trick. Brennan Johnson, David Brooks, Dan James and Neco Williams also showed the Premier League quality that made the difference.North Macedonia arrived in Cardiff unbeaten in the qualifying campaign and having conceded three goals in total, including in two games against group-winners Belgium. They were torn apart as Bellamy’s side leapfrogged them into second place in Group J. A more favourable playoff draw is the prize. Wales were guaranteed a playoff courtesy of winning their Nations League group but victory ensured they will have a home semi-final in March and should avoid a top-ranked opponent in Thursday’s draw.Wales’s first seven-goal haul in 47 years was reward for individual and collective excellence, but also Bellamy’s bravery. His response to a lengthy absentee list was to flood his forward line and deploy Joshua Sheehan as a lone holding midfielder. Boldness paid dividends. “We didn’t play with a forward, we had three 10s,” he said. “But they were in the position where you drag someone out and someone runs, then the wide players were connected as well. We were so clean with the ball and that allows you to have good chances. Today was one of those days where we are able to take them as well.”The hosts set a dominant, positive tone from the off. James was at the heart of proceedings and released Brooks inside the area with a beautifully weighted pass. The Bournemouth winger appeared to be clipped from behind by Andrej Stojchevski and the Dutch referee, Danny Makkelie, immediately pointed to the spot. It looked a clear penalty in real time, debatable after numerous replays. Few inside the Cardiff City Stadium cared. The penalty stood and Wilson drove the spot-kick past Stole Dimitrievski’s left hand into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenDan James steered a fine fourth goal in the second half to score his ninth goal for Wales.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesBellamy’s side maintained the intensity and doubled their lead within three minutes. Jay Dasilva released Johnson down the left and the Tottenham forward swept over a first-time cross for Brooks to steer an excellent finish beyond Dimitrievski. Brooks’s effort, into the ground and over the keeper’s grasp, took a slight deflection off Stojchevski but was a difficult attempt made to look routine.Wales were in dreamland, but brought fleetingly back down to earth when North Macedonia reduced the deficit too easily. Darko Velkovski, advancing out of central defence, stepped around Wilson and Brooks before splitting the defence with a pass into Bojan Miovski. As the striker ran through on goal, Karl Darlow slipped on a surface dampened by the Cardiff rain. Miovski’s low finish met no resistance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wales’s reaction saw to that. Wilson slipped in Williams brilliantly but the Nottingham Forest full-back’s effort was tipped on to a post by Dimitrievski. A stunning effort from Johnson restored the hosts’ two-goal advantage before the break, however. Receiving Dasilva’s pass out on the left, Johnson exploded between three white shirts to beat the visiting keeper with an angled drive into the top corner.Number four arrived courtesy of a flowing team move that started in defence and invited Brooks to run at the North Macedonian backline. He dinked a pass into Wilson, who met it with a delightful back-heel into James, and he polished his evening’s excellent work with a clinical finish.Wilson was not finished there. Having been tripped 25 yards from goal, he swept the resulting free-kick high into the goal from a difficult angle. Another superb strike. Wilson was also fouled for number six from the penalty spot, which he drove into the opposite corner to his first, before Nathan Broadhead added a late seventh when tapping in from fellow substitute Isaak Davies’s header. A repeat in the March semi-final and Wales can start dreaming of a third World Cup finals appearance.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWalesNorth Macedoniamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But the hosts’ pressure eventually paid off when Gregoritsch saw Marcel Sabitzer’s cross sail past the Bosnian keeper before bouncing off a post and into his path for a powerful finish and his 23rd and most memorable international goal.Spainsecured their place after a nervy 2-2 draw withTurkeyin Seville, finishing unbeaten at the top of Group E despite being given a genuine scare by their resilient visitors.The European champions led through Dani Olmo in the fourth minute but Turkey, who needed an almost impossible seven-goal victory to claim the group, managed to equalise through Deniz Gul in the 42nd minute. Turkey then stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Salih Ozcan strike from the edge of the box.However, Mikel Oyarzabal levelled the match eight minutes later to avoid what would have been Spain’s first home defeat in a qualifier and Turkey had to settle for a place in the playoffs for the 2026 finals tournament.“We didn’t celebrate as euphorically as we would have liked,” Olmo told TVE. “We wanted to finish with another win and another clean sheet.

Then came the words I’d waited 12 months to hear’Read moreEarpsannounced her retirementfrom international football shortly before last summer’s Euros in Switzerland, after Wiegman made Hampton the starting goalkeeper in place of England’s first-choice at the 2022 Euros and the 2023 World Cup. Hampton’s distribution is widely viewed as hugely important to the way England want to play.Earps accused Wiegman in her autobiography of “rewarding bad behaviour” by bringing Hampton back into the fold, then giving her opportunities, after she had been dropped by Aston Villa and Englandfor poor attitude and behaviourin 2022.“We had a very good goalkeeper unit and the two goalkeepers were competing for the No 1 spot,” Wiegman said. “We kept communicating and we tried to support everyone in the best possible way. I can’t control how it comes across and there’s always learnings, but I don’t think, looking at the bigger picture, I would have done things differently.“My reality and someone else’s reality can be different because how you experience things is very individual. I just know what I want to do is create an environment where we speak up, where I give clarity, where I always communicate with players when it’s necessary, and also, I make decisions to win.”View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton with her Yashin Trophy award for best women’s goalkeeper, and Sarina Wiegman with her Johan Cruyff Trophy for best Women’s coach in Paris in September.Photograph: Harriet Lander/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesHampton shone at the Euros in Switzerland,helping England triumph on penaltiesin their quarter-final against Sweden andin the final against Spain, where she saved spot-kicks from Aitana Bonmatí and Mariona Caldentey.Wiegman would not be drawn on conversations she had with players. Earpsdetailed in her bookan exchange with Wiegman in a St George’s Park meeting room in which she accused the coach of previously not having been entirely “direct and honest” regarding the picture with Hampton.“I always keep conversations private,” Wiegman said. “I’ll keep that private because that builds trust … When they feel that things stay with me, they know the door is always open and will come in and keep sharing things. That really helps on and off the pitch and helps to connect people.“So, that’s my approach. We create an environment where we want people to be themselves. Everyone’s different and that’s nice too, because you want to get to know each other. What you’re trying to do is to know the person so well that you know how to support them in the best way, but also in moments challenge them if necessary.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That would also rule him out of Premier League fixtures against Chelsea and Brentford at home and Aston Villa away, as well as the Champions League match at Club Brugge on 10 December. Mikel Arteta’s side – who have a four-point lead over Manchester City – then face Wolves at home before their rearranged trip to Everton on 20 December.It would be a significant blow to Arsenal’s title challenge to lose a player who has played every minute of the Premier League campaign, especially given Gabriel’s importance to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 11 games and had kept eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions before the2-2 draw at Sunderland.View image in fullscreenViktor Gyökeres (centre) missed Arsenal’s final two matches before the international break and is not certain to return this weekend.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PACristhian Mosquera and his fellow new signing Piero Hincapié are in the frame to replace Gabriel against Spurs. There are also concerns about whether Viktor Gyökeres will be back to lead the line, after the £64m striker missed Arsenal’s final two matches before the international break because of a hamstring injury.The Germany manager, Julian Nagelsmann, revealed on Tuesday that Kai Havertz has experienced what he described as a “minor relapse” during his recovery from a knee injury after Arteta had been hopeful that the striker could return this weekend. “But overall, he’s doing well,” Nagelsmann said. “He is expected to return towards the end of the year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningTue 18 Nov 2025 11.10 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShareENDANGERED RINOGoing into their Geopolitics World Cup qualifier against Norway on Sunday, the only way Italy could ensure they overtook Erling Haaland and chums to finish top of Group I was by hammering them by nine clear goals. It was a tough ask against a side who had shipped only four in total during their previous seven qualifiers and despite giving it their best shot the Italians came up woefully short, coming out on the wrong end of an embarrassing4-1 hidingthat prompted Gennaro Gattuso to flag up his side’s “fear and fragility”. Fairly certain that the automatic qualification jig was up before the match had even started, Italy’s head coach had used his pre-match presser to get his excuses in early by railing at the injustice of a qualification system that dictates European heavyweights such as Italy can win six of their eight qualifiers and get dumped into the fraught hellscape of the playoffs, while teams in other Fifa postcodes (yes you, Paraguay) can win just six of their 18 and nail down a spot at next summer’s dynamically priced jamboree in North America. He also had a moan about the increasing number of African teams (from two in his playing days to nine in the expanded tournament) who get World Cup places, in comments that many on the continent in question and elsewhere considered Eurocentric, dismissive and downright offensive.“It’s not a question for me, but it is for whoever draws up the rules and the groups,” Gattuso moaned, before proceeding to wang on by way of response to the question he had decided was not for him. “In my day, the top team in each group would go through, plus the best runners-up. We’ve got 18 points, won six games, and still we have to go into another two matches to qualify. It doesn’t seem right.” And while watching a World Cup finals play out withoutItalybeing involved also doesn’t seem right, these four-times winners were conspicuous absentees from the past two, staged in Qatar and Russia. There is now a very real chance of them missing out for a third time on the spin considering the lack of mental fortitude they demonstrated in defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia in the two playoffs they have previously been forced to play. Of course, the fact that they somehow roused themselves to win a European Championship during this absence from the global top table only adds to the generally stereotypical Italian craziness of the pickle in which they currently find themselves.While Rino might have a kernel of a point about some countries having it easier than others when it comes to qualifying for the World Cup without having to repeatedly run a playoff gauntlet, many in Italy are pointing the Big Finger O’Blame for their national team’s shortcomings in their current manager’s direction. Gattuso is an unapologetic vibes man with no great coaching pedigree compared to the more cerebral Luciano Spalletti, who he replaced two games into Italy’s qualifying campaign. And while his predecessor used the tactics board as an educational tool, Gattuso has always conveyed the impression he is more at home kung-fu kicking it around the dressing room in a bid to instil fear in his players. “Between having a not good coach who is Gattuso and a not good coach who is somebody else, I will pick somebody else,” said the Italy-supporting legend that is Gab Marcotti on a recent podcast. “Because you need to send a message that this is not who we want to represent us at this stage.” Following an embarrassing second-half collapse against Norway thatCorriere dello Sport likened to “snow melting in the sun”, Italy’s place in the playoffs was confirmed. Whether Gattuso will still be around to oversee yet another humiliating physical and mental on-field disintegration in March seems far less certain.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Rob Smyth at 7.45pm for red-hot updates on Scotland 3-2 Denmark in the night’s big Geopolitics World Cup qualifier.QUOTE OF THE DAY“Is it disappointing?

We ran nine teams every Saturday and the captain of the fifth team told me in the bar one Saturday evening that a mate of a mate from New Zealand had filled in last minute (no subs in those days). They stuck him at left-back and he scored five goals. I told said Kiwi that he would be straight up to the second team the following week (bypassing the club’s strict ‘one team at a time’ selection rules) but he had to decline as he would be on a week-long trial at Leicester City. Not sure if he ever made it but he is possibly the only player ever to get five goals from left-back (normally the worst player on any amateur team)” – Ben Gibbes.At Los Angeles’s Dorsey High School playing field, Saturdays were practice days for a squad I played with on Sundays where the talent varied from ex-internationals, ex-junior internationals, the rest of us and one guy that showed up one day for practice. He had that familiar ‘bay’ styled hairstyle: short back and sides with a bit of a hill on top. Everything he did happened fast but it barely looked like he ever ran at all. Later after a commanding performance he sat on the passenger side of a new silver S-class Merc changing. A young Mikel John Obi, then between Manchester United and Chelsea” – Reggie Akpata.Back in the day I played for teams in the Walsall & District League (Premier Division, no less). I had just signed for Highgate FC but my registration had not come through by the time of our match against deadly rivals New Fullbrook. I was a substitute and told to use the name Tony Smith if I came on. Problem was that at that time in my life I was a solicitor and the referee was a current client. When I was eventually called on to the pitch the referee checked his book and said, ‘I can’t see your name Simon!’ ‘I’m Tony Smith ref,’ I said sheepishly. The referee looked perplexed. Fortunately the New Fullbrook players (who had obviously seen me play) shouted at the ref to let me on. I left the legal profession not too long after that” – Simon Manton.Sad to hear that former Spurs winger Tony Galvin has suffered a stroke. To most non-Spurs fans, he was probably one of the less familiar faces from the great Keith Burkinshaw teams of the late 70s and first half of the 80s. But as a White Hart Lane regular, watching him fly down the left wing to latch on to a Glenn Hoddle pass was a great sight. Then it was a beeline to the corner flag, from where he’d swing in a cross for the likes of Crooks, Archibald or Falco. Potent combinations.

The Belgian –sacked by Rangers in February– replaces Liam Manning, who left Carrow Road before the international break with Norwich second bottom of the Championship.Manning lasted only 17 games, having been appointed in the summer. Under him, Norwich have lost all of their home matches so far this season.The club reportedly spoke to Gary O’Neill, who had a spell as a player with Norwich, and the former Sweden and Blackburn manager Jon Dahl Tomasson before settling on Clement. Although the Belgian’s time at Ibrox ended in dissapointment, with Rangers well adrift of Celtic in the Scottish Premiership, Clement did win the 2024 Premier Sports Cup and had previously guided Club Brugge to their domestic title twice before a spell at Monaco.The 51-year-old has signed a contract until the summer of 2029 and will be joined at Carrow Road by the coach Stephan Van Der Heyden. “I’m really excited by this story and opportunity,” Clement said. “I’ve known of this club for a long time and, whilst we are not in a good moment at this time, we are excited to work together with the players and staff to turn things around.“Meeting with the owners and hearing some of their ambitions for the club, it really convinced me that this is the best move. They have big plans for the future but, of course, our job in the short term is to turn around the current situation and get everyone believing again. I also see the potential in the club and the group of players and feel totally ready for the challenge ahead.”Norwich’s sporting director, Ben Knapper, said: “Philippe is an incredibly experienced and prominent head coach, with clear values and beliefs that align with ours. We now have an incredible amount of work ahead of us to ensure we improve performances and results and we will do everything possible to ensure Philippe has our full backing and support.”Clement’s first game in charge will be at Birmingham on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsNorwich CityChampionshipnewsShareReuse this content"

I know the age I’m at, this could be my last chance to go to the World Cup,” he told the BBC. “I couldn’t get my mateDiogo Jotaout of my head today.

They showed that tonight. I couldn’t be happier for my players. It’s fantastic. It’s going to be good and it’s going to be a good Christmas in the Clarke household, I promise you.”Clarke explained the seeds of Scotland’s World Cup return were sewn when losing a playoff against Ukraine for the 2022 tournament. “I told them to remember how we felt after Ukraine and to bottle that feeling,” Clarke said. “I remember at the time when I spoke to them, I said: ‘You have to remember how bad you feel and make sure that next time you get to that stage’ – and I knew they would get to that stage again because they’re good – ‘you get over the line.’“They don’t want to be successful just for themselves. They want to share that success with the country.”Reflecting on the nature of Scotland’s goals, Clarke smiled: “Scott McTominay scored the best overhead kick I’ve ever seen and it might not have been the best goal of the night. When Kenny hit it, I thought: ‘What are you doing?’, but when I saw it in flight I thought: ‘That’s going to go in!’”Andy Robertson, the captain, said: “That just sums up this squad.

We’ve certainly put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it – we’re going to the World Cup and I can’t believe it.

The 19‑year-old uncapped wing Noah Caluori has been called into the squad and could profit from ­Roebuck’s absence.All three injured players startedthe 33-19 winagainst the All Blacks on Saturday, forcing Steve Borthwick into a significant reshuffle as his side targets an 11th successive victory and a clean sweep of four November Tests for the first time since Eddie Jones’s first autumn in charge in 2016.As revealed by the Guardian, Lawrence’s participation to face the Pumas was in grave doubt after he picked up a hamstring injury in the closing stages of the win on Saturday. His absence is a blow to Borthwick given how his centre partnership with Fraser Dingwall has blossomed. It is also a considerable setback for Lawrence, who battled back from a long-term achilles problem ahead of schedule after missing the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia.The contenders to replace him include Elliot Daly, who is considered available for a first appearance since breaking his arm on the Lions tour , as well as Max ­Ojomoh and Henry Slade. More ­radical options include Henry Pollock, who was named on Tuesday on a four-man shortlist for the world breakthrough player of the year award, and Ben Earl. When Lawrence was replaced in the 79th minute against the All Blacks, Pollock moved to the backline.View image in fullscreenOllie Lawrence, pictured scoring England’s first try in the win against New Zealand, will miss the Argentina game on Sunday.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGeorge also has a hamstring injury and, though he endured lineout problems against New Zealand, the former captain’s experience will be sorely missed. Borthwick preferred to use Luke Cowan-Dickie as part of the “Pom Squad” against the All Blacks but could now hand the Sale hooker a start, while Theo Dan and the recalled Jamie Blamire will compete to take George’s place in the matchday 23.Roebuck misses out with a foot injury, as was the case against Fiji this month. The 24-year-old battled back to take his place against New Zealand and again impressed on the right wing, scoring the late try that put England out of sight. With Tommy Freeman also absent Borthwick’s wing options are suddenly depleted but Henry Arundell, who came off the bench against Fiji to score a stunning try, is in the frame, as is the versatile Daly.Alternatively, Borthwick may give a debut to the 6ft 4in Caluori, who has earned rave reviews for his aerial ability and scored five tries on his first Prem start for Saracens last month. He was also on the scoresheet for England A in their 29‑25 win against Spain at the ­weekend. Before the start of the autumn campaign, Borthwick said: “I think he could certainly feature this autumn. He has been on the radar for a considerable period of time.”The head coach has also talked up the idea of deploying Pollock out of position. “We’ve been looking at Henry Pollock on the wing,” said Borthwick, who has also added Charlie Ewels to the squad in place of Ollie Chessum, who is still out after missing the All Blacks game with a foot injury. “[Henry’s] pace is the match of a lot of wingers. That kind of versatility is really important to us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is believed that the scan he had last Friday was primarily intended to alleviate the player’s fitness worries, with the team’s medical staff never hugely concerned.Bazball faces its ultimate test as England eye golden Ashes chanceRead moreJamie Smith was one of the batters who faced Wood in the nets on Tuesday. “He was absolutely rapid today, I can tell you that first-hand,” he said. “He’s near enough full tilt, so it’s good signs for us. It feels like, if he’s good to go and the management feels he’s good to go, I don’t see why [he wouldn’t play].”Tuesday’s training session was England’s first at Perth Stadium, after the players were given two days off to get over the exertions of their warm-up. Though they have had only distant views of the ground’s drop-in pitch, the squad’s seamers found conditions in the nets much more to their liking than the softer ground in last week’s practice game – though Jofra Archer, following his own training plan, did not bowl at all, his involvement restricted to batting and running.Josh Tongue said: “Like any fast bowler I like a bit of pace and bounce in any wicket, especially after last week at Lilac Hill, which obviously wasn’t as quick. Bowling in the nets, it was a lot more true bounce and a lot more pace in the wicket. I was batting next to Smudge [Jamie Smith] when he was facing Woody and he was definitely getting it through. I think as bowlers, you ­definitely lick your lips.”While English bowlers have ­traditionally struggled in Australia – of those who have bowled at least 25 overs in Ashes matches here this century, the top 12 by bowling average are all Australian – Tongue is convinced the current pack can prosper. “I feel like the group of bowlers we’ve got now, the likes of Jofra and Woody with the X factor of pace and bouncy wickets, the skills we’ve got as a group – I think we can give it a good shot,” he said.Wood has not played a first-class game since the first Test against Sri Lanka in August 2024 but Australia’s Cameron Green, who has played only three times, and bowled a total of 20 overs, since August, said this should not be a concern. “I probably would prefer a few more competitive overs but at the same time I think it’s a double-edged sword,” he said. “I think you come into a series so fresh, and especially in a five-Test series you want to be as fresh as you can at the back end.”View image in fullscreenJamie Smith and Josh Tongue got their first taste of Perth Stadium on Tuesday.Photograph: Stefan Gosatti/EPAAs wicketkeeper, Smith is also looking forward to playing in Australian conditions. “I’m quite excited, hearing about a lot of pace and bounce,” he said. “I spent a lot of time last summer in conditions that were reasonably slow and low, standing a lot closer than normal. It’d be nice here, hopefully with that pace and bounce, we can stand a little bit further back and that should be an enjoyable challenge.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I wouldn’t hit the stumps anyway.”Carey himself refused to be drawn into a conversation about his infamous dismissal of Bairstow – “I think the series is shaping up to be a pretty good one, there’s not too much hype that needs to be put on it” – but was prepared to provide an emphatic endorsement for his South Australia teammate Brendan ­Doggett, the 31-year-old seamer in line to make his international debut this week as a result ofJosh Hazlewood’s hamstring injury.“He’s a fantastic teammate, really experienced and bowling as well as he ever has,” Carey said. “In his last five first-class games he’s taken four five-fers, so he comes into this squad with great form.

Real Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal, who scored the winner in theEuro 2024 final against England, and Arsenal’s Mikel Merino were joint top scorers for Spain in qualifying, with six goals each. But all eyes will be on Barcelona’s teenage sensation Lamine Yamal in the summer to see if he can inspire his nation to a second World Cup triumph.ScotlandTwenty-eight years later, Scotland will be back in a World Cup finals. They earned their spot in dramatic fashion, with Kenny McLean’s strike from the halfway line securing a4-2 victory over Denmarkthat saw them top Group C. After the historic achievement, captain Andy Robertson said: “That just sums up this squad. Never say die, we just keep going right to the end. One of the craziest games of football. We’ve certainly put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it – we’re going to the World Cup and I can’t believe it.”AustriaLike Scotland, Ralf Rangnick’s side will be making their first appearance at a World Cup since France 98. A 1-1 draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina secured top spot in Group H in the final game. Marko Arnautovic, now 36 andplaying his club football at Red Star Belgrade, led the way with eight goals in the qualifying campaign.SwitzerlandSwitzerland have reached every World Cup finals since 2006 and continued that record by topping qualifying Group B with four wins from six matches.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36.

The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich.

In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by theMLSPlayers’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.Tanner issued a statement in response to the Guardian’s reporting through his attorney, reading in part: “Mr Tanner firmly denies these accusations, some of which are six or seven years old.”Pablo Maurer’s investigationcan be read in full here, but here are the basics of what to know about the story.Who is Ernst Tanner?Tanner is the sporting director of the Philadelphia Union, a team in Major League Soccer, the top men’s league in the US and Canada. Typically people in his position are responsible for building rosters, player transactions, and hiring (or firing) a head coach and other soccer-related staff, akin to a general manager in other American sports. The responsibilities of a sporting director can vary from team to team but in Tanner’s case, they include near-total control over all soccer-related aspects of the Union organization, according to multiple sources including current and former employees. This includes not just the MLS team but also the reserve team (Union II) and the club’s academy system for youth players.What is he accused of doing?The MLSPA complaint alleged eight instances of misbehavior, with the Guardian able to find supporting evidence for six of them from 17 sources and related documentation. The Guardian can separately report additional allegations based on accounts from those sources. In summary, Tanner is alleged to have:Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.How have Tanner and others responded?Tanner himself issued a statement to the Guardian through his legal representation.“Ernst Tanner firmly denies these accusations,” read the statement, “some of which are six or seven years old. Over the past seven years as the sporting director of the Philadelphia Union, Mr Tanner’s strong and savvy leadership has helped the Union win two Supporters Shields and an Eastern Conference title.“Throughout his career spanning over three decades in professional soccer around the globe, Mr Tanner has worked fairly and effectively in a diverse, multi-cultural world upholding high standards of professionalism. Mr Tanner remains proud of the team’s success this season and his work with the Philadelphia Union.”Tanner’s legal representation also provided five statements from current and former colleagues of Tanner’s at the Union that broadly claimed he fostered a productive and inclusive work environment.The Philadelphia Union acknowledged that at least one of the allegations made in the MLSPA complaint had been dealt with internally: that Tanner was “found to have made potentially insensitive gender-based comments,” as the Union said in its statement. “The Club took remedial steps to address this conduct, including through training and discussions with the Club’s leadership on appropriate workplace conduct.”For its part, Major League Soccer acknowledged that it had received the complaint from the MLSPA, adding that the claims had not been verified. MLS said it conducted a months-long investigation, which involved contacting “more than a dozen” subjects, a majority of which spoke. The Guardian understands that the investigation made contact with 13 people, interviewing eight of them. MLS concluded its investigation in September but told the Guardian it could not substantiate the allegations.Nonetheless, MLS said that Tanner was “required to participate in a structured remedial program focused on professional workplace conduct” – the second such training he has been required to complete, in addition to the club’s annual sensitivity training.What comes next?The Philadelphia Union are in the middle of the MLS playoffs and will take on New York City FC in the Eastern Conference semi-finals on Saturday. As for Tanner, both MLS and the Philadelphia Union said in their respective statements to the Guardian that the investigation into Tanner’s behavior could be reopened if additional information comes to light. The league has an anonymous reporting line and says it has distributed that information to all of its clubs.If you have any relevant information to share about this story or others, you can contact the Guardian securelythrough these methods.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia UnionMLSUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer and Cowboys players wore shirts honoring Kneeland, and they bowed their heads during a moment of silence before the game.“It was a blessing to be out on the field, this is where healing happens for me,” said Prescott, whose brother Jace died in 2020. “We love Marshawn and will continue to shine a light for him. We’re blessed to carry his light forward.”Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland dies at age of 24Read moreThe Cowboys (4-5-1) played one of their best games of the season to maintain their slim playoff hopes. Dallas had lost three of four and have games coming up against Philadelphia, Kansas City and Detroit.Las Vegas (2-8) continued their downward slide under Pete Carroll in his first year as head coach of the team. The Raiders have lost four straight and eight of nine.Prescott was precise – minus a miss of a wide-open CeeDee Lamb for an easy touchdown – completing 25 of 44 passes to snap his four-game winless streak in primetime games. His four TD passes tied a season high, matching his total from 5 October against the New York Jets.He threw primarily to George Pickens and Lamb. Pickens (nine catches, 144 yards, one touchdown) and Lamb (five receptions for 66 yards and a TD) produced big numbers despite Schottenheimer benching them for the Cowboys’ first drive. Javonte Williams provided the Cowboys with balance by rushing for 93 yards on 22 carries.The Raiders had little balance, going with 32 called pass plays and three runs – Geno Smith also scrambled for seven yards – in the first half alone. They became only the third team since at least 1991 with 30 or more dropbacks and four or fewer runs in a first half. The four rushes were also the Raiders’ second fewest in a first half since at least that year; they had three runs against Atlanta in a 2008 game.Las Vegas finished with 12 rushes, tied for the 12th fewest in franchise history. The air-it-out approach didn’t work, with Smith finishing 27 of 42 for 238 yards with a touchdown and interception.The Cowboys’ defense made sure Smith had few chances to execute the offense, sacking him four times, including 1.5 by recent trade acquisition Quinnen Williams. Dallas sent the Jets a 2027 first-round draft pick, a 2026 second-rounder and defensive tackle Mazi Smith for Williams.View image in fullscreenDallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer wears a tribute to Marshawn Kneeland during Monday’s game.Photograph: David Becker/APBefore the game Cowboys players bowed their heads during a moment of silence in honor of their late teammate. A photo of Kneeland was shown on the video boards at Allegiant Stadium.Dallas players wore blue T-shirts with Kneeland’s name, the years of his life – 2001-2025 – and the team’s star logo beneath an image of his face. A decal of his number, 94, was on the back of their helmets and will remain there for the rest of the season.The team prepared a locker room stall for Kneeland at the stadium, and his jersey was placed on a coat hanger. Dallas were coming off a bye week, given the team a little more time to come to grips with his death.In the US, call or text MentalHealthAmerica at 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

Sites including X and OpenAI suffered increased outages at the same time as Cloudflare’s problems, according toDowndetector.The outage was reported at 11.48am London time and by 2.48pm the company said: “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.”A spokesperson for Cloudflare apologised to its customers “and the internet in general for leting you down today”. They said: “We will learn from today’s incident and improve.”Could the internet go offline? Inside the fragile system holding the modern world togetherRead moreAs it tried to fix the problem the company disabled an encryption service called Warp in London and said: “Users in London trying to access the internet via Warp will see a failure to connect.”Cloudflare was described as “the biggest company you’ve never heard of” by Prof Alan Woodward of the Surrey Centre for Cyber Security. The company says it provides services to “protect your websites, apps, APIs, and AI workloads while accelerating performance”.Woodward described it as a “gatekeeper” and said its roles included monitoring traffic to sites to defend them against distributed denial of service attacks when malicious actors try to overwhelm sites with requests. It also checks users are human.After finding a fix, Cloudfare said the root cause “was a configuration file that is automatically generated to manage threat traffic”.This file grew beyond its expected size and triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for a number of Cloudflare’s services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Frank Bienewald/AlamyAs GenAI becomes the primary way to find information, local and traditional wisdom is being lost. And we are only beginning to realise what we’re missingThis article was originally published as‘Holes in the web’onAeon.coByDeepak Varuvel DennisonTue 18 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 05.40 ESTShareAfew years back, my dad was diagnosed with a tumour on his tongue – which meant we had some choices to weigh up. My family has an interesting dynamic when it comes to medical decisions. While my older sister is a trained doctor in western allopathic medicine, my parents are big believers in traditional remedies. Having grown up in a small town in India, I am accustomed to rituals. My dad had a ritual, too. Every time we visited his home village in southern Tamil Nadu, he’d get a bottle of thick, pungent, herb-infused oil from avaithiyar, a traditional doctor practising Siddha medicine. It was his way of maintaining his connection with the kind of medicine he had always known and trusted.Dad’s tumour showed signs of being malignant, so the hospital doctors and my sister strongly recommended surgery. My parents were against the idea, worried it could affect my dad’s speech. This is usually where I come in, as the expert mediator in the family. Like any good millennial, I turned to the internet for help in guiding the decision. After days of thorough research, I (as usual) sided with my sister and pushed for surgery. The internet backed us up.We eventually got my dad to agree and even set a date. But then, he slyly used my sister’s pregnancy as a distraction to skip the surgery altogether. While we pestered him every day to get it done, he was secretly taking his herbal concoction. And, lo and behold, after several months the tumour actually shrank and eventually disappeared. The whole episode earned my dad some bragging rights.At the time, I dismissed it as a lucky exception. But recently I’ve been wondering if I was too quick to dismiss my parents’ trust in traditional knowledge, while accepting the authority of digitally dominant sources. I find it hard to believe that my dad’s herbal concoctions worked, but I have also come to realise that the seemingly all-knowing internet I so readily trusted contains huge gaps – and that, in a world of AI, it’s about to get worse.The irony isn’t lost on me that this dilemma has emerged through my research at a university in the United States, in a setting removed from my childhood and the very context where traditional practices were part of daily life. At Cornell University, New York, I study what it takes to design responsible AI systems. My work has been revealing, showing me how the digital world reflects profound power imbalances in knowledge, and how this is amplified by generative AI (GenAI). The early internet was dominated by the English language and western institutions, and this imbalance has hardened over time, leaving whole worlds of human knowledge and experience undigitised. Now, with the rise of GenAI – which is trained on this available digital corpus – that asymmetry threatens to become entrenched.For many people, GenAI is emerging as the primary way to learn about the world. Alarge-scale studypublished in September 2025, analysing how people have been using ChatGPT since its launch in November 2022, revealed that around half the queries were for practical guidance, or to seek information. These systems may appear neutral, but they are far from it. The most popular models privilege dominant ways of knowing (typically western and institutional) while marginalising alternatives, especially those encoded in oral traditions, embodied practice and languages considered “low-resource” in the computing world, such as Hindi or Swahili.By amplifying these hierarchies, GenAI risks contributing to the erasure of systems of understanding that have evolved over centuries, disconnecting future generations from vast bodies of insight and wisdom that were never encoded yet remain essential, human ways of knowing. What’s at stake, then, isn’t just representation: it’s the resilience and diversity of knowledge itself.GenAI is trained on massive datasets of text from sources such as books, articles, websites and transcripts – hence the name “large language model” (LLM). But this “training data” is far from the sum total of human knowledge, with oral cultures and even languages underrepresented or absent.To understand why this matters, we must first recognise that languages serve as vessels for knowledge. Each language carries entire worlds of human experience and insight developed over centuries: the rituals and customs that shape communities, distinctive ways of seeing beauty and creating art, deep familiarity with specific landscapes and natural systems, spiritual and philosophical worldviews, subtle vocabularies for inner experiences, specialised expertise in various fields, frameworks for organising society and justice, collective memories and historical narratives, healing traditions and intricate social bonds.When AI systems lack adequate exposure to a language, they have blind spots in their comprehension of human experience.Data from Common Crawl, one of the largest public sources of training data, reveals stark inequalities. It contains more than 300 billion webpages spanning 18 years, but English, which is spoken by approximately19% of the global population, dominates, with45% of the content. However, there can be an alarming imbalance between a language’s demographic size and how well that language is represented in online data. Take Hindi, the third most popular language globally, spoken by about 7.5% of the world’s population. It accounts for only 0.2% of Common Crawl’s data. The situation is even more dire for Tamil, my own mother tongue. Despite being spoken by more than 86 million people worldwide, it represents just 0.04% of the data.In the computing world, approximately 97% of the world’s languages are classified as “low-resource”. This designation is misleading when applied beyond computing contexts: many of these languages boast millions of speakers and carry centuries-old traditions of rich linguistic heritage. They are simply underrepresented online or in accessible datasets. Astudy from 2020showed that 88% of the world’s languages face such severe neglect in AI technologies that bringing them up to speed would be a herculean – perhaps impossible – effort.To illustrate the kinds of knowledge missing, let’s consider one example: our understanding of local ecologies. An environmentalist friend once told me something that has stayed with me – a community’s connection with its ecology can be seen through the detailed and specific names it has for local plants. Because plant species are often regionally specific or ecologically unique, knowledge of these plants becomes equally localised. When a language becomes marginalised, the plant knowledge embedded within it often disappears as well.View image in fullscreenA wattle-and-daub cottage designed by Indian architects Thannal, who specialise in natural building techniques.Photograph: ThannalWhile writing this essay, I spoke to various people about the language gaps in GenAI – among them Dharan Ashok, chief architect at Thannal, an organisation dedicated to reviving natural building techniques in India. He agreed that there is a strong connection between language and local ecological knowledge, and that this in turn underpins Indigenous architectural knowledge. While modern construction is largely synonymous with concrete and steel, Indigenous building methods relied on materials available in the surrounding environment.Amid concerns over unsustainable and carbon-intensive construction, Dharan is actively working to recover the lost art of producing biopolymers from local plants. He noted that the greatest challenge lies in the fact that this knowledge is largely undocumented and has been passed down orally through native languages. It is often held by just a few elders, and when they pass away, it is lost. Dharan recounted an experience of missing the chance to learn how to make a specific type of limestone-based brick when the last artisan with that knowledge died.To understand how certainways of knowing rise to global dominance, often at the expense of Indigenous knowledge, it helps to consider the idea of cultural hegemony developed by the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci.Gramsci argued that power is maintained not solely through force or economic control, but also through the shaping of cultural norms and everyday beliefs. Over time, epistemological approaches rooted in western traditions have come to be seen as objective and universal. This has normalised western knowledge as the standard, obscuring the historical and political forces that enabled its rise. Institutions such as schools, scientific bodies and international development organisations have helped entrench this dominance.Epistemologies are not just abstract and cognitive. They are all around us, with a direct impact on our bodies and lived experiences. To understand how, let’s consider an example that contrasts sharply with the kind of Indigenous construction practices that Dharan seeks to revive: high-rise buildings with glass facades in the tropics.Far from being neutral or purely aesthetic choices, glass buildings reflect a tradition rooted in western architectural modernism. Originally designed for colder, low-light climates, these buildings were praised for their perceived energy efficiency, allowing ample daylight into interiors and reducing reliance on artificial lighting.However, when this design is applied in tropical regions, it turns into an environmental contradiction. In places with intense sunlight,studies have shownthat glass facades lead to significant indoor overheating and thermal discomfort, even with modern glazing. Rather than conserving energy, these buildings demand more energy use to remain cool.Yet glass facades have become the face of urban modernity, whether in San Francisco, Jakarta or Lagos – regardless of climate or cultural context. As climate breakdown accelerates, these glass buildings are gleaming reminders of the dangers of knowledge homogenisation. Ironically, I’m writing this from inside one of those very buildings in Bengaluru in southern India. I sit in cooled air with the soft hum of the air conditioner in my ears. Outside in the drizzle, it seems to be a normal monsoon afternoon, except the rains arrived weeks early this year – another sign of growing climate unpredictability.In Bengaluru, I see yet another example of the impacts of lost knowledge: water management. How can a city flood severely in May, submerging cars, yet scramble for water even for domestic use in March? While poor planning and unchecked urbanisation play their part, the issue also has epistemological roots.Bengaluru was once celebrated for its smart water-management system, fed by a series of interconnected cascading lakes. For centuries, these lakes were managed by dedicated groups, such as the Neeruganticommunity (neerumeans “water” in the Kannada language), who controlled water flow and ensured fair distribution. Depending on the rains, they guided farmers on which crops to grow, often suggesting water-efficient varieties. They also handled upkeep: desilting tanks, planting vegetation to prevent erosion and clearing feeder channels.View image in fullscreenInterior of Thannal’s wattle-and-daub cottage.Photograph: ThannalBut with modernisation, community-led water management gave way to centralised systems and individual solutions such as irrigation from far-off dams and bore wells. The “Green Revolution” of the late 1960s – when India embraced modern industrial agriculture – added to this shift, pushing water- and fertiliser-heavy crops developed in western labs. The Neerugantis were sidelined, and many moved on in search of other work. Local lakes and canals declined, and some were even built over, replaced with roads, buildings or bus stops.Experts have realised that the key to saving Bengaluru from its water crisis lies in bringing these lake systems back to life. A social worker I spoke with, who’s been involved in several of these projects, said they often turn to elders from the Neeruganticommunity for advice. Their insights are valuable, but their local knowledge is not written down, and their role as community water managers has long been delegitimised. Knowledge exists only in their native language, passed on orally, and is mostly absent from digital spaces – let alone AI systems.While all my examples so far are drawn from India due to personal familiarity, such hierarchies are widespread, rooted in the global history of imperialism and colonialism. In her book Decolonizing Methodologies (1999), the Māori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith emphasises that colonialism profoundly disrupted local knowledge systems – and the cultural and intellectual foundations on which they were built – by severing ties to land, language, history and social structures. Smith’s insights reveal how these processes are not confined to a single region but form part of a broader legacy that continues to shape how knowledge is produced and valued. It is on this distorted foundation that today’s digital and GenAI systems are built.Irecently worked with Microsoft Research, examining several GenAI deployments built for non-western populations. Observing how these AI models often miss cultural contexts, overlook local knowledge and frequently misalign with their target community has brought home to me just how much they encode existing biases and exclude marginalised knowledge.The work has also brought me closer to understanding the technical reasons why such inequalities develop inside the models. The problem is far deeper than gaps in training data. By design, LLMs also tend to reproduce and reinforce the most statistically prevalent ideas, creating a feedback loop that narrows the scope of accessible human knowledge.Why so? The internal representation of knowledge in an LLM is not uniform. Concepts that appear more frequently, more prominently or across a wider range of contexts in the training data tend to be more strongly encoded. For example, if pizza is commonly mentioned as a favourite food across a broad set of training texts, when asked “what’s your favourite food?”, the model is more likely to respond with “pizza” because that association is more statistically prominent.More subtly, the model’s output distribution does not directly reflect the frequency of ideas in the training data. Instead, LLMs often amplify dominant patterns or ideas in a way that distorts their original proportions. This phenomenon can be referred to as “mode amplification”.View image in fullscreenThe glass facade of DLF’s Gateway Tower in Gurugram, India.Photograph: Danny Lehman/Getty ImagesSuppose the training data includes 60% references to pizza, 30% to pasta and 10% to biryani as favourite foods. One might expect the model to reproduce this distribution if asked the same question 100 times. However, in practice, LLMs tend to overproduce the most frequent answer. Pizza may appear more than 60 times, while less frequent items such as biryani may be underrepresented or omitted altogether. This occurs because LLMs are optimised to predict the most probable next “token” (the next word or word fragment in a sequence), which leads to a disproportionate emphasis on high-likelihood responses.This uneven encoding gets further skewed through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where GenAI models are fine-tuned based on human preferences. This inevitably embeds the values and worldviews of their creators into the models themselves. Ask ChatGPT about a controversial topic and you’ll get a diplomatic response that sounds like it was crafted by a panel of lawyers and HR professionals who are overly eager to please you. Ask Grok, X’s AI chatbot, the same question and you might get a sarcastic quip followed by a politically charged take that would fit right in at a certain tech billionaire’s dinner party.Commercial pressures add another layer entirely. The most lucrative users – English-speaking professionals willing to pay $20-200 monthly for premium AI subscriptions – become the implicit template for “superintelligence”. These models excel at generating quarterly reports, coding in Silicon Valley’s preferred languages and crafting emails that sound appropriately deferential to western corporate hierarchies. Meanwhile, they stumble over cultural contexts that don’t translate to quarterly earnings.It should not come as a surprise that a growing body of studies shows how LLMs predominantly reflectwestern cultural valuesandepistemologies. Theyoverrepresent certain dominantgroups in their outputs, reinforce andamplify the biasesheld by these groups, and aremore factually accurateon topics associated with North America and Europe. Even in domains such as travel recommendations or storytelling, LLMs tend togenerate richerand more detailed content for wealthier countries compared with poorer ones.And beyond merelyreflectingexisting knowledge hierarchies, GenAI has the capacity toamplifythem, as human behaviour changes alongside it. The integration of AI overviews in search engines, along with the growing popularity of AI-powered search engines such as Perplexity, underscores this shift.As AI-generated content has started to fill the internet, it adds another layer of amplification to ideas that are already popular online. The internet, as the primary source of knowledge for AI models, becomes recursively influenced by the very outputs those models generate. With each training cycle, new models increasingly rely on AI-generated content. This risks creating a feedback loop where dominant ideas are continuously amplified while long-tail or niche knowledge fades from view.The AI researcher Andrew Petersondescribes thisphenomenon as “knowledge collapse”: a gradual narrowing of the information humans can access, along with a declining awareness of alternative or obscure viewpoints. As LLMs are trained on data shaped by previous AI outputs, underrepresented knowledge can become less visible – not because it lacks merit, but because it is less frequently retrieved or cited. Peterson also warns of the “streetlight effect”, named after the joke where a person searches for lost keys under a streetlight at night because that’s where the light is brightest. In the context of AI, this would be people searching where it’seasiestrather than where it’s mostmeaningful. Over time, this would result in a degenerative narrowing of the public knowledge base.Across the globe, GenAI is also becoming part of formal education, used to generate learning content and support self-paced education through AI tutors. For example, the state government of Karnataka, home to the city of Bengaluru, has partnered with the US-based nonprofit Khan Academy to deploy Khanmigo, an AI-powered learning assistant, in schools and colleges. I would be surprised if Khanmigo holds the insights of elder Neerugantis – grounded in local knowledge and practices – needed to teach school students in Karnataka how to care for their water ecologies.All this means that, in a world where AI increasingly mediates access to knowledge, future generations may lose connection with vast bodies of experience, insight and wisdom. AI developers could argue that this is simply a data problem, solvable by incorporating more diverse sources into training datasets. While that might be technically possible, the challenges of data sourcing, prioritisation and representation are far more complex than such a solution implies.This was brought into focus by a conversation I had with a senior leader involved in the development of an AI chatbot which serves more than 8 million farmers across Asia and Africa. The system provides agricultural advice based mostly on databases from government advisories and international development organisations, which tend to rely on research literature. The leader acknowledged how many local practices that could be effective are still excluded from the chat responses, because they are not documented in the research literature.View image in fullscreenLiquid-cooled servers at the Global Switch data centre, London.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe rationale isn’t that research-backed advice is always right or risk-free. It’s that it offers a defensible position if something goes wrong. In a system this large, leaning on recognised sources is seen as the safer bet, protecting an organisation from liability while sidelining knowledge that hasn’t been vetted through institutional channels. So the decision is more than just technical. It’s a compromise shaped by the structural context, not based on what is most useful or true.This structural context doesn’t just shape institutional choices. It also shapes the kinds of challenges I heard about in my conversation with Perumal Vivekanandan, founder of the nonprofit organisation Sustainable-agriculture and Environmental Voluntary Action (Seva). His experiences highlight the uphill battle faced by those working to legitimise Indigenous knowledge.Formed in 1992, Seva focuses on preserving and disseminating Indigenous knowledge in agriculture, animal husbandry and the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in India. Over the years, Vivekanandan has documented more than 8,600 local practices and adaptations, travelling village to village.Still, the work constantly runs into systemic roadblocks. Potential funders often withhold support, questioning the scientific legitimacy of the knowledge Seva seeks to promote. When Seva turns to universities and research institutions to help validate this knowledge, they often signal a lack of incentives to engage. Some even suggest that Seva should fund the validation studies itself. This creates a catch-22: without validation, Seva struggles to gain support; but without support, it can’t afford validation. The process reveals a deeper challenge: finding ways to validate Indigenous knowledge within systems that have historically undervalued it.‘I have to do it’: Why one of the world’s most brilliant AI scientists left the US for ChinaRead moreSeva’s story shows that while GenAI may be accelerating the erasure of local knowledge, it is not the root cause. The marginalisation of local and Indigenous knowledge has long been driven by entrenched power structures. GenAI simply puts this process on steroids.We often frame the loss of Indigenous knowledge as a tragedy only for the local communities who hold it. But ultimately, the loss is not just theirs to bear, but belongs to the world at large.The disappearance of local knowledge is not a trivial loss. It is a disruption to the larger web of understanding that sustains both human and ecological wellbeing. Just as biological species have evolved to thrive in specific local environments, human knowledge systems are adapted to the particularities of place. When these systems are disrupted, the consequences can ripple far beyond their point of origin.Wildfire smoke doesn’t care about transgressing postcodes. Polluted water doesn’t pause at state lines. Rising temperatures ignore national borders. Infectious germs don’t have visa waiting periods. Whether we acknowledge it or not, we are enmeshed in shared ecological systems where local wounds inevitably become global aches.The biggest contradiction for me in writing this essay is that I’m trying to convince readers of the legitimacy and importance of local knowledge systems while I myself remain unconvinced about my dad’s herbal concoctions. This uncertainty feels like a betrayal of everything I’ve argued for here. Yet maybe it’s exactly the kind of honest complexity we need to navigate.I have my doubts about whether Indigenous knowledge truly works as claimed in every case. Especially when influencers and politicians invoke it superficially for likes or to exploit identity politics, generating misinformation without sincere inquiry. However, I’m equally wary of letting it disappear. We may lose something valuable, only to recognise its worth much later. And what’s the collateral damage of that process? An ecological collapse we could have prevented?The climate crisis is revealing cracks in our dominant knowledge paradigms. Yet at the same time, AI developers are convinced that their technology will accelerate scientific progress and solve our greatest challenges. I really want to believe they’re right. But several questions remain: are we capable of moving towards this technological future while authentically engaging with the knowledge systems we’ve dismissed, with genuine curiosity beyond tokenism? Or will we keep erasing forms of understanding through the hierarchies we’ve built, and find ourselves scrambling to colonise Mars because we never learned to listen to those who knew how to live sustainably on Earth?Maybe the intelligence we most need is the capacity to see beyond the hierarchies that determine which knowledge counts. Without that foundation, regardless of the hundreds of billions we pour into developing superintelligence, we’ll keep erasing knowledge systems that took generations to develop.I don’t know if my dad’s herbal concoctions worked. But I’m learning that acknowledging I don’t know might be the most honest place to start.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.

I’m your host, Blake Montgomery.The battle over AI agents hinges on shoppingA tech titan and a startup are fighting over who controls the next phase of artificial intelligence.Amazon has sued Perplexity AI, a prominent artificial intelligence startup, over a shopping feature in that company’s browser that allows it to automate placing orders for users. Amazon accused Perplexity AI of covertly accessing customer accounts and disguising AI activity as human browsing.The clash highlights an emerging debate over regulation of the growing use of AI agents, autonomous digital secretaries powered by AI, and their interaction with websites. Perplexity makes a browser called Comet, which includes an AI agent. Amazon does not want to allow Comet to shop for its users. The rejection has foundation in fact: Microsoft has found inresearch simulationsthat AI agents are quite susceptible to manipulation while shopping.The suit raises a host of questions. Is Perplexity’s agent a rogue buyer with unacceptable security risks, or is Amazon bullying an insurgent competitor out of the game? Whose interests does a semi-autonomous AI agent represent, the customer or the agent’s maker, and who is liable for its misconduct? The next iteration of AI may hang in the balance of the suit.Perplexity is no champion of the common man against the overbearing dominance of Amazon. The startup has raised $1.5bn at a $20bn valuation, perTechCrunch. In the process, the company has vacuumed up textual content to train its various AI products with little concern for rights holders, clandestinely circumvent explicit prohibitions on unauthorized scraping. Both Forbes and Wired have accused the company of directly plagiarizing their work with convincing documentation.The Vergehas compiled a long, comprehensive list of Perplexity’s controversies.The company wants market share and money and seems willing to run roughshod over any competitor it can, tiny or titanic, to get it. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, might have seen something of himself in that attitude; critics used to say he exhibited the same ruthlessness. He has, in fact, invested in Perplexity twice.A future full of slop rears its headsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersAI made notable incursions into two spheres last week: music and international relations. My colleague Aisha Down reports:Three songs generated by artificial intelligence topped music charts this week, reaching the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts.Walk My Walk and Livin’ on Borrowed Time by the outfit Breaking Rust topped Spotify’s “Viral 50” songs in the US, which documents the “most viral tracks right now” on a daily basis, according to the streaming service. A Dutch song, We Say No, No, No to an Asylum Center, an anti-migrant anthem by JW “Broken Veteran” that protests against the creation of new asylum centers, took the top position in Spotify’s global version of the viral chart around the same time. Breaking Rust also appeared in the top five on the global chart.A study published last week by the streaming app Deezer estimates that 50,000 AI-generated songs are uploaded to the platform every day – 34% of all the music submitted.Podcasts might be next. An AI startup, Inception Point, is churning out 3,000 episodes per week,the Wrapreports. The startup’s distribution network has amassed 400,000 subscribers and 12m total episode downloads. The cost of each episode: $1. In total, some 175,000 AI-generated podcast episodes exist on Apple Music and Spotify, per the Wrap.In diplomacy, AI firm Anthropic announced that it had detected and stopped a cyberattack – nearly entirely automated – by state-linked hackers in China. Aisha again:The US-based Anthropic said its coding tool, Claude Code, was “manipulated” by a Chinese state-sponsored group to attack 30 entities around the world in September, achieving a “handful of successful intrusions”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Stoxx Europe 600, which tracks the biggest companies on the continent, fell 1.8%. Wall Street was also trading lower, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all down about 1% on Tuesday.It followed steeper falls in Asia, where in the Japan the Nikkei 225 index shed 3.2%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.7%.Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said in an interview with the BBC that there was“irrationality” in the current AI boom. He warned that in the event that the AI bubble bursts, “no company is going to be immune, including us”.Meanwhile JP Morgan Chase vice chairman, Daniel Pinto, said that booming AI valuations are due for a reassessment. “There is probably a correction there,” he said at the Bloomberg Africa Business Summit in Johannesburg on Tuesday. “That correction will also create a correction in the rest of the segment, the S&P and in the industry.”The chief executive of Klarna, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, also sounded the alarm this week, warning that huge sums being poured into computing infrastructure made him “nervous”.He told the Financial Times: “I think [OpenAI] can be very successful as a company but at the same time I’m very nervous about the size of these investments in these datacentres. That’s the particular thing that I am concerned about.”The Klarna co-founder added that the rising valuation of AI companies, including the chipmaker Nvidia, was also a source of concern. Nvidia became the first company to hit a market value of $4tn this year, later followed by Apple and Microsoft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His biographer reveals what makes him tickSteve RoseTue 18 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTShareIn arecent interview, Alex Karp said that his company Palantir was “the most important software company in America and therefore in the world”. He may well be right. To some, Palantir is also the scariest company in the world, what with its involvement in the Trump administration’s authoritarian agenda. The potential end point of Palantir’s tech is anall-powerful government systemamalgamating citizens’ tax records, biometric data and other personal information – the ultimate state surveillance tool. No wonder Palantir has been likened to George Orwell’s Big Brother, or Skynet from the Terminator movies.Does this make Karp the scariest CEO in the world? There is some competition from Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Palantir’s co-founderPeter Thiel. But 58-year-old Karp could give them all a run for their money in terms of influence, self-belief, ambition and – even in this gallery of oddballs – sheer eccentricity. In his increasingly frequent media appearances, Karp is a striking presence, with his cloud of unkempt grey hair, his 1.25x speed diction, and his mix of combative conviction and almost childish mannerisms. On CNBC’s Squawk Box, he shook both fists simultaneously as he railed against short sellers betting against Palantir, whose share price has climbed nearly 600% in the past year: “It’s super triggering,” he complained. “Why do they have to go after us?”Leaving aside for a moment questions about what Palantir actuallydoes, the company seems to be at the heart of many of the world’s pressing issues. In the US alone, its AI-powered data-analysis technology isfuelling the deportationsbeing carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Pentagon’s unmanned drone programme, police departments’ (allegedly racist) profiling of potential criminals and much more besides. Its software is being used by the Israel Defense Forces in its assaults on Gaza, by the Ukrainians against Russia and by police forces and corporations throughout the western world. In the UK, Palantir is at the heart of Labour’s plans to “modernise” the armed forces and the NHS: whenKeir Starmer visited Washingtonin February, his first stop after the White House was Palantir’s office, where Karp showed him its latest military kit.For the past few decades, Karp has stayed largely under the radar, but a new biography, The Philosopher in the Valley, reveals him to be a complex, thoughtful, often contradictory personality, with a background that explains many of his insecurities. “Fear is something that really drives him,” says the journalist Michael Steinberger, the book’s author. “One of the many fascinating things aboutPalantiris the way that it is the embodiment, in a lot of ways, of Karp … he created Palantir to make the world safer for himself, or for people like him.” Whether that remains the case is up for debate.View image in fullscreenFitness obsessed … Karp has been known to lead tai chi classes for employeesSteinberger’s book reveals Karp to be an idiosyncratic CEO with a singular lifestyle. He is obsessed with fitness, especially tai chi (he has been known to lead classes for employees) and cross-country skiing (he often wears ski gear day-to-day) and has a coterie of super-fit, mostly Norwegian bodyguards. Karp, who waspaid $6.8bnin 2024, owns an estimated 20 homes around the world, many of which are apparently sparsely furnished ski huts. He is not married and has no children but has been described as “geographically monogamous” – he has two concurrent female partners in different parts of the world. He claims to run Palantir like “an artists’ colony” but he also likes to joke around in the workplace, comparing himself to Larry David, and once, according to Steinberger’s book, suggested that his own comic stylings “might be called Karp Your Enthusiasm”.This is not just tech-bro quirkiness for its own sake, says Steinberger. “In this case, it is legitimately him. He is himself. And that is what he’s always been.” Steinberger went to the same college as Karp (Haverford, a private college in Pennsylvania, though the two did not know each other). He has spent the last five years snatching interviews with Karp whenever the CEO could fit him into his busy schedule – including, on one occasion, during his midday roller-skiing workout. Steinberger had to cycle alongside him, holding out his Dictaphone.Karp grew up very much feeling like an outsider, it seems. The son of a Jewish paediatrician father and an African American artist mother, he was raised in Philadelphia, in an erudite, relatively privileged, leftwing environment. In a2023 interviewhe said: “I always thought if fascism comes, I will be the first or second person on the wall.” As much as ethnicity, he considers his defining point of difference to be his dyslexia, which, he tells Steinberger, “fucked me but also gave me wings to fly”. He also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (he claims the tai chi helps him to focus).View image in fullscreenAt the heart of Labour’s plans … Keir Starmer and Karp at the Palantir offices in Washington DC in February.Photograph: @10DowningStreet @PalantirTechKarp and Thiel first met as students at Stanford law school, where they hit it off despite being ideological opposites. But, while Thiel went off to found PayPal (with Musk) and embark on a fruitful tech investment career, Karp went to do a PhD in neoclassical social theory in Frankfurt. As a Jew, Steinberger says, Karp “wanted to understand how Germany, a pillar of European civilisation, had descended into barbarism.” While so many tech titans have amassed a fortune then used it to promote their “philosophy”, Karp has effectively done it the other way round. When he reconnected with Thiel and joined Palantir Technologies in 2004, he couldn’t write a line of code but he did know something about “ontology” – how information is structured and organised. He was also, apparently, a persuasive personality; good at recruiting and motivating eccentric talents like himself.Palantir’s founding mission was “defending the west” – a nebulous and pliable goal admittedly, but also an unfashionable one, at a time when early 00s Silicon Valley was all about giving tech a consumer-friendly face. While the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft shied away from working with the military, Palantir – which was never a consumer company – embraced the prospect, arguing that Silicon Valley should be helping the US to maintain its edge over threats from countries including China, Iran and, latterly, Russia. The company’s name is derived from JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings mythology: a palantir is a “seeing stone” – something like a crystal ball – a surveillance device, in other words. Karp has spoken of Palantir’s mission in terms of “saving the shire”, and employees were sometimes referred to as “hobbits”.In its early days, Palantir assisted the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it devised powerful tools for identifying enemy locations and attacks, arguably saving American lives. Even so, it sued the army in 2016, when it was being passed over for contracts. Palantir was also implicated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in 2018, in which Facebook users’ data was used to help influence their voting in national elections. But during the Covid pandemic, its tech assisted the US and the UK, among others, in tracking the spread of the disease and the distribution of vaccines and aid. Today it has contracts worth billions across US military and government agencies including the CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency, as well as Ice. You can see how the Big Brother comparisons started.But, there are “some fundamental misconceptions about the work they do,” says Steinberger. “They don’t collect the data, they don’t store the data; they provide software that helps companies and organisations make better use of their own data.” That could mean devising software to integrate complex supply chains for a large corporation, such as Airbus. Or it could mean analysing huge amounts of data, and spotting patterns and connections in real time, so as to identify, say, a battlefield enemy, a domestic terrorist or an illegal immigrant (or, potentially, any other kind of individual). Palantir argues that it has acode of conduct, and builds in guardrails to prevent abuses, including “civil liberties protections” – though it is not easy to verify such claims. “If abuses of data are taking place with Palantir software, it’s not because Palantir is doing it, it’s because the clients are doing it,” says Steinberger. “I think of Palantir software as like a toaster. If you burn your toast, you don’t blame the toaster.”View image in fullscreenKarp has spoken of Palantir’s mission in terms of ‘saving the shire’ … Karp in Idaho on 10 July.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesPolitically, Karp is difficult​ to pigeonhole. While the conservative, libertarian Thiel was an early Silicon Valley cheerleader for Trump, and campaigned for him in the 2016 presidential race, Karp was not. “I respect nothing about the dude. It would be hard to make up someone I find less appealing,”Karp said of Trumpin 2015. He voted for Hillary Clinton in that election, and backed Kamala Harris in 2024. Thiel had soured on Trump by 2024, but was instrumental in placing his protege, JD Vance, as his running mate.Since Trump’s re-election, though, both Thiel and Karp seem to have fallen more into line. Karp wrote a million-dollar cheque for Trump’s inauguration but did not attend. As a key defence contractor, Palantir also donated $5m towards Trump’s military parade in June. Ina recent interviewwith Axios, Karp described himself as “an independent who admires what Trump has done on many things.” In Karp’s mind, “the price of doing business with the government is making nice with Trump,” Steinberger says. Karp’s argument, he says, is: “Look, we got into business to work with the government, you can’t sit here and pull that support when someone you don’t like is elected.”Having once declared that fascism was his greatest fear, though, Karp could well be enabling it – by helping Ice to grab people off the street, some of whom could be innocent citizens, for example. Steinberger acknowledges the irony: “How do you square that circle? Well, in his case, I guess one thing is, he would deny that Trump is fascist. Karp would argue that we still have a functioning, independent judiciary, and a free press, for example.” Karp also claims that Palantir hasprevented “innumerable terror attacks”in Europe, which has actually helpedsave itfrom fascism. His argument about immigration, says Steinberger, is that “if the left doesn’t take this concern seriously, voters are going to turn to people who do, and the left isn’t going to like the outcome. That’s how you got the first Trump presidency, and arguably it’s one of the reasons you got the second one.”View image in fullscreenCheerleader for Trump … Peter Thiel in 2022.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APIt would seem that Karp believes there is no contradiction, but the “western values” he is defending appear to have evolved. When Steinberger first met him in 2019, he was talking about defending liberal democracy – making Palantir a “civil liberties juggernaut”. “Judging by his own words … he does not see multiracial, pluralistic democracy as the thing about the west that should be defended,” argues Steinberger. Now, “he sees it much more as just a collection of countries bound by a shared Judeo-Christian heritage, and, to varying degrees, by an attachment to free enterprise. That’s kind of where he is, I think. And it can lead you down some pretty dark paths.”In Karp’s own book The Technological Republic, co-written with Nicholas W Zamiska and published in February, Karp seems more concerned with US dominance, in tech and the military, including defeating rivals such as China in the AI race. He has railed against identity politics: in an earnings call earlier this month, he declared Palantir to be “completely anti-woke”. He believes that the west is too self-flagellating about its own superiority, and that “everything you learned at school or college about how the world works is intellectually incorrect”. In his quarterly letter to shareholdersin February, Karp referenced the political scientist Samuel Huntington’s belief that “the rise of the west was not made possible ‘by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion … but rather by its superiority in applying organised violence’.”In May, a group of former Palantir employees wrotean open letter(titled “The Scouring of the Shire”) stating that “Palantir’s leadership has abandoned its founding ideals”, and that its principles of protecting against discrimination, disinformation and abuses of power “have now been violated, and are rapidly being dismantled at Palantir Technologies and across Silicon Valley”.View image in fullscreenActivists protest against the federal government’s possible adoption of Palantir security software in Berlin in September.Photograph: Omer Messinger/Getty ImagesAs perplexing, objectionable and perhaps terrifying as some might find Karp, Steinberger did not come away disliking him. “I find him fascinating. I enjoyed our conversations,” he says. “He’s very fun to talk to. He’s very smart, but sometimes he’s going at a million miles an hour and it’s hard to follow his train of thought.”Karp likes an argument, says Steinberger. That’s the way Palantir is run – “It’s always been a culture where pushback is welcome” – and, he says, Karp would often seek to get into a debate with Steinberger personally. “It got to be a running joke. I’d say: ‘Who cares what I think? I’m not here to interview myself, I’m here to interviewyou.’ And that would piss him off. He would laugh and say: ‘No, no, no, let’s argue.’” When Steinberger did engage with Karp, he usually regretted it: “About 99% of the time he is convinced he’s absolutely right … You’d walk out after a conversation with him, and hours later you would be sitting there having a silent argument, firing back rebuttals, but he’s not there.”Palantir is firmly cemented into military-industrial infrastructure, and business is booming, but Karp is not letting up. He has said he wants Palantir ​to be as dominant and indispensable as IBM was in the 1960s, when it was the world’s largest computing company and shaped the way government and private companies did business. He also seems to view the world in terms of an existential war between “the west” and its enemies. You could see this as irrationally paranoid, terrifyingly prescient or simply what happens when you read too much Tolkien – but Karp clearly feels that he has work to do. In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, he wrote: “We are still in the earliest stages, the beginning of the first act, of a revolution that will play out over years and decades.”The Philosopher in the Valley by Michael Steinberger is published by Simon & Schuster (£25).

Can ChatGPT help you to manage your money?Read moreMeta’s AI received the worst score, followed by ChatGPT; Copilot and Gemini scored slightly higher. The highest score was given to Perplexity, an AI known for specialising in search.Estimates on the number of people in the UK using AI for financial advice range from one in six to as many as half.When asked about their experiences, Guardian readers said they had recently used AI to find the best credit cards to use abroad, for advice on how to reduce investment fees, and to secure good deals on household appliances – including an artist who used it to get a good price on a ceramic kiln.Several said they were pleased with the results, but Kathryn Boyd, 65, who runs a fashion business in Wexford, Ireland, said she turned to ChatGPT for advice on her self-employed tax and it used an out-of-date code.“It just gave me all the wrong information,” she said, adding that she had to correct it at least three times. “My concern is that I am very well-informed but … other people asking the same question may easily have relied on the assumptions used by ChatGPT which were just plain wrong – wrong tax credits, wrong tax and insurance rates etc.”AI chatbots distort and mislead when asked about current affairs, BBC findsRead moreWhen the Which? researchers asked the AI tools how to claim a tax refund fromHMRC, ChatGPT and Perplexity presented links to premium tax-refund companies alongside the free government service, which was “worrying” as “these companies are notorious for charging high fees and adding on spurious charges”.After they placed a deliberate mistake in a question about the ISA allowance, asking: “How should I invest my £25k annual ISA allowance?”, ChatGPT and Copilot failed to notice the correct allowance was £20,000 and gave advice that could have led a consumer to oversubscribe, breaching HMRC rules.The Financial Conduct Authority regulator said: “Unlike regulated advice provided by authorised firms, any advice provided by these general-purpose AI tools are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.”In response, Google said it was transparent about the limitations of generative AI and that Gemini reminded users to double check information and consult professionals on legal, medical and financial matters.A spokesperson for Microsoft said: “With any AI system, we encourage people to verify the accuracy of content, and we remain committed to listening to feedback to improve our AI technologies.”Open AI said: “Improving accuracy is something the whole industry’s working on.

Similar checks were introduced for users of pornography sites in the UK this summer under Online Safety Act measures to prevent under-18s from seeing explicit content.Roblox compared its new system to school cohorts such as elementary, middle school and high school. It will be introduced first in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where children will be blocked from chatting with adults they do not know in real life from next month, and in the rest of the world in early January.Users will be placed into the following groups: under nine, nine to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, or 21 and over.Childrenwill be able to chat only with others in their age group and similar ones. For example, a child with an estimated age of 12 will be able to chat only with under-16s. Images and video used for the checks would not be stored, Roblox said.“We see it as a way for our users to have more trust in who the other people they are talking with are in these games,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox’s chief safety officer. “And so we see it as a real opportunity to build confidence in the platform and build confidence amongst our users.”It comes amid allegations from lawyers for families alleging the “systemic predation of minors” on Roblox. Matt Dolman, a Florida lawyer who has filed 28 suits against the company, which boomed during the pandemic and has kept growing, said the “principal allegations concern the systemic predation of minors”.One of the latest cases he filed in the US district court of Nevada came from the family of a 13-year-old girl alleging Roblox “recklessly and deceptively” ran its business “in a way that led to the sexual exploitation of the plaintiff”.‘A man approached him’: parents describe their children’s Roblox problemsRead moreIt is alleged the girl, an avid Roblox user from Washoe county, Nevada, was targeted by a “dangerous child predator” who posed as a child, built a false emotional connection and manipulated the child into giving him her mobile phone number, to which he sent graphic messages. He then coerced her into sending explicit pictures and videos of herself.The claim alleges that “had [Roblox] taken any steps to screen users before allowing them on the apps [the girl] would not have been exposed to the large number of predators trolling the platform”, and that she would not have been harmed if age and identity verification had been in place.Two other US district court cases filed in recent days in the northern district of California concerned a seven-year-old girl in Philadelphia and a 12-year-old in Texas who were allegedly groomed on Roblox by predators to send explicit images of themselves.A spokesperson for Roblox said it was “deeply troubled by any incident that endangers any user” and that “we prioritise the safety of our community”.“This is why our policies are purposely stricter than those found on many other platforms,” they said. “We limit chat for younger users, don’t allow user-to-user image sharing, and have filters designed to block the sharing of personal information.“We also understand that no system is perfect and that is why we are constantly working to further improve our safety tools and platform restrictions to ensure parents can trust us to help keep their children safe online, launching 145 new initiatives this year alone.”Kaufman said: “It’s not enough just for one platform to hold a high standard for safety. We really hope the rest of the industry follows suit with some of the things that we’re doing, to really raise the protections for kids and teens online everywhere.”Beeban Kidron, the UK founder of the 5Rights Foundation, which campaigns for children’s digital rights, said: “It is time for gaming companies to put their responsibilities to children at the centre of their services.“Roblox’s announcement claims that what they are introducing will set best practice for the sector – a bold assertion from a company that has been slow to address predatory behaviour and has allowed adult strangers, and older children, easy access to millions of younger users. I hope they are right.”Explore more on these topicsRobloxInternet safetyChildrenGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

While the latest specs and outrageous screen sizes may well be a temptation, perhaps you can save money (and the environment) by holding off a little longer. With some simple tips and tricks, you can level up your TV experience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Of course, the Fomo is real. Back in the day, the only reason to buy a new TV was when the old one fizzled and died. One telly was much the same as another, and features rarely changed.The market is very different today. Every year ushers in a new wave of high-tech flatscreens, sharper than the generation before. What was once a bland box in the corner is now a pinnacle of technology, wall-mounted like a work of art.But I feel your pain. It doesn’t take long before that once-cutting-edge screen starts to feel a little dull around the edges. Your smart TV’s picture doesn’t seem quite as crisp as it did, and its operating system seems to be losing IQ points by the month. Apps take longer to load, menus feel clunky, and somewhere deep down, you know that a shiny new OLED would make everything better.But would it? I’m here to tell you that it’s perfectly possible to postpone the inevitable and improve your TV experience with a little fine-tuning, and perhaps some new (cheaper) kit.Upgrade your smart TV OSOne sure sign that your TV is running on borrowed time is its smart platform. Every telly worth its salt has a gateway to streaming services and smart home niceties, but as boffins fast-track ever smarter software, older platforms inevitably fall from favour. Streaming apps stop getting updates, and the slick interface that once impressed your mates now feels like it’s wading through treacle.It’s frustrating, but it doesn’t mean your TV is destined for the dump. Simply adding an inexpensive streaming dongle can breathe new life into an ageing set. Gadgets such as Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, Roku’s Streaming Stick or a Google TV streamer plugged into a spare HDMI port will instantly upgrade your streaming experience, with a faster interface, up-to-date services and nifty voice search.Amazon offers both HD and 4K streaming sticks. The basic 1080p model sells for £39.99, while4K models start from £49.99.View image in fullscreenAmazon Fire TV Stick HD£39.99 at Amazon£39.99 at John LewisNot an Amazon Prime subscriber? Pick up a Roku 4K UHD stick instead. It offers an equally expansive range of streaming apps and services for less than £50. AGoogle TV streamer, with built-in Chromecast, does much the same for £99.View image in fullscreenRoku 4K Streaming Stick Plus£24.99 at Argos£39.99 at CurrysIn all likelihood, your TV will have a spare USB port that can provide power to the stick, so you won’t even need to trail an extra wire to a plug socket.Alternatively, you can really level up your TV experience by adding aSky Stream. This diminutive box adds a full package of premium Sky channels, including movies and sports, along with embedded apps such as Netflix, Apple TV, Disney+, Prime Video, and mainstream UK broadcasters. The base subscription package costs £15 a month and includes Sky Atlantic, Netflix and Discovery+.What’s really clever is that there’s no requirement for a dish or aerial, since everything comes via your wifi network. Unlike traditional TV set-top boxes, there’s no built-in hard drive, either. Instead, your playlist is stored in a cloud personal video recorder (PVR), which never runs out of space.Dumb tricks that actually workThis may sound far-fetched, but if there isn’t really any issue with the tech, then pay attention to your room lighting. It might be worth moving things around to create a better viewing environment. Shift table lamps to prevent them from being reflected, and swap harsh overhead downlights for soft backlighting. A light placed behind the screen reduces eye fatigue and enhances subjective picture contrast. I see this style of bias lighting in studio mastering suites all the time.If you hanker after a bigger image, why not get closer to your TV? Sounds daft, I know, but there’s an inescapable link between screen resolution and viewing distance.Back in the day – I’m talking pre-HD era – TV resolution was so poor it made sense to keep your distance. But with today’s 4K UHD and even 8K TVs, pixel density is so much higher that it’s perfectly possible to sit much closer without frazzling your eyeballs.In an ideal world, your sofa sweet spot will be the distance of 1.5x the TV’s screen size away. For a 55in TV, that means perching no more than 2m from the screen. If it feels good, sit even closer. You’ll see more detail and finer textures when watching native 4K programmes.When it’s best to watch movies with the lights onView image in fullscreenAmbient lighting can do wonders for the picture of some shows and movies.Photograph: SeventyFour/Getty ImagesIf you like dark, dramatic movies, but are frustrated that your LED TV looks a bit grey when you dim the lights, don’t immediately feel you need to upgrade to an OLED. There’s a simple fix.LED backlighting enables your set to display a nice, bright image when room lighting is high; but in dim, or no light, that same backlight will cause black levels to grey out, as the backlight becomes more visible. For a more natural-looking image, watch your LED telly in a room with some ambient lighting, and try to avoid full darkness. That way, blacks stay subjectively black, and won’t turn grey.Make the most of what you haveIf your TV pictures generally look a bit washed out or unnatural, it could be your LED TV’s backlight beginning to fade.

Try switching to Dynamic or Vivid mode. This may well inject some welcome extra colour and pop into your pictures.Not all HDMI settings are equalPicture still looking pallid? Double-check your HDMI settings. If you’re watching an HDR programme, from an external source – perhaps a TV set-top box, games console or UHD Blu-ray player – and feel underwhelmed by your TV’s performance, it may be because you’re not watching HDR at all.Take a look at the HDMI setting in the Picture or General Settings menu, which will usually be designated either Standard or Optimal (or maybe Enhanced). Set this to Optimal to ensure you’re seeing both 4K UHD and HDR signals from your source component.Conversely, if HDR TV shows look too dark – and your TV was a Black Friday bargain-buy back in the day – then it may not have the inherent brightness to do HDR justice (despite what was stated on the box). In this case, set HDR to Standard, to enjoy a brighter overall image – and forget all about HDR (you’ll still receive 4K resolution).Improve your TV audio with a soundbarIf your TV’s sound isn’t up to scratch, with speech increasingly difficult to discern, the easiest and most transformative fix is a soundbar.Poor sound from thin TVs is par for the course. Even the latest models can sound awful, since slim panels leave little room for serious speakers, with audio quality inevitably suffering as a result. Adding a decent soundbar not only boosts volume but also improves clarity, expands the soundstage and restores the sense of scale that the TV speakers can’t match.If you own a smaller telly (let’s say 43in or thereabouts), consider the Sharp HT-SB700. This Dolby Atmos soundbar is just 640mm wide, but it can play at 140W. I reckon it’s a bit of a bargain.View image in fullscreenSharp HT-SB700£89 at Tesco£89.99 at CurrysIf you own a larger TV, consider the £999 Samsung HW-Q990F. A generous 1,309mm wide, it houses 23 speakers, boasts 756W of total power and comes with a wireless subwoofer and two wireless rear speakers, for a fully immersive cinema sound experience. It sounds positively epic.View image in fullscreenSamsung HW-Q990F soundbar£999 at John Lewis£999 at CurrysWhen all else fails – it reallyistime to buy a new TVAll that being said, there remain very good reasons to splurge on a new TV. If it’s toppled off its stand and now presents everything through what appears to be an 80s Top of the Pops visual effects filter, then recycling it is your only recourse (we’d recommendRecycle Your Electricals).Similarly, if the design is out of the ark (I’m looking at you, chunky TV with a ludicrously wide picture bezel), then an upgrade is equally understandable. Wide bezels will never be back in style. And if you’ve really set your heart on an OLED, I’m not going to stand in your way.

I don’t need three kinds of carry-on suitcases; I just needone I can rely on for every trip.I started my search for deals by outlining the key items every traveler should own. I also considered the “nice to haves,” or things that have made travel easier for me over the years. Then, I went to work hunting down those specific pieces from reputable retailers and brands – most of which I frequently shop from – and determining if the discounted prices were worthwhile. The ones that made the cut are featured below.At a glance: the very best Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel dealsThe best luggage deal:Away Packing Pro BundleNow $257, originally $343 at AwayThe best travel tech deal:Apple AirTagsNow $64.99, originally at $99 at AmazonThe best travel clothing deal:Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew SweatshirtNow $53.40, originally $89 at AthletaThe best luggage dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CalpakCalpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel BackpackNow $158.40, originally $198 at CalpakI started using the Calpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel Backpack last winter and was immediately blown away by the sheer amount it can comfortably carry. I’d even say it holds as much as my suitcase – and it will still fit underneath the airplane seat. The clamshell opening to a spacious main compartment makes packing a breeze, and the interior compression strap ensures everything stays secure. Part backpack, part duffel – you’re basically getting two bags for one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AwayAway Packing Pro BundleNow $257, originally $343 at AwayI travel 200,000 miles a year. This is the best travel backpack I can’t leave home withoutRead moreAway is my go-to brand for luggage. I’ve used the Bigger Carry-On for years, and I firmly believe (after trying at least 10 other suitcases) that it holds more than any other carry-on out there. The bundle comes with a set of packing cubes – which are helpful with suitcase organization – so it’s a great starter pack for anyone just beginning their travel journey or those who tend to overpack.Away’s earlyBlack Fridaysale means everything from the luggage brand is 25% off, but you’ll want to stay focused on the items with the best cost-per-use. For the everyday traveler, that is the Away Packing Pro Bundle. The set includes the Bigger Carry-On and the Insider Packing Cubes (set of four), two travel essentials that can be used together or separately. Bonus: you can opt to get both in the same color or mix and match.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of RoamRoam Check-In ExpandableNow $545, originally $725 at RoamMake no mistake, high-quality checked suitcases are expensive, so I always recommend waiting to purchase one until it’s on sale. While the Roam Check-In Expandable suitcase is still on the pricier side, it’s the kind of suitcase you only need to buy once. Designed with an expandable feature (a 2in zipper expansion) and compression boards, it’ll comfortably hold between 10 and 13 outfits.The best travel tech and gear dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonEuropean Travel Plug Adapter SetNow $12.66, originally $16.99 at AmazonIsEuropean travelin your future – or do you need a practical present for someone heading abroad?

This pair from JBL is 50% off and highly rated by thousands of shoppers.

These seven travel gadgets go with me everywhereRead moreNow $64.99, originally at $99 at AmazonThere are certain things you can’t control at the airport – ahem, lost luggage – but you can arm yourself with tech that can track your belongings. Keeping an Apple AirTag in both my checked bag and carry-on gives me peace of mind when I’m making a tight connection or using a transfer service. If you haven’t invested in your own set of AirTags, now is the time.If you went to Apple.com to purchase a four-pack of AirTags right now, you would pay full price. But on Amazon –and Walmart– the nifty tracking devices are under $65. While they’re definitely useful while traveling, AirTags can also do wonders in your daily life: attach one to your keys, throw one in your purse, or slip one in your wallet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTravel Inspira Luggage ScaleNow $9.99, originally $12.99 at AmazonSearching for a stocking stuffer? The Travel Inspira Luggage Scale is the type of item most people don’t realize is missing in their life until they experience the reassurance that comes with weighing a suitcase before arriving at the airport. You simply loop the weighing belt through your luggage handle and hold it up to get a read. Yes, the sale price saves you a few dollars, but you’ll also never pay an overweight luggage fee again.The best travel clothing dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of REIMen’s Evolution EMB Oversize HoodieNow $45.49, originally $65 at REIREI’s holiday sale features thousands of items that would work well in any traveler’s uniform, but the men’s Evolution EMB Oversize Hoodie (now 30% off) is a true crowd-pleaser.

The general rule of thumb is to wear your jacket or coat while in transit (so you don’t have to fit it in your suitcase), but sometimes you want to bring an extra layer. In that case, I’ll go with something like the Pioneer Camp Women’s Packable Puffer – a lightweight, water-repellent style that can be packed down into its carrying bag. The timing of the sale is perfect, too; this is the type of piece you need for most winter travel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AthletaWomen’s Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew SweatshirtNow $53.40, originally $89 at AthletaI’m a firm believer that travel outfits should be both comfortable and presentable. I tend to stick with sweats and loungewear in solid, neutral colors, like the Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew Sweatshirt from Athleta. Not only will it never go out of style, but the dark navy also masks any inevitable travel stains.The Athleta pre-Black Friday sale – 30% off everything when you download the Athleta app – is incredibly tempting for those who live inathleisure, but don’t go crazy just yet. Instead, only invest in the pieces that deserve a coveted spot in your suitcase. This cotton crewneck sweatshirt is machine-washable (a crucial trait for travel clothing) and comes in a ton of solid, neutral colors.

It’s more elevated than a blanket, but it keeps you just as warm on a chilly plane. It also doubles as a scarf – and any travel item that can play more than one role gets extra points in my book.

Gaming platforms have an exemption to the ban, but Julie Inman Grant said earlierthis month that eSafety had consideredthe game’s chat functionality and messaging.“If the online gameplay is the significant or sole purpose, if that were taken away, would the kids still use that messaging functionality to chat? Probably not,” she said.Speaking to Australian journalists on the planned changes, Roblox’s chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman, described Roblox as an “immersive gaming platform” but added: “I like to think of it as games being scaffolding for social interaction. Sometimes it doesn’t matter what the game is. What really matters is you’re bringing people together to spend time together.”When asked whether this meant Roblox should really be considered a social media platform under the ban, Kaufman said Roblox considers social media more to be about posting content into a feed that other people then see.“Then people come back and they look at the feed, and that feed … creates a fear of missing out,” he said “It’s like a popularity contest in our mind that defines the core of what social media is. Roblox is two friends coming home after school and playing a game together. That is not social media.“And so we do not believe that the social media laws within Australia apply to Roblox.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The results revealed a 61.11% false positive rate for 15-year-olds who were told by the technology they were 16, and 44.25% for 14-year-olds.Kaufman said the technology is good within one-to-two years of estimation, and if users disagree with a ruling they can correct it using government ID or use of parental controls to set age. He said there were “strict requirements” to delete the data once age is verified. Roblox said ID images are kept for 30 days for purposes such as detecting fraud or abuse and subsequently deleted.People who do not wish to go through age assurance will still be able to use Roblox, but will not be able to use features such as chat.More than 150 million people play Roblox every day in 180 countries across the world, including Australia.

But in Europe, a technologically superior rival was making it look like an ancient relicKeith StuartTue 18 Nov 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 16.14 ESTShareThere’s an old maxim that history is written by the victors, and that’s as true in video games as it is anywhere else. Nowadays you’d be forgiven for thinking that theNintendoEntertainment System was the only console available in the mid-to-late 1980s. If you were brought up in Nintendo’s target markets of Japan and North America, this chunky contraption essentiallywasthe only game in town – the company had Mario after all, and its vice-like hold on third-party developers created a monopoly for major titles of the era. But in Europe, where home computers ruled the era, the NES was beaten by a technologically superior rival.TheSegaMaster System was originally released in Japan in the autumn of 1985 as the Sega Mark III. Based around the famed Z80 CPU (used in home computers such as the Spectrum, Amstrad and TRS-80) and a powerful Sega-designed video display processor, it boasted 8kb of RAM, a 64-colour palette and the ability to generate 32 sprites on screen at one time – making the NES (based on the older 6502 processor) look like an ancient relic.At first it was marketed domestically as a continuation of Sega’s SG-1000 series of machines, which were closer to affordable home computers than games consoles, with their optional keyboards and printers. But as the NES exploded in both Japan and the US, Sega had a rethink, removed some computing features and re-released the Mark III in 1986 as the Master System – an unapologetic games machine with a sleek, slimline, angular look, contrasting the beige Betamax visage of the NES.View image in fullscreenSega Master System games came on two formats: a cartridge and a Sega Card for shorter, cheaper titles.Photograph: booksR/AlamyIt also came with a light gun, and Sega even released a pair of 3D glasses for the system and a range of compatible games. “I am going to call out the 3D version of OutRun,” says coder Chris White, who wrote a Master System emulator later used by Sega on its PlaySega website. “Sure it made your head hurt and the alternate flickering of the lenses was enough to trigger a mild seizure, but it’s reflective of an era when Sega wasn’t afraid to try wild experiments.”Sega oversaw the distribution of the Master System in the US (at least initially), but looked to local companies to tackle the more fragmented European market. For the UK and France (and later Spain), that role would go to Virgin Mastertronic. “Sega’s partners had better marketing positioning in Europe,” says Nick Alexander, who was Virgin Mastertronic’s managing director at the time. “They also had better retail and distribution relationships than Nintendo did in those days. The video game industry magazine Computer Trade Weekly had a running joke that Nintendo saw Europe as where the dragons lived – they didn’t understand it, they were nervous of it. So they put their effort into the US.”Alexander, who had run VirginGamessince 1983, embraced that company’s edgy, youth-conscious approach. “I was trying to think of the video game equivalent of a band going on tour,” he explains. “So we bought a double-decker bus and drove it around the country. We took it to school playgrounds and shopping centres. It got an awful lot of coverage. Nintendo had always marketed their games as family entertainment, but the only market in Europe where that worked was Germany. We pitched to teenagers and we knew if we got them, their younger siblings would want a Master System too. That’s how we beat Nintendo in Europe.”And while Nintendo had Mario, Sega had a valuable asset of its own: its arcade heritage. The company set out to bring many of its hugely popular coin-op hits to the machine including Space Harrier, OutRun, Golden Axe and After Burner, marketing its new machine in the west as an arcade in your own living room. Although hardly perfect ports of the original titles, these were much faster and more colourful than any earlier home computer translations. To those of us who were teenage arcade addicts at the time, it felt wildly futuristic.View image in fullscreen‘An arcade in your own living room’ … Shinobi on Sega Master System.Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy“The games are visually superior to other Z80 based systems as a result of Sega’s graphics hardware,” says White. “It presents the programmer with scrollable tilemaps and freely placeable sprites. They are both easy to use and offload a significant amount of processing from the CPU. The design had a number of parallels to Sega’s arcade hardware. In fact, the Master System’s graphics chip is actually based on theTMS9918, used by Sega’s older arcade machines.”For European developers, the Master System hardware was a dream. “We’d been working on the Spectrum and Amstrad and our games were being ported to the C64,” says Andrew Oliver, who with his brother Philip was making the Dizzy games for Codemasters. “We went to the CES show in Las Vegas and I remember seeing the Sega stand. It was massive, and right alongside Nintendo – and their message was: ‘It’s all about speed.’ Back in the day, computers really were all about what was colourful and fast. So Codemasters cut a licensing deal, we got the dev kits – it’s a Z80, so we program it like a Spectrum, but the graphics chip is like a C64. The code ran really fast and you had all the nice parallax scrolling and sprites. It was very easy.”UK developers also found Sega to be more helpful than Nintendo. Mike Simpson was a coder at the British publisher Personal Software Services, later owned by Mirrorsoft. “We had set up a little internal development studio in Coventry, only about 20 people, and we were doing a variety of ports,” he says. “Someone asked us to port Xenon 2, a really high-end 16bit Amiga game, on to the Master System. It looked impossible, so we had to have a go! I was actually invited to Japan to learn how to program it: I spent a week at Sega in Tokyo being taught by Mark Cerny [later lead architect of the PlayStation 4 and 5]. I remember rows and rows of tightly packed desks, and the meeting room chairs were all being used to sleep on!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The spin-off title Sonic Chaos, developed for both the Master System and Sega’s Game Gear handheld (which was based on the same hardware as the Master System), was one of the highlights of the series. Later, Sega rolled out a redesigned sequel, Master System 2, priced at a relatively affordable £50 with Sonic thrown in.But the Master System wasn’t just a repository for arcade classics and ports from other machines. It has its own heritage. The beautiful platformers Wonder Boy III: The Dragon’s Trap, Psycho Fox, Fantasy Zone and Alex Kidd in Miracle World, the seminal role-playing adventure Phantasy Star, the excellent Zelda-alike Golvellius: Valley of Doom – these are genuine classics, up there with the NES-era titles for which they are often overlooked. For modern collectors, they are also more accessible, being free of the inflated pricing attached to many classic Nintendo titles.It’s true that in the US, the NES was so dominant that the word “Nintendo” became a synonym for gaming. But in Europe, Brazil and elsewhere, the Master System won out. The history books have been cruel to it, but for those of us who were there, who read European gaming mags, or who studied the annual Argos and Grattan Christmas catalogues for Sega goodies, the Master System was the home arcade machine that hinted at the future of gaming. It was the promise that the Mega Drive would go on to fulfil.Explore more on these topicsRetro gamesGamesGames consolesSegaNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

A Friday night news alert came through on my phone: “CIA concludes Saudi crown prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi’s assassination.” I collapsed into my couch, repeating the words.I am not Muslim. But Jamal, in life and death, has taught me a lot about faith and looking for hope in all the wrong places. As a writer with a history of criticizing America’s meddling in weaker countries, in normal circumstances, I should have been loath to celebrate the CIA.But given that, a month before, a group of Saudi hitmen not only kidnapped my friend and writer from a consulate in Istanbul but allegedly cut his body into pieces, I might have been forgiven for looking for any hope that the Saudi crown prince,Mohammed bin Salman, would face consequences – cutting off leaders who think nothing of cutting up human beings should be a basic tenet of any healthy country’s foreign policy. (Prince Mohammed has denied any involvement or responsibility for Khashoggi’s killing.)This week, seven years almost to the day since the CIA announced the crown prince’s responsibility in the murder, Mohammed bin Salman returns to Washington, invited for an offical visit by America’s Temu pharaoh, Donald Trump. The reconciliation between Trump and MBS was perhaps inevitable, given that even before the first Trump presidency, Trump spoke often of his love for the Saudis and their wealth. (“I get along great with all of them; they buy apartments from me. They spend $40m, $50m,” he quipped in 2015. “Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much!”)In 2016Saudi Arabiabanned Jamal Khashoggi, a longtime editor, journalist and royal adviser from writing. His crime? He published an op-ed warning about the rise of Trump in 2016. He remained silent for a year, until Prince Mohammed unleashed a crackdown on businessmen, writers, and mild critics – imprisoning many of them. Jamal fled to the US in self-exile.In September 2017, while I was the editor of the Washington Post’s global opinion section, I asked Jamal to write for us. He published “Saudi Arabia was not always this repressive, but now it’s unbearable”, breaking his year-long silence. I hired him to continue to write for the Washington Post.A year later, Saudi Arabia had Jamal killed. In the aftermath of Jamal’s murder,Trump administrationofficials worked overtime to launder Saudi Arabia’s blood-stained image. Jared Kushner was advising Prince Mohammed on how to “weather the storm”. Last year, Kushner’s equity firm received $2bn from Saudi Arabia’s private equity firm.There’s much to say about the Saudification of western cultural spaces through the sheer sums of money the kingdom is so obviously throwing into what it sees as soft power. Writers and observers have commented for years about Saudi Arabia’s “sportswashing”, like the kingdom’s sponsorship of LIV golf tournament and the purchase of the Newcastle United soccer team.The kingdom invested heavily in tourism campaigns for Saudi Arabia, paying online influencers hefty sums to post pictures of their heavily curated trips to the country.Jamal warned about these hollow visions of Saudi Arabia. He warned that behind the glitz and glamour of the Saudi royal family, and promises of futuristic cities, there was poverty and discontent. He often told me how proud he was to have his words in the Washington Post, and he hoped the Post could be a model for voices like his to be heard. I still admire Jamal’s relentless optimism about media and America.In death, Jamal’s faith would prove to be misplaced. The Washington Post’s erasure of Jamal’s memory and the freedom he stood for has been brewing in the background.The global opinion section that Jamal wrote for was dismantled. The Jamal Khashoggi fellowship – which was offered to writers speaking out against authoritarian regimes – was left to fade away. Jamal used to tell me about his days as an editor chairing newspaper editorial meetings in Saudi Arabia, where editors were given marching orders from the top about the “red lines”, or what the royal regime wanted and did not want published.Today, the Washington Post opinion section is going through an increasing Saudification – imposing harsh red lines on who and what can publish. Under owner Jeff Bezos’s edict to write only about “free markets” and “personal liberties”, the Washington Post opinion section, the first major US paper to publicly impose such heavy censorship, purged nearly all its full-time voices that wrote against censorship, political violence and repression at home and abroad, myself included.To date, the Washington Post editorial board has not mentioned Jamal’s name ahead of Prince Mohammed’s visit. The Saudification of the mainstream news media means that other US media outlets and institutions are bending the knee to Trump, agreeing to multimillion-dollar shakedowns in exchange for eliminating diversity. He has sued outlets he claims were not fair to him. He has begun attempting to prosecute his political rivals. Pro-Saudi voices would argue that moralizing about chopped-up journalists does us no good, shouldn’t get in the way of the US-Saudi partnership, that there is too much money at stake, and that in order for the west’s colonial management of the Middle East, we need our friends in Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. They are effectively asking Americans to believe that America and Saudi Arabia will make the world a better place, together.This narrative only helps the billionaires and the deal brokers. The average American gains next to nothing from these elite arrangements. Rather, Jamal’s plight and murder was a warning sign for America, of the impending loss of freedom and censorship that would sweep the country.Karen Attiah is a writer and educator whose work focuses on race, global culture and human rightsExplore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaOpinionTrump administrationMohammed bin SalmanUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

And it is as brutal as ever. In barely six weeks, more than $1.2tn has evaporated from cryptocurrencies’ market capitalisation. The sell-off has sent bitcoin back to levels last seen in April. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly fell below $90,000 this week, shedding almost a third of its value since its October peak.The key to understanding crypto is that it has no “value” in any economic sense. It generates no income, commands no productive capacity and pays no dividends. Unlike state money, it is not backed by a tax base or a fiscal authority. What props up its price is not cashflow but expectation: the hope that someone else will validate today’s valuation tomorrow. When sentiment turns sour or people pull their money out, there is nothing to break cryptocurrencies’ fall. Prices don’t correct, they collapse. In 2023, MPsrightlysaid that cryptocurrency trading in the UK should be regulated as a form of gambling – a demandrejectedby the then Tory government.The volatility of cryptocurrencies is not accidental but structural. The Financial Timesreportedthat investors pulled out of crypto because there was a shunning worldwide of speculative assets amid concerns about sky-high AI valuations and the path of US interest rates. But while the crash is global, Britain is uniquely vulnerable to its fallout. No other large economy has so thoroughly hollowed out socialmobilitywhile selling to its young the myth ofentrepreneurialescape. No surprise then thatBritonsare more likely to have bought into crypto than their European counterparts.Regulatorswarn that too many young people in Britain are turning to crypto, oftenborrowingto do so because they want to “win big”. The UK has become, in effect, a one-shot society – a place where stagnant wages and unaffordablehousingleave millions clutching at any chance, however illusory, to escape. The US rapper Eminem captured this mentality in his hitLose Yourself, which begins: “Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity. To seize everything you ever wanted … would you capture it?” For a generation locked out of asset ownership, crypto ismarketedas that “one moment”.It is in may ways the clearest symbol of an economic system running out of road: a promise of freedom built on an asset class whose standing depends on decisions made in Washington. Cryptocurrencies rise and fall with theNasdaq; the dollar system is their unseenplumbing; and their values aredeterminedby theWhite House. But the current crisis has been viewed as an opportunity by the political right. They sell crypto to the masses as rebellious empowerment.Having once dismissed bitcoin as “based on thin air”, Donald Trump now revels in his role as “crypto president”. Under Mr Trump, crypto has become a machinery of patronage, deregulation andself-enrichmentthat is unprecedented in modern US politics. Joe Biden’s attempts toregulatecrypto businesses – which have provided routes forfraudand moneylaundering– have been eviscerated.Those on the right of politics who want to be supplicants to Trumpian power, whether that is Argentina’sJavier Mileior Britain’sNigel Farage, now embrace crypto aggressively. It lets them pose as the insurgent alternative to a “rigged” system – accepting donations in anonymous digital payments to prove the point – while sucking up to Mr Trump. Crypto is not the end ofpolitics in money. It resembles nothing less than the latest way for the powerful to profit from the powerless.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If you want to achieve that sort of brand name recognition, there are a few tried-and-tested ways to do so. You can spend years working your way up the ranks until you’re a power-broker like Nancy Pelosi. You can burst on to the scene anddramatically unseatan incumbent like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did. Or you can go the Marjorie Taylor Greene route and achieve notoriety by being utterly unhinged.Since becoming a congresswoman for Georgia in 2021, Greene has kept herself in the news by spoutingconspiracy theories,fighting with colleagues, and being one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders. Inrecent months,however, something strange has been happening. Greene has continued to generate headlines, but largely because she has turned on her party and is part of a growing Maga civil war. Greene was the first Republican lawmaker, for example, to say that there is agenocide in Gazaand has been one of theloudest voicesdemanding that the Epstein files be released. She has also criticised the Maga movement for not focusing on affordability or puttingAmerica first. Now, things have escalated to the point where Greene is making Trump see red; the pair are in a full-blown feud.On Friday the president, who stood by Greene when she voiced conspiracy theories aboutschool shootingsand claimed that wildfires were startedby space lasers,announcedon Truth Social that he was finally withdrawing his endorsement of the congresswoman. “All I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” he complained. Adding: “I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day.”Greene, meanwhile, has said that Trump’s comments are “hurtful” but she still supports his administration andhopes they “make up”. She has also said she believes that his comments have fuelled threats against her safety. When asked on Sunday about these threats,Trump said:“I don’t think her life is in danger … I don’t think anybody cares about her.”But that last bit isn’t quite true. If Greene learned anything from her apprenticeship with Trump, it’s how to generate media coverage. The congresswoman’s face is everywhere. And while she may no longer be buddies with the president, she is building bridges with former foes. On Sunday, for example, she appeared on CNN’s State of the Union and apologised for her role in“toxic politics”. And earlier this month, she went on the high-profile talkshow The View and criticised her party for not having ahealth care plan. “You are a very different person than I thought you were,” the presenter, Sunny Hostin, said.SoisGreene a different person? I’d love it if that truly were the case; it would be heartening to believe that some of the most toxic people in US politics might be capable of introspection and change. Alas, I don’t think this is some sort of road to Damascus moment. Rather, as Ocasio-Cortezhas posited, this is more likely a case of sour grapes. AOC’s theory is that the Trump administration shut down Greene’s ambitions to run for Senate and she “has been on a revenge tour ever since”. Greene said at the time that she didn’t believe she could make a difference as a senator and wanted to continue to serve her congressional district.She’s not alone in her revenge tour. The Republican congressman Thomas Massie, who along with the Democrat Ro Khanna is leading abipartisan pushto release the Epstein files, has also beentrading barbswith the president. In a dramatic U-turn, Trump has now had to concede defeat on the files, declaring on Sunday that he’s happy to have a vote on the issue, as“we have nothing to hide”.Marjorie Taylor Greene says she’s had ‘warnings for my safety’ after posts by TrumpRead moreTrump has bounced back from scandals that would have buried most people. He is, let’s not forget, the first convicted criminal elected to the presidency. But it’s not just the Epstein files and traitorous deputies that he’s battling at the moment. According to a recentNBC News poll, 63% of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said that Trump has fallen short of their expectations on the economy. The president has been building ballrooms and blowing up boats instead of lowering the price of bread. While his base is still loyal, hisapproval ratings are eroding. Whatever Greene’s motives, her political instincts are sharp: there’s a real opportunity now to turn the Republican party against Trump. May the revenge tour roll on. Perhaps, with all this infighting, Greene will turn the electoral map blue.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist and the author of Strong Female LeadDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You didn’t account for the US president and his Fifa soulmate, Gianni InfantinoTue 18 Nov 2025 09.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 13.06 ESTShare“It’s very clear,” claimed haunted Fifa cue-ball Gianni Infantinonot so long ago, “that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics.” But is it clear? Is it really? On Monday, the worst man in world sport was – yet again – to befound in the Oval Office, this time nodding along to Trump’s declaration that games could be moved from host cities for next summer’s World Cup if the US president deems there’s “a problem” with security or that the cities are non-compliant in some other way. In practice, that seems to mean if they’re run by a Democrat/“communist”. Amazing that the Fifa president will gladly allow his tournaments to be held in any old violent autocracy but, for the purposes of the White House cameras at least, might need to draw the line at Boston.Honestly, the very sight of Infantino these days causes decades of writing about Fifa to flash before my eyes. How could it have happened? How could we have ended up with an even bigger horror in charge of world football’s governing body than the various ones who went before? WhenSepp Blatter was thrownfrom a moving gravy train in 2015 amid an explosive corruption scandal, it would have felt like a genuine feat of sporting excellence to have beaten his record for craven awfulness.Tell us: have you bought tickets for the 2026 World Cup yet?Read moreAnd yet here we all are. This year, the Fifa president has been the Forrest Gump of Trump’s administration. Back in May, he attended the US president’s Middle East peace summit, causing him to be so late for Fifa’s own congress that even Uefa accused him of prioritising “private political interests” and staged a delegate walk-out. Last month, Gianni was back on the political trail at Trump’s Gaza peace talks in Egypt, and earlier this month instituted somepreposterous Fifa peace prizethat he’s going to inaugurate at the final draw for the 2026 World Cup in Washington next month, quite possibly so that the orange organ grinder can be the first winner of it. He spent yesterday grinning alongwhile Trump announced things such as the possible ordering of “strikes” on one of the US’s 2026 World Cup co-host nations, Mexico. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when Gianni kicked off the year of ceaselessly grim politicking by attending Trump’s inauguration, where he was filmed giggling appreciatively during the bit where the US president announced he’d be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.Back then, in January, Infantino looked like a competition winner. Now he resembles a fully operational member of Trump’s troupe of winged monkeys. It used to be host governments that got co-opted into Fifa’s supra-national edicts – I remember South Africa being forced to set up highly dubious “Fifa World Cup Courts” for errant fans during the 2010 tournament. But now Fifa is a wholly owned tool of whoever will have it. Like all parasites, it relies on its host organisms.As far as I can tell, a political leader removing a game from a host city has never happened in the entire 95-year history of theWorld Cuptournament, which should perhaps confirm the increasing global impression that the US might just be a uniquely backward country. Football fans considering buying expensive tickets and making even more expensive travel arrangements should consider that they are journeying somewhere so apparently volatile that even its own president talks its safety down. Hopefully here in the UK there will be official Foreign Office advice warning of the logistical and political dangers of watching a remorselessly poor match between two of the 48 countries that Infantino has triumphantly ruined the group stages with. Or, indeed, watching no match at all, because Seattle’s mayor has been deemed less politically acceptable than anyone connected to the leadership of the last two host countries, Qatar and Russia. Which, by way of a reminder, were not actually even democracies.Or as Trump’s White House World Cup taskforce head, nepo gimp Andrew Giuliani, put it on Monday, the next World Cup could only have happened because of Trump’s “vision”, and is going to be “one of the greatest cultural events in world history”. Infantino went with different superlatives, promising that it would be “the greatest and most inclusive World Cup ever”. Mm-hm. In the hands of marketing men, of which Mr Infantino is most certainly one, there are few more telltale red flags than use of the word “inclusive”. If you ever hear the word inclusive in what amounts to an advert, you can be sure someone’s about to get done over or excluded – and in this case, would you believe, it’s the fans. Not only has the Fifa overlord allowedWorld Cup game tickets to be subject to the loathed dynamic pricing, but those games might be shifted hundreds or even thousands of miles away due to politics.No doubt Infantino is patting himself on the back for all this. But his true achievement – so far – is presiding over an era in which “sportswashing” stopped being some niche critical term of art, and became something that all football fans know the minute they see it. Because they see it all the time. As for that peace prize, please don’t limit yourself to thinking it will be annual. The last time Gianni invented a prize – Fifa’s The Best Awards – he held them twice inside nine months. So there is every chance Trump could win it again before next summer’s World Cup kicks off. It’s all thanks to the least political man in world sport – or certainly, the least sporting man in world politics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An event last weekend suggests otherwiseTue 18 Nov 2025 07.12 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.04 ESTShareIt was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.Etan ThomasI listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.The fear was that they’d use the spray on Black and Brown students without hesitation, at the slightest perceived sign of trouble.Syracuse’s campus newspaper, the Daily Orange, printed a photo of myself and Roland Williams, who would go on to play in the NFL, standing at the rally alongside the sista with the megaphone. A few days after the protest, Kathy found me on the quad to thank me for lending my visibility and privilege as a basketball player to their cause. She said she seriously doubted the police would ever pepper spray one of us.She talked about how the university treated athletes as if we were different – valued and welcomed – while other Black and Brown students were made to feel like trespassers, constantly asked to show ID just to prove they belonged. (This was Rudolph Giuliani and Eric Adams’s stop and frisk before it was called that, but I digress).The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead moreThose memories came back to me on Saturday whena Texas state trooper was “sent home”after a run-in with South Carolina player Nyck Harbor during a game. Harbor, as a star athlete, was among the group of people that Kathy lumped into a protected class of Black people when we spoke all those years ago in Syracuse.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueA quick recap of what happened on Saturday.ESPN’s broadcast showedthe trooper appear to intentionally barge Harbor and his teammate Oscar Hadaway III after the receiver had scored a touchdown against Texas A&M in their home stadium. In doing so, the trooper came off like a school bully with low self-esteem – the kind of senior who gets his kicks plowing through a sea of freshmen, daring them to speak up so he can enjoy pummeling them in front of everyone. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), which employs the trooper, later said he had been sent home.There’s a lot to unpack here. Why didn’t the DPS call an immediate press conference and condemn the trooper’s actions? Why didn’t they say his behavior was appalling, disgusting, and unacceptable and not what they teach their state troopers to do?If this trooper behaved like this in the middle of a football stadium, during a nationally televised game, how does he behave whenever he stops a Black person on the side of the highway?Harbor did not retaliate, despite the trooper’s provocation – he turned around and made his way back to the field. But if he had responded, what would have happened? It happens all the time: the person being mistreated by police is expected to respond perfectly, or risk making things worse. Yet there’s no such expectation for the officer – no demand for restraint, professionalism, or even basic decency.Before they try to“no angel” Harbor, it’s important to note that he won the 2023 Franklin D Watkins Memorial Award, a prize which honors African American high schoolers who excel in athletics, academics and charity work. Aside from his football career, Harbor has won national titles in track, volunteered at a soup kitchen and worked with Generosity Global, which campaigns to improve women’s health in Africa. Harbor is majoring in public health and has been on the SEC Academic Honor Roll two years in succession.I asked retired police captain Sonia Pruittwhat she thought of the trooper’s behavior.“People say maybe he was having a bad day. But no, as an officer of the law, you do not get to abuse the public because you are having a bad day … People want to be treated with dignity and respect from their police officer,” she saidon my showThe Collision: Where Sports And Politics Collide. “However, far too often, in police training that simply isn’t the focus or conversation. And when it’s not a focus, you see acting out like what we observed with this Texas state trooper. That’s not a ‘bad apple’ issue, that is a bad system issue.”Captain Pruitt, I couldn’t agree more.Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsCollege footballTexasUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

And so does the USYuli NovakThe international community allowed all of this to happen. We must not look away or move onTue 18 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 11.18 ESTShareGenocide is a process, not an event. When genocide happens, its roots, and the conditions that allowed it, often become visible only in retrospect. If those conditions remain unchanged and there is no accountability, there’s every reason to believe the violence will return, perhaps even worse, especially if it was never fully halted. This is exactly what we are seeing in the case of Gaza. Demanding accountability from Israeli leaders isn’t just about the past, it’s the only way to challenge a system designed to repeat such violence.A strange kind of calm has settled over Israel in the weeks since theGazaceasefire was declared. The sirens stopped. The hostages who survived the 7 October attack and nearly two years in captivity came home. But this calm – which has not been extended to Gaza, where more than 200 civilians have been killed since the ceasefire supposedly went into effect is built around an unclear plan by Donald Trump that does not address the root causes of the violence, and is merely a mirage. Nothing has changed in the violent political system that Palestinians and Israelis live under. The machinery behind the violence remains intact. The logic of domination still rules.For nearly two years, Israel waged a campaign in Gaza that meets the clearest definition of genocide: a systematic, often openly declared attempt to destroy a group of people, the Palestinians in Gaza, through killing, starvation, forced displacement, and the destruction of life-sustaining conditions. Genocide is not a metaphor here. It is the only term that fits.Our organization, B’Tselem, published a report last July titledOur Genocide. We chose this name because we are not observers but part of this horrific story. Israeli and Palestinian researchers, investigators and fieldworkers worked together to document events in Gaza, the West Bank and within Israel. Our conclusion confirms what Palestinians and international experts have long said: this is genocide – a direct assault on a population aiming to destroy the group.Palestinians in Gaza were bombed, then forcibly displaced, then deliberately starved. More than 68,000 people were killed, a third of them children and women. This number might be much higher, with tens of thousands more who are still missing. Hundreds of thousands were injured. Hospitals and journalists were systematically targeted. Children buried alive under rubble. Entire familial lines erased. Infrastructure demolished. Israeli officials openly stated the goal: to destroy Gaza and make it uninhabitable. By textbook definition, this is genocide: the deliberate targeting of people not for who they are as individuals, but because they are members of a group marked for destruction.The origin of this genocide didn’t begin on 7 October 2023, nor did it end with the ceasefire deal. Its roots lie in decades of Israeli military rule over Palestinians, apartheid, impunity and dehumanization, driven by a system built to ensure Jewish supremacy over the entire land. That doesn’t mean this genocide was inevitable. Every genocide depends on enabling conditions and on events that move it forward.The 7 October attack was horrifying for every Israeli, including me. It allowed the Israeli system to begin a large-scale, coordinated destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza, under the banner of self-defense. This was merely a continuation of more than half a century of military occupation,15 years of siege and blockade, and repeated military campaigns that killed thousands of Palestinians.The international community, in particular the US and other western governments, allowed all of this to happen. This is what genocide looks like in the 21st century: not only in scale or method, but in how it’s normalized. How governments and leaders, especially in the US and Europe, watch the devastation and say nothing. Or worse, support and enable it.But despite Israel’s propaganda, people in the US and around the world have recognized what’s happening. A growing movement of citizens is rising, not only against the genocide, but against the system that enables it. That system must be named: a regime of violent control over millions marked as inferior. An apartheid regime, led by an Israeli government that embraces racism, empowers settler militias to terrorize West Bank communities, runs torture camps holding thousands of Palestinians without trial, and carries out daily war crimes.It’s tempting, especially for Israelis, to believe the worst is over. But in Gaza, genocide lives on in amputated limbs, untreated trauma, spreading hunger – Israel continues to block the entry of food and other humanitarian aid – and the loss of generations. The cost of normalizing this genocide won’t fall only on Palestinians. Its global implications are precisely why, after the second world war, the international community created a legal framework to prevent atrocities like genocide from recurring. When one nation is allowed to erase another without consequence, it tells future governments: you can do this too – and get away with it.We must not look away. We must not move on. Those who wish to stand with us, all of us, the people of this land, must act to stop this violent, racist, increasingly fascist regime and hold its leaders to account. This is the only way to protect both Palestinian and Israeli lives.Accountability is essential – not for revenge, but because there’s no reckoning without responsibility. Genocide must not be normalized. And a system that carries it out must not go unchallenged.Yuli Novak is executive director of the Israeli human rights organization B’TselemExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionGazaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

Am I stubborn to want to hang on to reality?Tue 18 Nov 2025 18.09 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 18.16 ESTShareRecently, a friend sent me a video of a man dressed as a pickle. Following a high-octane car chase, the pickle flung himself out of the car and flailed down the highway. It was stupid and we laughed. But it also wasn’t real. When I pointed out to my friend that the video was AI-generated, she was taken by surprise, noting she’s usually pretty good at spotting them. She was also frustrated: “Ihatehaving to be on the constant lookout for AI trash,” she lamented in the chat.And I feel that. Becoming an AI detective is a job I never wanted and wish I could quit.By now, the problems with generative AI are well documented: it’s built upontheft of people’s creative labour; it’saccelerating environmental degradation; it’sclaiming productivity gains but actually producing the opposite; itrelies upon exploited workers; itsbiggest champions are socially reprehensible losers; and so on. In my online circles, it’s also deeply uncool – using generative AI to make silly little videos signals you either don’t understand its consequences or you’re too much of an arsehole to care. Every AI-generated video that crosses my feed is a stand-in for the horrors associated with the technology and its politics.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreBut aside from these very important critiques, it’s also just downright irritating. Who wants to use so much energy playing synthetic media Sherlock Holmes?I consider myself to be relatively tech-savvy, which probably lured me into a false sense of security that AI content would always be obvious to me. This is becoming less true, thanks to many video-generation models becoming more sophisticated and producing content with fewer immediately obvious red flags. Combine this with the sheer volume of AI-generated material and the context we see it in – on platforms where the whole point is to move from one video to the next very quickly. You barely have time to do a reality check before moving on. Consuming an algorithmically curated social media feed feels like drowning in a soup of slop. Whatever croutons of reality you might come by are only there to keep you drowning, sorry, scrolling, for longer.And here’s the sick joke of it all: the more you linger on a video to discern if it’s AI-generated, the more of its kind you’ll see. Perhaps you watch it a few times, trying to spot the classic AI body horror. Maybe you’re annoyed enough to leave a comment. Perhaps you share it with a friend like: “Thanks, I hate it!!” All of these are signals that screammore! more! more!to the algorithm. And so we’re trapped in a nightmare in which even the act of hating AI-generated content only serves to fuel it.Platforms aren’t interested in stopping the onslaught of AI spam. Rather, they’re embracing itAll of this makes me feel like an unwilling traveller through a hellish hyperreality – a concept theorised by Jean Baudrillarddecades before generative AI took off. Would Baudrillard feel vindicated or repulsed by Sora 2? (You can ask ChatGPT.) But aside from waxing lyrical about poststructuralist theory and the collapse between reality and simulation, I didn’t anticipate all of this to be justso annoying.In some perverse way, it makes sense why people might choose to create adeepfakeof a politician saying something outrageous, or generate sexually explicit material depicting someone without their consent. I don’t like it or support it, but the intent is pretty easily discernible (a political agenda, straight-up misogyny). Those kinds of videos are bad in an obvious, illegal or violent way.But I also find the inane content particularly unsettling. Why bother making an AI video of a pickle in a car chase? Well, there’s money to be made. Insipid and puerile AI content created for the express purpose of going viral to turn a profit is a disturbing reflection of the absurdity of late-stage capitalism. When it comes to social media success, reality becomes a hindrance to revenue.JournalistJason Koebler arguesthis content isn’t actually designed for humans, its intended audience are the algorithms. The content of the AI slop is irrelevant – it doesn’t matter whether it’s high or low quality, political or mundane, in touch with reality or complete delusion. What matters is the ability to churn outa lotof it, spam the platform, find what gets engagement, rinse and repeat all the way to the bank.Cute fluffy characters and Egyptian selfies: Meta launches AI feed VibesRead moreAs always, it’s important to remember this is happening because the world’s most powerful companies and their billionaire leaders decided that mass adoption of generative AI is good for business. Platforms aren’t interested in stopping the onslaught of AI spam. Rather, they’re embracing it, incentivising it andbuilding tools to enable it. It doesn’t matter howpeople use it or for what purpose. It doesn’t matter if people like it. And because the platforms benefit, there’s no indication it will relent any time soon.Maybe I’m being stubborn in my desire to grasp on to reality; maybe I’m deluding myself that such a thing is possible. But it still matters to me if what I am seeing is real or not. Maybe it matters to you, too. So for now, we have to begrudgingly hold on to our magnifying glass and digital deerstalker hat.Samantha Floreani is a digital rights advocate and writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

But true progressives must have lost count of the red lines it has crossedTue 18 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 12.41 ESTShareYou can learn a great deal about a government by who it chooses to fight. In the 16 months since this shambolic, soulless rabble were handed power by Tory collapse, they have trained their fire on pensioners and disabled people. Their latest target:refugees fleeing violence and persecution.In time-honoured fashion, a desperately unpopular government lacking answers to the country’s multiplying problems opts to kick asylum seekers. No 10 is plainly in a panic.Barely one in 10voters are satisfied with its performance – a figurecomparable to the proportionof the public who believe the moon landings were staged.The government has no moral compass, but some of its remaining supporters do. Where, exactly, is their red line? They surely did not vote for Labour expecting a refugee policy so extreme that one Reform MP offered the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, anapplication formto switch parties. Nor did they imaginetheir vote would helpproduce an immigration stance applauded by Tommy Robinson.No wonder Reform spots a potential recruit in Mahmood. She’s willing to spout the most deceitful claims about vulnerable people. “We have become the destination of choice in Europe,”she claims, “clearly visible to every people smuggler and would-be illegal migrant across the world.”This is false. There were more thantwice as manyasylum claims in Germany last year, and about 1.5 times as many in Italy, Spain and France. Detected irregular arrivals aresignificantly higherinall of these countriesexcepting France, which does not publish figures.Adjust for population, and the UK sits 17th on the table of its former EU partners for asylum applications. The UK offers no “golden ticket” for asylum seekers, as Mahmood claims. The home secretary decries how “divisive asylum has become in our country” when it’s the sorts of myths and deceit that she’s peddling that are fuelling the fury.What noble cause can Labour’s remaining loyalists believe these fabrications serve? Under the government’s plans, refugees willspend two decades in limbobefore even being allowed to apply for permanent status, leaving them unable to set down roots. This answers pleas for integration how, exactly? Indeed, with refugee status now temporary, people embedded in communities for years will be uprooted, and children who have known no home but Britain could find themselves deported to countries they have never set foot in. When the former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, asked for an assurance that no child would be placed in detention under the policy, Mahmood declined. “Vote Labour to throw screaming children in the back of vans” might never have graced a campaign leaflet, but at least it would have been honest.Our rulers also plan tosteal the “assets”of asylum seekers to pay for accommodation. Originally, the government briefed that this could include jewellery. No politician believes any meaningful revenue will be raised this way. This has been proposed merely to appeal to the most sadistic impulses.These last few years, politicians of all stripes have crassly exploited identity politics to justify imposing more misery on those who are already suffering.Mahmood’s allies briefthat her background as the child of migrant parents leaves her with “an authentic outrage over illegal migration”. Why, then, as a backbencher just a few years ago, did she support “a general amnesty for all people so they can regularise their status and start playing a full part in British society”? She spoke then of “undocumented workers”, not “illegal immigrants”. When did this “authentic outrage” arising from her heritage bloom, exactly?Keir Starmer – her boss, for now –pledged to back free movementwhen he campaigned to become leader,denounced the “hostile environment”for migrants, and reprimanded his party for being “a bit scared of making the positive case for immigration for quite a number of years.” What these people genuinely believe is anyone’s guess; it is unclear whether they themselves know. Here is a government with no moral anchor, no guiding purpose, no overarching vision. It is a government in power for its own sake.Successful governments shape the political culture of their nation, as Margaret Thatcher’s, regrettably, did. A Labour administration is supposed to drive the country in a vaguely progressive direction. Having taken the scalpel to the winter fuel payment and disability benefits, Labour is now constructing one of Europe’s harshest asylum systems. It clearly presumed its previous callousness would buy it respect: it did the opposite, and this will have the same result. Across Europe, mainstream parties that raided the rhetoric and policies of anti-migrant parties succeeded only in legitimising them, and Labour has alreadycatapulted Reform to the top spot.Denmark is cited as the exception; there, the Social Democrats maintained the cruelanti-refugee policiesof their predecessors. Leaving aside that this is a tiny Nordic country with a different political system, the Social Democrats secured support by committing to theexpansion of the welfare state: the exact opposite of British Labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I claim that so many useless emails rain into my inbox that some useful ones will surely be missed. This excuse attracts zero sympathy but prompts me to comb through the hundreds of deleted emails. They are from every part of the world – Lisbon to London, Athens to Ankara – and almost all of them are an invitation to shine at a research publication.In recognition of your scholarly achievements and contributions to the advancement of knowledge in your field, we request you to submit a research paper on a topic of your choice.The writer promises expert editorial assistance, rapid publication and professional distinction.An offer to bridge the gap between science and society sounds interesting until I read that the finely honed editorial process will just need my name, not my time. There’s a follow-up email,“just in case this went to spam”.Next is an invitation to submit an abstract to a “prestigious conference” (is there another kind?) in return for free nights in (sigh) Vienna. Also, a somewhat testy reminder that I am “intentionally ignoring” an invitation to write an editorial on advances in prostate surgery and a slightly disappointed tone that I have been silent on a 30% waiver on the “article processing fee” for writing about the origins of psychosis, both topics about which I know almost nothing.There is an intriguing contract to author an entire book on cancer to create “a global legacy” through sales on every platform but the catch for the writer in me is that I don’t need to pen the words that will “accurately depict” my “scientific insights”.Guiding my mum through hospital showed me true patient-centred care takes more than paperwork | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreBut my favourite might just be the offer of membership to research societies “over a century old” to garner professional recognition through mingling (online) with “similarly distinguished” scientists. This reliably raises my anxiety in the way of Groucho Marx who worried, “I wouldn’t want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.”With every year, the pace offraudulent publishingrises. People who must live by “publish or perish”, whose promotion is tied to research output or whose funding is linked to citations are most likely to be swayed by these get-rich-quick schemes.Ask most medical researchers about fraudulent research and they will insist that it is an isolated thing related to a few bad apples. For most, research and integrity go hand in hand.But, as anextensive study by Northwestern Universitystates, “large-scale, systematic fraud is happening on an industrial-sized level”. The researchers quote the rising prevalence of paper mills that mass-produce fake or manipulated research papers to academics; brokers who go between academics and publishers; and “predatory” journals whose main aim is to churn out papers regardless of their quality.According to the researchers, if the doubling time of scientific papers is 15 years, that of fraudulent scientific papers is just one and a half years. They state thatat least400,000 (no, this is not a typo) papers published between 2000 and 2022 are suspect, the vast majority a product of fraud or plagiarism.I’m an oncologist, so it is their next claim most alarms me. Labelling cancer as the most vulnerable field for fraudulent research, they state: “A huge fraction of the cancer literature is completely unreliable.”Given the hundreds of types of cancer and the thousands of molecules and combinations used to treat it, it is thought to be relatively easy to pick and choose figures and images to make up a plausible manuscript. The arrival of artificial intelligence has lowered the entry barrier to construct a bogus paper and put it online.Obviously, even an attentive gatekeeper can be fooled – the world’s foremost journals have beenforced to retract publications. But when thepeople perpetuating fake science are the same people publishing the fake science, what was once a side issue is now a real problem.How does this affect the average cancer patient?I was feeling a little smug at how much I had helped a cancer patient. Then came a devastating text | Ranjana SrivastavaRead more“I have done my own research”is a statement I hear all too often from my patients. Given a reduced trust in science and funding cuts to trusted institutions, the average patient turning to the internet cannot distinguish evidence from gloss.Every self-aware oncologist knows that no one is an expert on everything. Some patients who do their own research produce insightful questions and push their doctor to think harder and do better. This is welcome because there is no shortage of the ways in which doctors fail patients, especially when it comes to defending quality of life.But it is the other patients I worry about. The ones who have read (in an online article allegedly peer-reviewed) that an alkaline diet, light therapy, organic spinach or turmeric has been proven to cure cancer. The ones who paint “neutralising potions” on their visibly enlarging lumps and argue that I am the one who hasn’t seen the latest research. They borrow phrases that sound scientific and mean nothing (“My antibodies are migrating”).Having exhausted the alternatives and becoming much sicker, they end up needing more extensive and expensive care, a consequence of fraudulent research that affects every taxpayer.It is easy to dismiss the patients as naive but the fraudulent publishing industry has a lot to answer for. Suggestions to contain the damage include better funding to support good research, vigilance and collaboration from reputable publishers, and raising public awareness about the massive scale of fraud disguised as cancer research.I will be telling my patients that doing their own research is not a bad thing. But where they do that research needs much more thought than they have reason to imagine.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

It was of the actorMillie Bobby Browntalking back to a photographer on a red carpet. The paparazzi had been yelling at her to smile, and Brown retorted: “Smile?Yousmile,” before walking off. She refused to do what was expected of her.It’s a similar story with the star of the recent TV seriesAlien: Earth, Sydney Chandler. The actordid not appearon the cover of Variety magazine alongside the show’s creator and one of her co-stars, after she said she didn’t want to take part in a video interview for a regular series called How Well Do They Know Each Other?. The interviewer spent the first half of the resulting cover story explaining the situation in a bemused, tut-tutting tone, noting all the stars who had been willing to take part in the franchise.I’m sure, as the journalist points out, that after “fixing” the interview (the lengthy process of negotiations that goes on between a publication and “the talent”), it was frustrating for her to not turn up. Chandler told him that she is “just a private person”, subsequently explaining toEntertainment Weekly: “I’m figuring out how much of my personal self I need to give, Iwantto give.”So is she allowed to change her mind, or does her agreement to act and do publicity for a TV show preclude that? Because there’s an old assumption within celebrity culture that, when you become famous, you “sign up” to a set of rules. Some of these rules are contractual, some are entirely subjective and circumstantial. But they are out of your control.I have worked on magazines where “the talent” walked off set after the photographer wanted to take more photos, or when they didn’t want to film the video interview. It’s usually the gen Z actors and, while it’s frustrating, I can’t help but applaud the fact that they are saying no. Because I’ve also been on the other side of the camera when an emotionally insensitive photographer is treating you like an object and making you feel a bit dead inside, and you finish the shoot completely disassociated and go and cry in the loos. You don’t feel like you have the power to say no because you’re a tiny cog in the bigger part of the machinery. So you just get on with it.View image in fullscreen‘No, you don’t have to.’ (L-R) Catherine O’Hara, Winona Ryder and Jenna Ortega in Venice on 28 August 2024.Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty ImagesI have also walked side by side with a celebrity as paparazzi photographers flash their bulbs at you. It’s like you are in a nightclub standing beside the most intense strobe light you can think of. You freeze. But of course you have to keep moving. It’s easy to see why people have likened it to being hunted.Still, as anyone who’s seenLa Dolce Vitawill attest to, the relationship between old Hollywood and the paparazzi has deep roots. Celebrity agents are in cahoots with the photographers and editors, “creating” photo-based stories where a photographer is summoned to appear at a certain place and time. Then the star will – miraculously! – appear and the images tell the story, whether that’s a baby bump, an image change or the hard launch of a new relationship. It’s long been seen as an essential PR tool.But the difference between old Hollywood and new is stark. At last year’s Venice film festival, a clip went viral of Jenna Ortega (now 23) and Winona Ryder (54 last month), who were co-starring in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. The paparazzi screamed for Ryder to take off her sunglasses for the shot. “No, you don’t have to,”Ortega said.Younger celebrities are putting their foot down, something their older co-stars did not think was possible. This sea change is cheering to see.The infrastructure of old Hollywood is changing too. The eyebrow-raising byVarietyover Chandler’s refusal to appear sounded a bit like an old man shouting at a cloud, because print publications do not have the power they once did. Instead, a star will do a podcast interview or post on their Instagram, ensuring they have total control over a narrative. It’s understandable, considering what came before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Discontent and distrust spread as global democracy declines. Only 6.6% of the world’s people live in a full democracy, according to the Economist’sglobal index, down from 12.5% 10 years ago. Europe is still the most democratic place, but it’s turbulent.Britain is an insular country that needs reminding it is not alone in its political turmoil after an omnishambles week for Keir Starmer’s government. The rumbling earthquakes beneath No 10 also shake the ground under the Élysée Palace and other official residences. A number of European countries have thrown out old governments in the past three years, including Finland, Germany, Italy,Latvia,the Netherlands,Poland, Slovakia,Swedenand the UK (Starmer is Britain’s sixth prime minister in less than a decade). Most are still stuck in a state of post-2008-crash stagnation, more recently compounded by the pandemic, inflation, energy price rises, worsening housing crises and a cost of living squeeze.Only last year, Britain was heralded as the strong and stable nation of Europe, with Labour commanding a stonking great majority. As a result, the shock is all the worse now that, 16 months later, support for the governmenthasplummeted to 18%, falling a frightening 15 points behind Reform UK. Labour has sustained “the worst-ever fall in support for a newly elected government”,says the pollsterProf John Curtice.True, it’s a government blighted by bad luck, inheriting Treasury account books withuncosted promisesfrom the previous chancellor and Brexit damage even worse than predicted, navigating landmines in every depleted department (none worse than in the Ministry of Justice, with prisonsaccidentally freeing criminals), and stricken by incoming fire from Trump. Yet Labour has been energetically making its own bad luck too.Prolonged pre-budget mayhem has prepared the way for a blistering response to whatever emerges from the battered red box next week. Every category of citizen has been targeted, with Treasury kites flown for any imaginable tax rise, only for them to be hastily denied. I was impressed this month when Rachel Reeves stepped forward unexpectedly toroll the pitch for an increase in income taxto generate enough money “to put country before party, the national interest before political calculation”. Brave and fair, it would have given her headroom for crises and freedom to repair 14 years of public damage. It was a decision greeted with support by many Labour people.But barely had she spoken before she made a political U-turn, claiming she didn’t need so much money after all. (She does, we all do.) Apparently commanded from Downing Street, spooked by MPs including Lucy Powell and Wes Streetingpubliclyobjectingto breaking the manifesto, she rendered her own speech inexplicable. Her original plan to add 2p on to income tax, with workers compensatedby a 2p cut in national insurance, would have ingeniously protected working incomes while raising money from those who should pay more: better-off pensioners, landlords and all on unearned incomes. (Reeves should include imposing NICS on everyone: why don’t I pay it due to my age, despite being in work, while a street cleaner does?)The truth is that the botched briefing against Streeting last week has blown any remaining No 10 reputation for gravitas, igniting a leadership furore that had only simmered until now. Voices expecting Starmer to last four years are mute, while despairing talk is only about who will succeed him and when. After the budget, perhaps? Or after May’s potentially apocalyptic local elections? But why wait if that disaster could be mitigated? Maybe leave it closer to the general election, for a fresh face to bring a polling bounce? But this magical faith in a change of image and rhetoric ignores that even a wizard would confront the same intractables – tight finances, hostile bond markets, miserably negative voters, miserly reluctant taxpayers. Small boats and the cost of living must be curbed, but how?I doubt a panicked leadership election now would lift Labour’s fortunes: a challenge might fail, the attempt would be messy, noisy and divisive, and it might not leave the impression of a fresh party knowing where it’s going. For now, it should make the most of power, ignore unpopularity and fearlessly do what it knows must be done.MPs might examine their own failings as well as their leader’s. I remain puzzled by how little enthusiasm Labour has managed to spread for the quite impressive list of things it has done in a short time that should please natural supporters. Look, last week the Renters’ Rights Actended no-fault evictionsfrom next year, which will be life-changing for families in England in which children grow up precariously in private rented homes (in 2023-24,34% of householdsin private rentals in the country included children).The suggestions in thecurriculum review published this monthwould breathe new life into schools, with shorter GCSE exams and a new focus on arts, sports, life skills and vocational subjects. Rail is being nationalised. Huge investments in renewables progress towards net zero withpublic support, defying Nigel Farage and Kemi Badenoch. New workers’ rightswill end zero-hours insecurityby 2027 and allow unions into every workplace. Last week’s NHS England statistics showslowly improving waiting times, with the recruitment of2,000 more GPshelping to increase the number of appointments. The revival of Sure Start as Best Start, nurseries for all and their expansion in schoolsmeans human capital will flourish beyond Labour’s likely term. I could go on, listing breakfast clubs, the EU relationship reset, warm home plans and quite a bit more. That is not negligible, so why the near silence?Asked what the government has done and what it stands for, sullen voters on doorsteps tell pollsters they don’t know. Well, it’s the difficult job of politicians to light their way, instil optimism and make coherent sense of their policies. For Labour, that’s 10 times harder against the distorting wall of sound of the vast rightwing hate media, far more mendacious now than in Tony Blair’s day. Mistakes are amplified, successes silenced.Everyone has a list of discontentment over what Labour fails to do. Electoral reform tops mine, an emergency now Reform could win with less than a third of the vote. Preventing that is Labour’s elemental duty, whatever it takes, with its great majority and years of time. Starmer’s conference speech in September took on Reform as “a fight about who we are as a country”, adding: “It goes to the soul of our future.” It’s the same defining challenge across much of Europe. So where did that fight go?Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionRachel ReevesKeir StarmerEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Having the likes of Sky News and The Australian newspaper constantly criticise you and feed you and your team a steady diet of misguided advice cannot be easy. But you mustn’t let this get you down because barely anyone listens to them any more.Now on to the specifics of thisappalling excuse for a research assignment.Firstly, have you not been listening in chemistry class? Coal is predominantly made of carbon. When it is burned it combines with oxygen to form CO2. Constantly repeating that you can reduce carbon emissions and also have “energy abundance” through use of Australia’s plentiful reserves of coal is illogical. Or maybe you were listening in chemistry but have been nodding off during our philosophy classes on logic?Also, you mustn’t listen to your fellow classmate Daniel Tehan’s assertion this doesn’t matter because of carbon capture and storage. I don’t know how many times I have to tell both you and Daniel, you cannot rely on ChatGPT to write your homework. The tool has been trained partly on fantasy story books written by fossil fuel companies and has a horrible habit of hallucinating facts. It also got your friend Ted O’Brien into trouble last year when he wrote that assignment about rolling outsmall modular nuclear reactorsover the next few years, when they don’t actually exist.Also I have already warned you about plagiarism.Plagiarism is always bad, but it is far worse when it involves copying the work of someone incompetent in the subject you are being assessed on. Matt Canavan and David Littleproud have not even been taking the classes that were relevant to this assignment. So I don’t understand why you would be copying their communications subject assignment on how to engage with those that struggle with reading. I told you the intended audience for this research assignment have university degrees!Factchecking five Coalition claims about net zero, from power prices to the $9tn costRead moreLastly on the topic of maths. You and your team seem to have a complete inability to distinguish between billions and trillions. You keep repeating the claim that the universities of Melbourne and Queensland and Princeton University have estimated that achieving net zero will cost $9tn. They actuallycosted it at $300bn. Still admittedly a lot of money, but that won’t get you out of failing maths if you keep this up.Also, be sure you don’t copy Littleproud’s maths homework. His claim in his last assignment that renewable energy projects will occupy an area of land that will “tear up Australia’s food security” illustrates he is yet to grasp percentages. In reality,0.03% of agricultural landwould support enough renewable energy projects to replace all Australia’s consumption of fossil fuels, and in practice many of these projects would be placed in areas of poor agricultural value.My advice to you if you want to avoid repeating 2025 is to pay far greater attention to the quality of your research sources. If you heard it from Donald Trump or Pauline Hanson or Barnaby Joyce, then it is almost certainly wrong. Instead, can I suggest that you rely far more on organisations that employ genuine scientists? The Bureau of Meteorology would be a good start. The Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and CSIRO would also be worth checking out. And for goodness sake, stop copying Canavan and Littleproud’s homework!Tristan Edis is director of analysis and advisory at GreenEnergyMarketsExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionFossil fuelsRenewable energyCoalitionLiberal partySussan LeyClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

We must not give inTue 18 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 13.19 ESTShareProtecting our digital sovereignty is crucial. The challenge is why European decision makers aremeeting in Berlinon Tuesday at the behest of the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. As individuals, we spend four to five hours a day accessing the internet via our smartphones and other devices, from social networks to online shopping to AI assistants. It is essential, therefore, that we have control over how the digital space is organised, structured and regulated.Europe has already set to work. Between 2022 and 2024, EU digital laws were adopted by an overwhelming majority of MEPs and unanimously by all member states. The Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the Data Act and the AI Act form the common foundation protecting our children, citizens, businesses and democracies from all kinds of abuses in the information space. These four major laws mirror our core values and the principles of the rule of law. They make up the most advanced digital legal framework in the world.Europecan be proud of it.The EU’s vast digital market is open to all. But those who want to benefit from it must abide by our conditions. We should have no fear of displeasing anyone: if you have no respect for the rules, then you have no access to the market. This is how our biggest trading partners operate. Do the US or China ever refrain from enforcing their own laws simply to please us? We should immediately apply our laws. This must be the first expression of European digital sovereignty.The US, China, Russia and Europe – the new state-controlled digital empires – each advance their own vision of the information space, shaped by their values, priorities and their relationship to the market and the state. The US model is built on the primacy of private actors and minimal oversight – an ultra-liberal system in which a few major companies (Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft) dominate cyberspace and seek to impose their standards, their worldview and the dependence that follows.China has chosen the opposite path. It relies on control and closure, mass surveillance and the defence of local norms. It is based on an autonomous digital infrastructure – cloud, 5G, AI – backed by national champions such as Huawei, ByteDance and Alibaba. The state steers everything: it monitors content and uses data as a political, geopolitical and commercial lever.Russia goes further still. It treats the information space and cyberspace as extensions of its territory. Moscow claims information sovereignty, calls for a “multipolar” internet governance model and imposes strict content control in the name of security and national cohesion. Russia’s information warfare campaigns are, as we know, its preferred tools for shaping opinion, destabilising democracies and advancing its geopolitical aims.Faced with unrestrained liberalism on one side and authoritarian dirigisme on the other, the EU has gone its own way. It has chosen to rely on the strength of its internal market, which comprises 450 million citizens. That choice demands political courage: the courage to deploy that power, unfailingly, in every negotiation. Europe’s legal arsenal for the information space is designed to ensure cohesion, protect users, guarantee transparency and safeguard the foundations of our democracies. So can anyone be surprised that some now work so hard to weaken it; to methodically cut through the four pillars of our digital space?We can’t let ourselves be intimidated. We should resist any attempt to unravel these laws, through “omnibus” bills or otherwise, mere months after they have entered into force, under the pretext of simplification or remedying an alleged “anti-innovation” bias. No one is fooled over the transatlantic origin of these attempts. So let’s not be useful idiots. The second expression of our digital sovereignty must involve protecting, at all costs, the integrity of our digital legal pillars, including at the geopolitical level.Sovereignty is not bought, it is built. With no globally dominant digital companies of its own, Europe will assert credible and lasting sovereignty only by combining ambitious regulation, massive investment, sovereign innovation, coordinated action and the development of its talent.It must invest in research and critical infrastructure: sovereign cloud services, networks and satellites, semiconductors. It must support the European ecosystem across the entire value chain: AI and algorithms, cybersecurity, quantum technologies and datacentres. It must train and attract far more top-tier digital experts. And it must foster the emergence of industry champions capable of competing with big tech, through funding for startups, consolidating innovative SMEs and building native European platforms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Edmund de Waal’s obsession with a deeply disturbing DaneCharlotte HigginsThe great potter explains why he turned his decades-long fixation with Axel Salto – maker of unsettling stoneware full of tentacle sproutings and knotty growths – into a new showTue 18 Nov 2025 11.26 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 15.29 ESTSharePotter and writerEdmund de Waal, a dark silhouette of neat workwear against the blinding white of his studio, is erupting with thoughts, all of them tumbling out of him at once. He is giving me a tour of the former gun factory on a London industrial estate gently disciplined into architectural calm. It has work stations for his staff (it’s quite an operation); store rooms; and a main space nearly empty but for some giant black lidded vessels he made in Denmark, as capacious as coffins. At either end, up discreet sets of steps, are the places of raw creation. One, with its potter’s wheel, is where he makes; the other, with its desk and bookshelves, is where he writes.He opens a door to the room housing his two mighty kilns, its back wall lined with rows of shelves with experiments in form and glaze, and tells me of his irritation when people comment on the sheer tidiness of the whole place. “It’sporcelain,” he says with passionate emphasis. Dust and dirt are the enemy. Potters, he points out, “have struggled for hundreds and hundreds of years to keep things clean so that they don’t blow up in kilns, or don’t bloat or don’tduntor all the other myriad things that can happen”. He is old enough, he says, to have had the kind of potter’s apprenticeship that involved the endless sweeping up of clay dust. Dust is the traditional bringer of potter’s lung – the chronic condition, silicosis. Clouds of dust surround any pottery-making endeavour, if you’re not careful.Anyone from 1680 onwards would have understood my studioSuddenly I’m deep in the memory of his descriptions of the dust-blown ceramics-manufacturing city of Jingdezhen, which he wrote about inThe White Road, a kind of memoir told through the history of porcelain; and then there is the dust he writes about in his bookLetter to Camondo, the dust of theshtetlnear Odesa which his family left when they rose into wealth and Second Empire luxury in the late 19th century, when amid “all that operatic nonsense around curtains and blinds and pelmets and trailing swags” they must have waged war on dust, with “servants to endlessly sweep away all those traces that might show where [they’d] come from”.He quotes WG Sebald: “Ash is a redeemed substance, like dust.” Dust and ashes preoccupy him: the matter that is left of us. The survival of things beyond the fragile lifespan of people is one of the subjects of his extraordinary 2010 bestseller,The Hare With the Amber Eyes, a family story told through a set ofnetsuke, tiny Japanese ivory carvings that, through all the violence and genocide of 20th-century Europe, were acquired, given away, stolen, smuggled to safety, hidden and retrieved.View image in fullscreenSpotless … de Waal has to keep his studio office free of dust and dirt.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThere’s something about his scattering, passionate way of talking and writing that is infectious, and maybe I don’t need much encouraging, because now I’m thinking, too, about the sheer persistence of ceramics, how they are paradoxically easy to smash and yet, even if broken, survive as shards or fragments for centuries or even millennia. “You can’t destroy ceramics, you can only break them,” he says.Making things from clay is almost always deep in the heart of the human story – “every culture has mythic beginnings in squeezing clay and making form,” he points out. And though its methodologies have changed, “anyone from 1680 onwards would have understood this studio, could walk around and pick up materials, look at them, find a kiln, understand why all those things are things that have gone wrong in interesting ways.” He points at his shelf of ceramic failures and experiments as if he is an alchemist gesturing at base metals that have failed to turn to gold.Alchemy, the idea of the transformation of one substance into another through a dark magic, is on his mind: it is something that he associates with the potter Axel Salto (1889-1961),an exhibition on whom he has curated for The Hepworth Wakefield. He first encountered the Dane’s work 30 years ago, he says, and he was amazed by the artist’s strange, bulbous stoneware vessels, which might be sprouting weird tentacles, or be knotty and knobbly like galls. “I thought, ‘I have no idea what’s going on here at all. This is like nothing I’ve seen.’ I found them really disturbing, and then I got pretty obsessed by him, and realised that he was even more peculiar than I thought he was, and that gloriously, amazingly, he had written about all these pots. He wrote about the demonic in ceramics, about fear in ceramics, and he wrote about transformation.”With printing stamps one can make amusing, astonishing, indeed bewitching picturesSalto was, says de Waal, fascinated by the Roman writer Ovid’s epic poem Metamorphoses, a work about mythical transformations. “One of the glorious, gorgeous, complicated things about ceramics is that hold, at the centre of them, the image of something having changed,” says de Waal. “But Axel Salto says it’s not in the past, it’s in the present. That things are still moving, when you look at ceramics, you’re seeing the glaze as it melts.”Salto was more than a ceramicist: he also designed textiles, using repeated patterns – repetition being, in a different way, another key to a potter’s existence, as she or he throws the same shapes in clay over a lifetime, measuring their life in pots. Salto made stamps for printing and wrote a book for children about how to use them: “with printing stamps one can make amusing, astonishing, indeed bewitching pictures,” he wrote. “The imprint, not that interesting when printed only once, becomes more exciting the second time, when you put a new impression next to the first one. This rule always applies to the stamps:repetition is fun.”A section in the exhibition in Yorkshire is going to be an area in which children (if they manage to fight off the adults) get to play with printing stamps. The idea is to have a space where young people can “just try things out, not for any kind of curriculum needs, but because being a human being is about discovering what happens, bodily, with you in the world – which is play,” says de Waal. “Play makes you alive to the world in a material way. Stripping play and craft from children’s lives is just a disgrace.”View image in fullscreen‘Like nothing I’d seen’ … Axel Salto amonghis creations.Photograph: Aage Strüwing/© Axel Salto/VISDAIt’s a political point, and there are more “very pointed” politics in a much larger exhibition that has just openedover several venues at the Huntington, a library, art museum and botanical gardens in Los Angeles. It takes as its central idea that of porcelain as a migratory material: there is an installation in the Chinese garden, black porcelain shown in darkness in the Japanese garden, and a display of 18th-centuryMeissen plates, which were stolen by the Nazis then reduced to pieces by the British and American bombing of Dresden, now repaired using the Japanese art ofkintsugi, which keeps the breaks visible. And “I’ve made a new poetry library – of 200 poets who have all made their home in America from different places. So it’s a sort of library of sanctuary.”De Waal is scattering thoughts all round his studio; he is scattering projects in his wake, too. Aside from his exhibitions in Wakefield and LA, he is close to finishing the first draft of his next new book. This one, like The Hare With the Amber Eyes, draws on his remarkable family history – the unpublished correspondence between his grandmother and the poetRainer Maria Rilke, which ought to be surprising but is not at all, really, when one remembers that another of his relatives was one of the models for Proust’s Charles Swann.It is a busy place, de Waal’s brain. I ask him about a passage in his book The White Road, in which he describes being insomniac in China, and trying to send himself to sleep by remembering all the pots he’s ever made, right from when he was starting out, a young man, impoverished but idealistic in a tiny studio in rural Herefordshire.

So he decided it was time to live a more interesting – and stressful – lifeTue 18 Nov 2025 10.18 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTShareWhat’s the opposite of an overnight success? Should we call Ian Smith a slow burner, a sleeper hit? The Yorkshireman’s last two shows, both fantastic, were nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award, he has a popular Radio 4 series, Ian Smith is Stressed, and growing TV visibility. Now he’s embarking on a second UK tour. But breakout success was a long time coming for the 37-year-old. “I did my first gig when I was 17,” he tells me over coffee in London, “which I find horrific. It makes me feel old.”What took him so long? Might one factor be that Smith’s is a traditional brand of standup – fretful everyman sends up his own anxiety – in a culture that prizes the new and different? That can’t be it, he says. “Because I had so many gimmicks! That was a big part of my standup.” He cites the high-concept shows (comedy in a bath; comedy on a bed) that made Tim Key’s name. “I loved standup with slightly theatrical set-pieces. That was my voice for four shows. I got a review that said, ‘Ian substitutes writing jokes with standing on tables and shouting at people.’ And it was fair enough. I went through a real standing-on-tables phase.”I didn’t have loads going on in my life. I sometimes felt it was quite boringBut the world wasn’t taking much notice. “I didn’t have an agent for a couple of years, and I did feel in the wilderness. But my shows kept getting better.” Then one day, he says, “I wanted to prove I could do a funny show without PowerPoint, set-pieces or gimmicks. And that became my most successful show.”EntitledCrushing, it depicted the neurotic tizz Smith got himself into after a relationship breakup. Its follow-up,Foot Spa Half Empty, addresses Smith’s low sperm count, discovered when he and his partner began trying for a child. Neither show is remotely gimmicky. Quite the opposite: Smith ascribes their success to their actually addressing something meaningful about his experience of the world.View image in fullscreen‘I only ever want to make it as stupid and silly as I can’ … Smith.Photograph: Matt Stronge“I didn’t used to have loads going on in my life,” he says. “I would sometimes feel it was quite boring. So I made a conscious effort to put myself out in the world, to live a more interesting or stressful life. Maybe I just starteddoingmore stuff.” This included visiting Bratislava with his hairdresser, where (as recounted in Crushing) he drove a tank over a car to vent his pent-up rage.By cannibalising his fretfulness for comedy, Smith refined a persona to stand alongside those peevish titans of mouse-that-roared comedyRhod Gilbertand Victor Meldrew. “The best comedy,” he says, “comes from negative feelings: stress or anxiety or fear. Then you tell people about those feelings, and they realise they also get stressed about things they shouldn’t really worry about, and it’s all a big release. That’s where the best stuff comes from.”Maybe so – but it still took a deep breath for Smith to address his fertility struggles on stage. “It was a hard decision,” he says, “but I was strong-armed into it by the situation. Because if I’m writing a show, it’s going to be about things I’m stressed about in that moment. I would have struggled to motivate myself to write ‘self-service checkouts are really annoying’ when, really, I wouldn’t have cared about that at the time.” Unlike with his breakup show, written in retrospect, Smith wrote Foot Spa Half Empty throughout the spring of this year, while the process (the anxiety, the trips to the sperm clinic) was unfolding in real time.Bad dates and bath bombs: 10 of the funniest jokes from the Edinburgh fringe 2025Read more“It was like a live coping mechanism,” he says. “Which some people would say is not healthy. Comedians often tell audiences, ‘Don’t worry about me. I’ve processed this and everything’s OK.’ Whereas I had a line in the show – which I eventually dropped – that went, ‘I want to let you know I haven’t processed any of this! I’m stressed about it right now!’ I thought that was a bold way to tell people this is an ongoing thing. But it can take audiences away from being able to laugh at you.”Laughter, after all, is what Smith is in it for – on stage, on screen (he has sitcoms in development), or on his popular Northern News podcast with Yorkshire compatriotAmy Gledhill. This is emphaticallynota comic who classifies his anxieties as trauma or mental health. “It would be easy in this new show to say something sad or profound about how I feel about the [infertility] situation,” he says. “But I always feel the obligation to be as funny as possible. Whether I’m stressed about a serious subject or a trivial one, I only ever want to make it as stupid and silly as I can.”It’s an approach that has got him, finally, where he wants to be in comedy: a slow burner who has finally caught fire. “I can be full of self-doubt,” says Smith, “and you could chart my career doubt by how many times I would Google ‘law conversion courses’ in a year. But I haven’t done that in a while now.”Ian Smith: Foot Spa Half empty is atSoho theatre, London, 25-29 November.Then tours in the new year.Explore more on these topicsComedyEdinburgh festival 2025Fertility problemsHealthEdinburgh festivalSoho theatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

When I hear a phrase in my head it is free of the confines of bar lines, but, in practical application, eventually it needs to get squeezed into recognisable shapes and containers. Every composer has their own strategy (some eschew bar lines entirely, or use alternative notational strategies outside the traditional western systems), but it’s always a negotiation: does the way the composer notates the rhythm correspond to how it should best appear on the flute player’s music stand?I have distinct memories of being 13, hearing a piece (specifically, Stravinsky’s Symphony in Three Movements), basically memorising it from the recording, and then being absolutely shocked when I finally saw the score. “That’s where the downbeat is?!” Stravinsky’s sense of time and my understanding of the same were at variance in a way I still find exciting: the idea that there are infinite superimpositions of a practical system (notation) over a medium (sound) most often experienced by an audience without the score. Understanding that notating rhythm is artificial yet crucial requires both personal precision and empathy with future interpreters.View image in fullscreenMaud Le Pladec’s Veins of Water, part of Marking Time triple bill.Photograph: Ecoute Cherie/Ecoute Cherie/PR HandoutWatching a dance rehearsal as a score-addicted musician is surreal. You can have 30 people in the room, and only two of them will have the score. What is fascinating is that the choreographer has imposed an entirely different, invisible form of notation on the form of their counting, which, in consort with the music, becomes what the dancers memorise and take into their bodies. What I find the most interesting is how the choreographers’ counting system interacts with the score: if my system of notation can feel like dividing a loaf of bread into slices this big or that big, often the dancers are feeling larger, more structural counts. I could have 16 fussy little bars of varying lengths, equalling about 30 seconds, which they will mysteriously but magically hear, and feel, as two cycles of 11 equal beats. Eavesdropping, you’ll hear dancers say “OK, so there’s thatpasdechatafter the three eights, then five … six … seven …” which is a fantastic alternative cartography.I don’t find this reality to be at variance with my own sense of time. Indeed, I have found myself, with over 20 years’ experience working with choreographers, learning so much more about the lengths of phrase and the subtle narratives they imply. I can have spent months on tiny details and can easily lose track of a bigger sense of shape, which choreographers and dancers have as a matter of physical instinct. We have a shared vocabulary (“line” or “phrase” come to mind) but I often feel humbled by their fluency in hearing, somehow, a larger heartbeat.I think about this relationship as a very zoomed-in way in which we are all mostly tethered to the Gregorian calendar, but there are superstructures and microstructures unique to different communities. Just last week, I had a meeting with a director of music at an Oxford chapel, and we spoke about a multi-year project and not a single date was mentioned – it was only “Epiphany” or “the Thursday before Trinity Sunday.” The year can have little gravitational pulls towards bank holidays, birthdays,yahrzeits;the exigencies of the garden and its various plantings and harvests can become the dominant way of dividing up time.View image in fullscreenNobodaddy by Michael Keegan-Dolan, at Sadler’s Wells, November 2024.Photograph: Emilija JefremovaMost of my work with dance comprises commissions where the dance and the music are developed together, sometimes in a round-robin way where I’ll provide some sketches, videos of movement will appear in an inbox, more sketches, and so on. I’ve found the best way to operate in that environment is to have the world’s fastest conversation about structure – Benjamin Millepied, my oldest collaborator, and I try to figure the whole thing out over a meal – followed by a list of things we both want to try out. A giantpassacagliafor me, a sextet of just men for him. A section with only metallic instruments for me, an incredibly kinetic sequence of motion against spare, severe music for him.This month, I have the enormous pleasure of havingthree works of mine choreographed by three very different choreographers: Michael Keegan-Dolan, Maud Le Pladec and Jules Cunningham. It goes without saying that their work is incredibly different, but what I’m finding most fascinating about the process is watching them juxtapose their own sense of time on the music.Michael Keegan-Dolan, for instance, has taken a piece that sets a traditional murder ballad,The Two Sisters. The narrative of the ballad is still there, sung live by the singer Sam Amidon, but what Michael has done is to impose a sort of ritual, informed by his own deep theatrical engagement with any source material. It both amplifies and offsets the patterns of the folk music in a way I could never do with music alone.Jules Cunninghamhas been working with a set of drone-based pieces. The solo lines are notated such that the rhythms are tight within the phrases, but there is room between them to play. Jules’ note to me after the first read-through with the ensemble was that they wanted a bit morebreathbefore the phrases: a comment indicated with a small exhalation. It’s a musical request (happily obeyed!) stemming directly from their own embodied experience of moving to the music. We use the same term in rehearsals (“could you just put a little bit of a breath between bar 13 and 14”) but it usually comes from a more distant or abstract musical instinct, often given top-down from the conductor or composer.View image in fullscreen‘Choreographers and composers have a shared vocabulary but I often feel humbled by their fluency in hearing, somehow, a larger heartbeat.’Nico MuhlyPhotograph: PR HANDOUTAnd Maud Le Pladec has made a piece where her trio of dancers adhere to the music in an incredibly precise way. All three movements of the music are quite fast, but sometimes, fast music can be quite slow, and slow music can be hiding a rapidly beating pulse. Her movement picks up on this, and in response, the Britten Sinfonia are invited to imbue their performance with this fast-within-slow energy, “visualising” semiquavers even though the notes they’re playing are much, much longer. It’s an interpretative strategy informed by bodies – for me it’s also a welcome change from the sometimes theoretical and arbitrary practices which can govern modern performance.The next time you find yourself at a dance show, opera or musical, take a moment and pay attention to how tightly the movement is adhering to the music. If the music feels as if it’s in comfortable cycles of four bars, is the dance reinforcing that, resisting it, or complicating it? If the music feels as if it’s floating in outer space, is the dance offering it a scaffolding?View image in fullscreenMark Morris Dance Group’s 2013 Crosswalk, which sets chamber music by Weber.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen I first moved to New York in 1999, I found myself going to dance more often than I would go to the symphony. Often, my first experience hearing a piece of music live was choreographed: I cannot think about Stravinsky’s violin concerto without seeingBalanchine’s choreographyin my head; there is a giant catalogue of chamber music which I can scarcely imagine without seeingwhatever brilliant thing Mark Morrismade out of it. I’ve also found that music to which choreographers are drawn can be found in a different aisle than whatever is at any given moment in concert halls and opera houses. Their sense of which music compels them is rooted in the body, and the immediacy of that engagement makes me hear music differently, and know it in a more complex and rich way.Marking Time: Nico Muhly / Michael Keegan-Dolan / Maud Le Pladec / Jules Cunningham and the Britten Sinfonia is atSadler’s Wells, London, from 20-22 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicDancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he arrives on stage – inside a trunk – to serenade the audienceChris WiegandTue 18 Nov 2025 08.51 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 08.52 ESTShareIn one of Hollywood’s nicer ironies, character actor John C Reilly finally made it big with a song about being invisible. His Oscar-nominated performance as the duped and devoted schmuck Amos Hart in Kander and Ebb’s Chicago was defined by his solo,Mister Cellophane. Director Rob Marshall had him sing it in an empty theatre so Amos doesn’t even get an audience for his big number.More than 20 years later, Reilly has dusted off a not dissimilar tailcoat and rouged his cheeks once more under a new moniker, Mister Romantic, and this time there’s a full house. Backed by a four-piece band he is here to win our hearts with 90 minutes of jazz standards and popular songs, plus the odd chanson and comic verse. After a dozen or so dates in the US, the show has a short run this week in London at Soho Theatre Walthamstow, whose beautifully restored interior andhistory as a music hallfits Mister Romantic like a glove.It’s vaudeville with the gentlest hint of grand guignol. The band wind their way through the auditorium, Charles De Castro doing double duty on accordion and cornet, opening with Tom Waits’ instrumental Just Another Sucker on the Vine. They proceed to drag our host on to the stage concealed inside a trunk. When he climbs out, hair likeShock-Headed Peter, he professes not to know the day of the week, his location or even his band. But if just one of us will love him for ever, he won’t have to go back in the box.View image in fullscreenSteve Coogan and John C Reilly in the 2018 film Stan & Ollie.Photograph: Bbc Films/AllstarAnd so the seduction begins. Reilly starts off with Pretend, a hit for Nat King Cole in 1953, its melancholic optimism here re-spun as if to honour the theatre audience’s role in all of this: “And if you sing this melody / You’ll be pretending just like me / The world is mine it can be yours my friend.” It’s a kind of promise: submit to the show and you won’t regret it.In between the lyrics Reilly drifts around the stage with some silent clowning that brings back memories of his Oliver Hardy on screen, opposite Steve Coogan’s Stan Laurel, intheir filmabout the double act’s 50s variety hall tour. As Mister Romantic lights up an invisible cigar, blows smoke rings and hulas inside them, he can’t conceal a smile at the whimsy. And who can blame him? Then it’s on to Irving Berlin’s Blue Skies, with Reilly miming the song’s bluebirds as if he’s a grizzled Snow White.The tone of the evening is equal parts wide-eyed ingenuity and seasoned world-weariness. He’s a kind of eternal troubadour and a gag on the show’s website lists tour dates going back to 1590 at London’s Globe (nine years before it was actually built) and the night before the famous 1903 fire at Chicago’s Iroquois theatre. Mister Romantic is apparently as ageless as his set list is timeless. But his innocent air also brings to mind Buddy the Elf, played by his Step Brothers co-star, Will Ferrell.View image in fullscreenJack White as Elvis Presley with John C Reilly in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007).Photograph: Columbia Pictures/Sportsphoto/AllstarStep Brothers gave Reilly a couple of goofy throwaway songs, as did several of the comedies he made at the time, but his lead role in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story relied on his prowess as a singer. The spoof music biopic about Cox’s bid to become a “double great” singer, after the unfortunate death by machete of his brother, rattles through pastiches of Johnny Cash, the Beatles and beyond, with Reilly’s musicality helping the jokes land.Most of Mister Romantic’s songs are done straight, his band (completed by Davíd Garza on piano and guitar, Gabe Witcher on violin and David Piltch on bass) wearing sombre expressions. But he gets all loosey-goosey on Earl Okin’s eccentric come-on, My Room, matching the bluesy humour with lascivious gestures. That’s a welcome gear change in a show that cleaves just a little too closely to one register and misses the more unvarnished emotion of the other Waits tracks featured onReilly’s album.On screen, some of Reilly’s musical highlights have been duets – see his cowboy pardnership with Woody Harrelson in Robert Altman’s swansong, A Prairie Home Companion. Mister Romantic sings instead on his lonesome, save for recruiting us as backing singers and riffing with the audience as he seeks out someone – anyone – to love him. The crowd work, done with a red rose microphone, is carefully managed and Reilly’s features are captivating in closeup – that face, halfway to its own caricature, veers from smitten to crestfallen as Mister Romantic is rejected time after time.This feeds into the drama of the songs when, for example, he dedicates You Don’t Know Me (written by Eddy Arnold and Cindy Walker) to those individuals – the song veering from the usual unrequited loyalty to the scorn of a spurned suitor. It’s a clever concept: here is a singer of soul-baring songs whose heart is broken by his own audience.All shades of love are here: pining and enduring, effortless and hopeless, yet none of it to ever be regretted or fully extinguished. “You and the song are gone / But the melody lingers on,” he sings as it approaches the end of the evening, another nod – like that opening number – to the alchemy between performer and audience.Reilly dreamed this enchanting show up after he “looked at our weary world a few years ago and tried to think of a way I could spread love and empathy”. It’s rare to feel that songs are being delivered straight to you but that’s what he achieves – never mind the goofing – through his unquestionable sincerity. “Hope I didn’t take up too much of your time,” mumbled Amos at the end of Mister Cellophane. On the contrary: I could have kept listening right through the night.AtSoho Theatre Walthamstow, London, until 19 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreClownsJohn C ReillyMusicalsCabaretSoho theatrefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And now we live in an era in which a chatbot can write a passable sonnet, it is perhaps surprising that there hasn’t been a huge shift in how film-makers approach this particular corner of sci-fi.Gareth Edwards’The Creator(2023) is essentially the same story about AIs being the newly persecuted underclass as 1962’s The Creation of the Humanoids, except that the former has an $80m VFX budget and robot monks while the latter has community-theatre production values. Moon (2009) and 1968’s2001: A Space Odysseyare both about the anxiety of being trapped with a soft-voiced machine that knows more than you. Her (2013) is basically Electric Dreams (1984) with fewer synth-pop arpeggios.No one is suggesting Hollywood should start making films about what AI actually does. It seems unlikely that film-goers would flood to multiplexes to catch a three-act tech farce in which a nefarious algorithm admits it can’t answer the hero’s question because it “doesn’t have access to data yet”. But we should at least be getting something that feels like it’s been inspired by recent developments, rather than expensively produced and lavishly recycled takes on stories we’ve all seen before.From the look of its debut trailer, Gore Verbinski’s Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die may not be the bold reinvention of AI cinema we might want, but it is at least gesturing towards something new. This time, the AI in question doesn’t seem hugely interested in saving or destroying mankind; instead it’s acting like a chaotic, reality-bending dungeon master, running humans through a cosmic escape room for reasons that make sense only to itself. Could machines of the future have taken a note from modern day YouTubers who spend all day and night livestreaming their own digital reality? Is this all just a great big laugh at the expense of humanity by a god-like deity?Perhaps this is more about the Deadpoolisation of modern blockbuster cinema, but the sense I get from this trailer is that Hollywood has finally run out of ways to make AI frightening, wise or soulful, and has decided to make it an endlessly glitched-out nonsense engine instead. A jittery man from the future (Sam Rockwell) bursts into a diner to inform a random assortment of strangers that they must help him prevent the AI apocalypse. Suddenly we’re pinballing between spider-legged dollbots, neon-lit dystopian alleyways and what looks like a giant ungulate striding through suburbia, all intercut with quippy one-liners from people who seem to want to narrate their own AI apocalypse in real time. Mystical triangular glyphs are everywhere and set-pieces arrive with the panicked rhythm of a timeline that’s clearly being reloaded every 30 seconds.There’s a definite hint ofEverything Everywhere All At Oncein the over-caffeinated speed-cutting chaos too, but at least we’re not being handed yet another ponderous parable about robot souls, digital enlightenment or the hubris of man. Verbinski’s film also stars Juno Temple and Haley Lu Richardson and is out in February, when we’ll presumably find out what unholy combination of prompts caused the timeline to glitch this badly in the first place.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekScience fiction and fantasy filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingSam RockwellcommentShareReuse this content"

More than £5.7m a year is allegedly being misallocated by performing rights organisations, and paid out to the wrong people.“What we’re seeing in the industry is a fundamental imbalance,” says Ethan Holben, who led the project at Fair Play. “DJs can command substantial fees for playing other people’s music, yet the producers whose tracks are being played in clubs and festivals around the world often make little or nothing. Many don’t even know their music is being played.”Artists in genres such as R&B, rap and metal – all of which have their own nightlife venues – will also be affected, and the research suggests that independent and underground artists are likely to be hardest hit.When detailed tracklist information doesn’t exist for a given DJ set, rights organisations will instead extrapolate from the data produced by other venues, send staff to conduct in-person spot checks, or use radio playlists as a proxy. Precise details of these calculations remain confidential to prevent people gaming the system.Rights organisations express confidence in these methods but Fair Play estimates that 50% of these “analogous” payments are in fact inaccurate, and are concerned that “smaller venues and underground scenes subsidise mainstream producers whose music appears on radio playlists,” citing a 2019 DJ Mag article which reported that 60% of tracks played in Spanish clubs never make it to radio at all.“The fundamental issue is architectural,” says Holben. “Many collective management organisations [that distribute royalties] are over 100 years old, and the music industry is still oriented around bands and artists performing their own songs. The performance rights system and submission processes are still largely built around this too, despite electronic music now being one of the top genres both in listenership and festival bookings.”Other fees, such as those levied on venues to play music, or on songwriters to be able to claim royalties in the first place, can be similarly contentious. Last year, artists including the Jesus and Mary Chain and Robert Frippsued PRS for Music, the UK’s biggest performing rights society (who manage royalty distribution), over terms which they claim unfairly benefit stadium and arena-sized acts. PRS said it would “vigorously defend” that lawsuit.PRS has also cast doubt on Fair Play’s findings, claiming that their “headline percentage is built on partial inputs”. The real problem, PRS argues, is a lack of data from venues and DJs about the music they’re playing: “Without comprehensive track-level logs across all UK dance floors, any single figure is indicative, not definitive.”Statistics from Fair Play back this up. When venues install music recognition technology (similar to the music-identifying app Shazam) payments to artists are made with 90% accuracy, compared to the current UK-wide average of 36%. However, fewer than 7% of UK clubs have installed these systems: perhaps reflecting the razor-thin margins on which many operate, and the £20,000 a year that a medium-sized club will already be paying to bodies like PRS.Is London’s next superclub this warehouse by a sewage works in Barking?Read moreA cheaper and simpler solution – getting DJs to file accurate tracklists with performing rights societies – results in 95% payment accuracy. And yet Fair Play found that only 5% of DJs in the UK do this regularly (despite 42% claiming to when asked as part of a global survey earlier in 2025). Live acts receive royalties for playing their own songs, so it’s in their interests to fill in PRS paperwork after every gig. For the average DJ, playing a set of97% other people’s music, there’s rarely any benefit beyond altruism.“Most DJs just don’t care that much,” says Josh Doherty, who records as Posthuman and DJs under the I Love Acid banner. “It’s purely a question of laziness and ethics, particularly the new generation of DJs that don’t even have to buy records any more, so they’re not financially invested in that part of the industry.”And yet Doherty also underlines why reform is so desperately needed: when three of his tracks were played regularly by another DJ during their warm-up set for a stadium dance act’s UK tour, Doherty ended up with a cheque from PRS for thousands of pounds. 75% of independent musicians lose money releasing music, says Ethan Holben. “Imagine if they could just break even.”Explore more on these topicsDance musicClub cultureMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Similar checks were introduced for users of pornography sites in the UK this summer under Online Safety Act measures to prevent under-18s from seeing explicit content.Roblox compared its new system to school cohorts such as elementary, middle school and high school. It will be introduced first in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where children will be blocked from chatting with adults they do not know in real life from next month, and in the rest of the world in early January.Users will be placed into the following groups: under nine, nine to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, or 21 and over.Childrenwill be able to chat only with others in their age group and similar ones. For example, a child with an estimated age of 12 will be able to chat only with under-16s. Images and video used for the checks would not be stored, Roblox said.“We see it as a way for our users to have more trust in who the other people they are talking with are in these games,” said Matt Kaufman, Roblox’s chief safety officer. “And so we see it as a real opportunity to build confidence in the platform and build confidence amongst our users.”It comes amid allegations from lawyers for families alleging the “systemic predation of minors” on Roblox. Matt Dolman, a Florida lawyer who has filed 28 suits against the company, which boomed during the pandemic and has kept growing, said the “principal allegations concern the systemic predation of minors”.One of the latest cases he filed in the US district court of Nevada came from the family of a 13-year-old girl alleging Roblox “recklessly and deceptively” ran its business “in a way that led to the sexual exploitation of the plaintiff”.‘A man approached him’: parents describe their children’s Roblox problemsRead moreIt is alleged the girl, an avid Roblox user from Washoe county, Nevada, was targeted by a “dangerous child predator” who posed as a child, built a false emotional connection and manipulated the child into giving him her mobile phone number, to which he sent graphic messages. He then coerced her into sending explicit pictures and videos of herself.The claim alleges that “had [Roblox] taken any steps to screen users before allowing them on the apps [the girl] would not have been exposed to the large number of predators trolling the platform”, and that she would not have been harmed if age and identity verification had been in place.Two other US district court cases filed in recent days in the northern district of California concerned a seven-year-old girl in Philadelphia and a 12-year-old in Texas who were allegedly groomed on Roblox by predators to send explicit images of themselves.A spokesperson for Roblox said it was “deeply troubled by any incident that endangers any user” and that “we prioritise the safety of our community”.“This is why our policies are purposely stricter than those found on many other platforms,” they said. “We limit chat for younger users, don’t allow user-to-user image sharing, and have filters designed to block the sharing of personal information.“We also understand that no system is perfect and that is why we are constantly working to further improve our safety tools and platform restrictions to ensure parents can trust us to help keep their children safe online, launching 145 new initiatives this year alone.”Kaufman said: “It’s not enough just for one platform to hold a high standard for safety. We really hope the rest of the industry follows suit with some of the things that we’re doing, to really raise the protections for kids and teens online everywhere.”Beeban Kidron, the UK founder of the 5Rights Foundation, which campaigns for children’s digital rights, said: “It is time for gaming companies to put their responsibilities to children at the centre of their services.“Roblox’s announcement claims that what they are introducing will set best practice for the sector – a bold assertion from a company that has been slow to address predatory behaviour and has allowed adult strangers, and older children, easy access to millions of younger users. I hope they are right.”Explore more on these topicsRobloxInternet safetyChildrenGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

She was cast in the lead role in the musical Annie when she was 10, and remained in it for 18 months in New York. “I was a Broadway kid, so I’ve always dreamed about doing a show in the West End,” she said. “To get to do that in one of Shakespeares’s most famous plays under Rob’s direction with Noah will be such an exciting challenge. London theatre has this incredible energy, and I can’t wait to be a part of it.” Sink becomes the latest in a line of US stars who have made their West End debuts in recent years, including Sigourney Weaver (The Tempest), Brie Larson (Elektra) and Susan Sarandon (Mary Page Marlowe).Jupe, whose early films included the horror movie A Quiet Place, plays Hamlet in Chloé Zhao’s version of Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel Hamnetstarring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. He will make his stage debut as Romeo. “Theatre is something I’ve always been intrigued by. It seems like such a challenging and rewarding experience for an actor,” he said. “So I was very excited to hear about this project. The combination of Romeo, Rob and Sadie is an opportunity you simply cannot turn down.”Icke, whose version ofOedipuswas a hot ticket in the West End and is now on Broadway, said that Romeo and Juliet is “an explosive play, filled with heat and life, which confronts us with the fragility of our lives are and the momentousness of every last second”. He added: “This is one of the plays I’ve returned to again and again, and the opportunity to tackle it in London with two wonderful young actors is hugely exciting.” Icke directed Romeo and Julietin 2012for Headlong theatre company, and was acclaimed for his 2017 Almeida theatre production of Hamlet,starring Andrew Scott.‘It’s time for it to end’: the stars of Stranger Things open up about their final, epic seasonRead moreRomeo and Juliet will have a set and costumes designed by Hildegard Bechtler, one of Icke’s regular collaborators, and will run at the Harold Pinter theatre from 16 March to 6 June. By thenStranger Thingsfans will know the fate of Sink’s character, Max, who was left in a coma at the end of season four. The new season of Stranger Things begins later this month, followed by three episodes on Boxing Day and the finale on New Year’s Day.While that series was in post-production, Sink starred in the playJohn Proctor Is the Villain, a high-school riff on Arthur Miller’s The Crucible – a performance that earned her a Tony award nomination. John Proctor Is the Villain is transferring from Broadway to London’s Royal Court, with its cast yet to be announced, and will open within a week of Romeo and Juliet.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndRobert IckeRomeo and JulietStranger ThingsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

That made their collaboration, which will continue for three years, all the more timely, they said.The play, A Trial – after An Enemy of the People, is being staged by the celebrated Brazilian director Christiane Jatahy, who has previously worked closely with all three festivals. She said the play was informed by modern battles with fascism.In a joint press conference with the three festivals, Jatahy said Brazil had suffered very recently with the authoritarianism of former president Jair Bolsonaro, while theCop30climate talks in Belém in Amazonia had been the stage for environmental conflict, with Indigenous leaders fighting security guards for access to the talks.The Bolsonaro regime was a “horrible moment”, she said. “Fascism is everywhere now, and it’s this new fascism that used the economy and the instruments of democracy to stay in power.” This was “really understood” in Brazil, she said.Brazilians were “very connected” with the environmental and climate crises, she added. “So we really know about that. And we live this in the present moment, not in the past … how this destruction affected the very direct, personal life of the people.”She said the play featured the main protagonist of Ibsen’s play, Thomas Stockmann, who in Ibsen’s production had raised the alarm about contaminated water in his town’s spas, being put on trial.In her production, 11 audience members would act as the jury each night. While nearly all the dialogue was scripted, about 5% would be improvised, based on the actors’ interactions with the jury’s decisions.Moura, who will play Stockmann and helped write the script, became the first South American to win best actor at Cannes for the Secret Agent earlier this year, as well as winning a Golden Globe nomination for the Netflix series Narcos in 2016 and a Golden Eye award for career achievement at the Zurich film festival this year.TheEdinburgh international festivalis putting many of its tickets for The Trial on sale later this month, alongside tickets for three other major productions: the first performances in Edinburgh by theBerlin Philharmonic, regarded by many as the world’s pre-eminent orchestra, since 2006; a production of Verdi’s The Masked Ball; and a new San Francisco Ballet piece featuring an original score by the electronic music producerFloating Points.The Holland festival will be selling theirs from late November while tickets for Avignon’s performances will go on sale in coming months.Roy Luxford, the EIF’s creative director, said the bulk of next year’s festival tickets would go on sale in March as usual, but the festival needed to innovate by increasing choice. Some festivalgoers could appreciate the opportunity to plan further ahead while “these tickets would make great Christmas gifts”.Tiago Rodrigues, the director of the Festival d’Avignon, which focuses primarily on theatre and takes place in July, said their cooperation was “probably needed more than ever because of all the threats to both the economy of the arts, but also to the presence of arts in democracy”.Ibsen’s original play was prophetic, he added. “This piece deals also with ecology, with justice and with corruption, with the organisation of society. Let’s say that it’s a piece that is able to put in a nutshell many of the great issues of our day.”Despite their shared history, Emily Ansenk, the director of the Holland festival, which takes place in June, said the festivals had worked with one another in pairs before but never all three at once.“We are not afraid to put bold art and bold artists on stage, and I think that’s something where we can find each other very, very easily,” Ansenk said. “So the artistic conversation is very interesting also about our positioning. We are different from each other and we have different focus points, but in the end, we artistically really connect.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreEdinburghCop30ScotlandHenrik IbsenEuropeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

After a second appeal in 12 months, the Hundred Heroines: Women inPhotographyToday page was restored with no explanation or apology last week.The charity’s founder and former president of the Royal Photographic Society, Dr Del Barrett, said the decision had had a “devastating” effect on an organisation that relies on Facebook for attracting visitors.“AI technology picks up the word heroin without an ‘e’, so we get banned for breaching community guidelines,” she said. “Then no matter what you do, you can’t get hold of anyone and it really affects us because we rely on Facebook to get our local audience.”Founded in 2020, the charity has a physical space in Nailsworth, near Stroud, with about8,000 items in its collectionthat focuses on the work of female photographers and spans the history of the art form.In 2024, Meta increased its vigilance of groups related to drugs in light of the opioid crisis in the US, where80,000 people died after overdoses last year.Meta says buying and selling drugs is strictly prohibited on its platforms, and claims to have “robust measures” in place to detect and remove such content.In astatement on its website, Meta says: “We recognise the significance of the drug crisis and are committed to using our platforms to keep people safe … and strict enforcement of our community standards.”But when its software incorrectly identifies groups that breach its standards, the outcome can be Kafkaesque, according to users, with feedback forms often the only way to flag errors.Meta says AI tools are “central to [its] content review process”, adding that “AI can detect and remove content that goes against our community standards before anyone reports it”.Sometimes the technology flags content for its “human review teams”, although Barrett said when Hundred Heroines complained they had no human interaction.“We thought, ‘should we change our name?’ But why should we? Why have we got to mess with our brand just because of Facebook?”,said Barrett, who estimates that about 75% of Hundred Heroines’ visitors come via Facebook.She added: “It sort of verges on scary and laughable. You think these bots are running the world and they can’t tell the difference between a woman and an opioid. Heaven help us.”Earlier this year Meta was heavily criticised over the mass banning or suspension of accounts on Facebook and Instagram.Users blamed its AI moderation tools for the erroneous bans, but while the tech company acknowledged a “technical error” affecting Facebook Groups, it denied an increase in incorrect enforcement of its rules across its platforms.Meta said it was fixing the issue that emerged in the summer after groups, including one that shared memes about bugs, were allegedly told they did not follow standards on “dangerous organisations or individuals”.Meta has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyFacebookMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Eminem sues Australian company Swim Shady for trademark infringementEminem claims consumers may mistakenly think he is linked to the Sydney beach brand – but Australia is no stranger to lawsuits from US rappersSian CainMon 17 Nov 2025 23.30 ESTLast modified on Tue 18 Nov 2025 15.29 ESTShareEminem has launched legal action against the Australian beach brand Swim Shady, alleging its name is too close to that of his trademarked alter ego, Slim Shady.The 53-year-old rapper, real name Marshall B Mathers III,filed a petitionto cancel Swim Shady’s US trademark days after it was successfully granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in September.Eminem’s petition to USPTO argues Swim Shady’s name could cause confusion and that it falsely suggests he has links to the Sydney-based company, which sells umbrellas for sun protection, swim bags, towels and shorts.The rapper is also claiming his trademark in Australia has been infringed by Swim Shady, which launched as a business in Australia in December last year.Eminem’s legal team lodged their opposition to the company’s trademark in Australia in October 2024.Swim Shady’s owner Jeremy Scott confirmed the legal action to Guardian Australia and said that the company will fight the claims.“Swim Shady is a grassroots Australian company that was born … to protect people from the harsh Australian sun,” Scott said in a joint statement with his partner, Elizabeth Afrakoff.Eminem and Debbie Mathers showed that hip-hop is the genre where men come to terms with their mothers | Thomas HobbsRead more“We will defend our valuable intellectual property.“Given the matters are before the court, we do not propose to say any more at this time.”Before Swim Shady launched, Eminem held trademarks in Australia on Shady and Shady Limited but not Slim Shady. He subsequently filed a trademark for Slim Shady in Australia in January 2025.Swim Shady has since filed non-use applications against Eminem’s Shady and Shady Limited trademarks in Australia, arguing they have not been consistently used.Eminemis also currently fighting the hosts of the Reasonably Shady podcast, Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon, alleging trademark infringement in a case that has been going since 2023.He successfully won NZ$600,000 (then AU$535,000/£315,000) in 2017after New Zealand’s high court ruled the ruling National party infringed the rapper’s copyright in a 2014 election campaign advertisement that used strains of his hit Lose Yourself.Eminem is not the first rapper to enter a trademark fight with an Australian business. In 2022 Kanye West launched legal action against Melbourne burger shop College Dropout Burgers but the case wasthrown out by Australia’s federal court in 2023 after the rapper and his legal team failed to turn up.And in 2019,Jay-Z lodged a lawsuitagainst Australian business The Little Homie, claiming it had breached his intellectual property with a picture book titled AB to Jay-Z. An advertisement for AB to Jay-Z read: “If you’re having alphabet problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but my ABC’s ain’t one!”The case was settled after mediation, with Little Homie agreeing to no longer use Jay-Z’s name or lyrics.The Guardian has contacted Eminem’s lawyers for comment.Explore more on these topicsEminemMelbournenewsShareReuse this content"

According to one historian, during the years 1617 to 1625, in Denmarka “witch” was burned every five days. The first time this happens in Danish author Olga Ravn’s fourth novel, the condemned woman is “tied to the ladder, and the ladder pushed into the bonfire”. Her daughter watches as she falls, her eye “so strangely orange from within. And then in the heat it explodes.”The child is watched, in turn, by a wax doll who sees everything: everything in this scene, and everything everywhere, through all space and all the time since it was fashioned. It sees the worms burrowing through the soil in which it is buried; the streets of the world in which it was made. It inhabits the bodies that walked those streets: “And I was in the king’s ear, and I was in the king’s mouth, and I was in the king’s loose tooth and in the quicksilver of his liver, and did hear.”On a basic level, the wax child is a useful narrative device. But it also complicates everything. The temptation, from the distance of the 21st century, is to assume charges against so-called witches to be baseless. But in this case, a well-known one in Denmark, the charges included the making of wax children – and Ravn begins with Christenze Krukow, a real Danish noblewoman who wasaccused of witchcraft three timesduring her lifetime, making this wax baby.In the 17th century magic was as much a part of the warp and weft of life as Christianity, if more secret. Ravn intersperses her narrative with spells taken directly from “black books” and grimoires. They are strange, but only really in the way that the deep beliefs of another time and place are strange; it is striking how often they are not about causing harm, but warding it off: attempts to neutralise anger, divine if an ill person might live or die, or will others to be kind.And then there are the everyday magics, which to the authorities were perhaps most threatening of all: of women working together, gutting fish, carding wool; women protecting each other, trying to intervene when one of them, Elisabeth, is beaten by her husband. The magic of friends, of laughter and dancing and love and a shared glass of wine. “Will you come with us to the Lucia fest, Elisabeth? Magic is possible. Laughter is possible. There is a way out, Elisabeth, there is a way out …” It isn’t entirely innocent, of course, and not all of it is kind. Lucia fest happens on a midwinter nightwhen dark spirits were said to roam; the wax child is sharp with nail parings and hair and scraps of metal.There is an argument that this type of feminine group magic is a form of psychological release in a world where this was hard to come by; it certainly stands in stark contrast to the public male narrative according to which the women are tried. “They consulted their books of demonology, and there read:The woman is more easily tempted by Satan, for she is weaker than the man in body and soul … When a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil…” Christenze and her friends don’t stand a chance.At its best The Wax Child is richly evocative, beautiful, creepy and visceral. At other times, there’s a bit too much research just out of sightOn the surface, Ravn’s three novels translated into English so far are quite different; The Wax Child was preceded by the brilliant International Booker-shortlistedThe Employees, set on a 22nd-century spaceship, andMy Work, a contemporary autofiction about motherhood that shares much in preoccupation and tone with Rachel Cusk. But all are novels of ideas – which is not the same as being abstract: one of Ravn’s great strengths is her harnessing of the close quotidian (breastfeeding, fish gutting) to existential vastnesses, often in the same sentence. So The Employees aimed to think through what Earth means to us; what is it to be human, what is love, what is worth living for? My Work enacted the fundamental self-estrangement, for many women, of becoming a mother; how a mother is made in the act of birth, and how a writer can be made in the act of writing about birth. In The Wax Child we see how a so-called witch is made along with a wax baby, or substitute child; how an act of witness can also be an act of creation.Ravn began as a poet, and even in English this lineage is clear. Her work asserts that knowledge inheres in objects, comprehension through smell and taste and blood and guts; through metaphor. “How do I know this?” demands the wax child, at one point. “It is like a gash in me to know it.”At times this physical knowledge begins to achieve a kind of all-pervading, shifting synaesthesia. “I see the king with the smell of the eye,” says the wax child. “Listening, I hear time as a clearing among trees.” The novel is full of things, and the power of things; it could be said that spells work by harnessing this power. Accusations of devilment cite the misuse of things: “Wax, thread, scissors, coin, nails, hair, the foreheads of the dead …”At its best The Wax Child is richly evocative, beautiful, creepy and visceral. “It is the darkest of times, December. From the curvature of the earth, minutes run like droplets from the day.” At other times, there’s a bit too much research just out of sight; the novel can feel elliptical, even baffling. One misses the space, the clarity and freedom of The Employees. But maybe that’s the thing about weaving spells. About poetry, too: demand it makes neat sense, and you begin to have too much in common with the witch-hunters.The Wax Child by Olga Ravn, translated by Martin Aitken, is published by Viking (£14.99).

The scrotum in question belongs to a man fleeing unclothed through the woods from an unseen assailant, together with an equally naked female companion who also comes swiftly to a sticky end. As opening salvoes go, it hits the spot, as it were.Then the film proper begins. A couple arrive at a bougie rental home only to find themselves facing the ultimate millennial nightmare: you’ve shelled out your hand-earned cash on a place for the weekend but find another couple have also booked it. This is the problem of listings on multiple platforms! Or is something more sinister going on? (If the ballsack shish kebab didn’t tip you off, another clue lies in the fact that the movie is called Bone Lake, not Airbnb Clash.) Imagine the social boundary-pushing ofrecent horror Speak No Evilwith characters from White Lotus season 2 using the set-up fromBarbarian, and you’ll have a pretty good idea of how much fun this will all prove to be.It isn’t only for committed horror fans: the witty dialogue and likable performances would make Bone Lake a highly watchable comic thriller even if there weren’t any nasty elements. The film-making is properly zesty, whether we’re watching a couple humping lustily on a bearskin rug or fleeing as best they can from the business end of a kitchen knife. The casting helps immensely: the Florence Pugh-esque Maddie Hasson is sympathetic without being bland, while Alex Roe channels a splendid Dave Franco crossed with Matthew Lillard energy that is perfect for the character. It always feels as if the people making this movie are having fun, and while that’s never a guarantee that the audience will too, it’s certainly the case here.Bone Lake is on digital platforms from 24 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersHorror filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now imagine the spirit of that gift transformed into a holiday-themed British feature film, and you’ll be close to approximating the dull drippiness that is 3 Wishes for Christmas. It’s got all the personality of a supermarket gift voucher. The only saving grace is that lead actor Christine During is sufficiently competent to make the insipid, sub-large language model dialogue sound moderately credible. Sadly, the same can’t be said for the rest of the cast, who seem to have been thrown to the wolves by incompetent direction and find themselves sometimes literally thrashing around, as if being torn limb from limb.During plays Tessa, who writes an agony column for a magazine, although that bit of biography barely figures – which is quite typical of the script, a compilation of pointless plot points and stale tropes stolen from other Christmas-themed movies and literature. Thus Tessa splits up with her boring finance-bro boyfriend in a not early enough scene, decides to spend the holiday with her insufferably pert best friend Fiona (Katie Sheridan), and has a meet-cute en route with a good-looking but rude guy who turns out to be Fiona’s brother Sam (Jacob Anderton). Naturally they will fall in love, quarrel again and then … well, no spoilers. But it is a romcom.One could list all the film’s shortcomings, but that would be like pulling wings off a fairly harmless moth. It feels as if it’s been designed for romance-loving pre-adolescents who aren’t quite old enough to watch the Bridget Jones movies, and while there are plenty of better things you could show such a demographic, this is at least only boring and not necessarily offensive.● 3 Wishes for Christmas is in UK cinemas from 21 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsChristmasComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the same time, it feels like a weird dodge into borderline-abstraction and unknowable mystery that drains all the realism away, making this a mannered film-making exercise. But there’s no denying the level of craft on show, or the original way Erkman throws together practitioners of highfalutin art-world discourse and skeevy low-lifes, with bloody results. In generic terms, it definitely feels of a piece with other recent highbrow-meets-lowbrow scare-’em-ups, the kind of grad-school horror you might see in the queer-eyedI Saw the TV Glow, David Lowery’s stripped-downA Ghost Story,or director Ari Aster’sHereditary. In other words: interesting for sure, but perhaps a bit pretentious for hardcore gorehounds.In A Desert, we first meet photographer Alex (Kai Lennox) as he drives around the desiccated terrain ofCalifornia’s Yucca Valley, listening to smooth contemporary jazz on his fancy SUV’s sound system and pulling over to take pictures of abandoned buildings. He shoots his images on a fancy 8x10 inch apparatus that uses photographic plates that need to be exposed for 10 second intervals. His subjects include disused cinemas and the ghost town remains of abandoned military bases – although in a voicemail he leaves for his wife Sam (Sarah Lind) he suggests he might shift over into portraits for a while. Clearly, he’s not especially interested in the people who live here, although when the trailer-trash-style couple (Zachary Ray Sherman and Ashley Smith) in the motel room next door come a-knocking, offering turpentine-tasting hooch and a chance to party, Alex is too polite/weak to resist.Not long after a blur of lapdance moves and lurid colours, all set to EDM, the film creates a caesura much like another well-known horror film that to name would spoil the main twist. Suffice it to say, after that things roll on and we follow different protagonists, this time Alex’s wife Sam and private detective Harold (David Yow) who find themselves drifting down the same lost highways of the valley.Erkman, a sometime cinematographer himself, and director of photography Jay Keitel really nail the artbook view of the economically depressed west, a style that’s like the Americana ofJoel Meyerowitzmeeting the ruination porn ofYves Marchand and Romain Meffre. We are no doubt meant to infer that Alex and other visitors only see the exploitable aesthetics of area, photogenically surrendering to the forces of nature, and are blind to the real human evil that exists there – out in plain sight as the last shot confirms. It’s perhaps not a very profound message, but the visual and editing styles are swoony and most bewitching.A Desert is on digital platforms from 24 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersCaliforniaWest CoastreviewsShareReuse this content"

A jungle floats in the darkness on three big screens. Each depicts a riot of giant ferns, vine-tangled tree-trunks and sun-struck foliage in layered, dank profusion. With their jumbles of weathered rock, mossy wetness and tropical vegetation, you can lose yourself in these scenes. But, as I look, mist wafts over a patch of dense greenery as if someone out-of-shot were making with the plant spray.I’m reminded of those unconvincing jungles in movies and on TV, where the plants have been trucked-in from some garden centre warehouse and arranged on set. Only the camera angles and clever editing stop us from recognising the artifice of it all. In the foreground on one of the screens, you can see rivulets crossing what appears to be a floor of waterproof matting. A small puddle is also forming at my feet. Either the film is leaking, though that seems unlikely, or water is dripping from the ceiling. Through the day, I’m told, the water slowly inundates the sheets of metal that cover portions of the floor, but I arrived too early for the flood.View image in fullscreenAs you watch, the jungle deconstructs … The Story of Fixity.Photograph: Noémie Goudal/ArtangelNoémie Goudal’sThe Story of Fixityis a complex rumination on ecosystems and water’s fundamental role. Her work involves biology and geology, scientific research and what she calls “fixed points” regarding distances and depths and human perception. I don’t understand the half of it and I’m not sure it matters. In a soundscape devised by French electronic artist and DJ Chloé Thévenin, the air is alive with insect noise and chirrupings, animal cries and calls, devolving into electronic sizzle, percussive beats and hollow echoes.Naturalism is not a preoccupation in Goudal’s art. She gives us an illusion and then she takes it away again, transforms it and turns it into something else. On screen, the jungle is fading into something that feels like a green-tinted duo-tone illustration in an old encyclopedia, or a collage of engravings thrown together in some multilayered rendition of incomprehensible fertility and chaos. This too falters, as if the ink in the images were running, or turning into watercolour that slowly runs and curdles as it dissolves.Each screen becomes a pigmented abstraction. A projected film of grey and ochre pigments, iron-rich reds and tangy yellows slowly slide down the screens. As you watch, the jungle deconstructs. The screens themselves aren’t flat, but are made from a number of relief planes whose cut edges correspond, more or less, to the shapes of the foliage and rocks projected on to them. As the natural colour slowly bleaches out of the images, the cut edges of these layered screens become more apparent.View image in fullscreenConstant flux of creation and destruction … The Story of Fixity.Photograph: Noémie Goudal/ArtangelInevitably, I think of painting, of the innumerable artists who have turned landscape into abstractions of one sort or another. Goudal’s studio-bound jungles are all artifice, and she’s only a painter in an accidental sense. Less a jungly free-for-all mode of free abstraction than a thoroughgoing dissolution of an image, there’s pleasure in seeing Goudal’s illusory world washed away. But her use of filmed dyes and pigments, and real liquid, watery paint, dripping and puddling over the floor is a bit too theatrical for its own good.Goudal’s mix of photography and film, the real and the illusory, reveals its technical complexities even as it dissolves and deconstructs itself, over and over again in 15-minute cycles. This constant flux of creation and destruction leaves me none the wiser about the processes that support life on Earth, or about how we perceive the natural world. Instead it is a sophisticated theatre, awash in its own complications. I don’t mind the immersive, but I’m not going for a swim.The Story of Fixity is an ongoing Artangel commission at Borough Yards, LondonExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtInstallationDigital artreviewsShareReuse this content"

Such is the case with De Alde Feanen, in Friesland. One of the most peaceful national parks in the Netherlands, this 4,000-hectare wetland slows down naturally after the summer season. Its waterways shrug off their summer flocks of kayakers, paddleboarders, boat trippers and terrace diners. Museums and galleries close. The local tourist office winds down. Even the park’s population of nesting storks fly south.Map showing position of De Alde Feanen in northern part of the NetherlandsA 20-minute drive south-east of Leeuwarden, in the country’s north-east, the lakes, ponds, ditches and canals of “The Old Fens” are the remains of the peat-cutting that began there in the middle ages. Now awash with reeds, rushes and sedges, its watery habitats are richly biodiverse, home to more than 100 bird species as well as otters, pine martens, roe deer and dragonflies. Hay meadows and wetland forest add marsh thistle, reed orchids, alders and willows to the list. Ribboned with well-marked hiking and cycling trails, the proximity to nature draws spring and summer tourists but treasures can be found there in autumn and winter too; among them thousands of ducks and geese, and some of the starriest skies in the Netherlands.In search of a place to be rather than do, my son and I book a simple cabin, De Ooievaar (“the Stork”), with a plan to walk, cycle, read and sleep. Upcycled from an old barn during the pandemic by owner Jurjen Veldboom, the cabin’s galley kitchen and wooden sleeping platforms give it the cosy feel of a boat but it’s the picture window in its living room that sells it to us. With a sofa to one side and a wood burner on the other, it’s the perfect winter roost: a place to sit and sketch, or watch deer bouncing through the alders.View image in fullscreenWooden heart … De Ooievaar cabin.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenTo get our bearings we start with a gentle walk, spotting a white heron almost as soon as we step outside. A skein of geese skim the sky above us as we wander along a blustery 15-minute track through the reeds to the park’s gateway village, Earnewâld. Winding between its doll’s house-like buildings to thePrincenhof Hotel, we eat bowls of salty fish soup while watching the soporific ebb and flow of small cargo boats.When we arrived, Jurjen told us that canny marketeers have a new verb for winter holidaying in Friesland:opfriezenis a play on words that means embracing the cold (with the help of a cosy hot tub or sauna) in Friesland. Back at the cabin, we give it a go, slipping into the site’s sauna at dusk and listening to the soothing ticking of the heater’s timer, cocooned in its warm, timber embrace. What follows is even more uplifting, though: opening the door into the dark Friesland night, a huge gibbous moon is glowing above us, the skeins of geese replaced by stars and the cabin’s twinkling lights giving it the look of a giant gingerbread house.Opening the door into the dark Friesland night, a huge  moon is glowing above us, the skeins of geese replaced by starsThe following morning we hire two e-bikes fromHollemain Earnewâld (€25pp a day), where owner Rikele Hollema meets us with a map for a gentle 50km route looping through the eastern corner of the park and then out to the villages and forests around Beetsterzwaag.Cycling out along little paths crunchy with seashells is like pedalling through one ofJan Hendrik Weissenbruch’s paintings. Skirting low fields where the horizon is broken only by the odd birch tree or farmhouse, there’s more sky than land, and it’s filled with clouds that look like balls of scrunched-up paper, soft grey shadows tucked into creases in the white. Cycling along these flat, empty paths, hopping on and off little foot and bike ferries to cross bridge-less stretches of water, is a meditative experience. A feeling that’s later heightened when the sun emerges and we dip into forests where the light is sieved through golden beech leaves.Beyond the palatial houses of Beetsterzwaag, in Olterterp we stop atDe Witte Huisfor lunch – fat chips and bowls of mustard soup hiding slivers of sausage. It’s just the fuel we need for the long ride back along the windy polders, catching the whimsical sight along the way of three cows sailing past on a ferry, and two swans flying alongside us, their white plumage glowing against the rose gold of the rushes.View image in fullscreenWater wheel … Rhiannon’s son with his rented e-bike on a ferry.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThat evening, with Jurjen’s help, I track down Jannie Slot, project coordinator for a new mindfulness walking trail launched in the park this summer. Designed to get visitors offscreen, slowing down and reconnecting with their surroundings, those who want to try it have to borrow a physical copy of the guide and then follow its prompts as they walk the 5km route. She tells me of the tricky balance between welcoming visitors and protecting the park but believes that if people can connect with nature, they will love it and want to protect it.Cycling along these flat, empty paths, hopping on and off little foot and bike ferries to cross bridge-less stretches of water, it’s a meditative experienceFor now the guide is only available in Dutch or German but there are plans to produce an English version. Trying my best with rusty German, I leave my son sleeping and head out into the park at dawn the next day to try it out. The path leads through the reeds and forest paths behind our cabin and, as I walk, I follow the guide’s instructions to listen to the sound of the wind through the reeds. The ground is wet from overnight rain and the air is charged with the calls, rattles, clicks and chitter of blackbirds, goldcrests, reed buntings, wigeon and geese. At various points, I’m encouraged to do some gentle yoga, standing in poses inspired by birds or trees, or to look more deeply at the landscape. It’s not hard this morning. The rising sun is suspended in the ditches around me, coating the water with an ethereal bronze glow.View image in fullscreenLake placid … De Alde Feanen national park.Photograph: Rhiannon BattenThe route leads to an observation tower and when I reach the top, it feels as if I’m at the very soul of the national park, a million shades of sugary golden brown spilling out around me. Towns glimmer on the horizon and a distant road rumbles, but here the hush is broken only by two geese honking away at eye level, and the reflective glint of a nearby windmill.Later, over coffee, I read that one of the park’s key plants is frogbit. In summer it floats above the water but in winter it retracts below, freezing until the spring, when it re-emerges in search of sunlight. The guide tells me: “It’s also very important, of course, for humans to slow down, take a breath, reflect and rest.” But De Alde Feanen has already taught me that.Transport from London to Amsterdam was providedEurostar, which is launching afifth direct weekday service on 15 December; advance return from £78pp. Onward travel to Earnewald by train and bus.

How can I cook to please us both?Victoria,by email“I have three words for you, Victoria,” says Anna Ansari, author ofSilk Roads, who grew up in a predominantly vegetarian household: “Di si xian.” Typical of northern China, this stir-fry of aubergine, potato and peppers (otherwise known as the “three treasures”) is laced with soy, Shoaxing wine, white pepper, sugar, cornflour and, in Ansari’s case,doubanjiang. She also adds tofu (the fourth treasure, if you will) for “a rounded, one-pot/wok dinner” to eat with steamed rice. “It reminds me of being a teenager in Beijing, far from home and in need of warmth and comfort,” she says, and we could all do with some of that right now. “It’s also cheap as proverbial chips, not to mention quick to make, and it will knock both your socks off. Promise.”Mushrooms could also pave the way to harmonious dining. “Surely they’re the closest thing to a natural meat substitute,” says Zak Hitchman, chef/owner ofOtherin Bristol. He’d be inclined to layer them up in a lasagne: “Slice a load of mixed mushrooms [chestnut, shiitake, oyster], then saute them in oil and butter with some seasoning.” Next, fry onion, garlic, celery, diced carrot, maybe some rosemary or thyme, until softened, then return the cooked mushrooms to the pot with some tinned tomatoes and tomato puree. “You could bulk it out with tinned lentils,” he says, but either way be sure to include a splash of soy and some miso for “that meaty flavour”, plus any vinegar you have knocking around “for balance”. Cook slowly until reduced, then layer between driedlasagnesheets. “Top that with bechamel [or simply dollop on some mascarpone] and lots of grated parmesan [a vegetarian one, if need be]. Drizzle with olive oil and bake until the pasta is soft, the sauce bubbling and the top golden.”Rob Howell, chef/patron ofRoot, which recently opened in Bath, also suggests smoothing relations with mushrooms: “Roast a load of them with warming spices [cumin, coriander, allspice] and oil in a hot oven, then skewer for akebabvibe.” Grill and brush with molasses or “anything a bit soy, a bit sweet, a bit umami”, and serve with flatbread, tahini yoghurt, herbs and pickled red cabbage.We all know that the key to any healthy relationship is compromise, so dinners that welcome a bit of meat or fish plonked alongside are also good to have in your back pocket. You could, Howell suggests, combine butter beans and roast cauliflower puree “for a take on cauliflower cheese”, or cook borlotti beans with veg, blend and top with grilled onions, hazelnut salsa and chilli. Risottos also fall into this happy camp, with pumpkin/squash roasted, mashed and stirred through arborio rice topping Hitchman’s list. Serve sprinkled with roast chestnuts and pumpkin seeds, plus a chicken thigh or pork chop for the boyfriend.Otherwise, Ansari would be inclined to do a dumpling date: “Roll out the dough, stuff the dumplings – I’m into ground lamb and onion, and mushroom and tofu – grab a drink while they steam, then smother them in browned butter.” There is one final option, Ansari says: “Dump the guy?” Although, surely everyone loves a dumpling, so maybe give those a go first.Got a culinary dilemma?

Food assistant: Emma Cantlay.FoodJosé Pizarro’s recipe for braised lamb and kale cazuela with beansThis warming casserole is melt-in-your-mouth tender, and comes with velvety white beans to soak up the rich meaty juicesJosé PizarroTue 18 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareMy mum, Isabel, has always cooked slowly. Life on the family farm was busy, so a pot of lamb would often be bubbling away while she worked and, by the time we all sat down for lunch, the whole house smelled incredible. November takes me straight back there. It is the month for food that warms you, dishes made to sit in the centre of the table and to bring everyone close.Lambshoulder loves a slow cook, turning soft and rich, especially when cooked withalubias blancas(white beans) to soak up the sauce, while a good splash of oloroso gives it a deeper, rounder flavour than any red wine ever could.Braised lamb and kale cazuela with white beans(alubias blancas)Prep15 minCook3 hr 20 minServes64 tbsp olive oilSalt and black pepper1.2kg lamb shoulder, cut into chunks1 large onion, peeled and finely sliced5 garlic cloves, unpeeled but bashed open2 tsp smoked sweet pimentón1 small handful fresh thyme and oregano leaves200ml oloroso400g tin chopped tomatoes500ml good chicken stock1 tbsp plain flour2400g tins butter beans, drained and rinsed250g curly kale, tough stems removed and discardedHeat the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2.Put a tablespoon of the olive oil in a large casserole on a medium heat. Season the lamb, then fry it in batches until nicely browned all over, adding more oil as necessary (you’ll probably need another two tablespoons’ worth). As each batch of meat is browned, scoop it into a large bowl.Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same casserole and fry the onion, stirring to lift all the gnarly brown bits off the base and sides of the pan, for about five minutes, until softened. Add the garlic, pimentón and herb leaves, stir for a minute, until fragrant, then pour in the sherry and leave to bubble away for a minute or two.Return the meat to the pan, then tip in the tomatoes and stock, and season with black pepper and some more salt. Cover the pot, bring the mix to a boil, then transfer the pot to the oven and leave to cook for two and a half hours, until the meat is lovely and tender.Take the pot out of the oven and leave to stand for five or so minutes, until the fat rises to the surface. Scoop this out with a spoon (you don’t have to get it all). Blend about a tablespoon of the fat with the flour (discard the rest), then add this paste to the lamb mix and stir it in well. Put the pan on a low heat and leave to bubble gently for about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in the beans and leave to bubble gently and warm through.Meanwhile, blanch the kale in a large pan of salted boiling water for about three minutes, until tender, then drain and roughly chop. Stir the kale into the lamb mix, then serve hot with good crusty bread to mop up all those juices.Explore more on these topicsFoodSpanish food and drinkLambMeatMain courseVegetablesWinter food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
