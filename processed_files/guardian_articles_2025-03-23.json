Rather than move closer to Europe and stand together we’re allowing ourselves to be ripped off.”He said it was “an abject surrender” even before the government chooses tax cuts for big US tech and austerity for the most vulnerable, adding: “Frankly, it’s unacceptable.”In addition, Chi Onwurah, the technology committee chair, warned on Sunday that concerns about the safety of artificial intelligence wereat risk of being ignored by ministers, as the government delayed regulating the industry to curry favour with Trump.The Liberal Democrats led opposition criticism of the tax cut idea, withEd Davey, the party’s leader, telling his spring conference: “Now Labour’s even talking about scrapping Britain’s tax on social media giants. Well, appeasement never works with bullies, and it doesn’t work with Trump. And you can see that he’s already put his tariffs on British steel.”Davey suggested the UK should respond to the threat of steel tariffs from 2 April with tariffs on the Tesla electric car company, which is part-owned by Musk.View image in fullscreenDavey at the Liberal Democrats spring conference in Harrogate on Sunday.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAHe said Starmer’s approach to Trump appeared to be “let’s be nice to him and hope he won’t hurt us”.In an interview this weekend, Starmer told the New York Times thathe personally “likes and respects”Donald Trumpand understood what he was trying to achieve. “President Trump has a point when he says there needs to be a greater burden borne by European countries for the collective self-defence of Europe,” he said.The spending review is likely to focus on higher defence expenditure, paid for through cuts to international aid, and Reeves said on Sunday that the backdrop to her economic plans and lower than expected growth is that the “world has changed”. The UK is planning three days of intensive military preparations to support a possible ceasefire in Ukraine before a meeting of the so-called coalition of the willing countries in Paris on Thursday.Starmer told the New York Times that it was a critical moment for the UK and it would not be right to pick either Europe or the US to side with. “Churchill didn’t do it. Attlee didn’t do it. It’d be a big mistake, in my view, to choose now,” he said.At the same time, Trump’s special envoy said this weekend that Starmer’s plan for a “coalition of the willing” to support a ceasefire in Ukraine was just a “posture and a pose”.Steve Witkoff, who is special envoy to the Middle East but also playing a role in Ukraine talks, said the idea was based on a “simplistic” notion of the UK prime minister and other European leaders thinking: “We have all got to be like Winston Churchill.” Witkoff also praised Vladimir Putin, saying he liked the Russian president and did not “regard Putin as a bad guy”.Talks have resumed among officials in Saudi Arabia between the US, Russia and Ukraine, with higher level discussions to start on Monday. Trump is said to be seeking a deal by Easter.No 10 had no comment on Witkoff’s remarks. But Reeves told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that she was “not put off by that”.“We will need to make sure that if there is a ceasefire it can be enforced, and that’s what our prime minister, along with allies around the world, is trying to secure, and of course the US has got to be an important part of that,” she said. “But it is right that European countries, including the UK, [are] upping defence expenditure because in this uncertain world our national security, our domestic security, is incredibly important for so many things, including a strong economy.”The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has been talking to trade counterparts in Washington this week. On the possibility of a cut to the digital services tax, a Treasury spokesperson said: “All taxes are kept under review and the 2025 review of the digital services tax has been planned since it was implemented in 2020 – so it would be wrong to imply any intention to repeal the tax from this.”A Labour source said the Lib Dems “were living on another planet and not credible” by opposing the national insurance rise on employers to fund the NHS and wanted more money for public services while opposing inheritance tax changes for rich landowners.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyTax and spendingKeir StarmerLiberal DemocratsDonald TrumpRachel ReevesSpring statement 2025newsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said its attack followed extensive intelligence and used precise munitions to minimise harm at the site.Hamas said a member of its political office, Ismail Barhoum, had been killed.‘There was just wave after wave’: Gaza doctors recount horror of the last weekRead moreIsrael’s defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the target was Barhoum. The military did not name the target, which it described only as “a key terrorist” in Hamas.Hamas’s al-Aqsa TV said Barhoum was being treated at the hospital for wounds sustained in a previous attack. Israel says Hamas systematically embeds personnel in hospitals, schools and shelters, which the group denies.Video on social media showed a fire blazing on the third storey of what appeared to be the hospital. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.After two months of relative calm in the war, Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Hamas.Another leader in Hamas, Salah al-Bardaweel, was killed in a separate strike in Khan Younis, Hamas said earlier. The Israeli military confirmed it had killed Bardaweel on Saturday.Both Bardaweel and Barhoum were members of the 19-member Hamas decision-making body, the political office, 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.Explosions echoed throughout the north, central and southern Gaza Strip early on Sunday, as Israeli planes hit targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attacks that began earlier in the week.Signalling it could escalate its actions further, the Israeli military said on Sunday one of its divisions that had operated in Lebanon, where Israel had fought Hamas’s Iranian-backed ally, Hezbollah, was preparing for possible action in Gaza.It distributed video of tanks unloaded in a field and a caption that read: “Preparations of the 36th Division for Operations in the Gaza Strip.”At least 45 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah and Khan Younis so far on Sunday, Gaza health authorities said.Palestinian officials on Sunday put the death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict at more than 50,000.The Israeli military said it did its best to reduce harm to civilians and questioned the death toll provided by health authorities in the Hamas-run territory.Most of the dead in Gaza have been civilians, according to health officials. Israel said they included about 20,000 fighters. Hamas does not disclose casualty figures.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the aim of the war was to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. The ambition of the new campaign was to force the group to give up remaining hostages, he said on Tuesday.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke to Netanyahu to “emphasise US support for Israel”, a state department spokesperson said. They discussed Israel’s continuing military operations in Gaza, efforts to bring hostages home and US strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, the spokesperson added.Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.“Israel’s military offensive has caused an appalling loss of life,” said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. “As long as this war continues, both sides lose.”Kallas added Israel must respect civilian lives and that threats to annex parts of Gaza were unacceptable.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

She said this would also result in about 10,000 job losses in the civil service, although this was not a target.As she prepares to give her spring statement on Wednesday, Reeves is under pressure to balance the books in line with her fiscal rules, meaning some departments are in line for spending cuts to avoid more tax rises or higher borrowing.But the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) warned her that there would be consequences for public services after 15 years of underfunding by the Tories.Fran Heathcote, the general secretary of the PCS, said: “You hear that every day from the public, that they wait too long on the phone when they try to make tax payments, jobseekers rushed through the system in just 10 minutes because there aren’t enough staff to see them, victims of crime waiting until 2027 to have their cases heard in the courts as well as the backlog in the asylum system which results in additional hotel costs.“The impact of making cuts will not only disadvantage our members but the public we serve and the services they rely on. We’ve heard this before under Gordon Brown when cuts were made to backroom staff and [the] consequences of that were chaos.”The government should have learned its lesson that “you can’t cut your way to growth”, Heathcote added.Reeves issued a defence of her economic plans on Sunday, saying her strategy was aimed at growth. The economy grew by just 0.1% in January, and the Office for Budget Responsibility is believed to have downgraded its forecasts to 1% for the year.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves, left, on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/ReutersThe chancellor said she was “not satisfied with the numbers that we see at the moment”, but told Sky News: “It’s not possible within just a few months to reverse more than a decade of economic stagnation, but we are making the changes necessary to get Britain building again, to bring money into the economy.”She said she would stick to her fiscal rules and not raise further taxes, but said there would be cuts within central government to help her stick to her spending limits.In advance of the spring budget, the government said it would allocate £4.8bn to roads and highways for the year 2025-26 and put a new requirement on English councils to show how many potholes they were filling before giving them access to their full funds. It said £1.6bn would be available for pothole funding, with up to 25% withheld from local authorities if they failed to report annually on how many potholes were mended.The spending review has already been overshadowed by where cuts are due to fall within the government. Although overall spending will increase each year, with big rises for defence and the NHS, other departments have been asked to model cuts of up to 11%.With maintaining security likely to be the big theme of the spring statement, Reeves told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: “The world has changed and that is having an impact on growth; you can see that in every country … but do we need to go further and faster in increasing growth? Yes, we do.”How did it come to this? Labour’s journey from landslide victory to ‘deep unhappiness’Read moreReeves and Keir Starmer are also facing the prospect of aLabourrebellion over plans to reduce welfare costs by £5bn, with unhappiness on the backbenches and also among unions about the proposed spending cuts.Asked about a grim forecast from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that all UK families would be worse off by 2030, with the poor bearing the brunt, Reeves disputed the findings and said living standards would rise.She told Sky News’ Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: “I reject that and the Office for Budget Responsibility will set out their forecast this week.“Living standards in the last parliament were the worst ever on record. I’m confident that we will see living standards increase during the course of this parliament. What we’ve already seen in these last few months of the Labour government is a sustained increase in living standards.”Reeves was also optimistic about the prospect of avoiding US tariffs from the Trump administration, saying she was confident in the ability of the UK’s trade negotiators to strike a deal.The chancellor was also pressed over having accepted free tickets to a Sabrina Carpenter concert with a family member, despite the row over Starmer’s acceptance of “freebies” last year.She said it had not been possible to pay for the tickets offered as hospitality and she had accepted them because her security needs made it difficult to sit in general seating.“Look, I took those tickets to go with a member of my family,” Reeves said. “I thought that was the right thing to do from a security perspective.”The chancellor later added: “These weren’t tickets that you could pay for, so there wasn’t a price for those tickets. Obviously, I’ll declare the value of them but they weren’t tickets that you were able to buy.”Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025LabourRachel ReevesCivil servicePublic services policyWelfareTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The shutdown is estimated to have cost the airline industry £60m to £70m and disrupted the journeys of more than 200,000 passengers around the world.Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said the government was “determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned”, in regard to the incident at Heathrow and the UK’s “energy resilience for critical national infrastructure”.Over the weekend, Heathrow airport’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye,defended the airport’s responseto the unprecedented power outage: “Heathrow uses as much energy as a city every single day so we don’t have backup power for baggage systems, fuel systems, things like air bridges and so on.“So whereas the safety systems are working and we can get aircraft in and out, most of the airport infrastructure comes to a standstill when we need to reset, as we did [on Friday].”‘Wake-up call’: ministers launch urgent investigation into Heathrow shutdownRead moreBut Pettigrew said two substations were “always available for the distribution network companies and Heathrow to take power”. He added it was a “question for Heathrow” as to why it took the action it did.“Losing a substation is a unique event – but there were two others available,” he said. “So that is a level of resilience.”On the day of the fire, Woldbye said the airport’s backup systems “worked the way they should” and told reporters outside the airport that the power supply of Heathrow is a “bit of a weak point”.The next day he told the BBC that although the airport has other substations “to switch to them takes time”, and he was proud of how Heathrow workers had responded to the fire. “The situation was not created atHeathrow airportand we had to deal with the consequences,” he said.“I don’t know of an airport that has backup supply that can switch on in minutes to the magnitude of what we experienced yesterday. The same would happen in other airports.”Pettigrew said all three transformers at the North Hyde substation were damaged by the fire, which firefighters have said burned 25,000 litres of cooling oil. This included one transformer that is a backup and is located further away from the other two.He added that the cause of the fire was not yet known, as the site is still too hot for full forensic work, and third-party involvement is not ruled out. “I can’t remember a transformer failing like this in my 30-plus years in industry,” Pettigrew said.Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan police initially led the investigation, but the force said the fire was not believed to be suspicious. London fire brigade is now leading the inquiry, which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.Asked why the North Hayes site, built in the 1960s, was designed in a way that meant a single fire could knock out all three transformers, he said: “You have to build substations in the space available, and obviously you do all you can to mitigate the risks.“But that is something that clearly I think an investigation will look into a bit further.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportTransportNational GridEnergy industryShareReuse this content"

The US is pushing for a broad ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine by 20 April, according toBloomberg,though sources said the timeline may slip given the wide gap that exists between Kyiv and Moscow’s positions.On Sunday, the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, appeared upbeat about working with the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since the second world war. “I feel that he wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News.This week’s talks are expected to delve into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.“I think you’re going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries,” said Witkoff. “And from that you’ll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said after the meeting that the talks were “constructive”, adding that the energy sector was a key focus of the negotiations.“The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy,” he said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a “just and lasting peace” a reality.Earlier on Sunday, the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said that the US was also talking through a range of confidence-building measures, including the future of Ukrainian children taken intoRussia.The Kremlin, however, swiftly poured cold water on hopes for a rapid resolution, saying that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead. “We are only at the beginning of this path,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV on Sunday.Peskov said the “main” focus in its talks with the US would be a possible resumption of a 2022 Black Sea grain deal, brokered by Turkey and the UN, that ensured safe navigation for Ukrainian farm exports via the Black Sea.Moscow pulled out of the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and fertilisers.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real estate developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.“I just don’t see that he wants to take all of Europe,” he said. “I take him at his word in this sense, so, and I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. But it sort of doesn’t matter. That’s an academic issue … The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the carnage. Let’s end this thing.”Last week Putin agreed to Trump’s proposal for a 30-day halt on attacks to energy infrastructure. The ceasefire, however, was cast into doubt soon after, with both sides reporting continued strikes.Ukrainian officials said on Sunday that at least seven people were killed overnight after Russia launched 147 drones. Ukrainian air defences shot down 97 of the drones, and 25 others were hindered by Ukrainian countermeasures.Three people, including a five-year-old child, were killed in Kyiv, while four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region.Russian troops reportedly seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, while Ukraine’s army said its troops had recaptured the small village of Nadia in the eastern Luhansk region.Russian officials said Sunday that their air defences had destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones targeting the country’s southwestern regions, noting that the strikes had killed one person in Rostov.This week’s talks come on the heels of a wide-ranging interview with the former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, in which Witkoff detailed his admiration for Putin, who launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and scorned the UK’s prime minister.Witkoff said he “liked” the Russian president – “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy … He’s super smart”, he said – while he dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a posture and a pose”.Witkoff, who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine, described Starmer’s idea as “simplistic” adding: “I think there’s this, you know, this sort of notion of we’ve all got to be like Winston Churchill, the Russians are gonna march across Europe. I think that’s preposterous. By the way, we have something called Nato that we did not have in World War II.”Witkoff also asserted that Kyiv had “agreed” to holdelections,though he offered no further details or backing for the claim. Ukraine’s constitutionbars national electionsfrom being held during a period of martial law, while, logistically speaking, any outcome risks being marred by disruptions from air raids, potential attacks on crowded polling stations and the Russian occupation of some regions.When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He stumbled, however, in trying to name them.“The largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, Donbas, Crimea, you know the names and there are two others,” said Witkoff, in remarks that appeared to be an attempt to name Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson and that confusedCrimeafor one of the four occupied eastern territories.Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyystressedthat Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russiawas accused of holding sham pollsin 2022 in a bid to provide cover for their illegal annexation – as Russian.Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and conflated the locally spoken language with support for Russia.“They’re Russian-speaking,” Witkoff said of the four eastern regions. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”In 2022, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections,said the referendumshad not met international standards and had been held in areas where much of the population had fled and which were not secure, while there has been no evidence to suggest that Russian-speaking areas are more favourable to Russian rule.Witkoff continued: “The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Can Zelenskyy survive politically if he acknowledges this?”Witkoff, who met Putin earlier this month in Moscow, told Carlson that the meeting “got personal”, as Putin had commissioned “a beautiful portrait” of Trump from a “leading Russian artist” for Witkoff to take home to the US president.Putin also told Witkoff of his reaction to thefailed assassinationattempt against Trump. “He went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president – not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States – but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” said Witkoff.“And I came home and delivered that message to our president and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,” he added.His comments were swiftly slammed by the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum. “If you ever wondered how the KGB manipulated foreigners and got them to repeat Soviet propaganda, spend some time listening to Steve Witkoff talk about his wonderful conversations with Vladimir Putin,” she wrote on social media.Witkoff went on to assert that the Russians had now obtained what they had hoped for when they launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose, exactly? They don’t need to absorb Ukraine,” he said. “They’ve gotten – they’ve reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they’ve gotten what they want. So why do they need more?”Instead he envisioned a global stage where the US and Russia could build on the ceasefire to normalise relations and join forces in areas such as energy policies in the Arctic, sea lanes, LNG supplies to Europe and artificial intelligence. “Who doesn’t want to have a world where Russia and the United States are doing, collaboratively, good things together?” he asked.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

As their numbers swelled, protesters increasingly clashed with police who fired teargas. In Izmir, video showed police attempting to disperse protests using armoured water cannon trucks.Prosecutors ruled that İmamoğlu’s detention on corruption charges alone was sufficient, despite “a strong suspicion of a crime”, opting to detain three others on terrorism charges but not the mayor. This decision is expected to allow the Republican People’s party (CHP), Turkey’s largest opposition party, to select a candidate to control the Istanbul municipality, rather than the state selecting a caretaker.View image in fullscreenPolice officers use pepper spray on protesters in Istanbul on Sunday.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersThe Turkish interior ministry issued a directive to officially remove İmamoğlu and two Istanbul district mayors from office, appointing a trustee to replace one in a neighbourhood long seen as a bedrock of opposition support.İmamoğlu has denied the accusations against him, telling investigators during questioning that his detention had “not only harmed Turkey’s international reputation but has also shattered the public’s sense of justice and trust in the economy”.His chief spokesperson, Murat Ongun, who was also remanded in custody, posted on X: “I was arrested on slander that was not based on a single piece of evidence!”The Istanbul mayor’s detention in a dawn raid earlier this week has sparked mass protests across Turkey, with tens of thousands taking to the streets each night and often clashing with police. The interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, announced that 323 more people had been detained overnight as part of an investigation into the Istanbul municipality, the day after he announced that 343 people had been arrested for protesting.Turkish officials rejected any suggestion that the sweeping crackdown against İmamoğlu, along with municipal officials, businesspeople and dozens of other members of the CHP, was politically motivated. This has done little to quell anti-government sentiment, and demonstrators have filled university campuses, public squares and surrounded Istanbul’s city hall each night to defy a protest ban.The growing demonstrations have sparked fierce criticism from Erdoğan, who has labelled them “street terrorism”.View image in fullscreenProtesters carry flags as they try to march to Taksim Square from the Istanbul municipality headquarters during the protest.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPAPosting on X, he wrote: “The days of taking to the streets along with leftwing organisations and vandals to point the finger at the national will are over … we will definitely not allow the CHP and its supporters to disrupt public order and disturb the peace of our nation through provocations.”İmamoğlu was jailed on pre-trial detention on the same day that 1.5 million members of the CHP held a primary vote to officially endorse his candidacy for president. The Istanbul mayor was the party’s sole presidential candidate, turning the vote into a symbolic show of support, particularly after the CHP offered non-members a “solidarity vote” in the primary.The embattled mayor issued a message from the high-security facility where he is now held. “Fifteen million of our citizens cast their votes,” he said. “Their message to Erdoğan was clear: “Enough is enough.’”He added: “That ballot box will come, and the nation will deliver a slap this government will never forget.”İmamoğlu has long been seen as the only challenger capable of defeating Erdoğan at the ballot box. A presidential election in Turkey is due in 2028, but an early vote is expected.The CHP leader, Özgur Özel, has accused Erdoğan and his government of detaining İmamoğlu over fears of an election loss. Istanbul University stripped İmamoğlu of his university diploma before his arrest, preventing him from running for president, as a degree is a pre-requisite.View image in fullscreenÖzgur Özel voting for İmamoglu during the presidential primaries on Sunday.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPA“Ekrem İmamoğlu’s only crime is leading in the polls,” Özel told crowds massing outside Istanbul city hall earlier this week. Speaking to reporters on Sunday he said: “Ekrem İmamoğlu is currently on the road to prison but he is also on the road to the presidency. The nation is repelling a coup through solidarity ballot boxes.”Many of those who took to the streets after İmamoğlu’s arrest said his detention had galvanised their decision to show up at the ballot boxes, even if the vote remained symbolic. The CHP said it had extended voting times to keep up with demand, amid images of vast crowds at the polls in their Istanbul stronghold of Kadıköy, and a line stretching around the block outside the polls in the opposition-held neighbourhood of Şişli.“This is a way for us to show our power, to show we’re coming in strong,” said a protester who gave her name as Devrim, who said she had been volunteering with CHP efforts to drive up participation in the ballot to demonstrate a groundswell of support for İmamoğlu.The CHP has also permitted those who are not party members to participate in the primary vote. “We were expecting a high turnout before, but now we think it will be even bigger,” said Devrim.The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yavaş, a leading member of the CHP, told reporters: “Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,” in reference to İmamoğlu’s arrest, after casting his ballot in the primary.“We learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It was chaos. One doctor stepped on a corpse on the ground as he tried to do a life-saving procedure on a child.”Palestinian medical officials say more than 200 people were killed on Tuesday morning alone across Gaza, and hundreds more injured. Within five days, as more airstrikes and shelling continued, the overall death toll in the devastated Palestinian territory in the 18-month warwould reach 50,000, comprising mostly women and children. A total of 113,274 others had been injured, the health ministry said.Israeli military officials say80 “terrorist” targets in 10 minuteswere attacked on Tuesday morning, including leaders and key military infrastructure.TheIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) has previously blamed high levels of civilian casualties on Hamas, the militant Islamist organisation that launched the attack into Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200, mostly civilians, and triggered the war. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge it denies.At Nasser hospital, more than half of adult casualties brought in on Tuesday night were given a 20-second check by surgeons – then, in an effort to prioritise those whose lives might be saved, whoever had brought them was told there was nothing that could be done. Children were almost all admitted, even when their injuries were clearly fatal.View image in fullscreenSome of the people injured in the Israeli army attack were brought to Indonesia hospital for treatment in Beit Lahiya, Gaza, on Saturday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“They had been sleeping so were coming in wearing pyjamas, wrapped in blankets. Often it was neighbours bringing them because the parents had been killed. It was horrific. We had to stop resuscitating several kids simply to focus on one who had a chance,” said Haj-Hassan.Feroze Sidhwa , a 43-year-old trauma surgeon from California, in Khan Younis as a volunteer with the medical charity MedGlobal, described telling the father of one four-year-old girl that his daughter was not going to live more than a few more minutes. “I had a look … She had very serious head injuries … I told her dad to take her outside and be with her and pray with her and he did,” Sidhwa told the Guardian.Many of the 300 brought into Nasser hospital on Tuesday did not survive. Ahmed al-Farra, head of the paediatric and obstetrics department, said about 85 people died, including about 40 children aged one to 17.The average age of the children pronounced dead at Nasser hospital after this week’s new wave of attacks was between six and eight years old and about 35% of all casualties were under 14, said Morgan McMonagle, an Irish vascular surgeon volunteering with the NGO Medical Aid for Palestine.Among the casualties was a 10-year-old boy with a severed spinal chord who was completely paralysed from the neck down and who was unable to breath unassisted, and a five-year-old with multiple shrapnel injuries including to her brain who was unlikely to speak again.In a statement, the IDF said it was committed to mitigating civilian harm during operational activity and made great efforts to estimate and consider potential “civilian collateral damage” in its strikes.“The IDF is fully committed to respecting all applicable international legal obligations, including the law of armed conflict. Considerations and obligations with respect to proportionality and military advantage are evaluated and applied on a case-by-case basis and are facilitated by the comprehensive integration of the law of armed conflict into every phase of training, planning, and execution of military operations,” the statement said.View image in fullscreenA woman tries to comfort an injured man as a child watches them at the Indonesia hospital.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsraeli political leaders have warned that attacks will intensify until Hamas frees more hostages and gives up control ofGaza. Hamas took 251 hostages in its October 2023 raid into Israel and continues to hold 59. Returning hostages have reported systematic abuse and poor conditions in captivity.The first six-week phase of the ceasefire agreed in January expired in early March. Israel proposed an extension of 30 to 60 days and further hostage-for-prisoner exchanges instead of an agreed second phase that would have led to a permanent end to hostilities.Only 22 of 35 major health facilities in Gaza are still functioning, each only providing a fraction of the services offered before the war. Thirteen are currently receiving casualties from the ongoing airstrikes.Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson in Gaza for the UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said that all were “overwhelmed” and suffering shortages of essential supplies even though stocks were brought into the territory during the eight-week ceasefire.“It’s hard to measure the exact level of supplies … [but] we have never had such a long closure. Literally zero has come in,” she said.Doctors at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said stocks were running low. “It was very difficult emotionally, even after 18 months of conflict. We only have ten beds, and we are short of so much: gauze for burns, gloves, cleansing materials, dressings,” one surgeon, who requested anonymity, said.Dr Khamis Elessi, a neurologist and pain specialist at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, said he had no painkillers of sufficient strength for hundreds of cancer patients. “We have hundreds of thousands in Gaza with chronic diseases. They need the right care but conditions are terrible. There is no safe water, sanitation systems are all destroyed so infections are spreading everywhere and people are terrified,” Elessi said.View image in fullscreenA child mourns beside the bodies of relatives, who lost their lives in Israeli attacks on northern Gaza, at the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahiya on Wednesday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIsrael continued to allow medical evacuations from Gaza but only a few dozen left daily and more than 14,000 needed urgent treatment outside Gaza, Cherevko said.Most facilities in Gaza now also have well-practised routines for mass casualty incidents, though even these proved inadequate last week. “We have plans, good plans, but the problem is that the number [of casualties] is greater even than our plans,” said Dr Fahd Haddad, medical director of a field hospital near the southern town of Nuseirat.Haddad said his facility too was short of supplies. “We are afraid we will run out. If there is a long term closure then we cannot survive,” he told the Guardian.But the biggest challenge the 38-year-old and his colleagues face is maintaining their own morale after hopes of a permanent ceasefire were shattered. “We woke up that Tuesday to the explosions and it was like a flashback to 18 months ago when the war began,” Haddad said. “We were so happy with the ceasefire. Life was very tough but at least there was no killing.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Friday, Israel’s defence minister ordered the military to“seize more ground”in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas released the remaining 59 Israeli hostages still held by the group.China, while long insisting Taiwan is part of its territory, is increasing its pressure on Taipei, with some analysts speculating it may take advantage of the weakening on the norm of conquest to absorb Taiwan and expand its influence in the South China sea.In Europe, what was once unthinkable, that Russia could physically threaten the Baltic and eastern states, is not just imaginable but an urgent security issue.Overarching all of this, say experts, is a US president who is not only prepared to approve annexation elsewhere but has an imperialist outlook, which has led some, including Ivo Daalder, the former US ambassador to Nato, to declare that with “Trump in office, the rules-based order is no more”.As analysts have noted, Trump’s policy on both trade tariffs and territorial acquisition harks back to the 19th century – the era of president William McKinley, who presided over the acquisition of Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Hawaii.Most starkly, the outgoing Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, earlier this monthaccused the US presidentof planning to use tariffs to bring about “a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”.“The idea of overtly threatening acquisition of another territory through the use of force has been off-table throughout the postwar period,” says Michael Albertus, a professor at the University of Chicago and the author of Land Power: Who Has It, Who Doesn’t, and How That Determines the Fate of Societies, who, like others, sees an unravelling of the postwar international order. “Since Trump’s election, that has really changed a lot.”The current expansionist mindset of certain nations, Albertus recently wrote, is “just the opening chapter of a new global competition for territory”. And while some of this concerns Trump’s own expansionist ideas, equally significant, says Albertus, is the change in Washington’s treatment of Russia as it has tried to annex large parts of Ukraine.“I think that risks emboldening other countries to test the waters and see if there is any pushback or not.”A key driver, he argues, is technology, climate change and the demand for rare earth minerals, visible in Trump’sdesire to acquire Greenlandand in Rwanda’s moves in the DRC.Putin praises Trump for ‘doing everything’ to improve US-Russia relationsRead moreFor Samir Puri, the head of the global governance and security programme at Chatham House, an academic who worked for the Foreign Office, the current rupture marks not only a reconfiguration since the second world war but also the post-cold war international order and its assumptions.“It’s not only the post-1945 world order but post-1991 in terms of the balance of power. It is important to understand where US is at now. Trump is not an isolationist. He is somewhat imperial in his bearing, not least the fact he might reward Putin’s territorial acquisition.”While Puri admits it is impossible to predict where this transition will lead, he is sceptical that meaningful international mechanisms can truly stop nations and leaders determined on expansion in the way that a US-led coalition came together during the first Gulf War (1990-91) to expel Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.It was that intervention in Kuwait, believes Puri, that created the environment for the decades that followed. “The US coalition to push Iraq out of Kuwait set the tone for a generation [of thinking about sovereign integrity] for a 35-year period.”Chinese premier meets pro-Trump senator and calls for ‘dialogue over confrontation’Read moreFor many, what is most concerning is how Trump’s actions and statements are creating a permissive space, from his open scepticism towards Ukraine to his suggestion that Gaza could be taken over by the US.“Donald Trump’s willingness to betray Ukraine and his rejection of the basic principle of territorial sovereignty is consistent with simultaneously giving Israel a green light to proceed in ways that break the law and seem likely only to fuel an endless cycle of violence,” Michael Becker, a professor of international human rights law at Trinity CollegeDublin, who previously worked at the international court of justice, recently told Al Jazeera.Kerry Goettlich, a lecturer in international security at the University of Reading, sees the change in the US stance as most significant in its transformation from a historic “informal imperialism” that used alternative tools like coups and influence “short of annexation during the 20thcentury’s period of US hegemony”.Goettlich is unsure how much Trump’s own talk ofterritorial expansion in Greenlandor of making Canada America’s 51st state should be taken at face value and how much of it is a negotiating position.“For much of the 20th century there was general agreement that the US would not annex and conquer territory, with some small exceptions.“It was advertised that the US didn’t do conquest. What is clearly changing is this is first time since [the 19th century] when there is a conversation about whether the US does do conquest or not.”And that, says Goettlich, has come in tandem with a change in previous “certainties” about America’s role in the world amid its declining power that – correctly or not – have been “taken for granted”.“What we see with Trump is a clear change of rhetoric that doesn’t have moralism as the basis for the US role in the world, where it puts itself on a moral pedestal.”History has its own warning for Trump as he leads the charge for territorial acquisition. Kal Raustialanoted in an essayin February for Just Security that McKinley’s expansionist policies during the Spanish-American war proved to be deeply problematic.As Tanisha Fazal, a professor at the University of Minnesota and author of the Conquest Is Back essay, writes – echoing the arguments of over a century ago: “Conquest is fundamentally incompatible with democracy. Many tenets of the liberal international order cannot survive in the absence of the norm against territorial conquest. Perhaps that is the point.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyUnited NationsGlobal economyGreenlandCanadaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The mayoralty is also being fought hard by theConservatives, who would otherwise have been favourites.Farage is to launch his party’s local election campaign in Lincolnshire with Jenkyns, who has promised “Doge Lincolnshire” to cut government waste – a reference to Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” in the US – and uses the slogan “No to net zero madness”.View image in fullscreenStockwood: ‘Most people, in my experience, just feel politically homeless and are fed up with the status quo.’Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianLabour’s chances of gaining the seat are likely to be low. But Stockwood, a high-profile tech investor who has never had a career in politics, said that he also wanted to use he race as an opportunity to take on the “nonsense” surrounding net zero denial and said it was a “key dividing line”.He said the national party could learn from his frontline fight against Reform by taking note of the distain that most voters were showing for all politicians – and talking more about costs and less about intangible economic growth.Stockwood has been holding meetings with groups of voters attracted by Reform and said many had told them how angry they were at the status quo.He said one key conversation with a successful local businessman had struck him. “He was saying: we need to blow it all up so we can rebuild it again. That is so dangerous,” Stockwood said. “We’re at a really precarious point in our politics and I was like, I’ve got to have a go, because the alternatives are really, really frightening.”He said he had connected with many of the Reform voters because of their disillusionment with the state of the economy and politics.“Most people, in my experience, just feel politically homeless and are fed up with the status quo. They see politics not working for them, being an elitist merry-go-round rather than people that are making their lives better,” he said.“I’ve definitely calibrated my own view having had those conversations. We’ve had decades worth of flatlining real-terms salaries, a cost of living crisis, jobs going offshore, so we need to make sure we have people who are prepared to have that conversation.”Stockwood said politics was often missing the human connection – whether it was politicians talking about artificial intelligence or economic growth.“I think Labour are trying to do that, but not necessarily always communicating that as clearly, but it’s really clear within Labour that it’s key we are delivering tangible results that affect people, not just talking about growth,” he said.“People don’t understand the growth story, we know that is to enable us to do the social justice stuff that we all care about but people aren’t translating that. We grow the economy so that we do the things we care about in public services. That isn’t landing with people. We’ve got to bring that narrative alive.“When you’re talking about that, sci-fi and robotics and autonomous vehicles, people are saying, but I can’t pay my rent. It just doesn’t connect.”View image in fullscreenAndrea Jenkyns, who defected from the Tories to Reform, uses the slogan ‘No to net zero madness’.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersStockwood said that he would also be taking on Reform’s argument about net zero – saying that Labour could win the debate on renewables as a boost for jobs and growth.“I’ve worked around the world with global investors. Global investors aren’t debating whether net zero is a thing or not. They’re investing in it because they have returns on capital and the amount of jobs it’s going to create. My argument is – you need a leader that understands that investors are ready to make the investment in our county,” he said.“The nonsense of having people that are focused on net zero denial, the actual focus should be on their investment. If we have people who lead the region denying the economic opportunity that net zero is going to create, then that’s really dangerous. We’re going to miss out on a once in a 100 year opportunity. I think that’s a key dividing line for me.”Stockwood said it would be a tough race in a mayoral battle where the Tories have also traditionally been strong. The party is running the leader of North Lincolnshire council, Rob Waltham.“This has always been known as the Tory county but the way our politics is going I just don’t think those lines are as clear as they were historically,” Stockwood said.“We won seats like Lincoln and Grimsby, the central part is historically very rural and Conservative, in the south there really has been a sense that people have been forgotten politically and that’s where you see Reform winning in places like Boston and Skegness.”Stockwood said he believed people would see the value in having someone from outside the political world in the role. “There’s not a tremendous amount of love for traditional politics,” he said.“If you want something genuinely different, someone that’s got a real plan and got real experience, then we’ve got that chance. I wasn’t looking for a job, I’m not looking for a career in politics. This is my one and done career in politics. I’m going to come and try and do this. If I don’t win, I’m not going to try and find another place to stand.”Explore more on these topicsLincolnshireLocal electionsLocal politicsLocal governmentLabourReform UKUK cost of living crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Should you remove fat from your diet? And what about shellfish? Experts explain it allAmy FlemingSun 23 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTShareHigh cholesterol can cause heart problems and strokes – but levels can creep up without showing any symptoms. This is why, if you’re over 40, you should be getting your cholesterol checked every five years. It’s a simple enough concept, but, like alcohol and other things that could be slowly, invisibly damaging our bodies, cholesterol can feel a little abstract, hovering in the background less urgently than everything in the foreground of a busy life.It doesn’t help when myths are flying about online, such as eggs being unhealthy because they contain cholesterol. Or when some fringe scientists and proponents of low-carb and high-fat diets dramaticallydownplay cholesterol’s significance in heart disease– arguing that sugar is a bigger risk to our health, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Nor does it help us laypeople that there are so many different ways to present – and therefore interpret – cholesterol levels.And yet, says Manuel Mayr, a cardiologist and professor at Imperial College London, it’s important to act early to avoid levels creeping up: “Take prevention very seriously, because if your cholesterol is high, if it’s over decades, it builds up in your arteries.”It might help to think of your circulatory system as a washing machine, he says. “If you have a lot of hard water, there’s a high risk of your washing machine getting a blockage.” When it comes to high levels of bad cholesterol, blockages can cause cardiovascular disease and could result in heart attacks and strokes. “The lifetime exposure is what damages the vessels over time,” Mayr adds.So what is the truth about cholesterol? And how do you maintain healthy levels?What is cholesterol?Cholesterol, says Emily McGrath, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), “is a fatty substance that is found naturally as part of your circulation”. We need a certain amount, says Tracy Parker, a senior dietitian at the same organisation, “for making things like hormones – like oestrogen and testosterone. And our cells need cholesterol to make them rigid and firm and solid. But when those levels go high, that’s a problem.” Our bodies make cholesterol, but levels are also affected by lifestyle and genetics.View image in fullscreenOily fish such as mackerel can form part of a low-cholesterol lifestyle.Photograph: RistoArnaudov/Getty ImagesThere are two kinds of cholesterol in the blood. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is known as “bad cholesterol” because too much can cause plaque to build up in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the good one. “HDL helps your liver to metabolise and reabsorb LDL into the bloodstream,” says McGrath, meaning HDL helps keep LDL levels in balance.“What has been shown in numerous studies is that if you lower your bad cholesterol,” says Mayr, “you reduce cardiovascular events.”When should you get your cholesterol checked?The NHS advises five-yearly checks for those aged 40-74, with annual health checks for people 75 and over, says McGrath. “But if there are concerns over family history of heart disease, or if you’re suffering with angina-type chest pain, anyone is entitled to ask their GP for a check.”What do the tests show?Sometimes after an initial cholesterol test, you may be given a single number for the total LDL and HDL cholesterol in your blood. Ideally, the results would show a full lipid profile, says McGrath, “because that gives you the full breakdown of HDL and LDL and triglycerides, which is another type of fat we find in the blood.” All of these details together help paint a clearer picture.Healthy HDL levels should be above 1mmol/L for men or 1.2mmol/L for women. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of somebody saying they’ve got too high HDL,” says McGrath. LDL levels are considered healthy if below 3mmol/L. You should also get a cholesterol ratio number, which compares how much good (HDL) cholesterol you have within your total cholesterol levels. It is your total cholesterol divided by your HDL levels, and is considered healthy if below six – the lower the better.What are triglycerides?This other type of blood fat is significant because, says McGrath, “some people can have good cholesterol levels but high triglyceride, and it still puts them at risk.” Triglycerides are, essentially, “unused calories, a form of stored energy. Like the LDL, you still need some of it – if you use it for energy it will be taken out of your blood – you just don’t want too much of it.” Just enough is 2.3mmol/L or less, unless you’ve been asked to fast before your blood test, in which case the healthy limit is 1.7mmol/L.Where do genetics come in?While a healthy diet and active lifestyle are essential for all-round health, in many of us, says Mayr, “lipid levels are genetic, and if you have very high cholesterol, and you’re unfortunate to have inherited this from your parents, you need medication, because you can’t reach the target level just by making diet changes”.The most common genetic lipid disorder, says McGrath, is familial hypercholesterolemia, which affects about one in 250 people: “If your father or your brother was under the age of 55 when they had a heart attack, or your mother or your sister were under 65, that’s an indication” that you might have it – and it’s worth getting your cholesterol tested. “Some people, unfortunately, might be the first person,” she adds. “So they don’t have any family history and find out by accident, or if, unfortunately, they have a heart attack.”What else affects your risk of heart disease?Cholesterol levels are usually given as part of a “key risk assessment”, which takes a range of factors into account. “Age, weight, family history, smoking status, alcohol intake, whether you have high blood pressure, ethnicity and gender. Men are at slightly increased risk of having high blood pressure, for example,” says McGrath. “If the key risk assessment is above 10%, you will be offered a statin.” Statins inhibit an enzyme the liver needs to make cholesterol, which reduces the amount of LDL cholesterol in the blood. They also reduce the risk of plaques breaking off from artery walls and causing blockages.If you’re offered statins, can you try lifestyle changes instead?If your high cholesterol isn’t down to genetics, you are entitled to say that you’d like to trial lifestyle changes before medication, says McGrath. “Most GPs will be willing to let that person have a try at reducing it themselves and then seeing how they get on. It’s a conversation for the doctor and you.” A doctor would consider how much your cholesterol level is above five, and your other risk factors.Exercise works wonders for that all-important cholesterol ratio by decreasing LDL and increasing HDL. And a healthy diet (more of which below) not only affects how much fat is floating around your blood, but it also helps the liver clear more LDL cholesterol. “On the surface of the liver you have LDL receptors, which are responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol,” says McGrath. “And you want a lot of these, so there are more to receive the bad cholesterol.” This boost in LDL receptors also happens when you take statins.Changing from butter to an unsaturated fat spread, or cutting down on processed meat – that makes a big differenceAfter making positive lifestyle adjustments, McGrath says you could start seeing results after six to eight weeks. “It can be that quick. And then you’ll probably be set a new target.”Parker says that generally, “when you’re asking people to make changes to their diet, we get them to come back in three months and see what the effect is on their cholesterol levels. It’s hard for a lot of people, but small, simple changes make a big difference. Those healthy swaps. You may not be changing everything, but changing from a full-fat milk to a low-fat milk, or butter to an unsaturated fat spread, or cutting down on processed meat – those little things make a big difference over time. If you do it right most of the time, five out of seven days, you’re probably doing all right.”How does body weight affect cholesterol levels?Not everybody who is overweight or obese will have high cholesterol, but, says McGrath, “it’s a contributing factor. Your risk of heart disease increases when you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, you’re overweight or obese, you’re inactive or have a poor diet. But if you’ve got high cholesterol and you are overweight or obese, losing weight will bring your cholesterol levels down.”What are the best foods for good cholesterol?View image in fullscreenThe oats in porridge provide beta-glucans.Photograph: Arx0nt/Getty ImagesAll dietary fibre helps to lower cholesterol, says Parker, but the soluble fibre you find in oats, beans and lentils has an added effect. “It’s a particular type of fibre called beta-glucans. It forms a gel in the gut that stops cholesterol being absorbed into the body, and then you excrete it. Around 3g a day can help to maintain or lower cholesterol levels.” A bowl of porridge with about 40g of oats will provide about 1.4g of beta-glucans.Oatcakes, beans and pulses are high in both general fibre and soluble fibre, “and a great low-fat protein source as well”, Parker adds. “So when you’re replacing meat in the diet with beans and lentils, you get this dual action to help lower your cholesterol.” This is part of the reason why a largely plant-based diet is recommended: “more fibre, more vitamins and minerals”. Most of us are still only consuming three of the five recommended portions of fruit and veg a day. “That includes things like unsalted nuts and seeds as well, because they contain healthy unsaturated fats, as well as fibre and other vitamins and minerals. You might have heard all these foods classed as the ‘portfolio diet’, as a group of foods that work together to help lower your cholesterol.”The fibre phenomenon: 30 easy ways to get your fill of this life-changing nutrientRead moreUnsaturated “good” fats mean, says Parker, “monounsaturated oils that we find in things like olive oil, rapeseed oil, avocados, olives and nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios. And not forgetting things like oily fish and linseed oils – they’re all the healthy fats we need to be eating more of. So it’s not really about low fat. It is about eating the right type of fats.”What are the worst foods for cholesterol levels?“When we talk about lowering cholesterol, it’s about reducing saturated fat in the diet, as we know that that’s linked to raised LDL cholesterol,” says Parker.Foods high in saturated fat include processed meats and high-fat dairy such as butter and cream. Parker also mentions “the tropical oils, such as coconut (which has about 85% saturated fat) and palm oil (which has about twice the saturated fat of butter). They’re the foods that tend to hike your cholesterol levels up, and we know that when you replace those with unsaturated fat, there’s a reduction in your cardiovascular disease risk.”Ultra-processed foods: the 19 things everyone needs to knowRead moreSugary foods should be kept to a minimum. And opting for low-fat foods that have added sugar to make them more palatable should be avoided. “Back in the day, they were removing fat from products and replacing it with sugar because of palatability, and that wasn’t doing us any good.” Ultra-processed foods, too, are rich in saturated fat and should be minimised in your diet.What about dietary cholesterol in eggs and other foods?“You often get myths surrounding things like eggs, shellfish and offal, and dietary cholesterol,” says Parker. These foods contain cholesterol, but this, she says, “really has a small impact on our blood cholesterol levels, and it’s more important to reduce your intake of saturated fat, which we know increases cholesterol”. Most people can enjoy these items as part of a healthy diet. “The exclusion is those who have got familial hypercholesterolemia, where the body is making too much cholesterol, and part of their guidelines are to have lower intake of those sorts of foods.”When do you need something more than statins?If you have borderline high cholesterol levels, or moderately high cholesterol levels, says Mayr, “it’s very important to stress that statins are a super-safe drug. They are widely used and effective at reducing cholesterol. However, they typically lower cholesterol by around 50%. So, if you have very high cholesterol and a 50% reduction is not sufficient to achieve target levels, patients can now benefit from newer therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors.” These target a different protein in the liver to increase the LDL receptors and could be considered if you’ve already had a heart attack.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingNutritionDiets and dietingFitnessHeart diseaseHeart attackHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s an essential emptiness at the core of this generic showLucy ManganSun 23 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShare“Isort of hope they all die,” is never the reaction a television drama wishes to evoke. But in relation to the drug-running family the Phelans and their colleagues and connections that make up This City Is Ours, that just might be your response.Sean Bean plays cocaine-smuggling patriarch Ronnie Phelan, who has enjoyed a long career dominating Liverpool’s drug trade. He is now considering retirement and, it seems, is planning to hand over the reins to his right-hand man of 20 years, Michael (James Nelson-Joyce, recently brilliant as Treacle Goodson in A Thousand Blows). Michael is pretty pleased. It almost makes up for his discovery that he has a low sperm count and that he and Diana (Hannah Onslow), the love of his life, will need to use IVF to start a family. If that all seems a jarring juxtaposition, it is. Scenes of violence are spliced with Michael’s sentimental moonings over pictures of his embryonic children, demanding that we see the irony and feel the humanity of a thirtysomething who is only now beginning to see what life may be really all about and to start groping towards some kind of escape and betterment for the next generation.But you know how it goes. Just when you’re thinking about getting out after IVF implantation, they pull you back in. This time because a large shipment of drugs goes missing, putting the scouse Sopranos in hock to their Colombian pals and requiring them to identify the rat in their midst. This is duly done, but in the course of the bloody investigation, Ronnie’s eldest son Jamie (Jack McMullen) moves up in his father’s affections and is soon effectively challenging Michael for control of the family empire. Some of this takes place in the luxurious Phelan villa in Spain, which is nice for them and also provides handy outbuildings where people can be shot and nearby clifftops from which bodies can be tossed.View image in fullscreenToughened … Julie Graham as Elaine Phelan in This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesThe Sopranos’ influence can be felt in the insistent interspersal of Normal Family Life Events interrupting the action (which is tense and well done) – Sunday lunches, wives nagging husbands about healthy diets, communal dancing at Jamie’s son’s christening – but this is diffusion-line stuff in the extreme. There is no emotional depth, no heart to it and, thanks to many lingering shots of people with faces expressing inner turmoil and/or conflicted loyalties and/or crushing moral burdens, a languorous pace lets any momentum built up by those tense set pieces drain away.There is a subplot around Diana’s past – her mother is in prison but they remain close – that seems designed to hint at the power of intergenerational trauma and makes us fear for her and Michael’s future babies. It adds a little interest. So, momentarily, does the approach by Cheryl (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) – the wife of one of Ronnie and Michael’s associates – at the christening to warn Diana that being a moll is a soul-sucking existence. “There’s nothing good about our men” she says, as lovestruck Diana looks at her with disbelief. “I’m you,” she adds, “sooner than you think.”Perhaps if it had followed the lives of the compromised women behind the bad men there might have been a richer experience here. Instead, the series follows the traditional route and tropes as power struggles, beatings and scary negotiations with bigger boys up the chain take place, further betrayals are uncovered, ambition and greed war with finer feelings, and more inner turmoils, pained expressions and grisly murders ensue.The essential emptiness at the core of This City Is Ours is tempered by the performances, especially from Sean Bean, who can do gnarly bastard in his sleep, and from Julie Graham as Ronnie’s wife, Elaine, toughened by years on the periphery of violent crime, who nails the hard-bitten vibe the part requires. And Stephen Walters as Davy Crawford is wholly convincing as a man just not made for gangland life, however much he wishes he was.It is entertaining enough. But it feels too much like too many things we have seen before. Michael, despite Nelson-Joyce’s best efforts, remains an underwritten cipher and there is no one to root truly for or against. Liverpool and Spain look nice, though.This City Is Ours aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewSean BeanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Stars of the arts world and politics, including prime minister Tony Blair, attended. All of them were dwarfed by a giant ­spider – Louise Bourgeois’s visiting sculpture – perched on the gangway over the vast, packed Turbine Hall.For Alex Beard, particular joyous moments still stand out, but not just from the evening: “It was a remarkable night, but I most clearly remember the first morning, 12 May, when I walked around outside, really early doors, and saw people lining up right around the building. I talked to the first person in the queue, who told me this was something they’d been waiting for all their life,” recalls Beard, who was deputy director of Tate.“The queen had officially opened the building with the words, “I declare the Tate Modern open”, adds Beard, remembering howNicholas Serota, the director and the driving force behind the venture, discreetly winced at the monarch’s use of the definite article. This was simply Tate Modern.“The last gallery proposed for London was in 1936, so this one took a long time coming,” says Beard, who now runs the Royal Opera House.“There were worries about funding, and a moment when we discovered some asbestos in the Turbine Hall, but our most spectacular inaccuracy was in the projection of business for the first year.View image in fullscreenLouise Bourgeois’s giant spider sculpture, titled Maman, in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern in 2000.Photograph: Tate Photography“We thought there might be two million visitors, and it was more than double that.”Last week, the gallery, built inside the brick hulk of a former power station on the south bank of the Thames in London, revealed plans to mark its anniversary with a “birthday weekender” of events. It will host a free celebration of visual art, live music and performance, running from 9 to 12 May.Bourgeois’s spider will be back, as it was in 2007, and in honour of an eventful ­quarter-century, a trail of 25 art works is being installed around the galleries, featuring modern art landmarks such as Andy Warhol’s images of Marilyn Monroe and Salvador Dalí’sLobster Telephone.Art historian Tim Marlow, director and chief executive of the Design Museum, feels that another party is justified. “Tate Modern has utterly changed the face of London’s museums. We didn’t have a separate museum for modern art and it pretty quickly gained status, up alongside Moma [the Museum of Modern Art in New York] and the Pompidou [in Paris], even if there are some questions about its collections.”It has helped London become one of the greatest cities in the world rather than the dysfunctional capital of a lost powerAlex BeardIt is, Marlow believes, everything Tate wanted it to be, although the original Tate Britain – on the other side of the river – may have suffered at its expense.“Tate Modern was the result of a series of things happening, not just one key moment,” says Beard. “There was the lottery money, of course, then all those ‘YBA’ graduates of Michael Craig-Martin’s at Goldsmiths College, as well as Charles Saatchi collecting at Boundary Road, and then all the new technology, turning us into a more visually aware nation. All that came together to create a gallery that could further energise what was going on.”But the chill March wind also brings sobering news. Tate, the parent organisation, is now inserious survival discussionswith the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It isbanking on central governmentcoming to the rescue while it looks for a “financially viable model”. The most recent annual report also reveals that trustees have approved a deficit budget for this financial year.View image in fullscreenDamien Hirst with his work, Shark, part of his 2012 exhibition at Tate Modern.Photograph: Rune Hellestad/Corbis/Getty ImagesSo while Tate Modern may have held on to its high place in the annual popularity rankings for British visitor attractions, released on Friday, it does face a dilemma. The Tate’s four galleries have jointly lost 2.7 million visitors in five years, according toAssociation of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva) figures.Tate Modern is in fourth place with 4.6 million visitors, 3% fewer than last year and 25% down on 2019. Only Windsor and the Natural History Museum lie between it and the British Museum, in the top spot again. Its neighbour up the river, the Southbank Centre, also celebrating 25 years since it was significantly overhauled, lies just behind in fifth.Tate cuts 7% of workforce in effort to reduce funding deficit from pandemicRead moreAs some other attractions return to pre-pandemic visitor levels, the original site, Tate Britain, is still down 32% on 2019, though up a bit on last year. The financial lifeline discussions and visitor figures come after recent reports outlining plans to cut staffing numbers by 7%.Alva’s director, Bernard Donoghue, suspects that Tate “has been heavily dependent on overseas visitors”, and so is being hit by the comparative lack of Chinese tourists since the pandemic.Tate points out that 2019 was a record-breaking year as Tate Modern pushed the British Museum out of first place in Britain for the first time in nine years on theArt Newspaper’s annual survey of international museums and galleries. The success was chiefly down to the appeal of itsacclaimed 2018 Picasso exhibition.Alison Cole, a former editor of theArtNewspaperwho now directs the Cultural Policy Unit, a new thinktank, believes that renewal – and money to carry it out – is now vital: “Tate is not alone in facing these issues, and it has to manage many sites in terms of attracting visitors.View image in fullscreenAi Weiwei with his work Sunflower Seeds, on show at Tate Modern in 2010.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“It’s hard to continually reinvigorate yourself; it is a question now of renewal. Many institutions are feeling their age since that big museum expansion at the turn of the millennium, not only in terms of deteriorating buildings but also flagging staff morale when finances are under strain.”Cole’s thinktank would like to see a temporary switch in the way lottery funds are distributed, in an effort “to help these great organisations put themselves on a sustainable footing”.The first Tate Gallery at Millbank was founded in 1897 by the sugar magnate Sir Henry Tate to champion British art. Away from the action in a residential area and with a limited collection of foreign and modern works, it wasn’t until the 1980s that it became a prominent feature of the art world.Its creation of the Turner prize in 1984 brought it – and the modern art world – much needed publicity and controversy. Then the appointment of Serota as its director four years later changed its fortunes.“Right from the beginning, on a crisp, two-sided application for the job, Serota laid out his vision,” says Beard. “He has got the most fantastic 60,000ft view of the role art plays in society and also knows how to get things done, with incredible attention to detail.” Now in the hot seat as chair of Arts Council England, Serota is becoming accustomed to less enthusiastic praise, after criticism of the organisation’s most recent round of cuts.View image in fullscreenArtist Oscar Murillo invited visitors of all ages to make their mark on a vast painting, The Flooded Garden, in the Turbine Hall last year, creating a collaborative work of epic proportionsChildren and young adults were at the heart of the new Tate Modern gallery “from the get-go”, explains Beard. The idea was to avoid the atmosphere of a reverent temple to the arts. “The entrance into the Turbine Hall was that liminal space between the city and the museum and part of the whole philosophy. It established what was so different about Tate Modern.“It was genuinely groundbreaking in its relationship with the city. The bridge over to St Paul’s was conceived really early on and it caused a great opening up of the river. It’s ridiculous to think you couldn’t walk along it easily then. It has helped London develop its confidence, to become one of the greatest cities in the world, rather than the dysfunctional capital of a lost power.”The two sides of the river have since reached a fairer balance, putting the Thames back at the centre of the city.“I was recently on the Southbank and it was heaving,” says Marlow. “Before, there was a sense that all the arts happened north of the river. Now it is a vibrant cultural ­corridor. And it seems incredible that a city with so much major art being produced in it didn’t have a separate museum for modern art until 2000.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernThe ObserverArtNicholas SerotaMuseumsArts fundingAndy WarholLouise BourgeoisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When she took part in the climate protest she had hoped that she would not be sent to prison and said that she was new to climbing apart from an occasional apple tree.She said her return to prison despite having been deemed suitable for monitoring in the community with an electronic tag had made her feel so low and isolated she considered going on hunger strike.She was sentenced to 20 months and after serving three and a half months at Peterborough prison was released under curfew last November. However, when Ministry of Justice contractors came to fit her with an electronic wrist tag so she could be monitored in the community, she was told there was none available that fitted her wrist so she would have toreturn to prison.“The police arrived to arrest me on 20 December [2024] and I had just 10 minutes to pack. I was behind bars for Christmas, new year and my birthday on 10 January. For my second period in prison I spent 41 days and 41 nights at Eastwood Park.”She said some of her experiences bordered on the absurd. When she first arrived at Peterborough, aged 77, she was asked to do a pregnancy test. “I burst out laughing, I said I’m not going to do it, it’s an insult. They didn’t make me do it.”She said that very little worked in prison as a result of chronic staff shortages, healthcare was poor, and education classes and exercise sessions were often cancelled.“At the pharmacy at Peterborough [prison] one day a woman who had a colostomy asked for a new bag. She was told they didn’t have any and was given one of those little black plastic dog poo bags instead. Another woman was a wheelchair user who used incontinence pads. They didn’t have the right size for her so she was turned away without any.”Delap had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, before going to prison but had to wait for more than two months for medication she needed.“When I was a complete novice in prison the other women were very kind and showed me how things work. They were shocked and horrified when they found out I had been imprisoned for a climate protest. I think around 80% of the women I met should not have been in prison. Help with problems such as mental health, addiction and housing would have been more useful.”She raised concerns about the practice of recall for the smallest misdemeanours such as being unavoidably a few minutes late for a probation appointment. “There was one woman with mental health problems who was released but had such serious issues that she was unable to sort herself out after she left prison so spent two nights sleeping in a bus shelter before being recalled.”She said the friendships she forged helped her get through both spells behind bars. “There was a lot of: ‘You all right babe?’ ‘Yeah, you all right?’ even though none of us were really all right.”She helped a young prisoner learn to read using Michael Rosen’s Sad Book. “Michael facilitated the learning of reading in absentia,” she said.Along with volunteering to help prisoners with literacy, she did gardening, including litter picking, and brought leaves and plants she found outside back into her cell to draw.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The prisons this government inherited are not working for most women. Many female prisoners are victims and over half are mothers. That’s why the lord chancellor has launched a new Women’s Justice Board to reduce the number of women in prison, and better support those who must still be imprisoned.”In response to Delap’s concerns about issues with healthcare at Peterborough an NHS spokesperson said: “All patients, regardless of location, deserve a good standard of care – however we know more needs to be done to expand access, which is why we’ve increased HMP Peterborough’s healthcare budget by over 20% over the year, while we also roll out better staff training to ensure women receive the same quality of care as they would in the community.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmental activismPrisons and probationJust Stop OilProtestUK criminal justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year I read twice the amount of self-help books than I logged onGoodreads. The number would raise serious concern and some of the titles would, too. I say I’m a culture journalist, but I couldn’t share my Spotify Wrapped because my most listened-to music was healing ambient tracks called things like “Whole Being REGENERATION”. My podcast listening habits were hardly better: softcore manifestation content or prophesying rants from a growing crop of spiritual influencers who makeDavid Ickelook like Stephen Hawking. I’ve withheld most of my adventures in healing from friends and family. I hadn’t known how to explain to people what I was doing.The why was easier: I’d rather not be my own worst enemy. I’d furiously backstep to the centre of many problems to find myself. I wanted to stop being someone with fairly unhealthy relationships and a discreet but unshakeable suspicion that I’m inherently unlovable, which is probably most people’s issue. I knew there was a version of myself with direction, with great intuition, if only I could trust it more. The original sins were not mine but now, a grown adult, they are my responsibility. A few years ago I told a close friend that I’m terrified I’ll wake up at 50, like Leonardo DiCaprio, dating a merry-go-round of inappropriately aged people, but without the Hollywood Hills compound and career. That could be fun, but if it happens, I’d rather it be an interesting choice than my unconscious fault.I found myself with the questions everyone asks at least once in their existence when they scare themselves: “Who am I? Why am I here? Why am I not happier? And what do I really want with me?” I decided that in order to be a more fulfilled human being, I had to focus on my (admittedly already significant) interest in psycho-spiritual self-improvement. I joined the masses and began – I can just about write the much-parodied phrase if I don’t have to say it aloud – my Healing Journey.My goals morphed into the pursuit of ‘being healed’I’ve done plenty of therapy and wasn’t interested in more, even if I could afford it. This was about the soul, possibly about the body, but not so much about the mind. What I had, as a freelance journalist, was time and a love of research. There were the tried and tested methods (religion, recovery groups, philosophy); the newly fashionable (breathwork, weightlifting, somatic experiencing); the alternative (tarot readings, kundalini activation,Rapid Resolution Therapy), and then whatever happened the other day when I found myself inside a giant wooden healing egg in Wandsworth getting blasted with sound and light therapy. I’ve had helpful discoveries and cosmic revelations.Then came the subtle backlash. I realised I was doing too much. I knew too much. I hadtoo muchawareness. I was letting go of my ego (good?), but was more disconnected than ever from what I wanted (bad – in fact, the opposite of what I wanted). One late afternoon, all I had the energy for was to decompose on my sofa and scroll through wellness social-media accounts. I knew I should meditate or journal or read, but I felt exhausted by it all. The signals of my body – limbs heavy, mind racing – told me I was at saturation point with healing. Why did I deserve to be awarded a PhD in the vagus nerve yet, in some respects, felt worse than before I started all this? I realised I had to stop trying to heal and recover from recovery.It seems clear to me nowthat excessive focus on self-improvement only enforces a narrative of brokenness. Each time I daydream about how elite my life will be when I have £2,000 to buy an amethyst infrared mat, I tell my subconscious mind that I need to be fixed. The lack of a shared cultural definition of “healing” doesn’t help – what does healing mean,precisely? Though it’s used incessantly, the word is vague and full of promise. It sets up a dichotomy of well and unwell, which I found made it slippery, too.While, two years ago, I had specific goals in sight, like learning to feel my feelings rather than immediately analyse them, and to avoid getting into another self-destructive romantic relationship, those attainable ideals were somewhat forgotten. They morphed into the broader, far more stimulating pursuit of “being healed”. And Ireally wantedto be healed. Intellectually, I knew there would be no definitive teen-movie makeover scene in which I would step out like a beautiful Ram Dass with great hair, but now that I had no obvious active addictions (beyond this new one), boy was I going to try.The online healing discourse tells us to put in “the work” and it will absolutely result in a tangible change. That might be true of some fitness or health markers, but I no longer believe it’s true of our inner selves. Self-inquiry and analysis are necessary for growth and a meaningful life, but it’s not as simple as input equals output. To heal is invisible, unquantifiable stuff.That’s not a marketable dream, though. There are enormous amounts of money to be made from the vulnerable seeker (which, given the right circumstances, could be any of us). The Global Wellness Institute projects that the wellness economy will grow to $8.5tn by 2027 (about £6.5tn), at an annual rate of 8.6%. If healing is a lifelong job, which most psychologists and spiritual teachers will tell you it is, then how do we know when to stop? I know a breathwork practitioner called Jamie Clements who went through a similar struggle after healing became his lifestyle and business, only to realise it wasn’t improving his life. He noticed the same issue in his clients, who also felt stuck in a healing cycle. Clements identified that while self-inquiry, introspection, and uncovering unconscious patterns are vital, they’re just the beginning. In an intellectually-driven society, we often believe that knowledge alone creates change. Clements believes that many get stuck in Healing 1.0 and don’t move to the next phase, which is applying self-knowledge to rebuild everyday life and relationships. While I had my theories, they didn’t take shape until I met two women, healer Prune Harris and nervous-system expert Ally Wise. Both emphasised that healing works in a spiral shape, not a linear one.It’s only in these last few hundred years where the age of reason has encouraged and valued linear thinking over that more spiral path, Harris told me. When she said this, I remember picturing myself valiantly pursuing something only to zoom out and see that I’m manically looping around and around on a mystical hamster wheel.I’d heard it before when reading about the work of psychoanalyst Carl Jung, infamous for his study of symbols and archetypes. He wrote that the unconscious process of psychological healing moves “spiral-wise round a centre, gradually getting closer, while the characteristics of the centre grow more and more distinct.” Basically, we encounter the same problems repeatedly, but each time with additional information about their nature.If healing is a lifelong job, then how do we know when to stop?When I told Wise about my feelings of being paralysed by my efforts to help myself, she was unsurprised, since healing now is unfortunately very conditioned: “I need to heal so I can live my life” or “I need to heal so I can have that relationship.” It puts even more pressure on the nervous system, she told me. In fact, my system – the thing that would actually be doing the healing for me, rather than me doing it to myself through sheer willpower – was so overwhelmed that I should completely take the pressure off myself.A different phase of life emerged out of Harris and Wise’s suggestions: unfollowing wellness Instagram accounts, not buying any more self-help books, having a glass of wine with friends. If I did that and just listened to my body, they promised I would feel a difference.There is far less“doing” of healing now. The other day I saw a popular British spirituality lifestyle influencer share an emotionally wrought Instagram reel of herself that turned out to be an ad for a holistic wellness platform she promises will change your life, and I rolled my eyes. A more critical lens has finally entered the chat.Naturally, I experience compulsions to indulge in self-development (usually prompted by an intrusive worry that I’m wasting my one solitary life being “unhealed”), but each time I remind myself that I’ve become exhausted trying to fix the problem ofme. Though I get that the idea of calling our self-development “the great work” came from ancient alchemists – and full respect to them – we are in an era in which everything has become work. Our hobbies, side-projects, bodies, friendships, relationships and now our inner worlds are projects to toil away at. I never want to hear the phrase “working on myself” again.It feels like a relief to say that at this junction (humbly, maybe for the rest of my life, who knows) this is pretty much as good as I get. This is as much intimacy as I can bear with people. This is how I communicate when unpredictably activated by childhood hurts appearing in the present. These are the places in my mind to which I occasionally retreat. I could be better but I’ve been much worse.Hannah Ewens writes a spirituality newsletter calledHeaven Sentand is author of Fangirls: Scenes from Modern Music CultureExplore more on these topicsLife and styleSelf and wellbeingHealth & wellbeingPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The least expensive of these could be yours for £160, while the dearest might set you back as much as £580. What do you get for your money if you seriously splash out? Loftus, who was born in Ireland and is soft spoken and gently thoughtful, takes her time with this question. “It’s to do with how much time I’ve spent combining different steels,” she says, hesitantly. “Some of the knives involve a layering technique – people know it as damascus steel – which creates a pattern on the blade. It takes a long time. There’s a lot of folding and cutting and hammering.”Such a knife is likely to be with its owner for a good while – perhaps for ever. “I’m lucky,” she continues. “The people who buy my knives have a strong sense of what they’re getting. It’s not going to be the same as an off-the-shelf, factory-made knife. They know they’re going to have to look after it.”Loftus didn’t set out to be a knife-maker; she used to do community work. But then she got talking to someone in the knives business. “Once I realised it could be done by hand, something about it took hold of me: it got stuck in my brain, even though at the time I’d never made anything at all. It was an infatuation. I spent a long time reading about it, and eventually I decided I wanted to commit. I went on a course in Scotland – it was for farriers, because there isn’t really anywhere you can learn to make knives professionally – and it was there that I found out how much I loved to forge: getting the heat into the steel, and once it’s plastic, moving it with your own body and the hammer … It was amazing.”She never looked back. “I found a forge in London [Blenheim Forge – of which, more later] and I trained with them for three years, learning to make chef’s knives.” Is she the only woman who’s doing this kind of work right now? “I think I might be the only one who’s doing itprofessionally,” she says, judiciously.View image in fullscreenKnives in production at Blenheim Forge, London.Photograph: Matthew WalderLoftus uses steel not only from Germany and Japan, but also from Sheffield, my home town and a city that was once famous across the world for its cutlery. The handles of her knives are made of cherry, hawthorn and yew, and each one is unique. But if they’re beautiful, they also need towork, to be functional to the highest degree. “Knives are having a moment, because cooking has been made more accessible. If you don’t cook, you absolutely don’t need a nice knife; if you do, a well made one makes all the difference. A lot of people think they’re useless at slicing and dicing, but they’ve just got blunt knives. Owning one that stays sharp and is easy to sharpen changes everything.” Buyers, though, should beware companies that boast their knives are handmade when in fact they’ve simply stuck a handle on a blade whose provenance is unknown. “Transparency matters,” Loftus says. “I know what steel mills I’m supporting, and almost all the wood I use comes from felled or fallen trees in London.”What would she say to someone who’s on a quest to buy a new knife, and panicking at the choice? “Think about what you’re cooking, and think about what kind of investment you want to make. Any knife can be made sharp, but how long it stays like that is determined by materials. There’s a trade-off. Stainless steel typically gets blunt faster than carbon steel, but carbon steel will rust, so it’s not for you if you want a knife you can leave wet.”My old knives were blunt and knackered. One was missing a rivet in the handle; another had lost the tip of its bladeWhat’s the best way to sharpen a knife? “I use Japanese whetstones. But for people at home, the best thing is a ceramic honing rod, which looks similar to a steel, only the material is less aggressive. It takes away less of your knife, so you’ll have it for longer.” I think of my granny’s carving knives, now in my kitchen, the middle sections of which are on the verge of disappearing thanks to constant sharpening on old-fashioned steels. My own odyssey, it seems, may turn out to have more stages than expected.Last January, I reached a place of acceptance. There was just no getting away from it: my knives were blunt, and some of them were knackered in other ways, too. One had a handle that was missing a rivet; another had unaccountably lost the tip of its blade. I hate waste, but it was OK. I had owned them for 30 years. It was time to spend some money.In the era of my first flat, I went to John Lewis and bought a selection by Sabatier, a name I knew from my parents’ kitchens. Easy! No one seemed to care much about knives then, let alone fetishise them as certain male cooks do now. Books about knife skills, and classes that teach them, were unheard of. The choice was limited, even for those with pots of money, and internet shopping had not been invented.But my, how things have changed. You could spend months looking, and still be undecided. European or Japanese? Factory-made or handmade? And how many different shapes and styles do you need? I exaggerate only slightly when I say that the cash it’s possible to spend on a kitchen blade now seems virtually limitless. Even John Lewis stocks a Japanese-made gyutoh knife by Miyabi with a blade that incorporates a “101-layer flower damascus design”, and a handle made from birchwood – a snip at £459 (reader, I didn’t buy it).View image in fullscreenKnife sharpening at Blenheim Forge.Photograph: Dan Sherratt Photography/Dan SherrattIn a muddle myself, I start on this piece as a way of sorting things out in my head, and Loftus is the first person I speak to, on the phone from Ireland: I feel so intimidated by macho Knife World, I want to fire my stupid questions at a woman, not a man. “That makes sense,” she says, when I confess this. “I’ve a lot more women followers than men on social media.”But as things turn out, Knife World isn’t so scary after all. When I email James Ross-Harris at Blenheim Forge to ask if I can visit him in Peckham, he replies immediately. He’s happy to have visitors – and it’s just as well. People often call by to get their knives sharpened and, followinga piece in theNew York Timesthat named Blenheim a top London destination, intrepid American tourists sometimes swing by, too.Blenheim Forge, which was founded in 2014, is under a Victorian railway arch, and it speaks to my roots (I’m apt to well up when in proximity to certain kinds of machinery). Like Loftus, Ross-Harris’s career was also a bit of accident. He and Jon Warshawsky used to spend their weekends knocking up DIY projects in the garden of their shared house in south London. One such project was a forge, made from fire bricks and a leaf blower, and it got them hooked.Ross-Harris trained as a blacksmith, working under this very arch when it was leased by another business. He worked mostly on architectural projects, but in the evenings he experimented. “I wasn’t massively into knives before I made one. You realise how many elements there are: the different types of steel, the different profiles and geometries.” When his bosses decided to move site, he and Warshawsky bagged the arch for themselves (they were later joined by another friend, Richard Warner), and ever since, the business has grown and grown. Nowadays, it makes perfect financial sense for them to spend £40,000 on five tonnes of steel: they know they’ll use it.At home, use a ceramic honing rod to sharpen your knife. It takes away less of your knife, so you’ll have it for longerWhat’s special about Blenheim Forge knives? The answer is: everything, from the steel that’s used (“it’s really, really clean”), to the handles (only native hardwoods), to the sharpening (each one is individually sharpened on a Japanese whetstone, and then stropped on leather).Chefslove them, and it’s not hard to see why. When Ross-Harris shows me some, my fingers tingle: a sudden covetousness. They cost hundreds of pounds, but I’m not young: these could see me out.My eye falls on a gargantuan bread knife – every week, the forge’s bladesmiths set aside time to work on special projects – for which I long especially: no more wonky sourdough inmyhouse. Most exciting of all, however, is the news that Blenheim is working with the only remaining drop forge in Sheffield – drop forging uses hydraulic pressure to press the metal, rather than a hammer – with a view to producing a range of steak knives. Uh oh. This is my dream. I remember the Victorian water-powered drop forge we used to visit on school trips. He promises to email me.If you’re not in the market for a bespoke, handmade knife, there is, of course, a middle way. You could buy an expensive factory-made knife instead, one that’s highly functional and beautifully designed. “We use ice hardening for our knives,” says Corin Mellor, the designer who now runs his father’s business, David Mellor. “The heat treatment starts at 1,200 degrees [celsius], then it goes down to room temperature, and then the blades – they’re Japanese – are put into liquid nitrogen and cooled further. It makes the edge last a bit longer.”View image in fullscreenKnife designer Corin Mellor.Photograph: India HobsonDesigning knives isn’t straightforward for him: his father’s celebrated cutlery designs are all still in production. But Corin’s black-handled kitchen knives, which took him four years to perfect, are now the among the company’s bestsellers. In appearance, he tells me, they nod deliberately to Sabatier’s classic design, but they’re also reassuringly sharp and have a certain balance in the hand: “They need to perform ergonomically. The forging runs down inside the resin handle, and then there’s a big lump of metal right at the bottom. You can’t see it – it’s inside the handle – but that’s the trick. It gives it a bit of weight.”Perhaps you’re wondering what I’ve finally decided on after all these conversations. But the truth is, I’m not there just yet. While I wait for the Blenheim Forge Sheffield knives, and perhaps for a bread knife, too, I’m slowly buying what’s useful and affordable. I’m loyal to David Mellor, another son of Sheffield, and have already treated myself to two of Corin’s knives, with their elegant single rivet and their shape that reminds me of my mother’s best gun-handled silver cutlery: one is a cook’s knife, the other is a chopping knife, and I love them (I paid just over £100 for both). For speed, and because they’re cheery – their handles are orange and yellow – I’ve also bought some affordable Victorinox paring knives, which are great for peeling fruit and other things, and can go in the dishwasher.No doubt more will arrive soon; my fingers still tingle, and not because I’ve had an accident while boning a chicken. But, in the meantime, I know now that Loftus was right: it’s so good to have knives that are properly sharp. When I leave my desk at the end of the day, a new ease accompanies me as I head to the kitchen. What can I dice tonight, and how finely?Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverSteel industryGadgetsHomesChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its outstanding motion isolation makes it a particularly fine choice for couples who need some peace from each other’s nocturnal fidgeting.Given its price of £1,149 for a double, you’d hope it would provide the sleep of your dreams – but it’s hard to find out for yourself until you actually buy it because Simba doesn’t have showrooms. You can follow expert advice onchoosing your ideal mattressand avail yourself of Simba’s 200-night free trial period, but you’re still buying blind.

As with all the mattresses I’vetested for the Filter, I tracked its impact on our sleep quality and other factors, such as body aches, night sweats and disturbances from tossing and turning, and ran tests to measure things like sinkage and heat retention. I also enlisted the help of our locally based family to assess its firmness, comfort and value for money.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreenThe Hybrid Pro is made up of eight layers and is 28cm deep.Photograph: Jane HoskynView at SimbaThe Hybrid Pro is the middle child in Simba’s Hybrid range, which all have pocket springs and different types of memory foam. It sits halfway between the averagely priceyHybrid Essential(£599 for a double) and the outrageously expensiveHybrid Ultra(£2,799 for a double). The Pro merely costs “a lot”, starting at £799 for a single and rising to £1,349 for a super king.You get what you pay for in terms of sophisticated construction. The Hybrid Pro’s eight layers exceed the usual five or six in a hybrid mattress, and its spring count is more than four times the typical 1,000. There are up to 4,800 springs in aking size, individually wrapped and with a layer of “micro springs” to add bounce and durability.View image in fullscreenThe Hybrid Pro’s cover is machine washable.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe largest foam layer is a high-density base for support and durability, while more technologically advanced layers include one made from open-cell graphite-infused foam to encourage airflow. There’s also a top layer of natural wool for cushioning and temperature regulation and a fabric cover you can unzip and wash in the machine.Simba describes the Hybrid Pro as “medium firm”, and my tests with weights suggested it’s about right. During my first month of testing, the Hybrid Pro sank a maximum of 29mm under 7.5kg of weight – halfway between the firmest mattress I’ve tested (theOrigin Hybrid Pro, which sank 18mm) and the softest (theEve Wunderflip Hybrid, 40mm).The Simba Hybrid Pro isn’t the heaviest mattress I’ve tested but it is beefy, measuring 28cm deep and weighing about 40kg for a double. Luckily, you’re not supposed to flip it, but you should rotate it from head to toe once a month to avoid indentations where you sleep. A 10-year guarantee covers manufacturing defects and there’s the 200-night trial – during which you can return the mattress for a full refund if you don’t get on with it.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

This worked well enough, with regular text alerts from Simba, a driver tracking link and a four-hour delivery window.Simba claims it will deliver your mattress to any room you want, but this was never presented as an option by the delivery team. The boxed mattress was heavy, weighing more than 40kg, so I’d recommend asking the drivers if they’d carry it upstairs if needed. In the event, my husband and I unwrapped the Simba downstairs so we could run tests and let our family try it, later ferrying it upstairs with some effort and the odd bleepable word.What we loveView image in fullscreen‘I felt fully supported when I sat up to read in bed and the support continued up to the edge and corners of the bed.’Photograph: Jane HoskynA new mattress often requires an adjustment period, so I’ve had a few sleepless nights reviewing mattresses (I know, it’s a tough job). The Hybrid Pro, however, had me sleeping soundly from the start. I woke up feeling refreshed, and there was no sign of the lower back pain I’d suffered with some firm beds.The surface feels cosy without being too soft, and supportive without being too firm. In the mattress game, that’s bullseye. In the words of my 22-year-old niece, “It has squishiness but it’s surprisingly firm when you actually lie on it.” The hint of softness is ideal for us side sleepers because our hips, shoulders and knees need cushioning, but I also felt a reassuring pushback when I laid on my back and front. I felt fully supported when I sat up to read in bed, too, and the support continued right up to the edge and corners of the bed. That’s a distinct advantage over the cheaperOtty Original Hybrid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I also liked the feel of the natural wool layer immediately beneath the sleeping surface, although I was torn on its supposed cooling powers. More on that in a moment.At 28cm deep, the Simba is chunky enough to look and feel luxurious, but slim enough to accommodate our non-stretchy fitted sheets, albeit with an effort to get all the corners snug. The 31cm-deepOrigin Hybrid Pro, by contrast, is too big for any standard-depth fitted sheet.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘I didn’t get sweaty while sleeping on the Simba, but it was autumn and winter.’Photograph: Jane HoskynWith a collective firmness score of 7/10 from our panel, the Hybrid Pro won’t be firm enough if you love the solid pressure relief of a hard mattress. This may be especially noticeable if you’re a larger person and you sleep on your back, but my husband (a back and side sleeper) and sister (side sleeper) – perfectly average-size, middle-aged people, if they’ll forgive me – felt it was slightly too soft. My niece and I, who agreed with the 7/10 firmness measure, awarded 9/10 for overall comfort. Clearly, firmness preference is subjective.Less subjective is the sinkage effect of foam. All mattresses that contain memory foam soften in their first few months. After I’d slept on the Hybrid Pro for three months and rotated it as instructed, the central section of the sleeping surface felt noticeably softer. I whipped out the weights again and, sure enough, the central area now sank 41mm under 7.5kg instead of 29mm.This alarmed me at first – especially consideringthe issues some customers have had in the past– but apparently it’s quite normal.Simbaclaims a “dip tolerance” of 25mm in the first six months, and my October and December measurements were well under 25mm. That initial sinkage is a bit like wearing in cushioned shoes and hard to avoid, so be aware of it – especially given that you can’t flip a hybrid mattress to get a freshly firm surface.Memory foam also tends to hold on to body heat, and this can spell misery if you suffer from night sweats like I do. I didn’t get sweaty while sleeping on the Simba, but it was autumn and winter.My tests with a heat pad, thermometer and my husband’s bottomfound that it hung on to body heat marginally longer than theOtty Original Hybrid, the Origin Hybrid Pro and the airy-but-much-less-robust Ikea Valevåg.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe plastic the mattress comes in can be recycled – but at household waste centres rather than regular refuge collections.Photograph: Jane HoskynBed-in-a-box delivery is an environmental challenge in itself. Like its rivals, the Hybrid Pro is vacuum-packed into a sausage-roll shape and wrapped tightly so it can’t expand en route to your front door. This requires metres of plastic that you probably won’t reuse unless you’re decorating and need a dust sheet. Most household waste centres will accept it for recycling, but bin collections won’t.Then there’s memory foam used in hybrid mattresses like the Hybrid Pro. Viscoelastic LRPu (low-resistance polyurethane foam), to give it its full name, is made using energy-intensive processes, and is not biodegradable. Simba, like many of its rivals, has made notable green efforts, perhaps in a bid to compensate.Simba’s onlineSustainability Hubdeclares its aim to be net zero by 2030 and says it’s the UK’s first sleep brand to be certified by global bodyB Corp, which demands strict and constantly monitored environmental and social standards from its members. All its foam is certified byCertiPurto minimise the impact on health and the environment.Simba runs amattress recycling serviceand, again, this is common among bed-in-a-box companies. It’s not free – it charges £50 to take away your old mattress and recycle it, whether it’s a Simba or not – but it does at least offer peace of mind that it’ll be handled by specialists.I gave the recycling service a try. Simba sent me a collection bag (essentially a thick, mattress-size bin bag) and then dispatched third-party couriers to collect it. “Oh no, it’s a mattress,” they lamented. Interesting that they’d not been forewarned, and it made me wonder for a moment where my old mattress might end up, but Simba guarantees that its collected mattresses are recycled responsibly with UK recycling partners.Simba Hybrid Pro: should I buy it?The Hybrid Pro is a sumptuously comfortable mattress that improved my sleep from the first night, offering the luxury of softness without sacrificing support. Its price is pretty deluxe, too, and it’s worth being aware that memory foam can soften in time, though if you treat it well this mattress is a worthwhile investment.View at SimbaJane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and ‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

By March, these birds have started to return from their winter breaks, navigating their way home to breeding grounds thousands of kilometres away – some species returning to home territorywith centimetre precision. Although the idea of migration often conjures up striking visions of vast flocks of geese and murmurations of starlings, “the majority,” saysMiriam Liedvogel, director of the Institute of Avian Research (IAR) in Germany, “migrate at night and by themselves, so they have no one to follow.”Liedvogel has had a fascination with birds since childhood, and often wondered how they navigate these lengthy migrations. She is not alone, with even Aristotle pondering the mystery and mistakenly concluding that redstarts change into robins over the winter. As Liedvogel points out, migration behaviour is varied and much remains unknown, but we now have enough data on bird behaviour to rule out species transmogrification, among other theories. Studies have revealed that 95% of migrating birds travel at night, alone, and without parental guidance, so the behaviour must be partly inherited. These birds use the Earth’s magnetic field to find their way, and it is likely that at least part of the biological mechanism that allows them to do this can be explained through quantum mechanics.Biophysicist Klaus Schulten came up withthe idea currently favouredfor explaining magnetic field-sensing in birds in 1978, alongside his colleagues Charles Swenberg and Albert Weller at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany. The idea hinges on what happens when electrons gain energy. A more familiar response might be the generation of a current, as in a photovoltaic device (or solar cell) when the sun is out, but other effects can take place too. Electrons favour hanging out in pairs, but absorbing energy can lead to an electron moving from one molecule to another. At this point, both the molecule gaining and the molecule donating an electron have unpaired electrons, earning those molecules the hippy-sounding term “free radical”.View image in fullscreenA flock of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) perch on power lines in France during their southerly migration.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyElectrons have a quantum property described as “spin”, and when two free radicals are formed in this way, the spins take on a particular arrangement that is sensitive to magnetic fields. This means that any change in biochemistry the molecule undergoes during the bird’s natural bodily processes – and the rates of these reactions – will be affected by the presence of a magnetic field. So this “radical pair effect” could allow birds to sense a magnetic field. However, researchers have also suggested that a little bit of magnetic iron oxide incorporated into a bird’s beak could do much the same thing, acting as a tiny compass needle. Particles of magnetite get everywhere: they’re inside the food we eat and are carried on the air that we breathe, so it’s inevitable that they end up in our bodily tissues. People have reported finding them inside the heads of birds, although not where they can enter the brain for it to sense magnetic fields. What is more, a bit of magnetite alone could not explain the navigating behaviour people observe in birds.Peter Horeis a professor of chemistry at Oxford University, who has been studying the possible mechanisms allowing birds to sense magnetic fields for more than 20 years, and he lists some of the evidence in favour of the radical pair effect. One finding is that birds do not seem to be able to sense the difference between north and south poles in a magnetic field, so much as the direction towards a pole or an equator. “That suggested it [the magnetic sensing] was not based on magnetic minerals, which behave like compass needles,” says Hore. Put a bird in the opposite hemisphere and it willstill aim its flight towards the equatorfor warmer weather in the winter.Another compelling finding is that it seems light is needed for birds such as robins to sense the magnetic field, and it is needed to kickstart the radical pair effect too. At the quantum level, all measurements are accompanied by an exchange of energy. Looking in detail at the wavelengths of light absorbed in the radical pair effect has also pointed towards a particular protein: cryptochrome 4. Schulten suggested in 2000 that a cryptochrome protein might be aplausible candidatefor hosting the radical pair mechanism in birds, although at the time cryptochromes had only just been discovered and only one was known. Liedvogel began her PhD just a few years later and began looking into the cryptochromes known in birds at that time, a study she describes as being “crazy hard”, before then adding: “Now, with much more failure and much more knowledge also, we understand why that was so.” It turns out that while cryptochromes 1, 2 and 4 are found in the eyes of these migrating birds, the binding between cryptochromes 1 and 2 and the crucial light-absorbing pigment in the radical pair effect is not nearly as strong as it is for the later discovered cryptochrome 4.It seems that nature has devised quantum technology before us, and that doesn’t sound that crazy, right?Ianis Kominis, University of CreteCareful study of the wavelengths of light absorbed by cryptochrome 4 revealed exactly which radicals were forming. In 2021, Hore and his colleagues were able to test the magnetic field sensitivity of cryptochrome 4 from a robin, which migrates, and compare it with that of a chicken, which doesn’t. They showed that the robin’s protein had a greater sensitivity to magnetic fields than the chicken’s. Furthermore, when they mutated the candidate parts of the protein flagged as forming the radicals, no magnetic field sensitivity effects were detected. All this strongly favoured the radical pair mechanism in cryptochrome 4 proteins as the basis for magnetic field-sensing in birds, despite the tiny values of the energies involved. The Earth’s magnetic field strength at the surface is a mere 50 microtesla – a standard medical MRI uses fields at least 20,000 times higher – so the energies these interactions amount to are tiny: a million times smaller than the thermal energy of the molecules just jigging around at body temperature.View image in fullscreenProf Dr Miriam Liedvogel of the Institute of Avian Research, Germany, with a female blackcap.Photograph: Melina Moersdorf/MPGWith the discovery of cryptochrome 4 and evidence in its favour for the radical pair effect, Liedvogel took another tack and set out to look for signs of adaptive selection optimising the protein in the evolution of birds that migrate seasonally. She and Corinna Langebrake, who was then completing a PhD with Liedvogel at IAR, looked at all the known bird genome sequences and compared regions relevant for the production of cryptochromes in birds that migrate versus those that do not. They found that in cryptochromes 1 and 2 there was very little variation across species, which can be indicative that those proteins are universally essential, as changes would then be hazardous to survival. As Liedvogel points out, these proteins are responsible for maintaining circadian rhythms – the “body clock” – so that much all adds up. What is more, they found higher levels of variation not just in the cryptochrome 4 of migrating birds versus non-migrating birds, but in the region of cryptochrome 4 that produces radicals in the radical pair effect. There are also other regions of apparently high selectivity in cryptochrome 4, possibly pointing towards an additional but as yet unknown function of the protein. Perhaps harder to explain, however, is the absence of cryptochrome 4 in a group of birds that includes solitary long-distance nocturnal migrants, the tyranni. Behavioural experiments are under way to test whether these birds can sense the Earth’s magnetic field in the way that the cryptochrome 4 radical pair mechanism model seeks to explain, but the jury is still out.Meanwhile, a paper published earlier this year suggests that there may be a limit to how far evolution can go in terms of improving a bird’s sensitivity to magnetic fields thanks to a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. “There are trade-offs in all aspects of physical reality,” explains Iannis Kominis, an associate professor at the University of Crete in Greece, whose research has focused on quantum sensing and quantum biology in parallel for 15 years. A key trade-off in quantum mechanics isHeisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which limits how precisely you can pin down two variables, such as energy and time – the better the handle you have on one, the less you have on the other. If you follow this line of maths and logic to its natural conclusions, and given the time it takes for a physical process to happen, then you eventually land on a tiny but finite quantum of energy below which you cannot go. Since a measurement must be accompanied by an exchange of energy, this places a fundamental limit on the achievable sensitivity – whether that comes from a quantum device operating in a lab at cryogenic temperatures or a protein in a bird’s eye. Earlier this year, Kominis, together with an undergraduate student at the university, EfthymiosGkoudinakis, showed that the limit isrespected in the animal kingdom, although the sensitivity achieved with the radical pair mechanism could get very close to this limit.“It seems that nature has devised quantum technology before us, and that doesn’t sound that crazy, right?” says Kominis. “The opposite would mean that we are smarter than nature.” He also suggests that where the sensitivity achieved is not so close to the limit, there is room to advance quantum sensing technology using “the IP from mother nature to try to make a better product”.Quantum calculations have also highlighted potential evidence in favour of the radical pair effect through the response of birds to magnetic “noise”. Calculations show that the radical pair electrons are actually swapping between “spin” states at specific frequencies, which means that the birds could become disoriented if exposed to a magnetic field fluctuating at those frequencies. “It’s not often that you can sit at your computer and do some quantum mechanical calculations and predict how an animal is going to behave,” adds Hore.View image in fullscreenA northern wheatear, Oenanthe oenanthe, in flight at the Parc Naturel Régional d’Armorique, Brittany, France. The bird is a summer visitor to the British Isles.Photograph: BIOSPHOTO/AlamyIt was 10 years ago that Hore collaborated with Henrik Mouritsen and his colleagues at Germany’s University of Oldenburg, showing that robins are disoriented in the presence ofurban electromagnetic noise– although the birds were sensitive to levels of noise below those the calculations had suggested. Mouritsen and his colleagues are now testing the frequencies at which a bird becomes disoriented. So far, these tally rather well with what has been calculated for the radical pair mechanism, but Hore explains such behavioural tests are time consuming, partly since they can only be conducted during migration season.Although Hore and Liedvogel are cautious of suggesting the case is closed, the accruing data on bird behaviour, their proteins and the radical pair effect do seem to be converging on an explanation for birds’ sensitivity to magnetic fields. If correct, it amounts to an incredible feat of quantum sensing achieved not in some hi-tech cryogenic lab but in the messy organic environment of a bird’s eye. “I certainly do look at birds in a different light,” says Hore. “The term ‘bird brain’ is normally an insult – I now think of it as a compliment.”Explore more on these topicsScienceThe ObserverPhysicsBirdsWildlifeAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When will ministers wake up?John HarrisA day with a care worker in Bury showed me the intolerable pressures of her life – and then I heard the news of a new squeeze on benefitsSun 23 Mar 2025 08.08 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 10.48 EDTShareJust under a fortnight ago,my working day beganat 6.45am, on a silent cul-de-sac near Bury, in Greater Manchester. I was there to shadow Julia, a domiciliary care worker, on her daily morning rounds. She was about to let herself into the home of a 93-year-old woman. “She’ll be asleep in bed,” Julia told me. In 30 packed minutes, she had to wake her up, get her dressed, deal with any overnight accidents and mishaps, make her breakfast and “have a good chat with her, and get her communicating”.Julia was in the middle of a seven-day working week, with between 10 and 15 “clients” to look after on each shift: elderly people, mostly, but also a 42-year-old mum of two recovering from a stroke. And as we drove from house to house, she explained the tension that runs through her working life: between the squeezed budgets that dictate how she does her job, and the profoundly human needs that she has to see to.In all our conversations, a few key themes were present. Bury council, like so many local authorities, is in dire straits. Just over a year ago, it declared that it was in a state of “financial distress”, and there are no signs of anything improving. Its care spending is impossibly stretched; the people who deliver such a vital service are usually paid £12 an hour, and their workloads are mind-boggling. Spreadsheets drawn up by local bureaucrats dictate the quickfire schedules that have to be followed, and the few moments when care workers can find time for meaningful human contact.To cap it all, with the start of a new financial year, the company Julia works for is about to be hit by Rachel Reeves’s rise in employers’ national insurance contributions. Only last week,Labour voted down Liberal Democrat amendmentsto the relevant legislation aimed at exempting hospices, GP surgeries and care providers from the increase, soa huge jump in costsis about to hit all those services. In Bury, as with lots of other places, that might push the kind of work Julia does to breaking point.In the early afternoon, I paid a visit to the offices of Homecare Services, the company that employs her, and spoke to Leanne, one of its managers. In its two-room offices in the centre of the town of Ramsbottom, there was a palpable sense of emergency. “Our accountants are looking to see how long we can hold on for before we have to say enough’s enough, and give notice to the local authority,” she said. “There’s only so long you can pay the wages if you’re not getting the funding.” She paused. “The social care sector will break … it’ll maybe sustain [itself] for a matter of months before people close down.”We were a long way from Whitehall, but it was clear how decisions made in the all-powerful Treasury are playing out in people’s everyday lives. As usual, reports about this week’s spring financial statement and the likelihood of even more bad news have centred onReeves’s fiscal rulesand predictions made by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but there is a much more human story woven into everything. In the real world, mounting numbers of people are simply scared. Many are also baffled about why ministers are constantly averting their eyes from the human costs of their decisions.2:03Keir Starmer defends calling benefit cuts plan 'moral' – videoSince thecutting of pensioners’ winter fuel payments last year, the government has developed a habit of behaving like that. Senior Labour people no longer speak the language of hope, or even reassurance. Increasingly, this feels like an administration that exists to enforce fiscal orthodoxy and issue bureaucratic edicts framed by abstractions: “tough decisions”, the need to “kickstart the economy” and an all-consuming quest to “bring stability to the public finances”.Which brings us to a story that began to boil over when I got back from that social care trip: all thoseproposed cuts in disability and sickness benefits. Last week, I spoke to someone from the National Autistic Society about what the much-reported “tightening” of people’s eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip) would mean for the daily living component of the benefit, which is one of those about to be hacked back.Here, once again, was a story about complicated human lives being subject to metrics so cold and impersonal that they look almost absurd. When they are assessed, people are given a series of marks between zero and 12 for their ability to do things summarised inso-called descriptors, such as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” or “needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to wash or bathe”. In the current system – and how surreally bureaucratic is this? – a minimum score of eight entitles people to the lower rate of £72.65 a week, while a total score of 12 or over entails the higher weekly rate of £108.55.Social care sector faces collapse as NICs and wage rises loom, providers warnRead moreBut not any more, if the government gets its way. To quote fromthe new benefits green paper, “only those who score a minimum of four points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip”. What that ignores is people with more nuanced needs whose deficits and impairments nonetheless amount to something real and debilitating, which is often true of learning disabilities or autism. We have ended up, in other words, with a redefinition of disability completely driven by the need to save cash.When the Tories were in charge, there was a clear narrative about their brand of austerity, and how awfully they treated so many vulnerable people: it was to do with the cruelties and ignorance that come with privilege. NowLabouris in power, the story has changed: there is a clear sense of Labour being the party of bureaucrats and bean counters, still clinging to the old statist idea that society’s complexities can be captured in statistics, and policy should be all about technocratic efficiency and competence. We can now see the results of that thinking: a profoundly unempathetic style of government, disconnected from the messiness and complexity of real life.Given that there is a lot of talk about changes to special educational needs provision andreform plans for the NHS, we should worry about what the government might focus on next. Equally alarming, it seems to me, is a belief in Downing Street that reviving the UK demands embracing the wonders of artificial intelligence, whichKeir Starmer believeswill have an almost magical effect on everything from social work to education, and realise his new dream of “totally rewiring government”. Because this is an administration so lacking in everyday humanity, that is a much more scary prospect than he and his colleagues seem to realise.John Harris is a Guardian columnistJohn Harris’s new book, Maybe I’m Amazed: A Story of Love and Connection in 10 Songs, is published this Thursday.

To which you might retort: so what? Everyone knows the weekly bout of mouth-to-mouth combat between prime minister and leader of the opposition is a theatrical ritual. The typical voter deplores it as a load of yah-boo, signifying nothing. Only a small minority of the public tune in on a consistent basis.Mrs Badenoch’s problem is that PMQs is taken seriously by two audiences that should be important to the Tory leader. One is made up of Westminster reporters and commentators. Their verdict about who has “won” PMQs influences the overall judgment about whether a leader has forward momentum or is going nowhere. The other critical audience is made up of MPs. They crowd into the chamber for a ringside seat at the prize fight. A robust performance by a leader energises them, while a flop disheartens. More often than not, the Tory leader sends her side away feeling deflated. They were led to expect better from someone who was marketed on the basis that she had a zesty and combative personality. “She was hired because it was thought she would kick ass,” remarks a Conservative veteran. During the Tory leadership contest last autumn, one of the claims made for her by supporters was that she’d rattle SirKeir Starmer. He leaves his encounters with the Tory leader looking distinctly unrattled.Used well by the leader of the opposition, PMQs is an opportunity in parliamentary primetime to make themselves relevant to the national conversation, prosecute their case against the government and showcase themselves as a potential prime minister. After nearly five months in the role, Mrs Badenoch is still struggling to get the hang of it. Where she needs to be fresh, agile and rapier-like, she is nearly always a predictable, clunking blunderbuss. She tends to be a bit better when sheconcentratesher fire on one topic, but often takes a wildly scattergun approach. There have also been quite a lot of occasions when she has appeared surprisingly ill-prepared. Given the many troubles crowding in on the government, and given that the Labour leader is not the most sizzling performer in this format, she lands a blow on him much less often than Conservative MPs would like. As her most recent joust with Sir Keir illustrated, one of the Tory leader’s handicaps is that she has yet to find a way of framing questions about tax, spending and growth that he cannot simply swat aside by responding “they crashed the economy”, whilescorning herfor being a policy-free zone “carping from the sidelines”.It has become painfully obvious to Tory MPs that the prime minister isn’t losing any sleep worrying about Mrs Badenoch. With a grimspring financial statementcoming up and a tricky vote onreductions to disability benefitsto follow, the prime minister is more troubled by incoming brickbats from his own side than he is by the leader of the Tory party. Muttering about her performances seems to be getting to Mrs Badenoch. At a recent PMQs, she responded to ridicule from the prime minister by accusing him of “being patronising”. That he is, often dismissing her for failing “to do her homework”. But it is a mistake for the Tory leader to complain in this fashion because it concedes that she can be patronised.She is not the worst I have seen. That would be Iain Duncan Smith when he led the Tories in opposition in the early years of this century. Infamously croaky, IDS’s frequent humiliations at the dispatch box contributed to his rapid demise as Tory leader. Westminster folklore remembers William Hague as a master gladiator. He took the role in the wake of a landslide defeat for his party – so in circumstances not that dissimilar to those in which Mrs Badenoch finds herself. Though up against Tony Blair when that Labour prime minister was in his pomp, Mr Hague often got the better of their clashes because his sallies were sharply crafted to expose his opponent’s weaknesses, and came salted with a lot of wit. The jokes were sufficiently well-designed and landed to get Labour MPs to laugh with him at the expense of their government. This kept up Tory spirits when all else seemed bleak for the party. That helped him survive in the job.One of her failings has been to shrink from a full acknowledgment of the reasons that inspired so many voters to loathe her partyBeing poor at PMQs is hazardous to Mrs Badenoch’s political health because nothing else is looking good for her either. The latestpoll of pollshas the Tories languishing at 22 points. That puts them third behind Labour and Reform with a vote share even lower than it was at lastJuly’s election. Donors closing chequebooks or defecting to Reform have triggered morale-sapping job losses at Conservative HQ. Once a darling with Tory members, Mrs Badenoch’s standing among them has dived to the point where the ConservativeHome league tableplaces her behindmost of her (almost entirely unknown) shadow cabinet. On Thursday, she launched her party’s campaign for theMay local elections. With 1,600 council seats in play, along with six mayoralties, she declared that the contest would be “extremely difficult” for her party.That’s not a rousing message to put fire in the bellies of what is left of the Tory activist base.It is true, of course, that any leader would face a monumental challenge rebuilding the party in the wake of the most calamitous defeat in its long history while fending off Nigel Farage’s bid to become the primary voice of the right. Supporters plead that it is too early to judge Mrs Badenoch. “She’s still learning the game,” says one sympathetic senior Tory. More restive Conservative MPs retort that five months is enough to decide that she’s a dud. They are beginning to speculate how long she has left before their notoriously regicidal party decides to try something different.She likes topresent herselfas someone who will tell hard truths “even when it is difficult to hear”. Yet one of her failings has been to shrink from a full and frank acknowledgment of the host of reasons that inspired so many voters to so loathe her party. She has criticised predecessors for breaking their promises to lower immigration and chastised their approach to Brexit while declining to repudiate Brexit itself. That’s been about it for atonement. She has flinched from recognising that Boris Johnson debauched standards in public life nor has she expressed regret for cheering on Liz Truss as she blew up the national finances. The Tory leader has not offered the comprehensive, deck-clearing, line-drawing apology to the country that is required before voters are likely to be willing to give the Conservatives a hearing.Her attempts to attract attention come tinged with desperation, as when shemade the Truss-ish declarationto one rightwing audience that the survival of “our country and all of western civilisation” depends on the revival of the Conservative party. If that is really the case, “western civilisation” is in more trouble than I feared. It sounded like wilful contrarianism, rather than a considered position, when last week she made the assertion, without evidence, that itwill be “impossible” to achieve net zeroby 2050.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She evinces next to no interest in the kind of voter who defected from the Conservatives to Labour or the Lib Dems. “If you’re going to panic, panic about the Lib Dems, for God’s sake,” says one Tory MP. Moving closer to Farageiste positions and associating her party with Donald Trump’s Maga movement is unlikely to be attractive to centrist voters. If shifting further right is designed to win back voters attracted to Reform, it is failing. She has sometimes played into Mr Farage’s hands bystarting fightsabout which of their parties has the fewest members and whether or not politicians should do reality TV shows. I’d say he won both of those little spats. Some Tories are now openly saying that they should strike some kind of Faustian bargain with the Reform leader to “unite the right”. Mrs Badenoch sets her face against that, but will find the pressure ratcheting up unless she can convince fellow Tories that she possesses a viable route map to recovery.As for PMQs, you can say that being adept at that ultimately did a fat lot of good for William Hague. He still led the Tories to an election defeat. But Mrs Badenoch might note that at least he survived long enough to get to fight one.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionConservative leadershipConservativesKeir StarmerNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Hence the pressing urgency of identifying £5bn of welfare cuts. Hence, lest we forget, the slashing of the UK’s already denuded aid budget, to pay for increased defence spending.It all looks perfectly sensible within the framework Labour has set for itself. And the bond market worry can’t be easily dismissed: the UK is already spending £100bn a year on debt interest.Nevertheless, viewed from a wider angle, the idea of responding to this profoundly uncertain moment for the world with nip-and-tuck spending cuts, looks at best like a holding position, and at worst like a pointlessly destructive act.And while bond market jitters may be a legitimate reason to be wary of plunging deeper into the red – for example by “doing a Germany” and excluding defence spending from debt rules – opting for spending cuts, rather than tax rises, is a political choice.Economists, including many previously supportive of Reeves’s approach, have lined up in recent days to issue warnings against wielding the scalpel too hastily.Gemma Tetlow, of the Institute for Government, advised the chancellor against “reaching for little bits and pieces to try and get the numbers to just about add up”.The former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane used an article in the FT article to warn against allowing“Treasury orthodoxy”to dominate Reeves’s thinking.“With the economy stalled, further fiscal belt-tightening is impossible to justify on macroeconomic grounds,” he wrote.And while the forecasts are by their nature highly uncertain, the impact of the welfare cuts and the wider spending squeeze will be concrete, as impact assessments set to be published alongside the spring statement will show.With the pressure for higher defence spending in the UK only likely to increase, the row about benefits, which followed Anneliese Dodds’ resignation over aid cuts, is likely to be a mere foretaste of the clashes ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Campaigners say this will be a key baseline, against which to track Labour’s progress in improving the lives of the poorest in society. In particular, the data is expected to show that the number of children in larger families living in poverty has increased, as more are caught in the net of the pernicious two-child limit.Charities are also expecting to see evidence that Scotland’s anti-child poverty policy, which includes anadditional Scottish child payment of £26.70 a weekto low-income households, is having a positive effect.As Save the Children’s executive director for advocacy, Dan Paskins, told me, “it will show the scale of the challenge, but also show what are the things that a government that is genuinely serious about tackling child poverty can do to reduce it – and we can then draw conclusions about whether government does that, or doesn’t”.The long-awaited child poverty strategy is now expected in June. But such is the caution about cost that Paskins says experts who work on this issue are now genuinely asking themselves, “Is this going to be the first ever Labour government under which child poverty is higher at the end of its term in office than at the start?”Of course, if Labour decides that something has to give, there are alternative revenue-raisers within the constraints of those pre-election promises, but they either involve an array of small yet hotly controversial changes (see farmers’ inheritance) or big and untried levies that would take time to implement.Breaching the tax pledges would be risky, even with Trump’s disruptive power to point to as an explanation. But clinging to them even as the world has changed risks leaving Labour cast adrift from its principles.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025Economics viewpointEconomic policyTax and spendingEconomicsRachel ReevesLabourChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

There is a real danger of getting the wrong end of the stick when we get enthusiastic about other nations’ lifestyles – such as when the New York Times writes about modern Britons enjoyingboiled muttonfor lunch, or“cavorting” in swamps, and we all get cross – but this comes straight from the Viking’s mouth.That’s Meik Wiking, the perfectly named chief executive of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen.Writing in Stylist, Wiking suggests we consider adopting a Norwegian concept that requires no blankets or candles:dugnadsånd, approximately translated as “community spirit”. He likensdugnadsåndto barn-raising in 18th- and 19th-century North America, describing a “collective willingness of people to come together in the context of community projects – emphasising cooperation and selflessness”.Could it catch on here? In a way, it already has. There aren’t many barns that need raising in 2025, but our communities definitely need and rely on collective action. With bare-bones budgets, threadbare public services and cuts, cuts, cuts, community spirit is already at least partly responsible for ensuring hungry children are fed, effluent discharged into our waterways is highlighted (why is this a thing?) and refugees are welcomed, among other things.There is a very fair question to be asked about whether, really,individuals and communities should be plugging those gaping holes. To British ears,dugnadsåndcould evoke a dread echo of David Cameron’s “big society” – the expedient outsourcing of the state’s obligations to a patchwork of charitable and voluntary organisations when what really needs to happen is for very rich people and corporations to pay vastly more tax.But if I’ve graspeddugnadsåndcorrectly, from what Wiking writes, it is mostly more modest: neighbours helping neighbours, communities clearing rubbish or creating playgrounds. Anyone can be the beneficiary, as well as the giver. “Helping each other out through reciprocation made the whole community stronger, more resilient and, I would argue, also happier,” he says.I can well believe that, because there’s hard evidence that volunteering is good for you.A 2023 review of 28 studies on volunteeringconcluded there was “consistent evidence to support effects on general health and wellbeing and quality of life”; there is even evidence of “reduced mortality”. Social prescribers refer clients for volunteering opportunities, because believing that you have something to contribute, and acting on it, feels good. Reciprocity is baked in, because everyone benefits.I know how that feels. I have been a trustee of a local environmental charity for the past few years, and while I rarely feel particularly helpful and sometimes actively the opposite (especially facing budget spreadsheets), I always feel less despairing when I’m there – not least because it has shown me how many people will cheerfully pick nappies and Monster cans out of freezing mud, or do itchy, sweaty battle with invasive plants. My husband (who actually has useful skills) gets something similar from his slots at the local repair cafe: not every lamp or toaster gets fixed, but there is a sense of building something.It also feels like training for what lies ahead. When government in Britain is bitterly disappointing and in other places is actively, enthusiastically furthering the end of the world, there will certainly be more, and worse, natural disasters and doubtless more human-made ones. Do we really want to try to survive them atomised, sitting on stockpiles of tinned goods? In the New York Times, an exploration of howthe horrifying current political climate has supercharged intellectual interest in the idea of solidarityincluded a description of it that stuck with me: “a distinctive and delicate form of intimacy”. Itisintimate, also vulnerable, to accept and express when we need help; to want to offer it but not know how, or to feel inept when we do; to accept we need each other.Dugnadsånd– practical solidarity, really – seems like a way of practising that, of training our collective thinking, collective action, but also our collective vulnerability muscles. It is either that, or it’s something completely different – over to you, Norway.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For subtle discussion of diversity, equity and inclusion, talk to Lorraine KellySun 23 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 07.39 EDTShareIn the second world war, Navajo code talkers transmitted sensitive US military information in their own undocumented language. Which was nice of them, as their immediate ancestors had been dispossessed and destroyed by white settlers, and then had all their waterpoisoned with uranium. “Were it not for the Navajos,” concluded major Howard Connor, at the time, “the marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.” And thatfamous photoof the American soldiers raising a flag would just have shown some Japanese boy scouts letting off a party popper.But last month Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said: “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength’.” Predictably, some Navajo code talkers had to have bodyguards to protect them from white American servicemen who thought they were Japanese. Plus ça change, as they say over there in that Europe.The Navajos’ efforts went unrecognised. When the son of one of the code talkers got to live the American dream by opening a Burger King in Kayenta on Navajo lands in 1986, he made the buildinga partial museumof his father’s unit. I visited it 30 years ago, with the comedian Kevin Eldon (Narvi the dwarf smith in TV’sThe Lord of the Rings: The Ringsof Power), and it remains the most edifying fast food restaurant I ever ate in. It was even better than that KFC near Bletchley Park that does that delicious Alan Turing chicken strips and alphabetti spaghetti meal deal ™ ®.Despite the fun-size fascism we’re seeing across the Atlantic, the woke folk panic still sells papers and farms online engagementThe Kayenta Burger King also has a more extensive archive of code talker artefacts than any official government repository. Especially since, last week, videos, photos and stories of the Navajo code talkers were temporarily removed online as part of Trump’s assault on diversity. A page commemorating corporal Ira Hayes, a Pima of the Gila River Indian Community, and one of the servicemen photographed raising that Stars and Stripes at Iwo Jima, also disappeared for a while in Trump’s thwarting of the woke. Boris Johnson must be delighted. But I wonder if Trump’s actions please the British daytime TV treasure Lorraine Kelly?Kelly’s interview in theTimeson 14 March, culled from a book promotion appearance on Times Radio, seemed to suggest she believed gender and racial diversity are wrongly prioritised in the workplace at the expense of offering opportunities to the (presumably white) working class. The headline spoke for itself: “Lorraine Kelly: Diversity push is leaving working-class people behind.” Was our Lorraine an unexpected supporter of Trump’s anti-diversity agenda?Probably not. This is the rightwing press, or the press as I call it, that we’re talking about, and Kelly didn’t quite espouse the view the headline implies. Even the elements of the radio interview that the paper chose to transcribe show a Lorraine Kellyprincipallyconcerned about how the cost of living affects working-class access to media jobs, and she made explicit that she hoped to see diversity initiatives tackle exclusion on the basis of classin additionto concentrating on gender and race. It’s a subtly different position and an example of the nuanced thought that has made Kelly the Socrates of the sofa, while her competitor Richard Madeley stares out of his kitchen window at a donkey in a field while thinking about bread.But this is how papers work. For two decades I was lucky enough to review records (remember them?) for theSunday Times.So when they asked me, 20 years back, to write an insider comedian’s view of attempts to boycott the Edinburgh comedy awards because the sponsor, Perrier, was owned by Nestlé, which pushed unsafe formula milk initiatives to the developing world, what could possibly go wrong? And the money didn’t hurt either!I wrote a balanced piece about how the boycott was morally the right thing to do, with the appended caveat that high-profile supporters were asking a lot of young broke performers to walk away from a cash bung of £10,000 that might shift at least some of their debts. The headline? “‘Emma Thompson needs to grow up’, says comedian Stewart Lee”, which wasn’t anything I said, but perhaps fitted the paper’s agenda better, and left me apologising, cap in hand, to the charity Baby Milk Action and Miss Thompson herself, who has conspicuously failed to cast me in any of her hit films since.Despite the fun-size fascism we’re seeing across the Atlantic, the woke folk panic still sells papers and farms online engagement. TheTimesgot what it wanted out of massaging Kelly’s quotes, and in the US the fourth estate is finished, jeopardising democracy worldwide. Maybe it’s time for writers to work out what they believe and stand up for it. But the British press is staffed by a class of professionals happy to drift between theTimes,theTelegraph,theNew Europeanand yes, even the last liberal papers, refining their opinions as required by their offshore billionaire employers. It’s as easy as changing the look of your byline photo from sensible suit and tie to a beatnik polar neck jumper and beard. And that’s just the women. These days.Ironically, some wag at theTimeshas chosen to illustrate Kelly’s interview with an old photo of her GMTV colleague, the black fitness expert Mr Motivator, holding her aloft on the roof of a building. Presumably there were dozens of more motivated white working-class Mr Motivators, but the woke agenda meant they never got the opportunity to lift a Scottish woman. Let’s see if we can’t see a white working-class TV fitness instructor raising Lorraine Kelly high above their head by the end of 2025, but ideally let’s do it without playing into the divisive playbook of Trump, Musk, Vance and Farage, apportioning blame to the disadvantaged, while consolidating their own chrome-plated futures.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionSecond world warNative AmericansStewart LeeRaceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

If Reform is the answer, she may have to goSun 23 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 15.38 EDTShareKemi Badenoch may only be four months into her leadership, but already Westminster is talking about her successor. Nigel Farage declared over the weekend that the Conservative party leader would be“lucky to survive past June”. Of course, hewouldsay that. The Reform UK leader has a personal interest in Tory misfortune. But more concerning for Badenoch is that some in her own party are starting to ask if she’ll still be leader at the next election.Her problems are piling up. The Toriesregularly come thirdin national polls behind Reform and Labour. There is little money to go around (despite a spurt in Tory donations late last year) and redundancies at Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) are seen as inevitable. Badenoch’s performances at prime minister’s questions are regularly criticised among Tory MPs for being too scatter-gun and missing open goals. The May local elections will be the first electoral test of her leadership – and CCHQ sources are attempting some serious expectation management as they warn of losses.But perhaps worst of all for Badenoch, there are simply plenty of figures on the right who never wanted her to be party leader and have even less time for her now. Alongside Farage, rarely a week passes without Dominic Cummings – the former leave campaign supremo – taking to social media or his Substackto criticise Badenoch, recently suggesting “it’s better for the country when she’s playing iPad games all day than playing ‘policy’.” The factCummings met Faragefor dinner a few months ago has spurred excited chatter that a rightwing coup could soon be under way to push Badenoch aside. Her critics are a mix of those who find her too abrasive and those who think her shadow cabinet is too one-nation and lacks the bite to take on Reform.However, this talk has not yet caught on too widely within the party. “I don’t think she is doing that well but she’s not going anywhere at the moment,” says a former cabinet minister. Others point to her performance last week – in which she announcednet zero was “impossible” by 2050and launched a series of policy commissions – as evidence that things are improving. While Badenoch has been accused by the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore of going back on a pledge she made to a group of MPs in 2022 to back the net zero target, many of the current intake welcome the move as a way of taking the fight to Reform. “Her position is much stronger than a few weeks ago,” says a member of the shadow cabinet. Even the Badenoch critics are keen to downplay talk of her imminent exit. “Angela Rayner has saved Kemi,” says one Conservative source, pointing to the limited number of local council elections after local government changes. “The most difficult votes have been postponed so May won’t be the crunch point.”Yet while the Tory mood is far from regicidal, there are long-term questions being asked about Badenoch’s leadership. “There are things she should do to increase her survivability,” says one Tory MP. “Net zero was one good thing in a desert of five months – and she needs the self-awareness to understand that and then the ability to respond.”But the first step is perhaps understanding the forces that will be working against her. As well as the odd explosion from Cummings or Farage, Badenoch has to contend with the likely launch of a campaign group in the next few weeks that will argue for an electoral pact between Reform and the Tories. For now, the campaign is loosely referred to as “unite the right”. However, a different official title is expected – to be revealed at the launch.On paper, a mix of supporters of Reform and theConservativespointing at the polling and making the point that there could be an argument for the two parties working together isn’t that sinister. However, the reason this poses a threat to Badenoch is that she has come out firmly against a pact and there is no love lost between her and Farage. “If we have to work with Nigel – and the current polls suggest the Reform vote is too sticky to not – you can’t have Kemi as leader,” says a former government adviser. They argue that Badenoch’s leadership style is too abrasive, even if she did change tack.It’s here that a game of fantasy leader tends to happen. Names being floated as Reform-friendly Tory leaders include Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick. Jenrick – who lost to Badenoch in the leadership contest – is these days seen as the most likely successor were Badenoch to go. While the shadow justice secretary has his critics – particularly among Badenoch loyalists – he is slowly but surely winning round some through his hard work. He is far and away the shadow minister making the biggest impact when it comes to social media, policy work and setting the news agenda.“Some of the shadow cabinet are jealous of Rob [Jenrick] as he keeps making news but he is also working a lot harder,” argues a Tory MP. A Jenrick ally adds: “Rob is willing to work all hours unlike some – and it shows.” Others pine for Boris Johnson – but for now this is yet to be a real movement. “It’s the same people as before talking up Boris and they will say, ‘Oh, he stopped Farage,’” says one Tory MP. “He also oversaw increased legal migration.”It’s why, for now, Badenoch’s inner-circle plan to ignore the noise and focus on showing MPs they have a plan through their actions. “It’s the same people mouthing off. They’re like the Japanese soldiers who didn’t know the second world war had ended and were trying to keep it going,” says a Badenoch ally. Instead, Badenoch hopes that the cracks appearing in the Reform party sinceRupert Lowe’s exitmean most of the drama will be coming from the other side.Yet there are small signs that the Tory leader recognises she will need all the friends she can get in the long term: she has recently started lunches with MPs after prime minister’s questions. Given Badenoch takes issues with sandwiches (previouslytelling me they were not a real food), the food of choice is pizza. She ultimately knows that while she has breathing space for now, that will change if she can’t point to progress in the coming year. If the Tories stay third in the polls, her critics won’t find it too hard to win supporters for their cause.Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political editorExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionConservativesNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Experts lostAustin SaratThe governor dismissed an ex-judge studying the death penalty in the state and failed to heed a leading voice on the matter. It’s no surpriseSun 23 Mar 2025 09.32 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 09.33 EDTShareOn Wednesday, 19 March, Arizonaexecuted Aaron Gunches by lethal injection. As ABC Newsreports, he was put to death for “kidnapping and killing 40-year-old Ted Price by shooting him four times in the Arizona desert”.Gunches’s case was unusual in many ways, not least that he stopped his legal appeals and volunteered to be executed, then changed his mind before changing it again. His execution was scheduled to be carried out almost two years ago. Itwas put on holdwhen the Arizona governor, Katie Hobbs,commissioned an independent review of the state’s death penalty procedures after a series of botched executions.But over the last several months, she pushed hard to make sure Gunches died for his crime. She evenfired the expert retired Judge David Duncan who she had chosen to do that review, before he could complete his report.Her decision to let Duncan go was shocking. At the time, sheoffered the following explanation: “Your review has, unfortunately, faced repeated challenges, and I no longer have confidence that I will receive a report from you that will accomplish the purpose and goals of the Executive Order that I issued nearly two years ago.”The governor also noted that the department of corrections, rehabilitation & reentry had conduct “a comprehensive review of prior executions and has made significant revisions to its policies and procedures”. But doubt about whether she could rely on a review conducted by the group which is in charge of the state’s executions in why she appointed Duncan in the first place.That is why I suspect that Hobbs tossed Duncan aside because she didn’t like the facts he was finding or the conclusions he seemed to be reaching.Facts are stubborn things, but, in our era, they can be tossed aside with little political cost and no regret. Why rely on expertise if it gets in the way of achieving a result you want to reach?Still, Hobbs’s unprecedented decision to “kill the messenger” was another low moment for a society increasingliving by a line uttered by a newspaper editor in the classic movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence: “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”In the world of capital punishment, the “legend” to which politicians like Hobbs are attached is that it can make America a safer and more just place. They want us to believe that they embrace the death penalty to bring closure to family members of murder victims rather than to accrue political capital.Note what Arizona attorney general Kris Mayessaid during a news conference following the execution: “An execution is the most serious action that the state takes, and I assure you that it is not taken lightly. Today, Arizona resumed the death penalty, and justice for Ted Price and his family was finally served.”After Gunches’s death, the sister of the man he murderedechoedthat sentiment. Karen Price called the execution “the final chapter in a process that has spanned nearly 23 years”.Ted Price’s daughter added that Gunches’s deathmeans that she will no longer have to revisit“the circumstances surrounding my father’s death” as she had to for over two decades of seemingly endless legal proceedings. “Today,” she said, “marks the end of that painful chapter, and I couldn’t be more grateful”.That chapter would not have ended if Governor Hobbs had been willing to listen to her own expert.Before being sacked, JudgeDuncan prepared a draft of his report and wrote a letter to the governor’s office previewing his conclusions. He called lethal injection an unreliable method of execution and said: “Drug manufacturers don’t allow states to use the appropriate drugs.”Political leaders know they can play into the burgeoning culture of disrespect for what experts have to sayDuncan had spent nearly two years reviewing Arizona’s use of lethal injections. As heexplained, “Early on, I thought lethal injection would work. The more I learned about it I learned that that was a false hope.”Duncan told the governor that, in his view, using lethal injection was too risky. In his view, the best course would be forArizonato adopt the firing squad because “it has the lowest botch rate.”That was not the news Hobbs hoped her expert would deliver, so shelet Duncan go. It seems he just didn’t understand that she wanted him to ease the way toward a resumption of lethal injection executions rather than suggesting that the state should not execute anyone until it could adopt what he considered to be a better method.And Duncan was not the only one raising questions about Arizona’s resumption of lethal injection executions. Last January, law professor Corinna Lain, a leading expert on lethal injection,said: “The evidence is overwhelming that Arizona cannot lawfully carry out an execution by lethal injection at this time. Its pentobarbital protocol is sure or very likely to cause a tortuous death even in the best of circumstances.”She went on to say: “The circumstances here are far from optimal. The State is on the cusp of using an inexperienced, untrained team to inject likely expired drugs stored in unmarked mason jars that were produced by a company that does not make drugs for human consumption and that will be compounded by a pharmacy that the … (the state) itself has previously disavowed.”Disregarding expert knowledge is very much in fashion in many areas of American life, not just where the death penalty is concerned. The Atlantic’s Tom Nicholsexplainsthat “Trump allies make noises about expert failures … [and] demonize what its constituents believe was the medical establishment’s attempt to curtail civil rights during the coronavirus pandemic.” He argues that Elon Musk’s attack on civil servants is really an attack on the “very notion of apolitical expertise.”But, as Nicholsexplains, such doubt is not confined to Washington DC. It is found in the “homes of ordinary American families”. There, “knowledge of every kind is also under attack. Parents argue with their child’s doctor over the safety of vaccines. Famous athletes speculate that the world might actually be flat. College administrators ponder dropping algebra from the curriculum because students keep failing it.”So, it is not surprising that the attack on knowledge would infect decisions about how to end the lives of people condemned to death. Political leaders – including Democrats like Hobbs – know they can play into the burgeoning culture of disrespect for what experts have to say, so they dispense with Duncan and ignore Lain.The more publicly they display that disrespect, the more politically they can benefit.It wasn’t always this way when decisions had to be made about methods of execution. At the end of the 19th century, before New York decided to abandon hanging, the state convened a commission to consider and recommend alternatives.That commission sought out the best minds to help them make their decision. It chose the electric chair.The decision whether electrocution “would be by Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC)”was informed by a competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, both pioneers in the development of electricity.That was then. Today, as the Arizona example shows, such expertise does not govern the choice of execution methods.In the wake of the Gunches execution, Governor Hobbs and the “down with experts crowd” may feel vindicated becausenothing seemed to have gone awry. But they should not rest easy, and neither should any of the 112 inmates on Arizona’s death row.Studies have shown that lethal injectionhas the worst track recordof any method of execution used in the last century in this country. That is why it is only a matter of time before an execution in Arizona proves the folly of ignoring experts and the insights they offer.Explore more on these topicsCapital punishmentOpinionArizonaUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In 2011, he smuglydismissedthe Chinese carmaker as unimpressive, its products unattractive and its technology “not very strong”. He’s not laughing now – and not just because Tesla’s stock has plummeted amid aboycottby motorists protesting against his embrace offar-rightpolitics. More pressingly, Mr Musk, like other western carmakers, has beenoutpacedby BYD.Last week, the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturerunveilednew charging technology that, it says, is capable of delivering 400km (249 miles) of driving range in just five minutes – as quick as filling up a petrol car. The system, released next month, will be fitted in two EVs, priced from 270,000 yuan (£29,000) – comparable to Tesla’s most affordable model in China. Yet BYD claims toquadrupleTesla’s kilometres-per-minute charging rate. Technological supremacy at a competitive price may help to explain whyBYDnow sells seven times as many cars in China asTesla.A lack of fast-charginginfrastructuremaydelayBYD’s progress in the west. But that shouldn’t diminish the scale of China’s technological advance. It was only in 2015 that Beijing launched itsMade in China 2025plan, targeting 10 strategic industries – including EVs – for rapid indigenous development. China’s approach follows a familiar playbook. Just as theUS once did, China shifted from exporting raw materials to becoming a manufacturing powerhouse by protecting domestic industries, acquiring foreign technology – sometimes dubiously – and prioritising exports. Taking cues from history, Beijing has used tariffs, subsidies and state investment to dominate industries from steel and electronics to EVs.When a country rapidly monopolises export markets, its industrial dominance becomes inevitable. That advantage has often hardened into a global stranglehold over key industries. With itscommandingedge inEVs, China’s leadership is poised to set the rules and dictate, on its own terms, the future of the technology. It did so on the cheap: BYD reportedly receivedChinese government subsidiesworth about a quarter of the $15bn that Mr Musk’sTesla obtained from US authorities.Thecasefor electric cars is clear. They cut emissions and pollution while preserving personal mobility. But the climate crisis raises a deeper question – not just how we power vehicles, but whether our reliance on them is sustainable. Switching to EVs is vital, but so is asking: do we need fewer car journeys, not just cleaner ones?Despite its lead in EVs, China’s30,000 milesof high-speed rail network offers a striking alternative. Meanwhile, Mr Musk’s transport visions often appear to beself-interestedsleights of hand. His high-speed transportation system,Hyperloop, was never meant to be built – its true success was in derailing California’s high-speed rail project. His Boring Company is building a 68-mileundergroundsystem in Las Vegas, primarily, it seems, because regulators agreed to minimal oversight.There’s an old joke about dictators: at least the trains run on time. Can a democracy taken over by oligarchs manage eventhat? China has high-speed rail; Mr Musk has acoupleof miles of tunnels under Nevada. But supposed “authoritarian competence” is not the answer. Only morecapable, more democratic government – the kind Mr Muskscorns– can reverse the US’s steady loss of economic, industrial, technological and governance competitiveness.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsOpinionTeslaChinaSelf-driving carsTravel and transportElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

But matchgoing supporters are right to be circumspectSun 23 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 15.52 EDTShareVisitors to Salford’s Lowry art gallery this summer will be able to enjoy a new take on one of the greatest paintings about sport. Depicting thousands of supporters bent purposefully towards a 1950s football stadium, LS Lowry’s Going to the Match has become part of the iconography of the national game. As part of its silver jubilee celebrations, the gallery is staging animmersive experienceof the painting, including a nostalgic soundtrack evoking the sounds of a lost world.So much for the past. Barely a mile away from the Lowry, at Manchester United’s Old Trafford base, it is the ghosts of football’s future that are being summoned up. To great fanfare, this month the club unveiled computer-generated images of Lowryesque hordes approaching the new £2bn stadium it hopes to build by 2030.Accommodating100,000 fans, and topped by three spires that will allegedly be visible from Liverpool, “New Trafford” is set to be the biggest and costliest football arena in Britain. Somewhat improbably, United’s co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested that the stadium and its vast surrounding leisure campus could become a global draw on a par with the Eiffel Tower.A project so gargantuan will undoubtedly be a catalyst for welcome economic growth in the wider Trafford area. The club is anticipating that substantial public funding can be unlocked to transform the stadium’s post-industrial hinterland.Enthusiasticnoises from the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, suggest that a substantial amount of cash may be forthcoming. But there is alreadycriticismthat the scheme could boost a billionaire tax exile’s business at taxpayers’ expense.The 2012 London Olympics demonstrated what sporting-led regeneration projects can achieve. But Manchester United supporters’ organisations, with good reason, areambivalentabout this brave new world. In the same week the initial stadium design was revealed, Sir Jimtoldinterviewers that Britain’s biggest football club had been at risk of going bust by Christmas. This was alarmist talk to justify deeply unpopular ticket price rises and internal cost-cutting. But the clubowesmore than £700m, largely thanks to the leveraged takeover by the US Glazer family 20 years ago, which piled a mountain of debt on to a previously debt-free institution.Funding one of the most expensive stadiums in world sport will ratchet up the financial pressure still further, and investors will demand handsome returns. The grim likelihood is that, one way or another, ordinary supporters end up footing the bill. Well-versed in the monetising ways of modern football, an already disillusioned fanbase will treat the club’s pledges of ticket affordability with understandable scepticism.Ultimately, of course, the success of “New Trafford” will depend on what happens on the field of play. In a caustic assessment of the plans, the Manchester MP Graham Stringerrecalleda visit in the 1960s to Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough ground, which had been recently modernised. As the home team trailed, a disgruntled local commented acidly that he was “still waiting for the bloody cantilever stand to score a goal”.In an age when elite football regularly shows signs of losing touch with the soul of the game, that nugget of northern wisdom offers a salutary reminder of core sporting priorities. As they dream of a“Wembley of the north”, while the men’s team continues to flounder on the pitch, the Glazers and Sir Jim should not lose sight of them.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedOpinionManchesterRegenerationeditorialsShareReuse this content"

However, they are simultaneously charged with solving the problem of those not in education, employment or training, and shoring up community adult education. The problem (specific to England) remains the outdated binary divide, with academic routes and qualifications occupying the privileged position and hampering efforts to offer student-centred accessible pathways.Way back in 1990, the Institute for Public Policy Research proposed a radical, all-encompassing British baccalaureate (not the half-arsedRishi Sunak proposalof the same name). This was a modular single qualification, a replacement across the ability range for academic and vocational pathways.Its intention was to shatter the hermetically sealed inflexible systems that prevented “academic” students from pursuing vocational interests, and vocational students from exploring academic areas of interest (beyond the thin gruel of GCSE English and maths retakes). It encouraged opportunities to mix academic and vocational modules in a common framework.I fear that if T-levels are the answer, we are still asking the wrong question.John ButcherProfessor emeritus, Open UniversityT-level bashing does not help recruitment. Some T-levels might not be working in some subject areas, but this is not true for all of them. For example, students on the T-level in digital production, design and development, where I teach, are well prepared for a wide range of careers in the digital sector. The problem we have is getting students interested in pursuing careers in digital. Sending the message that T-levels are a waste of time is not doing the sector any favours.This particular T-level course is better than the outdated BTec course it replaced. The content is more up to date and direct industry links are more visible.The approaches to teaching in vocational education make the course suitable for students who gain 4s and 5s at GCSE. All my students have gained 4s and 5s, some of them even 3s in GCSE English. All of them are navigating the T-level course with the support they require to achieve good grades. Universities are accepting this qualification as a route into many different computing-related courses.In some subject areas, T-levels might not fit the bill, but in others they are flourishing. Or at least they would be if the cloud of negativity was not being continually forced upon them.Karen AhmedLecturer in computing and IT, Southport CollegeDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Pep Guardiola was unimpressed about losing John Stones to injurywhen the Manchester City defender started both of England’s friendlies against Brazil and Belgium last year.However, while Tuchel had a similar view to Guardiola when he worked at club level, he stressed his priorities have shifted and there will be no favours when it comes to managing his side’s physical demands.The 51-year-old coach, whose options on the wing have been limited byAnthony Gordon withdrawing from the squadafter sustaining a hip injury during England’s 2-0 win against Albania on Friday, pointed out that Arsenal overlooked a chance to rest Declan Rice in thesecond leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against PSV Eindhoven.“Given the fact Declan Rice played after a 7-1 first leg the next match with Arsenal, I didn’t have the feeling that they think so much about us,” Tuchel said.View image in fullscreenTuchel insisted he can fit Phil Foden (pictured) into a team with Jude Bellingham.Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock“So I don’t think we have to break our heads about this. I take care about the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players: ‘Hey, you have tough matches coming up so I rest you now.’ We have a qualifier to play, we do what’s good for us, we monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs and we won’t take any unprofessional risks.“I feel responsible for the players. I don’t want the player to be injured, I want the players to play quarter‑finals of the Champions League because I want to watch it. We take care about us and the clubs take care about themselves and the main focus is taking care of the players.”A more pressing issue for Tuchel is finding the right balance in attack. He has a glut of creative players but he cannot fit them all into the team.

This is about our standards. How do we win, how do we play and how do we impose ourselves and deserve a win against Latvia? It’s to raise the standards.“There are a lot of No 10 positions. It’s just not possible we play all these No 10 positions. We have to get the process right to find the best group. If that means we leave very good and talented players out of the squad this can happen. In the next 16 months it is important we find the right team and not the most talented 26 players.”Tuchel said that Phil Foden, who struggled against Albania, is missing “confidence and flow” for club and country, yet he insisted that he can fit the City playmaker and Jude Bellingham into the same team, even though both want to play as No 10s.“One hundred per cent they can play together,” Tuchel insisted. “I don’t see one reason why they should not. The numbers of Phil are unbelievably good for Man City. They are not so good for the national team, so we need to try to build something to see the Phil Foden from Man City.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

However three hours after the flag, and in the wake of the usual post‑race inspection of the cars to ensure they are in compliance with regulations, Ferrari were found wanting over two clearly defined rules.The skid block on the floor of Hamilton’s car was deemed to have been 0.5mm below the limit, and Leclerc’s car was 1kg below the minimum weight requirement. Both drivers and team representatives were summoned to the stewards and afterwards theFormula Onegoverning body, the FIA, confirmed Ferrari had admitted culpability. “The team acknowledged that there were no mitigating circumstances and that it was a genuine error,” its findings read.Piastri wins F1 Chinese GP but woe for Ferrari as Hamilton and Leclerc disqualifiedRead moreBoth drivers were disqualified andFerrariissued a statement conceding their errors. “Car 16 [Leclerc’s] was found to be underweight by 1kg and car 44’s rearward skid wear was found to be 0.5mm below the limit. We will learn from what happened today and make sure we don’t make the same mistakes again. Clearly it’s not the way we wanted to end our Chinese GP weekend.”The margins for error are fine in both cases and teams will always look to come as close to the limit as possible for performance purposes, but Ferrari acknowledged they had incorrectly calculated the expected wear in Hamilton’s case. “With regard to Lewis’s skid wear, we misjudged the consumption by a small margin,” the team stated. “There was no intention to gain any advantage.”Ferrari argued that Leclerc had been caught out when the team opted to switch to a one-stop from a planned two‑stop strategy, which affected their pre-race weight calculations. “Charles was on a one-stop strategy today and this meant his tyre wear was very high, causing the car to be underweight,” Ferrari said in their statement. Other teams, including McLaren and Mercedes, also switched strategy mid-race without breaching the regulations.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneFerrariLewis HamiltonCharles LeclercMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

No one expected it to be anything other than straightforward for England. The Red Roses duly achieved a resounding six-try win in launching their attempt at a seventh successive title, but after scoring five first-half tries they stuttered after the break and waited until two minutes from time for a second-half score. “We left a bit out there,” the head coach, John Mitchell, conceded.England’s hot streak now stretches to 21 consecutive matches, since after the World Cup final defeat by New Zealand in 2022, but there was ultimately a lack of fluency here in York that may concern Mitchell, who celebrated his 61st birthday and ushered in what may become a special year with a win.Fran McGhie shines as Scotland hold on to edge out Wales in feisty thrillerRead moreIn 152 days’ time, England begin a home Rugby World Cup against the USA at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. It is inconceivable they could suffer the same fate of the men’s side of a decade ago, when Stuart Lancaster’s team failed to make it out of the pool. But they are sure to be tested in the tournament’s later stages, so this Six Nations will be about refining combinations and systems. After an uncertain start, Italy improved markedly, while England’s accuracy was not what they would have hoped.“It was a really good performance,” Mitchell said. “The objective was to build pressure on Italy … We started really well but we also knew we’d go through a period of the game when we’d have to work our way through it.“We let them off with a bit of poor execution but generally, I thought we stuck at it … I just think [it’s] combinations, getting used to each other.”The captain, Zoe Aldcroft, born down the road in Scarborough, said it was a “super special” day. “The crowd were fantastic and there were a lot of familiar faces which was lovely,” the blindside flanker said.“The first half was really good, just then a little bit of [poor] execution. They had some good carries second-half and maybe we could have matched that. We’ll work on everything in that second half.”A blend of Italian nervousness and English precision led to a try bonus point being wrapped up before the half-hour. An errant Beatrice Rigoni pass gifted England an attacking scrum after which Mia Venner, on full debut, got the hosts up and running after three minutes, the full-back Emma Sing converting.Emily Scarratt scored the second and, although the excellent Rosie Galligan then knocked on in seemingly scoring a third, the Italy hooker Laura Gurioli was sent to the sin-bin for coming in at the side and a penalty try was awarded anyway. Holly Aitchison soon pumped a high kick to Claudia MacDonald, who snaffled it and scurried around the cover to score.View image in fullscreenEmma Sing adds two of her individual 11-point haul.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersScrum-caps off to Italy, though, they refused to buckle, and on their first visit to England’s 22 they shoved the No 8 Francesca Sgorbini over the try‑line. When Amy Cokayne added a fifth try before half-time no one would have believed that England would subsequently remain scoreless until the 78th minute. But that is what happened. Sgorbini was later denied a second try owing to an infringement by Beatrice Veronese.Mitchell, who revealed after the game that he has confirmed internally his selection for the first two matches, including the visit to Cardiff next week, began to unload his bench, and the appearance of Hannah Botterman and Sarah Bern was ominous for Italy.With a quarter of an hour left, though, the contest had become scrappy and the crowd were contemplating a second Mexican wave. The introduction of Ellie Kildunne, another Yorkshire-born Red Rose and the women’s world player of the year in 2024, visibly lifted home supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Job done and a victory to kick off a significant year. But Mitchell and his squad would have hoped for more after such a dominant first half.The Italy front-row Sara Seye said: “We had a good chat at half-time. We spoke about defence. We said we had to do the basics right and keep building … You know they’re a good side, with good players coming off the bench. You just have to get your mind off of that and be yourself – be Italy.”Expanding on his two-week selection policy, and what lies ahead before the World Cup, Mitchell added: “I like to plan. It would be stupid not to plan with what’s ahead in the year. A lot of thought’s gone into this, and we’ll be a better group for making sure everyone has purpose. We built pressure [today] but we also got some great examples of having to take some punches and deal with it.“We’ve got a squad that’s got started [against Italy], and another group that’s ready to go again next week. It’s all good. The Red Roses don’t sit still.” It wasn’t perfect, but England and Mitchell may be grateful for having had a proper test.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Six NationsEngland women's rugby union teamItaly women's rugby union teamWomen's rugby unionRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Relegation to the second tier of theNations Leagueis no disaster for Scotland. Indeed, it may be their natural habitat. It is just that the calamitous circumstances in which Clarke’s men crashed out of League A were alarming for anybody with an affiliation to Scotland.Greece outfought, outthought and outplayed their hosts at Hampden Park. The tie was effectively over while the corporate classes were still shuffling back to their seats at the start of the second half.Greecedid not add to that third goal; it never looked as if they would need to.Resentment towards Clarke, unavoidable afterScotlandflopped at Euro 2024, had dissipated after a recent upturn in fortunes. Greece sent Clarke and Scotland spiralling several steps backwards. Ivan Jovanovic and his Greek players will be licking their lips at facing Scotland again on World Cup qualifying business.Scotland v Greece, Spain v Netherlands, Germany v Italy, and more: Nations League – liveRead moreThis was an evening when no part of the Scotland team performed even adequately. The hosts were overly generous in defence, wasteful in midfield and no threat whatsoever in attack.Clarke makes great play of the fact his squad contains great international experience. The flipside, as evidenced here, is that perhaps this is a team which has reached the end of their cycle. Clarke can reasonably argue there is no emerging batch of talent to draft in. The friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June, three months before Scotland begin their World Cup quest, suddenly look rather important.“We didn’t play how we can play,” Clarke said. “We didn’t have enough energy in the team.On Thursday night in Greecewe defended as a team, from back to front. We didn’t do that tonight and were punished. This is a bump in the road. There are bumps in the road, it’s about how you react to them.”Clarke suggested the exertions of the first leg played a part in Scotland’s lethargy in game two. “I’ll go away and look at myself to see what I could have done better,” the Scotland manager said. “Maybe I didn’t make enough rotations. Maybe I could have made more to freshen the team up. We have to analyse it, park this tournament because we go down to League B and try to do better.”John McGinn was even more candid. The Scotland midfielder labelled this an “embarrassing” affair.The game had opened in rousing fashion. Tribute was paid tothe late Denis Law, with members of the Scotland icon’s family joining Sir Alex Ferguson pitchside. What Law would have made of what happened next is anybody’s guess. It was grisly, gruesome stuff for the Scots.“Wonderkid” is an overused term. In respect of Konstantinos Karetsas, it is perfectly apposite. The 17‑year‑old is such an elegant, creative force that Genk should enjoy him while he lasts; bigger clubs are casting admiring glances. In his first action of this clash he fed Georgios Vagiannidis on the right flank. The use of marauding full‑backs was a key Greek tactic that Scotland could not combat. Vagiannidis crossed for Giannis Konstantelias in blissful isolation inside the Scotland penalty area: Konstantelias slammed home to level the tie.Greece forged ahead on aggregate three minutes before the break. Karetsas endorsed his star quality with a curling finish after Konstantelias flicked the ball into his path. Andy Robertson, one of umpteen Scotland players who endured an awful evening, had been drawn towards the ball in leaving Karetsas totally unmarked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just 15 seconds of the second period had been played when Konstantelias pounced on a loose Ryan Christie pass.

Billy Gilmour was visibly irked at being substituted, sentiment shared a Scotland support which made its collective feelings plain. It took until the dying seconds of stoppage time for Konstantinos Tzolakis, the Greece goalkeeper, to make a save of note. By then, this stadium was largely empty. Any Scot who remained did so only to voice their displeasure at full time.“I had no doubt we could rise to the occasion,” Jovanovic said. Such an emphatic victory was, surely, beyond the coach’s wildest dreams. Clarke has been left with so much to ponder; repeat performances will lead to his tenure ending in inauspicious style.Explore more on these topicsNations LeagueScotlandGreecematch reportsShareReuse this content"

After Erin Cuthbert’s late header won this contest and sent the away fans into raptures, there is a 15-point gap between Chelsea and fourth-placed City, who will feel aggrieved about one controversial first-half incident that might have altered the game’s course.WSL roundup: Arsenal thrash Liverpool thanks to Matthews’ damaging doubleRead moreLong before Cuthbert’s winner in the 91st minute, City were understandably baffled after Jess Park curled the ball into the top corner from just outside the penalty area only to realise the referee, Kirsty Dowle, had stopped play for a free-kick, moving to blow her whistle just as Park was connecting with her shot.“The officials admitted that they got it wrong and that they should have played on,” City’s interim head coach, Nick Cushing, said. “The frustrating thing for me is, about two or three minutes before, because we were so dangerous on the counterattack, when the whistle was blown [for a separate foul] I asked the fourth official to ask the referee to play advantage, and she said: ‘OK, I’ll pass that message on.’ Then three minutes later that happens.”Sonia Bompastor, the Chelsea manager, said: “I can understand their frustration. If I was the City manager I would probably be in the same place. But I don’t think it changed our belief going into the second half. We created a lot in the second half, 24 shots on goal, their keeper made really great saves. We could maybe have scored more.”A goal at that stage would have put City 2-0 up after Kerolin’s strike on 32 minutes. Instead, Chelsea survived and emerged after the break a completely different team.The defending champions levelled as Aggie Beever-Jones met Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s cutback and supplied a quality finish into the bottom corner. What followed over the next 15 minutes was nothing short of an onslaught from Chelsea as they raced forward relentlessly with attack after attack, and Rytting Kaneryd began to dominate the contest.Quite how Chelsea did not score in that spell of pressure was unclear to everybody except perhaps the City goalkeeper Khiara Keating. First, she produced a terrific diving save to her left to keep out Wieke Kaptein’s effort. After Rytting Kaneryd had hit the post, Keating then did superbly well to make a low save at the feet of the same player, before stopping another close-range Kaptein shot.Keating went on to make another top-class save low to her left to keep out a powerful Lauren James strike in the closing stages, before Chelsea’s pressure told in stoppage time as Cuthbert’s header won the game for the visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twisting and weaving in front of a retreating Millie Bright, Kerolin eventually placed the ball through the defender’s legs and into the far corner.Shortly afterwards, Kerolin was running straight at Bright again. This time Bright did make a challenge, fouling the 25-year-old just inside the D, and as the ball rolled straight to Park for a first-time shot Dowle brought her whistle to her lips to award a free-kick, much to the bewilderment of Park, Cushing and almost everybody inside this stadium.The result was a second victory for Chelsea in the three consecutive games played between these sides in nine days, with the fourth in a row still to come on Thursday when Chelsea will need another comeback to overturn the two-goal deficit in the Champions League. But you can never write them off.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueManchester City WomenChelsea WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was Ingebrigtsen’s first world indoor medal above 1500m and underlined his position as one of the biggest stars of world athletics. There are not many who can match the 24-year-old athlete when the stakes are highest.‘There’s a dark side’: 1500m star Georgia Hunter Bell calls for online abuse to stopRead moreThis was also a successful event for Great Britain, not least for Amber Anning who becameBritain’s first women’s 400m world champion, in dramatic circumstances on Saturday, to quickly put aside the painful experience she endured at the European Indoor Championships in Apeldoorn this month and in the process securing GB’s second gold of the championships.Anning was disqualified for a lane infringement in the Europeans that left her devastated, but in China she announced herself on the world stage by coming through a thrilling 400m final to edge out the US runner Alexis Holmes, after the pair had come together in a mid-race shove as the bell rang.Anning held her nerve and hit the final bend magnificently. “After what happened at the Europeans, to come here and win is just an amazing feeling,” she said. “It wasn’t the cleanest race but the goal was to win and get my first individual title.”There were successes on Sunday, too. Neil Gourley was forced to sit and watch last year’s Glasgow-set world indoors – his place of birth – from home because of an injury that left him struggling to walk, but this time around he performed brilliantly on the world stage, running 3:39.07 in the men’s 1500m final to claim silver.Gourley was unable to match Ingebrigtsen in the final stretch – the winner came home in a time of 3:38.79 – but that is nothing to be disgraced by; silver represents a magnificent outcome for the Scot given the events of the past 12 months.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Hunter Bell on her way to bronze in the women’s 1500m in Nanjing.Photograph: Jessica Lee/EPA“I came away disappointed at the Europeans and I had a point to prove to myself,” he said. “I’m ready for something bigger so I’m glad I came out here to prove that.”Having watched Anning and Gourley win medals, Georgia Hunter Bell would have very likely felt the pressure to write her own tale of redemption. She was the overwhelming favourite for 1500m gold in Apeldoorn but could only finish fourth after battling anear infection that ultimately left her out of the medals. Like her teammates, she produced on the world stage, executing to perfection to take bronze in a time of 3:59.84.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: “Today’s revelations of major misuse of public money and potential fraud by students in franchised universities deal a hammer blow to the integrity of higher education in this country.“We must go further and faster to protect the public purse. I will not tolerate a penny of taxpayers’ money being misused. That is why I can announce that I have asked the Public Sector Fraud Authority to coordinate immediate action across the system to halt this growing threat.”Phillipson insisted that the blame rested squarely with the Conservatives for the growing issues within the university loans system. She argued that the last government’s decision to expand franchised education in 2016, without addressing underlying financial instability, paved the way for widespread abuse.She criticised the Tories for ignoring repeated warnings about the risks of fraud, writing: “But just as they ignored countless warnings about billions of pounds of Covid fraud, the Conservatives dragged their feet.”She also noted that the SLC is working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the prevalence of “some Romanian students at certain institutions”, adding that “not enough care was taken to join the dots of wider abuse taking place across the system and to slam the door shut on widespread abuse”.Though the OfS was created to ensure universities were high-quality and to prevent fraud, it was “directed by the Conservatives to pursue culture wars in our universities”, she said.Phillipson has promised to bring forward new legislation “at the first available opportunity” to ensure the OfS is equipped with tough new powers to intervene quickly to protect public money.A spokesperson for theDepartment for Educationsaid: “Our plan for change will restore trust in our universities. We have already taken clear action to crack down on rogue franchise operators to tackle fraud and we’ll go further. We will overhaul regulation so the Office for Students better protects taxpayers’ money. In the meantime, we have asked the OfS to clamp down on franchising.“The education secretary has asked the Public Sector Fraud Authority to help coordinate the cross-government response to these extremely concerning allegations and support the investigations already under way.“Where misuse or fraud is found we have powers to claw back payments – and we won’t hesitate to use them. We will bring in tough new laws to ensure the OfS can quickly stop bad actors gaming the system once and for all.”Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, said: “The type of sharp practices alleged by this investigation are entirely unacceptable. They represent shocking misuse of public funding and take advantage of genuine students who are not getting the education they deserve.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesOffice for StudentsBridget PhillipsonDepartment for EducationnewsShareReuse this content"

On 11 February 2023 they lured Brianna to a park in Cheshire where she was stabbed 28 times with a hunting knife.Both were jailed for lifewith a minimum term of 22 years for Jenkinson and 20 years for Ratcliffe. The court heard the killerswere partly motivatedby Brianna’s transgender identity.The 75-minute documentary celebrates Brianna’s life and features interviews with three of her friends, who describe the schoolgirl as kind, chatty and funny. It also explores her death and issues around online safety.View image in fullscreenThe 75-minute film celebrates Brianna Ghey’s life and features interviews with three of her friends.Photograph: Family Handout/PABrianna, who had thousands of followers on TikTok, struggled with her mental health, which was worsened by accessing eating disorder and self-harm content on X.From the age of 14, one of her killers, Jenkinson, enjoyed watching videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers.At a screening in London, Ghey said one of the reasons she had chosen to take part in the documentary was to “get answers” from social media companies about safety.Last year,Australia passed a law aiming to ban under-16s from social media. Ghey said she supported such a ban.“It is an absolute cesspit,” she said of social media. “Even if, say, I do an interview, and I’ll try not to look at comments, but I can never help myself, and I’ll look at the comments, and you’ll see people saying about my child, trying to tell me what gender my child was, and also really, really horrific comments too.“When you report things, the support isn’t there.”Ghey added: “I’ve reported so many comments, and I always get the response that they haven’t done anything wrong, that it’s not something that they can take down, and our children have access to those comments.“No matter how much love and compassion you pump into your child when you’re bringing them up, and how much empathy you can teach them, they will go online and they’ll see the way that other people are speaking about other people and they might think that that’s right.”In the documentary, Ghey meets Arturo Béjar, aformer engineering director at Meta, who testified before Congress about child safety on the tech company’s platforms. He tells her that people are “defenceless” against harmful algorithms.At the screening Ghey expressed hope that any social media company would not put “lives before profit”.Ghey foundedPeace & Mind UKto raise funds to teach mindfulness in schools. Her recently published memoir on her and Brianna’s lives, which explores how deadly social media can be, wasdescribed by the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstoneas “one of the most unflinching, inspirational autobiographies I’ve read, a remarkable cry of hope from the depths of despair”.Meta, X and TikTok have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYoung peopleInternet safetyChildrenViolence against women and girlsDigital mediaTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

This cycle of violence must end.”Amen’s sister Delina Teklay, 17, previously told BBC Scotland that her brother hoped to gain UK citizenship and become a doctor or engineer. She said: “This was very unexpected and shocking for us. I just think this is a dream and I’m going to wake up tomorrow. I’m still in denial.”The 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with Amen’s murder and assault, while the 15-year-old was charged with assault.Police said the 16-year-old will appear in court in due course, and that a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.Explore more on these topicsUK newsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, have visited China since taking office.Government ‘absolutely up for the fight’ over net zero, Ed Miliband saysRead moreConcern has long been expressed that Chinese-manufactured solar panels likely to be bought by Great British Energy are made using Uyghur slave labour, a charge the Chinese government rejects. China dominates the solar panel market.Labour ministers say Great British Energy will already be empowered, and indeed be required, by law to root out slavery anywhere in its supply chain.Ministers also say a pre-existing solar taskforce co-chaired by Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is charged with addressing the issue. But Lyons said: “A decade ago the UK led the way setting new standards in the fight against modern slavery. Today we have fallen behind.”The business and trade select committee warned recently the UK is at serious risk of becoming a dumping ground for products made with forced labour: “It is well evidenced that the renewable sector is heavily dependent on companies sourcing from areas like Xinjiang in China, and that forced labour is endemic in the region through involuntary labour transfer schemes. The Great British Energy Bill provides an ideal vehicle to ensure that the green transition is not built on the back of contemporary slaves.”Sobel said: “The UK has been crystal clear that the UK will not tolerate slave-made goods and appreciates more must be done to root them out. Great British Energy provides us with the opportunity to not only pursue our green transition but bolster our national security, but only if we are to reduce our dependence on China.“Ensuring our solar supply chains are free from slavery would also see the UK take a leading position on human rights, as a force for good.GB Energy needs full £8.3bn of funding or it will disappoint, government toldRead more“We have listened to the government arguments and tabled an amendment which would provide a practical solution to this issue, assuring we are aligned with actions in Europe and the US.”The amendment passed by 177 votes to 127 in the Lords and has Conservative support, as well as the backing of the Labour peer and human rights barrister Helena Kennedy.Lord Offord, a former Conservative exports minister, said: “The UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires companies to take responsibility for their supply chains, yet we know that modern slavery remains a serious issue in the global energy sector, particularly in the sourcing of solar panels, batteries and raw materials such as lithium and cobalt.“This amendment does not create unnecessary bureaucracy or hinder investment; it simply ensures that taxpayers’ money does not fund exploitation.”In opposition Labour backed moves to declare China’s actions in Xinjiang genocide and to block trade deals with countries found by UK courts to have committed genocide.But in a speech last week Lammy said he had asked the Foreign Office “to turbo-charge the relationships which will generate the greatest returns on investment for UK plc in the medium-term. At the top of that list stands the EU, China and the United States of America”.He called for pragmatic engagement with China, cooperating on climate change goals without endangering UK national security. He said future ambassadors “will in priority markets be assessed against their delivery of trade and investment wins overseas”.Explore more on these topicsModern slaverySolar powerLabourChinaEnergyRenewable energyPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

There will never be another era like it again.”The broadcaster, who is now a presenter on Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, said that the show gave him “incredible memories that will stay with me forever” and “took a chance on me” when he had no experience.Reacting to Thomas’s post on X, Bacon wrote that he “loved” Blue Peter, and said “being live is what made it alive”.“I remember walking from one side of the studio to the other – doing a piece to camera – and seeing the whole crew, five cameras, and another on a crane, track with me,” he wrote.“I know that doesn’t sound like much – but the first time it happened it was mind-blowing. It was just a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well-resourced live kids TV show.“That had been live in that building for decades. It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).”Bacon was sacked from Blue Peter in the 1990s, after admitting drug taking, but did return, receiving a Blue Peter badge on the 60th anniversary.A BBC spokesperson said: “Blue Peter won’t just be available to view online and will remain on the CBBC and BBC Two linear channels, as well as BBC iPlayer and sign zone.Yvette Fielding looks back: ‘Blue Peter gave me balls of steel – it’s helped me deal with lots of backstabbing people in TV’Read more“The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change.“Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.“As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.”The current lineup of presenters include Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterTelevisionBBCChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Arrivals and departures continued on Sunday, although a number of flights ran with slight delays in taking off.The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has ordered theNational Energy System Operator (Neso)to investigate the power outage. An internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response to the disruption will be undertaken by the former transport secretary Ruth Kelly.The Sunday Times reportedthe airport’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, went to bed and delegated the decision to shut the airport to his deputy, Javier Echave, on Thursday night, after senior staff were split into two “gold command” groups. One worked through the night, while the other went to bed to take over in the morning.Heathrow officials told the newspaper that the decision was taken so Woldbye was better rested when he would take the decision to reopen the airport.A Heathrow spokesperson said: “Today we will operate another full schedule of over 1,300 flights. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by our decision to close the airport on Friday following a significant fire at an off-site power substation. Yesterday, we served more than 250,000 passengers, with punctual flights and almost all passengers waiting less than five minutes for security.“We have welcomed the government’s announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow’s response. While these inquiries are ongoing, our focus remains on serving our passengers.”Power to the airport was disrupted on Thursday night due to thefire in Hayes. The airport was closed, with passengers told not to travel. Planes were eventually allowed to take off and land again on Friday evening.0:37Substation fire in Hayes, London causes widespread outages and Heathrow airport closure – videoHeathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024, and about 200,000 passengers were affected by Friday’s closure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Power supply then had to be restructured from two remaining substations to ensure enough electricity was available to power the airport, which has been described as similar to a “mid-sized city”.Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan police initially led the investigation, but the force said the fire was not believed to be suspicious so London fire brigade is now leading the inquiry, which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.Heathrow’s chair, Paul Deighton, announced the review, to be led by Kelly, on Saturday night to assess the airport’s response to it.Lord Deighton said: “The Kelly review will analyse all of the relevant material concerning the robustness and execution of Heathrow’s crisis management plans, the airport’s response during the incident and how the airport recovered the operation with the objective of identifying any improvements that could be made to our future resilience.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportAir transportLondonTransportTransport policynewsShareReuse this content"

And there are no signs it will be different next time. Indeed, it is likely to be worse.”Nor is there any evidence that the country has understood the psychological consequences triggered by placing the nation into lockdown.It might have been moderately effective for reducing infection but it underestimated the need for connection, contact and community, said Dominic Abrams, professor of social psychology at Kent University: “There seemed to be almost no strategy to meet those fundamental needs. The social and psychological scars remain extensive and deep.”View image in fullscreenScientists said that since the 2020 lockdown there has been no subsequent attempt to understand the usefulness and importance of measures such as social distancing.Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/ShutterstockAnd while social distancing, mask-wearing and the use of lateral flow tests were widely employed, there was no subsequent attempt to understand their usefulness and importance, according to Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia.“My big regret is that we still have not reached scientific consensus on the value and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions [NPIs],” he said. “We know that NPIs do reduce transmission. But whether the benefits outweigh the harms is still far from clear.”The international implications were stressed by Andrew Shepherd, director of the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network. “Lockdowns are not suitable for every country. During the pandemic, richer nations pressured low-income and middle-income countries to introduce lockdowns, with disastrous consequences.“Most of these countries were not in a position to mitigate the accompanying loss of jobs, income and businesses in the same way that we could in the UK, and the result was massive impoverishment, which will take years to recover from.”Dr Michael Head of the University of Southampton acknowledged that lockdowns were a vital component of any pandemic response. “But we do need smarter lockdowns that are in place earlier in the outbreak to better reduce transmission and therefore shorter in length.”The anniversary has also been marked by the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, which is made up of almost 10,000 people who were bereaved by the pandemic. The group has written to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, urging her not to go ahead with herproposed plan to cut disability payments.“Rampant inequality contributed to the UK’s high [Covid-19] death toll,” the letter states.“Disabled people were 11 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than non-disabled people. Instead of addressing the inequalities that contributed to that horrifying statistic, the government is pushing ahead with plans to slash disability benefits, driving more people into poverty and making the country even less prepared for future pandemics.“The government promised to learn from the pandemic but appears to be suffering from Covid amnesia, forgetting the devastating cost of an underfunded health service and public services cut to the bone.”Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusThe ObserverInfectious diseasesBoris JohnsonMedical researchNHSHealthRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

He used his fake name on the birth certificate of their son.She only discovered in 2020 that he was a police officer who had deceived her for almost two decades. At the time of the discovery, she was engaged to be married to him. She had started the relationship in 2001, believing him to be a businessman.It is the longest-known deception of a woman into an intimate relationship by an undercover officer. It was revealedby the Guardian two years ago.In new filings, the undercover policing inquiry has disclosed that while the officer was subjecting her to the long-running deliberate deception, he was married to another woman.Both women have been left devastated. The first woman, known by the pseudonym Gabriella, has not spoken publicly. Her relatives have described how the ordeal has broken her and left her “a shadow of the person we used to know”. The undercover officer had become close to Gabriella’s family who have also been devastated.Police told the second woman, known by the pseudonym Esther, in 2021 that her husband had a relationship and a child with Gabriella. This “has had a major impact on [Esther’s] life and wellbeing, to which it has taken her time to adjust”, said the inquiry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least25 undercover officers – nearly a fifth of those who infiltrated political movements– formed sexual relationships with members of the public without disclosing their true identity to them.In its later stages, the inquiry will switch to investigating another aspect of undercover policing – the deployments that infiltrated criminal gangs.The undercover officer had no role in spying on political campaigners and was tasked with gathering information about criminals.Avon and Somerset constabulary, which deployed him, hasapologised to Gabriella, and added that she had no links to criminals and played no role in his deployment.

Now, to mark the 80th anniversary of this milestone, the society is launching a year-long series of events to assert the rightful place in history of its first female fellows, Marjory Stephenson and Kathleen Lonsdale.Stephenson was a pioneer in biochemistryand hergroundbreaking experimental approachenabled her to become the first person to isolate an enzyme from bacteria cells in 1928.View image in fullscreenKathleen Lonsdale was a pioneer in crystallography.Photograph: Royal SocietyLonsdale, a physicist who had illuminated how molecules are arranged in atoms by proving the structure of the benzene ring in 1929, was recognised for her “outstanding contributions” tocrystallography.The Royal Society has commissioned two films about the lives of the two women and their achievements, which will be launched on its YouTube channel this week. An exhibit of archival documents about their election to the fellowship and the generally muted media response to it – several newspapers chose to ignore the women and their achievements entirely and reported only on the “brilliant careers” of male scientists receiving the same honour – will also be on display at the society’s London headquarters in July.To join the Royal Society in 1945, at least two existing fellows had to sign a printed certificate that stated, “we the undersigned propose and recommend him”, the exhibit and films will show. After crossing out the word “him”, 12 fellows signed Lonsdale’s certificate and 17 signed Stephenson’s.The moment “was a real milestone”, said Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, a Royal Society fellow and pioneering astrophysicist, who isno stranger to sexism in science.“There was also a lot of uncertainty among some fellows about whether women could be scientists, whether they were appropriate for membership of the Royal Society. But they [Lonsdale and Stephenson] had some very powerful backers.”Each of the women had earned the respect of a male Nobel prizewinning colleague and former president of the Royal Society; in Lonsdale’s case, the physicist Sir William Henry Bragg, and in Stephenson’s, the biochemist Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. Other fellows had to “take notice” when such eminent scientists recommended the women, Bell Burnell said.It is no coincidence the Royal Society began admitting female scientists during the second world war, she added. “I think it was because of what women, in general, did during the war. They couldn’t be ignored any longer.”A previous attempt by fellows in 1902 to nominate a female scientist, the physicist Hertha Ayrton, had failed, said Keith Moore, the Royal Society’s archivist. “The society took a legal opinion on whether or not it could elect women at the time, because masculine terms had been routinely used in its charter, which governed how the society operated.”Questions were also raised about whether a married woman such as Ayrton met the legal definition of a person, at a time when wives were considered the property of their husbands. “The legal opinion came back that fellows could not elect women, particularly if they were married,” he added.After the first equal opportunities legislation was introduced in Britain in 1919, the society could have elected a woman, Moore said. “But it took another 26 years before we actually did.”Joining the Royal Society in 1945 may have helped Lonsdale and Stephenson to smash other glass ceilings for female scientists as they advanced in their careers.In 1949, Lonsdale became the first woman to be made a professor at University College London, after she was appointed professor of chemistry and head of the department of crystallography.Stephenson was persuaded by fellow microbiologist Alexander Fleming to become the first female president of the Society for General Microbiology in 1947. An alumna and fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge, she was made the university’s first reader of chemical microbiology shortly before her death in 1948 – the year the female undergraduates she taught finally began to be awarded degrees.To further honour the women’s achievements, the Royal Society plans to host evening talks and networking events to promote women in science this year, and is collecting data to better understand and address gender diversity across different science subjects.Explore more on these topicsRoyal SocietyWomenPhysicsChemistrynewsShareReuse this content"

The committee has raised with Patrick Vallance [the science minister] the lack of an AI safety bill, and whether that is in response to the significant criticism of Europe’s approach to AI, which JD Vance and Elon Musk have made.“It’s absolutely critical that the government shows it is on the side of people when it comes to technology, particularly when it comes to the tech platforms and the impact technology is going to have in their lives.”She added: “Peter [Kyle, the technology secretary], Keir [Starmer, the prime minister] and Wes [Streeting, the health secretary] are great champions of tech and the positive contribution it can make. That’s great, but we also have to show that we recognise the threats that so many of my constituents see coming from technology generally, and AI specifically, and that we are here to protect them.“We are here to protect people, and so the sooner we have clarity on the AI safety bill, the more protected people will feel.”Starmer’s approach to technology is being guided in part by a desire to placate the US president and his administration. Vance gave a pro-AI speech at the recent AI safety summit in Paris,where he said: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety. It will be won by building.”The stance of Vance and Starmer contrasts with that of the previous government under Rishi Sunak, which hosted the inaugural global AI safety summit in 2023. At that gathering, the UK, US, EU, Australia and China all agreed that AIposed a potentially catastrophic risk to humanity. The summit also struck a voluntary agreement between tech companies and governments over safety testing for AI models.As well as delaying the safety bill, the government is also considering dropping the UK’s digital services tax on the major global technology companies. Trump has ordered an investigation into other countries’ technology taxes, saying the findings will determine which countries will face tariffs on 2 April.But the UK prime minister is also being guided by his own enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, whichhe argueshas the potential to make the British state far more efficient by, for instance, automating certain tasks – as well as to power the economic growth thathis government has made a priority.The government’s desire to foster a British AI industry has led ministers to make acontroversial set of proposalsthat would allow technology companies to circumvent copyright law and use creative content to train their models without the permission of the people who created it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One option ministers are considering is to allow technology companies access to creative content, while making it much easier for artists to seek payment for that content and opt out if they would prefer.“My concern is that to get it right, the tech companies need to be proposing tech solutions,” Onwurah said. “The tech companies need to be using technology to help address this issue, not trying to make a land grab for all content on the basis that there isn’t a viable tech option.”A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “The government is clear in its ambition to bring forward AI legislation which allows us to safely realise the enormous benefits and opportunities of the technology for years to come.“We are continuing to refine our proposals which will incentivise innovation and investment to cement our position as one of the world’s three leading AI powers, and will launch a public consultation in due course.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LabourScience policyComputingTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The Fish Hook fire, which scorched 1,713 acres, was 50% contained.All are burning about 30 miles south-east of Ashville, according to the North Carolina forest service, in an area where Hurricane Helene swept through in September. The downed trees leftover from the hurricane, as well as low humidity and dry vegetation, are helping to fuel the fires which ignited last week, officials said.“It’s not just the high winds, the low humidity, the steep terrain, but they’re also dealing with storm debris that’s blocking UTV trails, regular roads, and them just getting in on foot because we have so many trees down,” Cannon toldCBS affiliate WSPA.Dense smoke from the wildfires spurred a “code red” air quality alert for Polk county. The North Carolina forest servicewarned in a social media postthat all residents should avoid prolonged exposure or heavy exertion outdoors.Cannon said the residents of Polk county are “extremely resilient” after enduring Helene and the last round of wildfires earlier this month.North Carolina was under a statewide burn ban during the critical fire weather. The state’s forest service reminded residents that the ban is remaining in place until further notice.The threat of wildfires was felt in neighboringSouth Carolinawhere Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens county called the Table Rock fire that started on Friday night and quickly spread to 35 acres, McMaster said.By Sunday, the South Carolina forestry commissionwas reportingthat the fire had grown to 300 acres and was 0% contained.“As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,” McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued on Friday by the South Carolina forestry commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration’s crackdowns on diversity and equity programmes and on immigration, and mentioned the possibility of a US where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 20 women in total have accused him of abuse and improper behaviour but several cases have been dropped as they are out of time for prosecution.Grinberg has supported the two women, saying Depardieu repeatedly made “salacious remarks” during the shoot in Paris.The trial was originally scheduled for last October but was postponed due to Depardieu’s ill health. At the time, his lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said the actor had undergone a quadruple heart bypass and his diabetes had been aggravated by the stress of the forthcoming trial.He has since been seen by a court-appointed doctor who declared him fit to appear, though the hearings will be limited to six hours a day and he will be given permission to take breaks when needed.Depardieu was placed under formal investigation on accusations of rape and sexual assault in 2020 after the actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of having attacked her on two occasions at his home in Paris in 2018, when she was 22 and he was 70.After Depardieu’s lawyers tried to get the case dropped, the Paris chief prosecutor said there was “serious and confirmed evidence” that justified maintaining the charges. The investigation continues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. The brothers have denied all wrongdoing.Shortly after arriving in Bucharest early on Saturday, the pair spoke to reporters outside their residence. “We’re here to clear our names and exonerate ourselves,” said Andrew Tate.Andrew, 38, a former professional kickboxer, and Tristan, 36, remain under judicial supervision in Romania. Last month, authorities in Romania said the brotherswere obligedto return for a court appearance on 24 March or potentially face “a higher custodial measure”.Earlier Andrew Tate – who hasbeen bannedfrom several social media platforms for his misogynistic views and hate speech – told his more than 10 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 on a private jet in order to “sign one single piece of paper in Romania”.On arrival, however, he told reporters that he was glad to be back inRomania. “After all we’ve been through, we truly deserve the day in court where it is stated that we’ve done nothing wrong and that we should have never been in court in the first place. We should have never gone to jail. We should have never had our assets seized. We should have never had our names slandered,” he said. “Anyone who believed any of this garbage has a particularly low IQ.”Their return to eastern Europe comes nearly a month after the brothers’travel banwas lifted. Soon after, the brothers announced that they had flown on a private jet to Florida.They swiftly found themselves entangled in another criminal investigation, this timelaunchedby Florida’s attorney general, James Uthmeier. “These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying upon women around the world,”said Uthmeier.The accusation came days after Andrew Tate told journalists in Florida: “We’ve yet to be convicted of any kind of crime in our lives ever. We’ve no criminal record anywhere on the planet ever.”Their arrival in the US prompted speculation as to whether the Trump administration had leaned on officials in Romania to lift the travel restrictions. The Tates are outspoken supporters of Donald Trump and several members of the US president’s inner circle havespoken out publiclyabout their case, including Donald Trump Jr who described their detention as “absolute insanity” in May 2023.While the US president later said he knew nothing about the travel ban being lifted, a US sourcetold Reutersthat Washington had pressed Bucharest to give the brothers their passports and allow them to travel.Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Andrew Tate rejected these claims. “There’s no American pressure, there’s just the rule of law,” he said.It was unclear how long the brothers, who are facing legal challenges in several countries, would stay in Romania. In December, a court in Bucharest ruled that the case against them could not go to trial, citing multiple legal and procedural irregularities. The case, however, remained open.Last August, Romania’s anti-organised crime agency Diicot launched a second case against the brothers,amid accusationsthat the brothers had used the so-called “loverboy” method – convincing people they are in a romantic relationship – to force 34 women into making pornography that was sold online for almost $3m (£2.1m).At the time, the agency said it was investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. The brothers have denied the charges.Four British women have also accused Andrew Tate of sexual violence and physical abuse,launching a civil suitin the UK after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him.Last March, authorities in the UK said they had beengranted a warrantover accusations of sexual aggression dating back to 2012, meaning the brothers would be extradited once the legal proceedings in Romania were completed. The brothers have also denied these allegations.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TateRomaniaSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

The mass gathering in Belgrade marked the culmination of four months ofprotests against the governmentafter the deadly collapse of a concrete train station canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad last November.1:01Tens of thousands rally against Serbian government in student-led protests – video reportCivil society groups have been warning for months about an increasingly hostile environment for independent media since the station collapse, which killed 16 people and set in motion a political backlash against Vučić’s pro-Russia administration.“The media inSerbiais at a dangerous turning point,” wrote the editors in an open letter signed by five outlets and included Igor Božić, the news director of the CNN-affiliated N1 Serbia. “The government is stepping up its attack on independent journalism, especially targeting outlets within United Media, as the political crisis worsens and public frustration grows.“Instead of addressing real public issues, the government creates false stories that paint independent media as foreign agents and enemies of the state. As a result, our reporters are assaulted, blocked from official events, and targeted with disinformation meant to break public trust.”The NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has said the pressure exerted on the media in Serbia has reached levels not seen since the 1990s. It has also urged the EU to condemn a raid on the offices of the Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability (CRTA), an NGO that runs a prominent fact-checking website.Pavol Szalai, the head of the RSF’s EU-Balkans desk, said Serbia was 98th out of 180 countries and territories on the world press freedom index last year, its lowest ranking in 22 years of the index.There have been several reports of hostility towards independent journalists since the train station disaster. At the end of last year, the N1 journalist Žaklina Tatalović and her cameraperson Nikola Popović were harassed while covering protests. Local press freedom groups said at the time that Tatalović and Popović had endured sexist insults and physical violence. Police officers were accused of failing to intervene.Another N1 reporter Jelena Mirković was attacked while covering protests against the demolition of a bridge. She suffered a neck injury and was subsequently unable to work. Last month, fellow N1 journalist Ksenija Pavkov was verbally threatened while reporting.In their letter, the group of editors said Vučić was falsely accusing journalists of “stirring unrest”. They also said financial and regulatory pressures were being applied, forcing away advertisers and business partners.“With ongoing student protests and a dissolved government awaiting new elections, we are deeply concerned for the safety of our reporters on the ground,” they wrote. “The growing hostility toward independent media, fuelled by orchestrated government rhetoric, has created an environment where violence is not only allowed but even encouraged.“In the past four months alone, our journalists, including Zaklina Tatalović, Ksenija Pavkov, and Jelena Mirković, have suffered both physical and verbal attacks. Despite clear video evidence of the perpetrators, the police have done nothing to hold them accountable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Protests have been a regular feature in Serbia since November. The president has so far sought to deflect the blame, with a series of resignations arising from the station collapse.The Serbian government, led by the prime minister, Miloš Vučević, formally resigned last week, with Vučić saying elections could follow in June.Protesters aredemanding accountability for the disaster at Novi Sad, as well as more transparent institutions based on the rule of law. More than a dozen people have been charged in relation to the canopy collapse. On Friday, it was announced that a teenager had become the latest to die from injuries sustained in the disaster.As many as 325,000 peopletook to the streets of Belgrade on 15 March, though the government has disputed those estimates.Footage shows crowds suddenly splitting, with some complaining of feeling the ill effects associated with the use of a sonic weapon. However, senior government politicians and police have denied that such a weapon was deployed. Vučić described the claim as a “wicked lie” that was aimed at “destroying Serbia”.Explore more on these topicsSerbiaPress freedomNewspapersEuropeNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, Palestinian officials said the total death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict had passed 50,000.An airstrike in the city of Khan Younis on Sunday killed Salah Bardawil, a member of Hamas’s political leadership bureau, and the Israel Defense Forces (issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas west of the city of Rafah on the border with Egypt, the target of a major offensive about a year ago, and where the IDF is pressing ground operations.The orders specified that movement in vehicles would not be permitted. There have been many reported incidents of civilians being killed or badly injured in attacks by Israeli forces on cars inGazain recent days. “The IDF has launched an operation to dismantle terrorist organisations. You are currently in a dangerous combat zone. Distance yourself from the combat zone immediately,” the orders said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian boy at the site of an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Younis on Sunday.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersAt least 19 Palestinians were killed overnight, according to medical officials on Sunday. Two hospitals in southern Gaza said they had received 17 bodies from strikes, including those of several women and children. The toll did not include the Hamas official and his wife.Later on Sunday, Israel’s military said troops had encircled Tal al-Sultan refugee camp in Rafah, adding that their objective was to “dismantle terrorist infrastructure and eliminate” militants there.To date in the war – triggered by an attack by Hamas militants into Israel in October 2023 in which they killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages – more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, also mostly civilians, and about 113,000 wounded, say officials.Israel, which has accused Hamas of systematically looting aid, cut off supplies to Gaza hours after the first phase of a supposed three-stage ceasefire expired. Hamas denies the charge.Gaza’s ceasefire brought hope, but it was the calm before a brutal stormRead moreAid officials said distributions would be reduced gradually if possible, while the provision of community kitchens that feed about a million people would get progressively more difficult.“At some point we will just run out and things will get desperate … but even if we had supplies it would be very difficult to distribute them because the security environment means we can’t operate,” said one UN official based in Gaza.Six out of 23 bakeries operated by the UN World Food Programme have already been shut due to a lack of cooking gas, while Unrwa, the main UN agency with responsibility for Palestinians’ welfare, had stocks of about 60,000 bags of flour on Friday, enough for just six days of distribution.Prices for the limited amount of food still available in shops and markets have soared and are now unaffordable for almost everyone. Potatoes cost the equivalent of $6 (£4.60) a kg, five times more than a month ago, while cooking gas cylinders are selling for $60 a kg, four times higher than before the end of the fragile pause in hostilities three weeks ago.“It is very clear that people are underweight. The population is very young, and children need nutritious food,” said Khamis Elessi, a senior consultant doctor in Gaza City.Feroze Sidhwa, a US-based volunteer emergency doctor in Gaza, said the consequences of 18 months of poor diet were very evident among his patients. “We see very clearly that everyone has lost weight … I can see my surgical incisions are not healing well,” he said.Aid distribution has been hindered by displacement. “There is a lot of anxiety about what will happen, especially parents for their children. It is non-stop: evacuation orders, explosions, the hospitals are filled with casualties, we are now seeing food scarcity. It is very unpredictable,” said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson in Gaza for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).“We can hear massive explosions most of the day. Reports of casualties are received every hour but the first responders cannot reach all the sites of attacks because it is too dangerous or they have not enough fuel for ambulances.”In the southern city Rafah on Sunday, Palestinian men, women and children could be seen walking along a dirt road and carrying their belongings in their arms. Most of Gaza’s population have had to flee within the territory, often multiple times. “It’s displacement under fire,” said Mustafa Gaber, a local journalist on the move with his family. “There are wounded people among us. The situation is very difficult.”Israeli media questioned on Sunday whether the aims of the new offensive were limited to destroying Hamas and returning the hostages held in Gaza – the two goals often cited by the Israeli government.On Friday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said in a statement that he had “instructed the IDF to seize additional territories in Gaza, evacuate the population, and expand the security zones around Gaza in order to defend the Israeli towns and IDF troops”.“The longer Hamas continues to refuse to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose that will be added to Israel,” Katz said.On Saturday, Israel’s cabinet approved a proposal to set up a new directorate tasked with advancing what it framed as the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians, in line with Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it as the “riviera of the Middle East”. Legal experts said any such policy would almost certainly be a violation of international law.Katz said the new body would be “subject to Israeli and international law” and coordinate “passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries”.Israel has been roiled by massive protests, with more than 100,000 demonstrating against efforts by Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, to fire boththe head of the internal security service, Ronen Bar, and the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara.Bar as the head of the Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including allegations of leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas. Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with the government, warned the prime minister he could not fire domestic intelligence’s chief before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.In an unprecedented step on Sunday, after accusing her of blocking the government’s policies, Israel’s cabinet voted unanimously in favour of a no-confidence motion against Baharav-Miara.The cabinet’s decision was condemned by opposition parties and thousands of protesters who took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the sixth day in row, who described Netanyahu’s move as an attempt to undermine Israel’s democratic system.During clashes with the police, three protesters were arrested outside Netanyahu’s residence in central Jerusalem.There are also widespread calls for the return of the hostages to be prioritised over the offensive against Hamas.On Friday, 40 freed hostages who were in Hamas captivity and 250 family members of Israeli soldiers and civilians still held in Gaza signed a letter calling on Netanyahu to halt Israel’s “endless war”.In the agreedceasefire’s first phase, 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone – allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remained of their homes – and there was a surge in humanitarian aid.The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the scheduled second phase of the truce, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages – 35 of whom are believed to be dead – in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent end to hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal.Israel backed out of the ceasefire agreement, offering instead to extend the first phase by between 30 and 60 days if Hamas released more hostages.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

We will not let this happen. We’re over the shock of the betrayal, but we can never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves. We have to look out for each other.”Moments before, Carney met the governor general, Mary Simon, requesting she dissolve the country’s 44th parliament and call an election. Under federal law, the minimum length of a campaign is 37 days.By calling the snap election in search of a “strong, positive mandate”, Carney does not have to face a hostile parliament – a showdown complicated by the fact that he doesn’t have a seat in the House of Commons. Parliament had been due to return on Monday after being prorogued for two months, following former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation announcement in early January.Carney’s decision comes as the Liberals experiencean unprecedented swing in the pollsthat has now put them ahead of the Conservatives, with some projecting the party has enough support nationally to form a majority government.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoBefore the dissolution of parliament, the incumbent Liberals held 152 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives had 120, the Bloc Québécois 33, the NDP 24, and the Green party two.“Carney has been the gamechanger and has totally reversed the fortunes of the Liberal party,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. “And increasingly, this election is not really about the parties any more, or the brands they represent. We don’t elect our prime minister directly, but the feeling increasingly is that people are poised to vote for the leader they want to see as prime minister.”Numerous surveys from polling firms suggest Canadians view Carney as more capable than the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, in handling economic turbulence, trade talks and relations with a hostile and unpredictable White HouseTrump has figured prominently into Canada’s political narrative, repeatedly threatening to wage economic war on the US’s closest ally and one of its largest trading partners, with the end goal of annexing the country’s northern neighbour.Those threats, and the prospect of painful tariffs on Canadian goods, have electrified the country, with a groundswell of patriotism, calls to boycott American goods and an “elbows up” rallying cry.“The election will certainly have a ballot question. But it isn’t Trump, it’s uncertainty. Trump is a symbol of that he’s showing how Canada is vulnerable in many ways. People want a leader who can be the antidote to that uncertainty,” said Turnbull. “And if you look at poll after poll, people believe Carney offers something, in this moment, that Canadians need.”In acampaign video released on Saturday nightthat has had millions of views, the Canadian actor and comedian Mike Myers appears with Carney in matching Team Canada ice-hockey jerseys. Carney questions Myers, who long starred on Saturday Night Live, with Canadian cultural references in a test of the comedian’s identity.“Wow, you really are Canadian,” Carney says after Myers answers every question correctly. The ad ends with Carney telling Myers “there will always be a Canada” and the pair agreeing it was time for “elbows up”, the hockey phrase that has become the latest rallying cry in the country amid threats to Canadian sovereignty.The camera then shows Myers from behind with his jersey emblazoned with the slogan “Never 51”, a reference to Canada’s rejection of ever joining the US.In less than 24 hours, the ad had been viewed more than 7m times, an unprecedented level for a Canadian political ad.If the Liberals emerge victorious in April, it will be remembered as the largest political comeback in the country’s history – and for the Conservatives, a catastrophic loss of an election result that until recently was certain to fall in their favour.As early as 2023, CBC’s polling aggregator had the Tory chance at electoral victory at 99% – a seemingly insurmountable edge they maintained until mid February 2025. But a series of confounding factors, including the resignation of Trudeau, threats by Trump toannex Canadaand the rapid ascension of Carney as the new Liberal leader, has dramatically shifted the political landscape.Turnbull said: “Conservatives seem to be falling short in saying the things that connect with how Canadians are feeling. A few months ago, Poilievre was talking about affordability and housing, issues that the Liberals were tonedeaf on. But now, he’s somehow absent. The Conservatives are keeping the same messaging, even though Canadians have shifted.“They may be trying to convince themselves that Carney is on a honeymoon, and if they just stick to their notes, the polls will go back to some version of what they were before, and then they’ll cross the finish line first.”Poilievre has framed his party’s campaign as a “Canada first” platform. On Sunday, he told reporters at his campaign launch: “Trump has been very blunt that he wants a weak Canada that he can target … Electing Liberals will weaken our country still.” He added that Canada “will never be an American state; we will always be a sovereign and self-reliant country”.The Conservatives, without Trudeau as a political punching bag, say Carney is largely responsible for the country’s slow growth in recent years, given his role as economic adviser to the Liberal party. They call him “sneaky Carney” and allege he plans to bring back a controversial carbon tax he removed in his first day as prime minister.“That whole strategy rests on being able to define Carney. And if they could do that, then their strategy would probably work,” said Turnbull. “But that’s not working. Voters, in poll after poll, are not accepting the Conservatives definition of who Mark Carney is. And that will matter in the coming weeks.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Upon arriving at the scene, authorities located a deceased woman who they later identified as 43-year-old Jessica Aber.“In a matter of protocol, an investigation is under way surrounding the circumstances of her death. The office of the chief medical examiner of Virginia will determine the cause and manner of death,” policesaid, without providing additional details surrounding her death.Aber began her career in 2009 at the US district court for the eastern district of Virginia where she prosecuted financial fraud, public corruption, violent crime and child exploitation cases. From 2015 to 2016, she served on an assignment as counsel to the assistant attorney general from the justice department’s criminal division.

He then made his way home to Casa Santa Marta in theVaticanCity, where he will convalesce for at least two months.“Our pope is coming back,” one of the pilgrims told Rai news.The health of Francis, who was admitted to hospital on 14 February and subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia, was steadily improving, Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, told reporters on Saturday. However, it would still take “a lot of time” for his body to fully heal.Francis suffered two critical breathing crises in hospital before his doctors declared on 10 March that he was no longer in imminent ­danger.In the Angelus, the pope reflected on his“long period” of hospitalisation. “I have had the opportunity to experience the Lord’s patience, which I also see reflected in the tireless care of the doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the care and hopes of the relatives of the sick,” he said. “This trusting patience, anchored in God’s unfailing love, is indeed necessary in our lives, especially when facing the most difficult and painful situations.”He expressed his sadness atIsrael’s renewed bombing of the Gaza stripand called for an “immediate halt to the weapons and for the courage to resume dialogue, so that all hostages may be released and a final ceasefire reached”, while urging people to pray “for an end to wars and for peace, especially in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”La Repubblica reported that Francis had insisted he return home, where he will need to continue his recovery and rest. “The hope is that he will soon be able to resume a work schedule,” Alfieri said. However, he cautioned that the pope would not immediately be able to meet groups of people. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, scheduled for 8 April, will take place.Despite his health challenges, on some days Francis continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood and writing a letter to the editor of Corriere della Sera newspaper reiterating his appeal for peace and disarmament.Francis is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.He has suffered ill health in recent years and has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. Speculation over an imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanThe papacyItalyCatholicismChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month, China’s ministry of foreign affairspromisedthat China will “fight to the end” with the US in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war”.Daines, a Montana Republican, met Li with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs.Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.Daines, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over US-China trade during Trump’s first term, and has made multiple trips toChinaas a senator. He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble.Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset US tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.Relations between China and the US have come under new strain after Trump slapped additional tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.In early April, Trump is expected to unleash a round of tariffs on all countries that tax US imports, potentially including China. A US review of whether China has fulfilled promises made during the “phase one” trade deal from Trump’s first administration is set to conclude on 1 April. “Currently, US-China relations have come to an important juncture,” Li told Daines in their meeting, stressing the need to choose dialogue over confrontation.“Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,” Li said.The US executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Knew his music and cricket inside out. Raise your bat and enjoy a long rest in the pavilion.”Read posted a recent picture of him having lunch with Peebles and fellow formerRadio1 DJs Dave Lee Travis and Adrian Juste.Tony Blackburn, the first DJ to be heard on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967,posted: “So sorry to hear that fellow DJ from Radio 1 when I was there Andy Peebles has passed away. He was a lovely man and a great broadcaster, very sad news. R.I.P. Andy.”Peebles said the highlight of his career was interviewing Lennon in 1980, although it was bittersweet because two days later the former Beatle was dead after being shot by Mark Chapman.The interview lasted three hours and 22 minutes, Peebles later recalled. “It is a staggeringly long time to actually talk to somebody and that was all down to him.”Peebles’ final question was about how safe Lennon felt living in New York. Lennon suggested he felt very safe as he could easily walk down the street and go to movies and restaurants, whereas in London he “couldn’t walk round the block”.Peebles,in an interview with RTÉ to mark the 40th anniversary of Lennon’s death, recalled going for dinner with him at Mr Chow’s in Manhattan after the interview. The whole restaurant turned their heads, he said; Lennon put his arm around Peebles’ shoulder and said: “They’re all saying who the bleep is that with Andy Peebles?”Born in 1948, he began working as a club DJ in the 1960s before joining BBC Radio Manchester in 1973 and then helping to found Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio, where he presentedhis weekly Soul Train programme. He joined BBC Radio 1 in 1978 and presented a variety of programmes including a soul show andMy Top Twelve, in which music stars would choose their favourite records and talk about their life and career.Peebles also presented 15 episodes of Top of the Pops anda number of Radio 1 roadshows. After Radio 1, he had stints at Manchester’s Smooth FM and London’s 102.2 Jazz FM, and was inducted into the Radio Academy’s hall of fame in 2011.Explore more on these topicsRadioRadio 1BBCJohn LennonRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The 37-year-old actor isn’t in a performance art piece or strange social experiment, but rather starring in director Omar Elerian’s new production of Eugene Ionèsco’s 1959 absurdist play,Rhinoceros;it ishis first stage role in seven years. “It sounds mental but it’s the theatre of the absurd, so it’s meant to be baffling at points,” he says with a smile, back in human form in a white T-shirt and cap while on a break from rehearsals, where he is clearly enjoying taking on the story of a small French town whose inhabitants gradually turn into rhinos.If you have watched a British comedy over the past decade, it’s likely you’ve seen McGuire in it. The endlessly energetic performer is usually found next to the leading man, sporting a frizz of curly hair and delivering anxious one-liners or slapstick pratfalls. He has featured in everything from Netflix seriesLovesickto Richard Curtis’sAbout Timeand Emerald Fennell’sSaltburn.On stage, meanwhile, he had his breakthrough in Laura Wade’s 2010 satire on the British upper classes,Posh, playing a member of a fictionalised version of the Bullingdon Club, and has since starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in David Leveaux’s 50th anniversary production ofRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.“I was a class clown so it’s not surprising so many of my roles have been comedic,” he says, speaking in the quick nasal tone of his many characters. “But in recent years the work has been getting darker, which is welcome, since it’s nice to be morally dubious for once.” In 2022, McGuire starred as “clever asshole” Chris Clarke in the Downing Street thrillerAnatomy of a Scandal, while inRhinoceroshe is tackling material that has been read as a critique of postwar fascism, challenging the audience and its central character Bérenger to question how much people will believe and go along with – even if it means succumbing to a crash of rhinos bolting across the stage.I was drawn to Cheaters because everyone in it has committed some sort of betrayal but they’re also empathetic and lovable“The play is about groupthink and the dangers behind the ideas we might buy into,” McGuire says. “You can read it as a comment on social media and how we can become indoctrinated to follow the crowd, even if we don’t initially agree with where we’re going. But ultimately it’s the cast in a white box with no props – the audience can fill it with whatever they’re seeing and that’s the most confronting thing of all.”While his role as Jean inRhinocerossees him showing a darker side to his usual playfulness, it was McGuire’s top billing in2022’s BBC seriesCheatersthat has done more than anything else to transform him from a sputtering sidekick into an unlikely leading man.Starring alongside Susan Wokoma,Cheaterssees McGuire playing Josh, a downtrodden sound engineer whose adulterous one-night stand with Fola (Wokoma) while on holiday ends up following him home when he realises she has just moved in across the road.View image in fullscreenWith Susan Wokoma in Cheaters.Photograph: Screen Grab/BBC/Clerkenwell“I was drawn toCheatersbecause everyone in it has committed some sort of betrayal but they’re also empathetic and lovable,” he says. “I really liked how Josh isn’t macho or a gym guy but he’s still shown in moments of passion and is working his way through the difficulties of a long-term relationship.”Created by Oliver Lyttelton,Cheatersfeatures plenty of well-observed relational dynamics, as well as a lot of sex. In the 18 10-minute episodes of series one, characters masturbate, get naked, perform oral sex and experience several orgasms. “It was my first experience doing intimate scenes on screen and it was such a gift to be performing alongside Susie [Wokoma], not least because we were both at Rada together in the same year, so I’ve known her for ever,” he says. “We would be in bed almost totally naked, surrounded by 20 crew putting up lights, and we would just be chatting about which mutual friends we had seen recently.”The show became a sleeper hit and a second series came out last year. With the increased popularity, though, it must have been a challenge to prepare his family for the show’s steamy content? “I had to tell my mum that there was nudity in episode one and that it arrives pretty fast,” McGuire laughs. “It’s like five minutes in and bam – there’s my full bum out! There was no easy way to tell her that but she’s seen it all and she’s proud of me.”View image in fullscreenIn rehearsals for Rhinoceros with Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù.Photograph: Marc BrennerGrowing up in Warwick as the youngest of three siblings, McGuire fell into acting seemingly by accident. “I didn’t have a particularly thespy family since my mum’s a paediatric nurse and my dad worked for IBM,” he says. “We were only a 10-minute drive from the RSC in Stratford-on-Avon though and my mum would always take me to see new productions – both the good ones and the not so good.”In 2001, at 13, McGuire was cast as one of the young actors in Gregory Doran’sKing Johnat the RSC and soon caught the bug for performance. “They would just get local boys from the nearby schools to fill in as the young parts for some of the RSC performances and I thought it would be a fun thing to do,” he says. “I was suddenly part of this mad world where people were getting paid to have fun every night and then going for drinks afterwards. I was enchanted and to this day whenever I smell incense it takes me right back to the Swan stage and the cardinal in the play swinging his censer across the boards.”Getting into Rada at 19, McGuire joined a mightily talented cohort, including Wokoma, Daisy May Cooper, James Norton, Cynthia Erivo and Phoebe Fox. “It was a magic time because from 10am to 6pm each day you’d just be playing and discovering,” he says. “I would laugh at what my older brother might have thought if he could see me spending all day being water or jelly.”View image in fullscreenWith Daniel Radcliffe in Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at the Old Vic.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his final year, McGuire was cast with Norton to play members of the riot club in Wade’s Royal Court send-up of the Oxbridge Tory elite,Posh.“His talent was immediately evident,”Observertheatre critic Susannah Clapp says of his performance in the ensemble. “He gleamed in an excellent cast and has since been a good picker of good plays – rumpled in James Graham’sPrivacy(2014) and garrulous and bossy inRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.”While McGuire says his experience ofPoshwas overwhelmingly positive – “I thought all jobs would be as fun, as popular and as pertinent to the moment as that” – future stage roles were less straightforward. “I had the opening line ofRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Deadand one night I began it by skipping the first two pages of the script entirely,” he laughs, head in his hands. “It’s like suddenly thinking about walking and you trip up. Thankfully, I don’t think anyone noticed because Dan [Radcliffe] is so famous that for the first five minutes of that show at least, no one was looking at me.”Does he wish his career had taken off to similar heights, rather than largely being known for supporting roles? “God no. I have mates who have lost all anonymity and it’s really tough, especially if you have kids,” he says. “I have a two-year-old son now and I love being able to go to work but then also come home, put him to bed and leave it all at the door.”View image in fullscreenWith Simon Shepherd in Posh by Laura Wade.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn 2022, McGuire married actor Amy Morgan and the pair share parental responsibilities in their London home alongside their work. “We’re living the dream because we’ve been able to work and have our boy and not really sacrifice any roles,” he says. “It does take a village and we’re very lucky to have so many friends and grannies around for babysitting!”At least McGuire’s current rehearsal schedule means he can be home for bedtime and once the play’s run begins he can spend the day with his son instead. “As a dad, this show takes on another resonance, thinking about how social media groupthink might affect his life in the future,” he says. “But he can’t even read yet so there’s no use worrying too much – I’m more desperate instead to be in one of those Julia Donaldson Christmas adaptations, which he might just about understand!” Until then, it’s a welcome return for McGuire to the London stage, bringing his comedic excitement and recently showcased vulnerability to both rhinoceros and human beings.Rhinocerosruns at the Almeida, London N1 from Tuesday 25 March to 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverEugène IonescoTV comedyTelevisionRoyal Shakespeare CompanyAlmeida theatreComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been really difficult.”The artist pointed out the recent allegations offalse imprisonment, negligence and excessive use of forcelevelled at Greater Manchester police after Romani Gypsies and Irish Traveller children were stopped from attending Christmas markets.Children as young as 10 were allegedly forced on to trains thattook them 100 miles from home.Le Bas said: “I mean, the case with the young kids in Manchester was just quite awful … there have been some really bad incidents historically as well.”View image in fullscreenDelaine Le Bas’s Roma heritage was an inspiration for her Turner prize installation.Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/AlamyEntrenchedanti-Traveller attitudes and negative press coveragefocused on antisocial activity is partly to blame for the treatment of her community, said Le Bas, whose work often confronts those perceptions.“I suppose what I’m trying to do is sort of counter-balance that, but also maybe bring some subtlety,” she said. “Because I don’t feel there’s any subtlety around a lot of this stuff. I just feel it’s either this or that, and there’s all this stuff in between that no one really wants to talk about.”Le Bas said that she had seen other signs of anti-Traveller bias on her travels through Europe.Last year it was announced that the Berlin memorial in tribute tothe 500,000 Sinti and Roma who were murdered during the holocaustwas to be moved to make way for a train line. “If it was any other memorial, it wouldn’t be getting disturbed,” she said. “I see a lot of hypocrisy.”Le Bas, who wasnominated for the Turner prize last year, has taken over a former manor house on the Becontree estate in Dagenham, east London, for her latest project.Behind the door of the house in Becontree, which was once the largest housing estate of its kind in Europe and was used to rehouse people after the slum clearances of the old East End, Le Bas has created a world of installations thatexplore Traveller culture.Silver reflective paper lines the floor and a doormat made of images of cars passing by the front of the house, which is next to the main road running through the vast estate, greet you at the entrance.Over a six-month residency during which Le Basrelocated from her home in Worthing, West Sussexto the estate’s White House, she created long, draped fabric with painted expressions such as “gypsies, tramps and strangers: volume one”, which was the name of a file she found in the property’s archive.View image in fullscreenLe Bas relocated to the White House in Dagenham for a six-month residency.Photograph: Eszter HalasiShe has created what she called “glass sandwiches”, which are transparent picture frames that contain clippings from newspapers containing stories about Travellers. “Sometimes it feels like you’re eating a glass sandwich,” she said. “Because of what you’re having to read or listen to.”La Bas studied at West Sussex College of Design, where she met her late husband, the artist Damian Le Bas, also a Traveller, who died in 2017. The couple’s son,who is also called Damian, is a celebrated author and broadcaster.The White House is run by Create London, which also helped establish theHouse for Artistsproject in Barking and Dagenham, which created affordable housing for artists who are encouraged to interact with the community they are part of.Explore more on these topicsArtRoma, Gypsies and TravellersRacenewsShareReuse this content"

The chair of trustees is George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer.The Parthenon, or Elgin, marbles are the ancient Greek sculptures that once decorated the temple on the Acropolis in Athens. They were removed between 1801 and 1815 by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, who claimed he had permission to take them, although no supporting document has been found. The sculptures were acquired by the British Museum in 1816, but their rightful ownership has been ­disputed since the 1980s.New British Museum trustee Dr Tiffany Jenkins.Photograph: British MuseumIn her bookKeeping Their Marbles:How the Treasures of thePastEnded up inMuseums… andWhyTheyShouldStayThere,Jenkins examined the influences behind the high-profile battle to return museum artefacts in an attempt to repair historical wrongs. Her views are at odds with those of another well-known historian and broadcaster, Dr Alice Roberts, who recently met the Greek culture minister, Lina Mendoni, while filming her series on Ancient Greece for Channel 4.Earlier this month Roberts toldRadio Times: “They belong back in Athens. It’s not equivalent, but I imagine we might be upset in England if another country had significant bits of Stonehenge and wouldn’t give them back. But actually the argument goes deeper than that. There’s a pressing need to recognise some of the questionable practices of the past, which often went hand in hand with the history of colonialism.”View image in fullscreenThe book by Jenkins.Last month, Greece elected a new president, Constantine Tassoulas, who is a prominent advocate for the return of the marbles. A former culture minister, Tassoulas played a key role in revitalising efforts to reclaim the 2,500-year-old sculptures.Until recently, the British response has been based on the idea that the removal was legal, and that the British Museum is the safest custodian. But the argument shifted in recent years as Greece moved away from simply claiming ownership. The question is often now framed as one of “reunification”, involving sharing the legacy.This attitude was emphasised by the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who suggested that art can be kept in a different country without losing its significance. But in 2023, Rishi Sunak, who was prime minister at the time,cancelled a meetingwith Mitsotakis at the last minute in a move interpreted as a way to avoid the issue.Jenkins, an honorary fellow at the University of Edinburgh, was congratulated on her appointment by Claire Fox, her colleague at the Academy of Ideas. This thinktank, founded by Fox 25 years ago on the closure of Living Marxism, is non-party political but promotes what it describes as “a robust stance on contentious issues”.Talks over return of Parthenon marbles to Athens are ‘well advanced’Read moreAlso welcoming the appointment was author and presenter Timandra Harkness, who told theObserverthat Jenkins was solely concerned with the serious business of protecting history and would “not be joining the board to fight any external battles”.Additionally, there was criticism that the new trustees are all white. “If no one black or brown from outside London applied to become a trustee, they should have gone out to look for someone. They are out there,” said one leading cultural figure who wanted to remain anonymous but who is dismayed by the lineup.The museum’s board of 20 trustees does contain a mix of cultural backgrounds, including the Indian-American Amazon executive Priyanka Wadhawan and economist prof Abhijit Banerjee as well as the economist Weijian Shan from China and the Colombian-American philanthropist Alejandro Santo Domingo.Last July, culture secretary Lisa Nandy announced a drive to attract the widest pool of talent to the public appointments system.Announcing the appointments, culture minister Chris Bryant said: “Public appointees help to lead some of the UK’s best-known institutions, and these immensely talented individuals with a wide range of personal and professional experience will make great contributions to how they are run and help to promote British soft power abroad.”Explore more on these topicsBritish MuseumThe ObserverParthenon marblesHeritageSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, happier and more free than ever, she’s found her feet – and her voice – at her healing retreat in the Welsh valleysSun 23 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 11.47 EDTShareWhenCharlotte Churcharrives, she starts to cry. “I break down,” she says, “every time I reach here. It’s the first thing I do when I set foot on this soil.” It’s a two-hour drive from her home in Barry to The Dreaming, the retreat centre she opened in 2023, a pilgrimage across Bannau Brycheiniog and into the myth-steeped hills of the Elan Valley in Powys, central Wales. “Two to three weeks,” she’s explaining, icy ground crunching underfoot, “is the longest I can stay away before I start clucking. As I get closer, I feel myself relaxing, a calm coming over me, my nervous system resetting.” That bodily response, she’s sure, is physiological. Tears stream. “This land holds me like nothing else. It feels like coming home; I’m enveloped here.”It’s early January when I visit. Through the small market town of Rhayader and out into dramatic landscapes, snow-dusted peaks atop rolling hills. A hand-carved sign marks a single-track turning. Through morning mist, The Dreaming comes into view: a three-storey manor almost built into the valley, flanked by moss-lined rocks and woodland. Fresh from being photographed alfresco, Church greets me outdoors: “It’s bloody lush, love, isn’t it?”It sprawls to 50 acres, 33 of it Celtic rainforest. We pass the waterfall, Nant Gorwen, and yomp deeper into the trees. There’s such joy in her voice as she talks about the seasons changing and wildlife here, and what it means to be this land’s custodian. Visiting practitioners run workshops: womb yoga, willow weaving, night-sky gazing; retreats for grief, queer people, goddesses and another she’ll be leading with “two other witches”.It’s tempting to be cynical, but Church is aglow, at ease with herself: in a flowy sky-blue dress, sheepskin coat and cowboy boots, the 39-year-old has gone full Earth Mother. There’s a yurt down by the redwoods where Church stays when on-site. “Then in the morning, I’ll come up here and sing to the land.”View image in fullscreen‘Voice of an angel’: Charlotte Church at the height of her popularity in in 1999.Photograph: Alamy/AllstarAnd that is…? She grins. “Going round the land and having a little sing at it,” she says, “obviously.” A burst of laughter. “It can be whatever you want it to be.” She looks around then hums, a mournful, melancholic tune. “It’s a dialogue to connect with nature, but your own emotions, too. So much of the time we’re in the dark. Start to sing, everything comes to the surface.”Church opened The Dreaming to offer respite to guests. Really, though, it became immediately clear, for Church it’s also a much-needed sanctuary. For years, she took regular, vicious poundings in the tabloid press. A child star, her early classical albums went multiplatinum worldwide. In adulthood, record releases have been less forthcoming. “Part of all this for me has been having the time to cocoon and to heal my wounds inflicted in that exposure. I was made such tabloid fodder, for such long periods of time, lots of people just saw me as a celebrity.” A pause. “A piss-head celebrity, really. It was a time with lots of misogyny flying about, especially towards working-class women, or women who were outspoken.”She came of age in the early noughties: lad mags, body-shaming, a rabid tabloid press capable of unrestrained cruelty. “I was out there, in a toxic culture and environment. I have had to rehabilitate my little creative self. I think I was really exploited. My artistry and talent wasn’t taken seriously. It’s taken some time to remember that Iaman artist; to refind my own creativity.”In November 2020, Church came with her newborn to Rhydoldog House – on the market as a private, residential property – to look around. “It was out of my price range,” she says. “I was just here for a nose: this used to be Laura Ashley’s gaff.” Church was hunting for something else entirely. “A glamping thing, to house an educational, family holiday place.” A neat follow-on from theAwen Project, the free-to-attend, democratic forest school she co-founded in 2019, focused on reconnecting families and rewilding childhood. “And on a personal level, I also didn’t want to have to make a living from show business any longer. I wanted to make art and music, but not be reliant on celebrity; to live more in line with my values. With the money I had left, I wanted to invest in the land.”View image in fullscreen‘I was really exploited. I have had to rehabilitate my little creative self’: Charlotte Church.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The ObserverArriving here, she felt a pull. “I cancelled everything else, I knew right away, I could feel it.” We come to a halt. “I stood right here,” says Church, “on this very spot, and realised: ‘Ah, right,thisis my life now.’” She waves at the thick, verdant forest ahead. “I had this vision of people full of wonder, play and joy here. I could see women with their feet in the waterfalls crying; writing love-letters to themselves in the trees. What exactly I’d do with a whopping great house I couldn’t afford in need of complete renovation? I didn’t have a fucking clue.” The plot cost £1.5m. “I was going to have to put myself in a really precarious position. Friends and family said I was mental.” They’d be proved right: budgets were blown; Church sunk her life savings long before planning permission was granted. “We’re not breaking even yet here. I’ve taken a lot of financial risk. But I fell in love, and that was it.”Still and silent, we stand, for a minute, absorbed by nature. “Right, love,” she interrupts, “you have a wander around the woods and I’ll meet you inside. I’m busting for a wazz, see.”I’m shown aroundthe house by Naoko, the general manager. Guest bedrooms are upstairs. Below, there’s a workshop, library and office, all wooden floorboards, candles and draped curtains; earth tones, gongs everywhere. In the refectory, two long tables. A blackboard sets out the next retreat’s schedule: “celestial blessings” in the elemental garden; “farewells at the fairy door”, etc. Church appears with a loaf of bara brith. “Fancy a tea?” She sings to herself as she puts the kettle on to boil: “I’m a little teapot, short and stout…”“This land, this project,” she continues, “has taught me a lot.” There’s the practical side of running a business, yes. “I didn’t have a fucking clue, but also about myself. I’ve always been incredibly open, porous as a cloud. Which is sort of insane, considering how much shit I’ve had thrown at me. Here, I’ve learned to have boundaries.”View image in fullscreen‘I was growing up, getting a hold of myself, with a towering brain box partner by my side’: Charlotte Church and Jonathan Powell in 2017.Photograph: Polly Thomas/Bafta/ShutterstockHow so? “I’d always been very free with my trust and care,” she says. “I’m the opposite of misanthropic. I’ve a deep love for people, even when they’ve been awful. I always held that as a badge of honour. That no matter what happened to me, I kept faith. Only, it’s really fucking naive.” She laughs from the belly. “I do still have that,” she clarifies, “but also, get real, babe.”Being here has taught Church just how desperately she longed for an escape; a place to shelter and take refuge. First, from the strains of family life. She lives with her two teenagers, four-year-old and husband, Jonathan Powell. “I love being a mother, but it’s complicated… bringing up teenagers.” She recently relocated in part to be close to family. “Looking after the rest of them is a lot, particularly my dad, who is terminally ill.” Her stepfather, James, has AL amyloidosis, a rare disease affecting the internal organs. Church’s mum has bipolar, and her parents separated when she was two. Her biological father, Stephen, from whom she was estranged, died of coronavirus in 2021.“It means I have a massive amount of care duties,” says Church. “I’m back and forth from the hospital, and lots of other things are going on with my extended family. So coming here is a balm. It’s also allowed me to become more of who I am, to drop some of the façade and pretence.”Primarily, for Church, that has meant being more forthright in her politics. Since her 20s, she has been outspoken. Proudly left-wing, her activism traversing anti-austerity movements, the climate crisis, Palestine: “I’m less afraid of what people think about all that now.” At times, she used to feel almost embarrassed about her ideals. “I’d make out like I couldn’t help that I cared, or act like I was just being rebellious. Now, I feel more backed up, stepping into my integrity. The only way we’ll sort out the right fucking mess the world is in is to come back together, in community. There is no alternative and I will battle until my last breath to do it.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m proud that I’ve survived. That even as a little one, I’ve had courage’: Charlotte Church at The Dreaming.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The ObserverA colleague plonks down a plate of roast dinner in front of Church. “Do you mind if I munch?” she asks, tucking in. “I’m absolutely fucking ravenous.”Church can tracethat steadfast spirit back to her Cardiff childhood. “My family,” she says, “instilled a fierceness in me: that we fight and love and live with every fibre of our beings. And a sense that you have to battle – my family has struggled for generations; there are scars and intergenerational trauma. I grew up with this sense of who we were, as a working-class family. There was a lot of humour and music, alongside the really fucking dark shit.”Church was just 11 when she landed her music industry break, singing a phone-in rendition of Pie Jesu onThis Morningin 1997. That same year, she performed on an ITV talent show. It catapulted her to international fame: the nation’s sweetheart, “voice of an angel”. Within 12 months, she’d released her first classical album. She performed with orchestras around the world. Music itself, she always adored. “But I was in a hardcore capitalist machine,” says Church. “A child star in a psychological grinder making a lot of money for big corporations. Sure, I fucking hated bits, but I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m deeply grateful for it, what a privilege.”As she approached her late teens, however, the tabloid press made Church the subject of obsessive attention. There were hidden cameras outside her home, fake stories galore, up-skirting attempts by paparazzi. She believes a suicide attempt by her mother was “at least in part” down to a looming story about the family. Radio DJ Chris Moyles publicly offered totake her virginityas she turned 16, the age of consent. TheSunpublished a story about her pregnancy before Church had even told her family. “I feel my character,” Church says, “the narrative of who I was in the world, was taken from me, and made into something salacious, or something to be ridiculed.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to do something’: Charlotte Church marching with pro-Palestinian supporters in Bath in 2024.Photograph: AlamyShe’s confident that “this isn’t me being overly sensitive”. Take her appearance onQuestion Timein 2015. “I suggested, as was being presented in research at the time, that climate change and drought played a role in war breaking out in Syria.” It was a position posited by a host of experts. “When I said it, it was all over the papers: ‘Voice of an Angel, Brain of Angel Delight: Charlotte Church blames climate change for jihadis.’ I’ve been made into this caricature: sexualised, patronised, ridiculed.”In 2011, Church detailed the effects in evidence to theLeveson inquiry. “I started to understand deeply what the experience me and my family had at the hands of the press really was,” she says. “How dramatic and painful and shaming and ugly it was for us all. It really politicised me, seeing the insidious relations between police, press and government. Especially meetingMilly Dowler’s family. It ignited that fierceness in me, latent before then, maybe, but deep within the female line of my family: right, fuck you fuckers, I’m coming for you all.”For a while, the attacks intensified. “It was revenge,” Church believes. “They tried to discredit me as hard as they could. To make me a figure of ridicule who was thick, and a tart, and a drunk.” The diatribes, she’s sure, were brimming with classism and misogyny. “Now don’t get me wrong, I got myself into certain…” She comes to a stop, reassessing. “Well did I, actually? I mean, I had sex. I went clubbing with friends. Only the tabloids were always right there, poised to orchestrate any sort of downfall.”Through her 20s, Church had become an impassioned activist. “It started with having kids. It started to prickle things in my soul. Thinking about society – about others – in a way I hadn’t as a pretty egocentric teenager.” Church had her first of two children with rugby player Gavin Henson at 21. The couple split in 2010.She met her current husband 15 years ago. “We started writing music together.” He plays guitar and viola. “He really introduced me to the more formal political sphere. Before then, I’d never voted; I wasn’t remotely interested. I felt it had nothing to do with me, aside from being certain I paid too much tax when I was a teenager.” Aged 14, at the Labour party conference, Church set out this very stall to Tony Blair, then prime minister.I still dance my tits off, regular, do not worry. I’m not  rebrandingSo when the media intrusion escalated after Leveson, Church felt emboldened. “I was growing up, getting a hold of myself, with a towering brainbox partner by my side,” she says. The pair jointly wrote her statement after she settled her phone-hacking claim against theNews ofthe Worldin 2012 for£600,000. The now-defunct paper admitted her voicemails were hacked repeatedly over a number of years, and that they’d “unlawfully obtained” then published “private medical information” about Church and her mother. “They basically forced us to settle,” says Church, “otherwise I’d have happily taken it all the way and tried to nail them to the floor. But they were putting my mother in far too much danger.” She cuts herself off. “I can’t really talk about that, blah blah blah. More tea, love?”The tabloid drubbings have died down in recent years. Based on the speed at which any sniff of a story spreads across gossip columns and sidebars-of-shame, it’s likely to be a consequence of Church’s relative absence from the public eye, rather than a lack of malintent or interest. Her recent public positions on Palestine have, however, attracted headline-making criticism.Today, she’s wearing a keffiyeh; Church has spoken at marches, fundraised and performed at Palestine solidarity events. “What’s happening there,” she says, “is the greatest spiritual awakening of our time. Children are being killed in the most cruel way. To me, it’s an absolute no-brainer.” Loud and public accusations of antisemitism have been directed her way. “It’s unpleasant to weather those things,” she says, “have my name dragged through the mud and my family’s security put at risk. But what else is there?” She’s resolute. “I don’t know what the alternative is – its so fucking serious.”And then, of course, there’s all of this. Does she not worry about being painted as a hippy-dippy tree-hugger? She sips her herbal tea. “I don’t mind being castigated or ridiculed for it,” Church says. She leans in, and drops into a whisper. “Because I know the gold, the feeling. How much more enriched life becomes when you embark on this journey. There’s such beauty here, living in the world this way.”I know the gold, the feeling. How much more enriched life becomes when you embark on this journeyWith that same resolve, she’s making new music, too. “I’m going to release an album,” she says, “hopefully, in 2026.” It’ll be her first since 2010. It doesn’t sound like a commercial proposition – “I’m meeting indigenous elders in Peru, Burkina Faso, Australia… I want to sing about nature, healing and sisterhood” – but that’s of little concern. “I want to create experiences,” she says, “to really make peoplefeel. Pop Dungeon did that, in a way.” Long, sweaty nights spent dancing to the cover band she frontedbecame the stuff of legend. “We would get people excited, ecstatic and into hysteria. So much of modern society is trying to manufacture a minor emotional reaction from you with fake shit. To really whip people up in music, song and rhythm is the greatest magic.”We speak foralmost two hours about sound healing, creating ritual and communing with the cosmos. It’s striking how appealing she makes it all sound: not preachy or tiringly tedious. She’s foul-mouthed, quick-witted, great company. In this new dawn, Church is still a laugh, basically.“Listen,” she makes clear, “I’m not holier-than-thou. Life is difficult; do what you need to do to get through it. All last year I was smoking.” She’s now quit again. “I have, naturally with age, stopped going out drinking so much. But I still dance my tits off, regular, do not worry. Just now, it’s less drunk in a club, more at home with friends, or at 6am, alone on a beach, absolutely shaking my arse as an act of devotion. So no, I’m not rebranding.” A shake of the head. “I fucking hate all the pious wellness industry shite. So much of that multi-billion-dollar pile of crap says ‘do this’, ‘buy that’, ‘subscribe to me’, ‘swallow a pill’, and this result will happen. It’s all bollocks.” She gestures out the window. “All this is much more esoteric. We’re not trying to get people to subscribe to a programme. It’s not all peace, love, light; stillness and meditation. It’s exploration. Have a go, and see what works.” That’s been Church’s approach. “I’m not an expert, I’m just following my nose and intuition.”She knows it could have gone so differently: child star turned tabloid target. “I’ve certainly done my hard yards,” she says. “I’m proud that I’ve survived. That even as a little one, I’ve had courage.” The sun is starting to set. Her yurt awaits. One final question.When Church first set foot here, feeling all she did, was she not tempted to snap it up for herself? Shut the world out and raise her family? She smiles, then turns towards the dusk-drenched valley. “Well,” she replies, “I’m a socialist. I believe in public luxury. Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been driven to heal and help. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that the early Celtic and religious songs I sang were found by many to be healing.” What she’s doing now feels full circle. “I see people suffering, whether in my immediate network of family and friends, or out among my kin and peoples. I want to do something about it. That first day, I asked: how could this beauty belong to one family? It might be the way it is in the world today, the wealthy owning vast swathes of the best of nature, but it’s bullshit. This beauty right here is a thing for sharing.”For more about The Dreaming, visitthedreaming.co.ukThis article was amended on 23 March 2025.

Last year was the first in over 20 years without a UK global top 10 single or album in the charts.”Sheeran has called upon the government to provide a cross-departmental taskforce to work together on these issues to ensure music education remains high on the agenda.The letter continued: “The time to act is now. State schools – which educate 93% of the country’s children – have seen a 21% decrease in music provision … we also need you standing up for music education. Artists and industry can’t deliver on the world stage for the UK without schools, youth clubs and stages at home.“We collectively ask for a £250m UK music education package this spring to repair decades of dismantling music … Music in and out of school should be for all, not a few.”A 2025 report by Music Mark, the UK association for music education, found that the Labour governmenthad inherited a £161.4m shortfallin its budget to ensure the future of music education over the next five years.Before winning the 2024 election, Starmer –a former child flautistwho has spoken of the joys of travelling with his youth orchestra – told Classic FM that he “passionately” wanted to reverse the “degrading of creative arts and music” in state schools.Annie Lennox, Dave, Paloma Faith, YolanDa Brown and Sleaford Mods are also among the 500 signatories from the music industry. The Brit awards Rising Star winner Myles Smith has also signed; at the awards ceremony last month, he called on the government, venue conglomerates and music executives to support emerging artists.“How many more venues need to close, how many music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can’t just celebrate success, we have to protect the foundations that make it?” he asked.Arts advocates are hoping Labour’s long-awaited curriculum review, led by Prof Becky Francis, will lead toa boost for the artsand greater educational inclusion, closing the access gap between state and private schools, and those in wealthy and less well-off areas.In 2022, the Conservative government published the second iteration of its national plan for music education, emphasising the “power of music to change lives”. It proposed that all children and young people should be able to learn to sing, play an instrument and create music together, and have the opportunity to progress their musical interests, including at a professional level.But music studies in schools are at a historic low. In August, the Independent Society of Musicians reported a 43% drop in A-level applicants and almost 40% in GCSE applicants since 2010, when then-education secretary, Michael Gove, introduced the Ebacc qualification, which does not include music or art. Last year, the Cultural Learning Alliance found that 42% of state schools enter no pupils for GCSE music.Femi Koleoso, a drummer with Ezra Collective, also advocated for support for music education when the London jazz band won group of the year at the Brit awards. The ensemble formed in 2016 after meeting through the Tomorrow’s Warriors youth jazz programme.Their victory, Koleoso said, was “because of the great youth clubs and the great teachers and the great schools’ that supported young people playing music. “The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, where we’re unsure of how to fix it … the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies with giving a young person a saxophone, because when you do that you give them a dream and aspiration and a goal,” he added.Sheeran previously called for public funding for music in schools in 2023. Hesigned a letter from Andrew Lloyd Webberto Starmer and Rishi Sunak, calling for funding to scale up the work of Lloyd Webber’s music education charity, the Music in Secondary Schools Trust, which provides free musical instruments and weekly music lessons in disadvantaged schools.A government spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of this government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and we are committed to ensuring art, music and drama are no longer the preserve of a privileged few.“To help achieve this our curriculum and assessment review will seek to deliver a broader curriculum, and our new national centre for music and arts education will promote opportunities for children and young people to pursue their artistic and creative interests in school.“We are also expanding the creative careers programme to £3m over the next financial year, to help provide even more schoolchildren with information, advice and guidance on creative career routes.”Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranElton JohnSchoolsColdplayHarry StylesCentral CeenewsShareReuse this content"

Self-taught cook, traveller, recipe collector, historian and anthropologistClaudia Rodenhas reshaped how we think about food, its cultural heritage and social meaning.It’s not just celebrated chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi and Moro’s Samantha Clark who pay tribute to her pioneering work. The historian Simon Schama once observed that “she is no more a simple cookbook writer than Marcel Proust was a biscuit baker”.Yet there is nothing grand or entitled about this remarkable 88-year-old. She has travelled to our meeting place in Hampstead on the tube, her preferred mode of transport, and speaks with scrupulous modesty, exceptional recall and a gift for anecdote that makes her a dream lunch partner.La Cage Imaginaire, a small French-Italian brasserie in Flask Walk, is her chosen venue. It features in the latest Bridget Jones film, she tells me, as the scene of a romantic date. It’s a quiet Tuesday lunchtime and we are, at first, the only guests. Although she adores restaurants, she seldom eats out, she says, partly because of her age and partly because she enjoys cooking so much for family and friends. But she came here recently with one of her two daughters and was impressed by the quality of the food. “We should order quickly,” she says, “because they do everything from scratch.”It’s wise advice, which neither of us takes, because as soon as we take our seats we slip into a conversation that scarcely takes a breather for the better part of the next three hours.Roden’s first book,A Book of Middle Eastern Food,was published in the UK in the revolutionary year of 1968 (and four years later in the US). With crystalline prose and exotic recipes she summoned up both the food and the atmosphere of her childhood in Cairo, where she lived a privileged life in the city’s then thriving Jewish community. She grew up speaking French, Italian, English and Arabic, and became Egypt’s national backstroke swimming champion at 15. In the same year, she moved to boarding school in Paris, where her younger brother was being treated for a serious infection. She lived there for three years before moving to London. “I wanted to stay in Paris,” she recalls.People would say they don’t want wine at lunchtime because it softens their brainsLondon was rather drab in 1954. Rationing only ended in the middle of that year, and British cuisine left something to be desired – taste, mostly. But she took to St Martin’s School of Art, enjoyed living with her two brothers in a flat in north London and began cooking for her fellow art students.“They kept coming to dinner,” she explains. I bet they did.We order two glasses of viognier. “For a while people would say they don’t want wine at lunchtime because it softens their brains,” she comments dryly.She bought Elizabeth David’sA Book of Mediterranean Foodwhen London became her home, and was pleased to find a recipe for molokhia, an Egyptian soup. “I learned how to use recipes,” she says, “because there hadn’t been recipes or cookbooks in Egypt. Everything was just handed down.”In 1956, her parents, along with most of the remaining Jewish community, were forced to leave Egypt after the Suez crisis. They moved to London to join their children. Cut off from her homeland, Roden missed her extended family, but not so much that she wanted to marry one of them – her parents had tried to encourage her to make a match with a cousin. “There was the fear of you being on the shelf,” she says. Her mother and father both came from families with a large number of girls, who were seen as a burden because they required dowries. She says she tries to understand how her parents saw things but at the time she made it clear that she “didn’t appreciate that attitude”.It’s time to order. The three-course set meal is enticingly priced and Roden opts for the duck and cognac mousse with ciabatta to start, followed by egg tagliatelle with king prawns and homemade green pesto topped with parmesan.I go for the creamy wild mushroom risotto, then baked salmon with new potatoes, baby spinach and french beans in a white-wine butter sauce.She was 23 when she married Paul Roden, a clothes importer, with whom she would have three children. The marriage ended after 15 years but in the middle of it she wroteA Book of Middle Eastern Food, a product of nostalgia, love of food and deep scholarship (she buried herself in the Soas library looking for clues to the origins of the meals she carefully documented).Roden and her children formed a close bond during the years of single parenthood (her ex-husband relocated to the US), which remains strong – they all live near her home in Hampstead Garden Suburb and there are weekly meet-ups. When the children left home she decided to travel around Europe and the Middle East to research what would becomeThe Book of Jewish Food(1997); the trip also provided material on Mediterranean cooking that resulted in a number of books and a BBC TV series.She didn’t enjoy the process of being filmed or the demands to emote in an unnatural manner. “I looked so stupid, but also terrified,” she says. “I don’t wish television on anybody.”Still in her forties, she did most of her travelling alone, which attracted a certain amount of unwanted male attention. Her ingenious method of dealing with it was by talking about her five grandchildren. “I didn’t have any then,” she says, “but after I said I did they were totally respectful, though one man said I shouldn’t mention my grandchildren because it puts men off!” It’s a typical Roden story: finely attuned to local cultures but not blind to their shortcomings.The starters are generous, but Roden declares hers “good, though not quite as good as the first time”.View image in fullscreenClaudia ate duck and cognac mousse with ciabatta; egg tagliatelle with king prawns; and green pesto topped with parmesan.

They both drank a glass of viognier, £8; and an espresso, £3.80.La Cage Imaginaire, 16 Flask Walk, London NW3.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverWe discuss a paradox that runs deep in her books. The best traditional food is almost always the product of conflict, the clashing of cultures, the exchanging of culinary ideas and practices. But food is also, as the former war photographer and triple amputeeGiles Duleysays, the antithesis of war; a means of bringing people together.“Yes,” she agrees, before adding, “I know Giles. He’s come to dinner at my place. He’s really wonderful. I can’t believe he can cook with one arm!” The longer we talk, the more I realise that she has met an awful lot of people down the years, but retains a youthful enthusiasm for the new and innovative.Our main courses arrive as she talks about returning to Egypt for the first time, 30 years after her family were expelled. While her Jewish identity is important to her, the prawns confirm that she’s happily secular.The return was “very, very emotional but also thrilling”, she says.A Book of Middle Eastern Foodhad helped Egyptian chefs rediscover their own cuisine and she drew crowds of fans and journalists wherever she went, all asking her why she left Egypt. “It’s not taught,” she says of the Jewish expulsion that took place across the Middle East.Her instincts, though, are all about what unites people rather than what divides them, and she made a whole new group of friends on that first trip back with whom she remains in contact.She’s currently working on another book, her 22nd, in which she revisits the Middle East but this time to explore the regional cooking and peasant food that has only recently begun to gain the appreciation it deserves.“There’s more beans and vegetables. I’m not a vegetarian,” she quickly adds. “But let’s just say there’s more of that and the recipes are marvellous, because they taste so good.”Her tagliatelle is also “very good”, though again not quite up there with her previous experience.She says she’ll return to work after our lunch, although she worries – entirely without justification – about her writing. “You see,” she says, “I feel I’m lacking in words.”I tell her that the past two and half hours strongly suggest otherwise.We finish off with a couple of double espressos, before I accompany her back to the tube station. I could have happily stayed on until dinner. But this amazing cultural ambassador, this inspirational wandering gastrophile, has another book to write.Explore more on these topicsClaudia RodenLunch with...FoodMiddle Eastern food and drinkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Frankie was eight weeks old when he came to live with us, and right now, watching him bound around with my seven-year-old son, I don’t want to imagine ever saying goodbye to him. Well, maybe I won’t need to, or rather, I can at least kick that day into the long grass, and buy Frankie some extra time. After all, scientific understanding of the mechanisms of ageing has never been better; there is a plethora of longevity products to choose from and more in the pipeline, including a kind of diet pill for dogs; and, thanks to research into lifespan expansion for pets over the last decade, prescription-based longevity interventions that are now approaching FDA approval. All I have to do, it seems, is put in the time, care and (lots of) cash.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But should I do so? Don’t our pets live long enough already? And whose needs would I be serving – my own or my pooch’s? In the UK, the life expectancy for a dog isjust over 11 years, while catsaverage 14. As a working cocker spaniel, Frankie should be with us for 12-15 years – old enough that he’ll still be around when my son leaves home, just not long enough to see me into my dotage.That’s fine by me – let the cycle of life and death proceed apace. I side with the dog owners who are happy to take however many woofs, walks and belly rubs they can get. But the figures show that many of us are investing a significant amount of money and time into extending the lifespan of our four-legged friends. In the UK, the pet supplement industry is worth around $255m, with the overall pet market in the US set to reach a value of$200bn by 2030: this growth is driven partly by an increased spending on pharmaceuticals, diagnostic testing and vet bills. There are wearable activity trackers for dogs and cats, smart collars that collect sleep data, temperature-adjustable beds andapps to analyse your pets’ poop. But we’re now seeing the emergence of something new: longevity-focused pills and injections that can address the more fundamental causes of pet mortality.“We live in the same environments as our dogs and share similar lifestyles,” says Celine Halioua, the founder of Loyal – a San Francisco-based biotech startup that’s so far secured $150m in investment to develop what it hopes will be the first widely available lifespan-extension drug for dogs.Loyal’s research is based on the observation that larger dog breeds tend to have shorter lifespans – Newfoundlands live for an average of 8-10 years, while Chihuahuas average 15-17. To address this, they’re developing a range of vet-prescribed products for the US market that turn down production of IGF-1, a hormone that manages cell growth, found at high levels in larger dogs. Research across a number of species suggests links between IGF-1, age-related disease and longevity in several species – driven in part by higher oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.Intervention's only worthwhile if it increases an animal’s healthspan; the proportion of life they’re active and healthy“You could argue that by breeding for larger dogs, we have – to some extent – also bred in a faster rate of ageing in those dogs,” says Dr Matt Kaeberlin, a biologist and longevity expert. “And so turning down IGF-1 would almost definitely have an effect if you administered it while the dog was young – but then, of course, you’d end up with a small dog. The question is if it will work in middle-age, after the dog has stopped growing. But even if it doesn’t, it should have a pretty big effect on cancer [IGF-1 stimulates cell proliferation, which is linked to the development of some cancers], which we know is a major killer.” As dogs live longer, cancer is increasingly common as a cause of death – especially among breeds like the Bernese mountain dog and bull mastiff. “That means Loyal really has two chances for their system to work,” says Kaeberlin. “So I’m pretty optimistic that it’s going to show some positive effects.” The company has three drugs in development – Loy-001 and 003 are specifically aimed at larger dogs, while Loy-002, aimed at dogs over 10, is the closest to full FDA approval. In February, the daily tablet received its “reasonable expectation of effectiveness” acknowledgment from the FDA and could be prescribed in the US this year.Of course, this isn’tthe only theory about how pets’ lives might be extended, or the only solution on offer. One of the best-evidenced interventions for humans and other species is calorie restriction: in one14-year studyconducted in a laboratory environment, Labrador retrievers that were fed 25% less than their full-fed siblings saw a mean increase in lifespan of 15% (important to note: the “lean-fed” dogs weren’t malnourished and the diet restriction had no adverse effects on skeletal strength or metabolism). Similar levels of calorie restrictionseem to have a positive effecton biomarkers of ageing in humans – but very few people are suggesting that it’s something you should try with a pet.“Caloric restriction in a laboratory environment is very protected,” says Dr Kaeberlin. “Animals’ exposure to pathogens in a lab is very different and the number of processes in the body that are modified by restricting calories is in the tens of thousands. But there are a lot of negative consequences that go along with very severe caloric restriction in the real world.” In other words, it’s fine, and probably advisable, to keep an eye on your dog’s weight – obesity in animals, as in humans, can lead to a raft of health conditions – but not to deliberately restrict their eating over the long term. However, a project co-created by Kaeberlin is also testing another intervention that mimics some of the effects of calorie restriction and can actually be administered in pill form – an artificial drug named rapamycin, originally developed as an immunosuppressant for organ transplant patients.The Dog Aging Project, a US-based research initiative currently following tens of thousands of non-laboratory dogs in a long-term study, has been running trials to determine the effects of rapamycin on dogs since 2018, after receiving a five-year grant for nearly $29m from the National Institute on Aging. They’ve prescribed rapamycin to thousands of pet dogs in double-blind, placebo- controlled trials – tracking their health progress through annual questionnaires (or in some cases, DNA testing).“I believe rapamycin is the best shot on goal,” says Kaeberlin. “Other than caloric restriction, it’s the intervention for which there is by far the most data in preclinical studies, both for lifespan and pretty much every measure of healthspan that people have looked at.” Rapamycin has already shown promising results in worms, yeast andmice– in the latter, it’s been shown to increase lifespan by a median 25%, while also affecting the prevalence of certain cancers.Whatever genetic hand a pet's been dealt, stress, nutrition and exercise all play a partSome of Silicon Valley’s human longevity fans, not wanting to wait for formal human trials or FDA approval, are already including rapamycin in their supplement stacks.(Bryan “Don’t Die” Johnson, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who spends $2m a year on longevity treatments and has his own Netflix documentary, recently ended his own five-year protocol, citing side effects including “soft tissue infections, lipid abnormalities… and increased resting heart rate”.) Rapamycin works by inhibiting a protein now commonly known as mTOR (or the “mechanistic target of rapamycin” – yes, it’s named after the drug), which regulates cell growth and metabolism. “What mTOR fundamentally does is that it senses the environment an animal is in, particularly with regard to nutrition, and helps the animal’s cells make a decision about whether it’s a good time to grow or reproduce,” says Kaeberlin. “So for instance, if there’s not very much food around that’s a really bad time to have babies – so that turns mTOR down. And one of the side effects of that from an evolutionary perspective is that you enhance stress resistance – and one consequence of that increased resistance is slower biological ageing.”Other competing theories might offer promising leads, but aren’t (yet) as well funded or researched. The New York-based Vaika Project has spent years tracking the health of a group of 103 retired sled dogs, looking at DNA damage, but doesn’t yet have a suggested intervention in pill form and has been forced to cut back its tracking efforts due to funding issues. In Japan, former professor and immunology researcher Toru Miyazaki is studying an inhibitor that might protect cats from kidney disease by helping them dispose of dead cells more efficiently – AIM30, a cat kibble based on his findings, is already on sale, but trials for a vaccine are ongoing. At least one breed of guinea pigs has hadtheir entire genome sequencedas a model for studying Alzheimer’s, heart disease and other disorders in humans – but so far, that hasn’t resulted in any longevity interventions for the pet variety. So what about owners who want to tackle their beloved pets’ health now?Plenty of over-the-counter supplements offer ingredients that have shown promising results in mice or flies, but little evidence of their efficacy in larger animals. Humans are more helpful: there are any number of other lifespan or healthspan-enhancing interventions available to certain pets, some better evidenced than others. DNA testing, for instance, can help to predict whether your cat or dog has genetic mutations that might predispose them to certain illnesses or adverse reactions to other medication. Epigenetics is another promising area for investigation, as studies increasingly suggest that environmental factors can play a key role in controlling which of an animals’ existing genes are expressed – however good or bad a genetic hand a pet’s been dealt, stress, nutrition and exercise can all play a part. And, as with humans, we’re also starting to understand that the gut and microbiome are likely to play a huge role. Deficiencies in gut bacteria, for instance, have been linked toneurological issues in dogsandsmall cell lymphoma in cats.“There’s some evidence that dogs in particular are born with a compromised microbiome,” says Anna Webb, a canine nutrition and behaviour specialist. “And also that unlike, say, horses, which tend to bounce back pretty well after a course of antibiotics or medication, dogs’ microbiomes don’t. And part of this might come from ongoing diet choices – where, for instance, owners are opting for a convenience-style diet that we’re increasingly understanding may not contain what dogs really need to thrive.Dogsseem to do very well eating raw meat that’s unadulterated, packed with the moisture and juices that they thrive on.”It’s surprisingly difficult to find good quality data on disease incidence and lifespan in dogs and cats – even in the US, electronic record systems are fragmented across different vets, and some still use paper. But what seems uncontestable is that the things that are good for us as humans – eating a balanced diet, getting plenty of exercise and outdoor time, feeling valued and loved – are also good for our shorter-lived companions, in ways we’re just starting to understand.View image in fullscreen‘Particularly with senior pets, cognitive health is just as important as physical health.’Photograph: Toms Kalniņš/EPAThe microbiome, for instance, seems to be topped up by being outdoors, while studies suggest that dogsshare stress levels with their owners. “There are several instances on record of dogs in Australia that lived into their mid-20s,” says Webb. “These were dogs that just lived on sheep farms, running around outdoors, having a blast, eating things like cows’ tails and whatever they found on their travels. A real dog’s life, if you like.” And in the way that humans seem to benefit from moderation, movement and ways to de-stress, it’s likely the same thing happens in other mammals. “As a veterinarian with a focus on animal nutrition, I do find the development of longevity pill regimes for dogs intriguing, and I’m cautiously optimistic on the better-evidenced options,” says Dr Michael Thompson, founder of Pets Food Safety, an organisation dedicated to providing dietary advice for pets. “But until longevity pills become more widely approved and available, I advocate for evidence-based approaches to improve a pet’s lifespan. Ensuring pets receive a balanced diet tailored to their specific life stages, including adequate protein intake, essential for maintaining muscle mass, is crucial.”“Maintaining an active lifestyle helps keep pets at a healthy body weight and prevents obesity, which is a significant factor in various diseases – and particularly with senior pets, cognitive health is just as important as physical health,” he says. “Engaging toys, training, and environmental enrichment can keep pets mentally sharp. Oral health is often overlooked, but dental disease can lead to systemic health issues. Regular tooth brushing and veterinary dental cleanings can extend a pet’s life. In my practice, I’ve seen that when these basics of care are adhered to, pets tend to enjoy not just longer lives, but ones characterised by improved health and vitality.”But the biggestquestion remains: if youcangive your pet longer life with an injection or a pill, should you? It probably goes without saying that any intervention is only worthwhile if it increases an animal’s healthspan – the proportion of life they’re active and healthy – in lockstep with lifespan, but even then, is a few more years at the tail end of a pets’ life really for them, or for you? For me, though it’s easy to say right now, I doubt I’ll invest in extending Frankie’s life beyond what he’s likely to naturally get. As a man living in the UK, I’ll be very happy if I make it to the end of my expected 78.8 years in relatively decent shape – and if my dog makes it to 15 or so with most of his joie de vivre intact, I feel like I’ll have done my job.I can also see it from other points of view. “If I had the money, I would absolutely look into interventions like these for some of our animals,” says Holly Brockwell, who runs a no-kill shelter for disabled, elderly and unloved cats. “Sometimes you get one who’s had a really hard life and by the time you get them they’re on their last legs and you just want to give them some more time being happy and loved. I did chemotherapy on one of my ancient mogs for that reason when she got cancer, but to be quite honest, it wasn’t worth the side-effects. This sounds like it might be an alternative.”Other people, at different stages of their lives, might need the companionship of their best friends in ways that I (hopefully) won’t, or find the pain of replacing them too much to do it often. I certainly sympathise. But that’s the tragedy and beauty of life, that everything ends. No longevity treatment is promising to let pets live as long as their owners, and there are always going to be sad goodbyes. But the important thing for all of us, humans, cats, dogs, and even guinea pigs, is to live our best lives, for as long as we can.Explore more on these topicsPetsThe ObserverDogsCatsAnimalsBiotechnology industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The plan was for the baby and me to follow him six weeks later.I’d decided to make the journey as leisurely as possible, so I booked a stopover in Hong Kong. I was very proud of myself setting out because I’d made a homemade baby sling to carry James on my chest during the flight.But when I got off the plane in Hong Kong and was waiting for my bag, I suddenly realised: the baby was against my chest, so how the hell was I going to get that suitcase? I couldn’t grab it myself because it would smack into me, or the baby might fall out as I leaned over. I couldn’t take the sling off and lay him on the ground – what if someone stole my baby while I had my back turned grabbing the suitcase? I was really working myself into a state. Clearly, I still had some postpartum emotions going on.The kindness of strangers: I thought I’d lost my flute for ever, then a chance to play Greensleeves returned it to meRead moreLooking back, I should have gone up to an airport official and asked them to help me. But I could not think logically about how to deal with the problem. I had been breastfeeding, I must have been tired, and I was an emotional heap. So I just stood there and burst into tears as I watched the suitcase go round and round the carousel.Luckily, there was a couple, probably in their 50s, also waiting at the carousel. The woman saw me crying my eyes out, walked over and said, “What’s the matter?” Through tears I told her that I couldn’t work out how to get my suitcaseandhold my baby. Of course, her husband grabbed the bag for me and everything was fine within about 10 seconds. Such a simple gesture and, in the end, such a simple solution.When I look back on it, there must have been other people nearby who just awkwardly averted their eyes. The fact that this couple saw me and were willing to walk over and help was a real reminder that people can be lovely. I often wonder if the woman might have been a grandmother with a daughter my age, who knew what it’s like to have a newborn baby.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

We talk to the restaurants riding the wave of viral-video successJimi FamurewaSun 23 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 04.23 EDTShareWill Murray isn’t sure about the toad in the hole. In the soft gleam of a prep kitchen, deep below St James’s in London, the chef-patron and co-founder of Fallow frowns at a pan of puffy bronzed batter and extruded sausages. “Do you think we need to do it again?” asks one of his chefs, Emma Taiwo, approaching the pass. “I think we need to do it again,” says Murray, striking an apologetic tone amid the waft of simmering gravy.On the face of it, this level of perfectionism is not surprising – Murray and his fellow chef and co-founder Jack Croft both emerged from the fastidious, Michelin-starred environment of Heston Blumenthal’s Dinner. What is unexpected is that the people this dish is being made for will never actually taste it. Next to the worktop where Murray and Croft stand, a three-person production crew fiddles with iPhones, audio equipment and propped-up wearable cameras.That toad in the hole is one of 14 dishes being cooked and tasted during a day of filming for an “Iconic British Dishes” YouTube challenge that will be beamed out toFallow’s 1 million subscribersand beyond. It’s the latest in a long line of attention-grabbing videos that have seen Murray and Croft compare scrambled-egg techniques, turn beef fat into soap and replicate a cockentrice, a complicated Tudor dish. “Yeah, that didn’t really work,” says Croft.It’s like Jamie on TV or Nigella writing books, but there’s a brand new delivery system and the scale is almost limitlessWelcome to the weird and increasingly lucrative world of restaurant social media and content creation; a digital-age gold rush that has seen hospitality businesses of all kinds seek to transform their fortunes throughInstagram, TikTok and YouTube. From the moment Croft, Murray and restaurateur James Robson launched Fallow, initially as a pop-up in 2020, they have been embracing the potential of a savvy online presence. What began with social-media accounts for their three restaurants (including chicken shop Fowl and Canary Wharf blockbuster Roe) has mushroomed into four accounts with millions of views a month across different platforms. They feed into an operation that employs 345 people (six of whom are part of a dedicated content team) and, in Fallow, has a flagship restaurant doing 5,200 covers a week.Where once a restaurant’s digital footprint consisted of some Instagram, a few dutiful promotional Facebook posts and a blog last updated during “eat out to help out”, now it is just as likely to be an ambitiously shot mix of kitchen documentary, reality show and meme-literate sketch comedy. Crisply technical, ASMR-style recipes walk us through the process of dishes (seeThomas StrakerandMaison François’s Matthew Wryle). Day-in-the-life videos demystify the hospitality business and valorise tasks such as dough-proving and wiping down surfaces.TopJaw-style interviewsthrust clip-mics into the faces of commis chefs and bartenders.View image in fullscreenPatrick Brown, co-founder of Onda Pasta Bar in Manchester, filming in the kitchen for the restaurant’s social media accounts.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe result is a lightning bolt of virality and real-life restaurant success stories (such as solo operation Patio Pizza in Kingston; Bristol-born Sandwich Sandwich; and Spud Bros in Preston, the jacket potato tram turned TikTok phenomenon with 3.7 million followers). Internet culture, having given us Instagrammable interiors and cartoonish, phone-eats-first dish aesthetics, is now transmogrifying much of the restaurant landscape. In a2024 interview withRestaurantmagazine, Croft suggested Fallow’s business “might become a social media group with restaurants rather than a restaurant company that’s funding our digital”.The days when a chef’s “content” was limited to what they put on the pass are long gone – but what does it all mean for the future of hospitality, and old-fashioned notions such as whether the food is any good?One of Fallow’s formative social-media breakthroughs was born of a problem perhaps as old as restaurants themselves. “Saturday morning service was always our slowest of the week,” explains Murray. “One of our general managers said, ‘Why don’t we do brunch?’ And, of course, every other chef is like, ‘Fucking hell, we’re not doing brunch.’ But we thought: actually, that’s a great idea.” After developing a menu, they posted photos of their new “royale pucks” – decadent, drippy riffs on egg McMuffins, wedged between proprietary pressed croissant buns – to their Instagram. “We sold out the brunch service for the next three months,” says Murray. “It went from our worst service of the week to being 450 covers.”People want something authentic, a little more raw, with some personalityHere was a measurable justification for the energy expended on an Instagram account. Boosted by the arrival of experienced creative director Joe Cowie, the Fallow team built on this proof of concept. Longer YouTube content followed, including a series of popularPOV videos(the first has 6.4m views and counting) which featured GoPro cameras strapped to the chests of Murray and Croft in the midst of a busy service. The success of those absorbing clips, a kind of culinaryCallof Duty, led to a couple of other lightbulb moments. The first was the discovery of their exact YouTube demographic (96% male and 25 to 45 years old); the second was a meeting with a YouTube department head who explained what worked on the platform.“People interact with content for three different reasons,” says Murray. “Education, access or entertainment. A pillar of our content is that it’s educational.” This targeting forms the basis of the technical dish breakdowns and playful, YouTuber-coded challenges (“We cooked the best Michelin star dish from every decade”) Murray and Croft devise alongside their content team. These are filmed every Monday, and put out on restaurant channels and theHerd Chefsaccount that is the umbrella entity for their virtual cooking school.I get a closer look after Murray orders that toad in the hole to be remade. Downstairs, he and Croft taste and rate a plate of fish and chips as part of the British Dishes challenge; Cowie films and directs with two iPhones while production manager Russell Clamp supplies sheets of research. It feels like the kind of thing that might once have been an anarchic TV series.“The idea of promoting your restaurant and a brand as a story is age old,” says Frances Cottrell-Duffield, publicist and founder of Tonic Studio, a social media agency for the hospitality industry. “It’s not that dissimilar to Jamie getting on TV or Nigella writing books. It’s just that there’s a brand new delivery system, and the scale is almost limitless because of the number of people you can reach.” Social media’s tendency to prioritise scrappy honesty over gloss has enabled creators to go where TV seldom would. “We view our specific niche as teaching people how to cook, being radically transparent and taking away the veil of restaurants,” adds Murray.View image in fullscreen‘Need this in my beside table’ … Onda Pasta Bar’s ‘tiramisu drawer’ post on TikTok was viewed 3m times in one morning.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThat notion of transparency is key. If restaurants have traditionally been predicated on theatre, and careful obfuscation of exactly what goes on beyond the swing doors of their kitchens, today’s businesses are making a feature of how the operational sausage comes together. Fallow has turned explanatory videos about not wearing rubber gloves and thehigh mark-up on its £29 sriracha butter cod’s headinto content. Dalston’s Dusty Knuckle bakery has used Instagram to provide detailed breakdowns of why prices are going up. Gina, the forthcoming Chingford restaurant from chef and Junior Bake Off judge Ravneet Gill and her husband, Mattie Taiano, has a companion Substack, which acts as both a crowdfunding mechanism and a diary of the process of opening a restaurant. This approach doesn’t just reflect a TikTok-age prizing of authenticity and get-ready-with-me fascination about the minutiae of other people’s lives. It also mirrors a cultural moment that has given usThe BearandBoiling Point, when there is a particular, alluring fascination with professional kitchen environments that can be harnessed into something transformative.No British restaurateurs know this better than the founders of Onda Pasta Bar in Manchester. In September 2023, the restaurant was four months into operating from a temporary space on the edge of Ancoats, struggling for consistent bookings and not getting much traction from its social media. Then, co-founder Patrick Brown noticed the refrigerated drawer where chef Sam Astley-Deankept a scoopable slabof tiramisu. “Because I’m not from a chef background, I was just like, ‘What is that?’” says Brown. “And Sam said, ‘Oh, it’s just something I did to save a bit of time in the kitchen when we get an order.’ I had it in my head for about a month.”The subsequent social-media post altered Onda’s fortunes. Following a like-magnet comment onTikTok(“Need this in my bedside table”), the viral video of Astley-Dean’s tiramisu drawer was viewed 3m times in one morning, shared on Instagram by the actor Florence Pugh and almost melted the booking function on Onda’s website. “By the end of that week we were fully booked from October until February,” says Brown. “It gave us confidence to start looking at permanent sites, rather than looking at the finances and thinking we could go under any week.”View image in fullscreenUrban Tandoor’s TikTok.Photograph: @urbantandoorbristol/TikTokCreative dessert storage and the aspirational reality of kitchens are not the only routes to virality. In the past 18 months or so, Bristol-based Indian restaurant Urban Tandoor has had a business-reviving uptick in bookings via an unlikely source: captivatingly shonky music parodies shared on TikTok. Aqua’s Barbie Girl has become Bhaji Girl, performed by waiters and chefs in cheap wigs; Sophie Ellis-Bextor’sSaltburn-soundtracking hit is now a terrifically silly 55-second love story called Murder at the Tandoor. The restaurant’s owner, Sujith D’Almeida, notes that tourists from as far afield as Australia have been prompted to make pilgrimages for selfies with befuddled front-of-house staff, and that “about 40%” of business now comes from fans of their TikTok. “The restaurant market is saturated on social and the appetite for content is changing,” notes Nat Brereton, head of TikTok at Nonsensical, the dedicated TikTok marketing agency behind Urban Tandoor’s videos. “You can only look at so many gorgeous plates of food, so people want something that feels authentic, a little more raw and has some personality.”Of course, if everyone is hurling things at the same algorithmic target, the impact is going to be dulled. Brereton acknowledges that it takes until “the 70th post or something” to see cut-through. Brown thinks that we may have already passed saturation point. “I can’t say for certain, but it feels like the wins mean less,” he explains. “If so many restaurants are going viral for day-in-the-life videos, that’s going to stop putting bums on seats. It’s only been a year and a half since our tiramisu drawer reel but I don’t know if it would have been as successful or had the same impact now.”Cottrell-Duffield also points out that the unstoppable engine of social-media popularity can occasionally backfire. “We had a restaurant where something went viral on their dessert menu and it totally brought in the wrong audience,” she says. “The customers didn’t enjoy it when they got there so it was this unhelpful flash in the pan.”Murray acknowledges that worries about screen time and what some in the US have started to call “attention fracking” will undoubtedly grow in the next six months. “A hundred per cent there will be a move away from it and we’ll be first in the firing line,” he says. “If it gets to the point where we’re prioritising content over the success of the restaurant, we’ve gone too far.”A hundred per cent there will be a move away from it, and we’ll be first in the firing lineSigns of a shift in approach may already be here. One of the notable restaurant trends of recent months has seen some places taking an ascetic approach to social media. The Dover in Mayfair has a placeholder Instagram presence, and Canteen in Notting Hill favours soft-focus kitchen candids and a single, repeated screenshot of the day’s changing menu. At Lucia’s, a small, Mexican-inspired counter in Hackney Wick, a rush to open accidentally turned into a hugely successful, digital-averse approach. “People loved that their initial contact with us was a conversation rather than a picture on Instagram,” says founder Jo Kurdi. “They had to come in, explore and find out for themselves.”To swim against the tide is a strategy in itself. But it’s worth noting that all these chefs and owners are using wildly different methods to search for the same thing: the joyful interactions that arise when customers discover delicious food. “I think it comes from the lack of money in hospitality,” says Cottrell-Duffield. Last November, accounting firm Price Bailey reported that 12% of restaurants in Britain were at imminent risk of closure. “There is an air of desperation, in all honesty, and people are just trying to find a way to bring people in, at a time when no one has really caught up to how quickly the media landscape has changed.” Viral dishes that aren’t actually good are as ephemeral as an Instagram story.This competitiveness is what is driving Fallow and others to double down on digital content; not to replace traditional hospitality, but to navigate an increasingly brutal trading environment. It’s at the forefront of Murray’s mind as he prepares to make a pork pie for Cowie’s cameras and millions of viewers. “The food is the most important thing, and the customers, too,” he says. “But at the same time, what does the food matter if there’s no one there to taste it?”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverSocial mediaFoodHospitality industryTikTokYouTubeInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In my experience, a pullover on the shoulders was not in any way “posh“ in Italy. It was an alternative to tying the pullover around the waist. Both were choices made when one thought it unnecessary to keep wearing the pullover because it was too warm. Why are both choices inexplicable to Brits? Because they would rather leave home without the pullover and feel cold for a while, rather than feeling warm and comfortable at the beginning and then have to carry the pullover when they warm up.This could also be a nice lede into the subject of the popularity ofthe concept ofhyggein Britain, but not in Italy.

I will describe them, and you will see how our reactions show that earnestness has gone violently out of style. The first picture accompanied a quote from Jeremy Strong responding to his Oscar nomination. He’d put out a long statement saying this was the “realisation of a lifelong dream” and shared a photo of himself as a kid in 1993, when he spent the night “on cold metal bleachers” outside the Academy Awards to watch the nominees arrive. “I have not lost that feeling of excitement… I have devoted my life to the attempt to do genuine work that would be worthy of this honour.”The second was an Instagram post where Strong’sSuccessionco-starKieran Culkinreacted to his competing nomination with champagne on a balcony in Paris, and the phrase, “Let’s fucking gooooooo.”OK, then we have Timothée Chalamet’s much-memed acceptance speech for his SAG award. “The truth is,” he said, in a lime green shirt, “I’m really in pursuit of greatness… I want to be one of the greats.”Then the kicker – a picture went viral of Strong and Chalamet talking seriously at the afterparty. “They’re having a thesaurus-off,” someone commented slyly.When Culkin won the Oscar over Strong, there seemed to spread a feeling of smugness, a silent, gold-plated sneer – the right Roy had won. Because Culkin’s performance had appeared effortless – in interviews he routinely explained how he didn’t like to rehearse, instead he just turned up on the day and said the lines, no big deal.This was in vivid contrast to Strong, whose infamousNew Yorkerprofile contained quotes about playing hisSuccessioncharacter like, “To me, the stakes are life and death.” Why does Culkin’s flippancy come off today as charming, while Strong or Chalamet’s sincerity make even their fans recoil? When did earnestness become a crime, and why?I thought about this when I found myself accidentally browsing weightloss drugs. My Instagram feed is suddenly full of ads for cut-price Ozempic knockoffs, injections that can cure the problem of hunger. They offer, not just a more acceptable body, but a more acceptable way to walk through the world, a chance to live without showing yearning and wanting and needing, or anything effortful at all.Nihilism is self-preservation, a kind of daily inoculation against disappointment and fearIt reminds me of the lure of “quiet luxury” and “stealth wealth”. These beige coats and cream jumpers are valuable and coveted because of the way they’re embedded with codes that show how successful their wearer is without having to do anything as vulgar or grabby as display a logo. Likewise the laser facials and expensive injectables that allow wealthy women to forgo makeup. All are a way to walk through the world without appearing to try. All are tricks to living that define the world today. In an essay for the Substack newsletter That Final Scene, which is titled “Jeremy Strong, Kieran Culkin, and the cost of caring too much” and goes into more depth on the story, its author Sophie writes: “This obsession with effortless success is class warfare dressed in cashmere.”A battered car, a “kitchen supper”, “this old thing”, these are the silent signals of privilege – these are the staples of a life that appears to come easily. Often because it does, because this is the life and these are the rules that have been handed down from generation to generation, not just the cash or opportunity, but the language and attitude. To say you want something, to say you really want it, that you want it so much you would camp outside an awards ceremony at night just to be close to it, is to express an uncomfortable vulnerability, and expose yourself as unwhole or worse, low class. And it’s uncomfortable to see it too! To hear Chalamet’s ambition, to see Strong’s childhood desire provokes in us a kind of interior confrontation. We are forced to ask ourselves what we really want, and what we have that hasn’t been earned.Affected detachment is far easier than being earnest. Nihilism is self-preservation, a kind of daily inoculation against disappointment and fear. Dipping into earnestness, even for a moment, can feel completely mortifying. Dangerous, even. A couple of years ago theNew York Timesannounced we were entering the “Age of Anti-Ambition”, a claim that was reinforced more recently by young women’s dalliances with “marry a rich guy” influencers and the “soft life” promise marketed by trad wives. To strive (especially after the pandemic) seemed grubby and exhausting – far more appealing to simply float.But here’s what I think. I think the ick we sometimes feel towards those who are openly wanting is misplaced. I think there is room to critique earnestness and ambition, especially when the ambition is simply “success”, an ambiguous blur of awards or cash, because the rewards for such things are almost always empty and unsatisfying. That’s not what we’re seeing with these earnest actors though, these slim men in brave suits using big words. These are people taking their work seriously, yet, in this culture, are risking that work by doing so.Culkin said he objects, “when actors call themselves ‘storytellers’. Sorry, Jeremy”. Brian Cox said of Strong’s approach to acting, “It’s fucking annoying. Don’t get me going on it.” While I absolutely love everything old Culkin does, while I am in awe of the way Cox can imbue a raw little swearword with infinite pathos, I admire the gritted earnestness of a person who refuses to compromise, who leans into pretension, even if it makes them unlikeable. Because it makes it easier for the rest of us to be honest about our own struggles, and desires, and to show we give a shit. It lets us be hungry again.This article was amended on 23 March 2025 to include reference to That Final Scene newsletter as a source for discussion on issues addressed in this column.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Eva Wiseman columnCelebrityOscarsWork & careersAwards and prizescommentShareReuse this content"

In the days that passed since Thompson was fatally shot on a Manhattan sidewalk by an unknown assailant on 4 December, policetracked downsurveillance footage allegedly revealing the still-unidentified Mangione’s face and widely distributed a now notorious still of him appearing to smile at a hostel, all in an attempt to find the fugitive.That hunt ended on 9 December when a worker at an Altoona,Pennsylvania, McDonald’s allegedly recognized Mangione from law enforcement alerts and called in a tip to local police. Two patrol officers went to the McDonald’s and approached him.After Mangione pulled down his face mask, they claimed to recognize him from the photos. They asked for ID, which turned out to be false, and more police were dispatched to the scene, ultimately resulting in his arrest.Mangione’s backpack was searched at the police station – turning up an apparentghost gun, as well as a silencer and bullets, among other allegedly inculpatory items – and he was charged with false identification and weapons counts. This chain of events would culminate in Mangione’s extradition to New York City, where he now faces state and federal charges.But Thomas Dickey, Mangione’s Pennsylvania attorney, has since contended that his client’s encounter with police was fraught with constitutional violations and that the evidence collected must be thrown out, urging dismissal of the Pennsylvania state charges in court papers filed on 12 March.Several veteran defense attorneys told the Guardian that while there are strict requirements surrounding arrests and gathering evidence, judges frequently deny motions like Mangione’s. And if this request did prove successful in Pennsylvania, such a decision would not jeopardize his other cases.“Even if this motion is successful, it doesn’t mean that Luigi Mangione walks out of prison,” said Ron Kuby, a criminal defense attorney whose practice focuses on civil rights. “All it means is that the items that were seized from him, or seized that belong to him, can’t be used as evidence against him.”“That would certainly hurt the prosecution’s case, but he was on video, shooting a man in the back,” Kuby said. “Substantial evidence remains, including his travel and other things.”That said, the merits of this motion are “surprisingly good”, with the caveat that “so much depends on what happens at a hearing”.Kuby thinks that Mangione’s team has made enough claims in their papers to merit a hearing on the issues, in which the police officer involved would have to testify, confirming or denying the facts. “It does appear that they stopped and frisked Mangione without a legal basis to do it. If that’s true, everything that follows from there is likely to be found to be unconstitutional,” he said.Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, voiced similar sentiments. Arguments to keep out evidence are frequently denied and even if a judge did rule in Mangione’s favor, other evidence abounds allegedly implicating him in the murder.“It just suppresses the evidence that was found unlawfully,” Rahmani said. “We’re talking about the ghost gun that was on his person, the manifesto that he had. But if there is some other type of evidence, that still comes in.“The case doesn’t get dismissed. The remedy is a suppression of unlawful evidence.”Other evidence includes video of Mangione at the crime scene, as well as fingerprints allegedly found on a nearby water bottle, officials said. In Rahmani’s view, police seemed to have enough reasonable suspicion that the man at McDonald’s was the shooting suspect to stop him lawfully.“The standard is you can stop someone based on reasonable suspicion, which is a lower standard, and you can arrest someone based upon probable cause, which is the higher standard. Obviously, once you arrest someone, you can search them,” Rahmani explained.Dickey, Mangione’s lawyer, has contended that the police did not have reasonable suspicion, arguing that they were dispatched for a “suspicious male that resembled the suspect who shot the CEO in New York”. At one point, Dickey charges, the officers told him that he “looked suspicious”.While these two patrol officers did not officially arrest Mangione right away, they stood in such a way that “no reasonable person” in his position would think themself free to leave, constituting an arrest, Dickey argued in court papers filed on 12 March.The attorney argues that they did so operating solely on a tip – without any “independent corroborating evidence”.Dickey also claims that nobody from the department spoke with this anonymous tipster – nor did they try to vet this information. This means that the stop was made without the legally necessary “reasonable suspicion” that he had committed a crime, his lawyer said.Mangione felt that he had to present identification given the circumstances and, as more police came to the McDonald’s, continued to think that he was in their custody and unable to leave. At this point, police still had not apprised him of his rights; in the US, an arrestee must be told that they have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, for example.Mangione was not provided with his rights until about 20 minutes after he was first approached by police. After being provided his rights, Mangione indicated that he did not want to speak with police, Dickey said.An officer then told Mangione: “You are not in custody,” despite his obviously being in custody, and kept questioning him, Dickey alleged. Purported constitutional violations continued after officers deemed him arrested and brought him to the police station. They also gave Mangione a snack and soda to get samples of his DNA, Dickey wrote.‘It didn’t use to be like this’: woeful US healthcare system exposed by CEO killingRead moreSpeaking generally, Sam Roberts, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society’s homicide defense task force, said that police can gather DNA from items such as a beverage cup at the station. Using this as evidence at trial, however, could prove tricky as there are issues surrounding potential contamination.Roberts said that while people might think some cases just crumble outright from evidence issues, this is rarely true.“In high-profile violent felony cases, a murder case, there’s this whole popular perception that ‘the killer walked free on a technicality’,” Roberts said. “That is kind of what the perception is in the popular mindset. So judges are going to, in my opinion, bend over backwards to find a way to keep the evidence in.”Mangione has pleaded not guilty in the proceedings against him. The Altoona police department said they had no comment on Dickey’s claims.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingUS crimeHealthcare industryPennsylvaniaNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most of the dead lost their lives in the period just after the first world war, when allied troops were sent to support rightwing White forces in the Russian civil war against the Bolsheviks, while 41 are casualties from the second world war Arctic convoys.Their resting places have been tended over decades by the Russian military and by private contractors, paid by the UK’s Commonwealth War Graves Commission. But after Vladimir Putin’s invasion ofUkraine, economic sanctions meant Britain could no longer pay for the graves to be maintained.The two countries appear to have come to a private understanding, however. The commission has continued to maintain 674 Soviet graves in its cemeteries in the UK and around the world and, although it cannot be certain, it believes that the Russians are doing the same for the 663 British military personnel.Map“We haven’t seen the graves but we think they are still being maintained,” said Gareth Hardware, the commission’s area director for the UK and northern countries. “We are maintaining their graves in our cemeteries.”Officials at the commission, which is funded by Britain and other Commonwealth nations, think the majority of the graves are tended by the Russian navy, while a private contractor has continued to oversee plots in Arkhangelsk. “Although we are currently unable to pay him, we have written confirming we will when able to do so,” a spokesperson said.Last summer, an amateur Russian historian took photographs of the graves in Arkhangelsk and they appeared to be in good condition. “The cemetery looks very well maintained. Someone is taking care of it, even in these difficult times,” he wrote in a blog post.A British diplomat from the embassy in Moscow also went to Murmansk on Remembrance Day last year with a Russian counterpart and reported back that the cemetery there was in good condition.At a commission conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London last week, the Russians’ apparent respect for the British dead was welcomed. V Adm Peter Hudson, vice-chair of the commission, said: “It transcends even those very fraught national relationships which exist between our two countries today.”Relations between London and Moscow have become so strained that earlier this month Britain was labelled Russia’s public enemy number one after the country’s foreign intelligence service accused the UK of trying to derail Donald Trump’s attempts at a peace deal.John Foreman, who served as Britain’s defence attaché in Moscow from 2019 to 2022 and visited all but one of the eight Commonwealth war cemeteries or memorials in the country, said it was a sign of how bad relations were between the two nations that there was no treaty governing the upkeep of graves. “This is all a very difficult issue with Russia, as we don’t have the treaties in place for all casualties of the 20th century,” he said. “I argued for a formal agreement while I was there.”It is even more difficult in the Russian-occupiedCrimearegion of Ukraine, where mass burial grounds housing the remains of British soldiers from the Crimean war had already been built on or desecrated. “We’ve had no sight of those,” Foreman said, adding that British diplomats from Moscow and Kyiv had been prevented from getting there during the war.Dirk Backen, general secretary of the German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge eV, still works with the Russians despite his country’s strained relationship with Moscow. “It’s the only thing still working,” he said. His commission oversees 600,000 German graves in Russia and other former areas of the eastern front. About 760,000 Soviet citizens were buried in Germany as a result of the second world war.UK accuses Russia of driving its Moscow embassy towards closureRead more“We still recover Red Army soldiers in Germany each year and will provide them a proper grave in Germany,” he said. “And the Russian ambassador is invited, but is not allowed to give a speech in front of the TV camera because he will misuse this [to repeat] a narrative which explains why everything in Ukraine is justified.”The commission’s cemeteries around the world have immaculate green lawns designed to be a reminder of English gardens. As well as international relations, climate change is a challenge and the commission said cemeteries will be redesigned over time to be more sustainable, with local plants and, in many locations, a less manicured look.Explore more on these topicsFirst world warThe ObserverSecond world warCrimeaUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But he is drawing larger crowds now than he did when he was campaigning for the White House.The message has hardly changed. Nor has the messenger, with his shock of white hair and booming delivery. What’s different now, the senator says, is that his fears – a government captured by billionaires who exploit working people – have become an undeniable reality and people are angry.“For years, I’ve talked about the concept of oligarchy as an abstraction,” Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats and twice sought the party’s presidential nomination, said in an interview after a joint rally in Tempe, Arizona, with the New York representativeAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The Vermont senator recalled Donald Trump’s inauguration, when the three wealthiest people on the planet – Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg – were seated in front of his cabinet nominees in what many viewed as a shocking display of power and influence.“You gotta be kind of blind not to understand that you have a government of the billionaire class, for the billionaire class, by the billionaire class,” he said. “And then, on top of all that, you’ve got Trump moving very rapidly toward an authoritarian form of society.”Two months after Trump was sworn in for a second term, Democratic activists and an increasingly vocal chorus of voters say they are terrified, angry and desperate for leadership. In something of a third act, the 83-year-old democratic socialist is stepping in to fill the void.But his aim is not only to revive the anti-Trump resistance movement – he wants a bottom-up overhaul of the American political system.Them just holding paddle boards up and staying quiet or wearing pink blazers is not enoughAlexandra Rodriguez, 20“It’s not just oligarchy that we are going to fight. It’s not just authoritarianism that we’re going to fight,” Sanders told an arena full of supporters atArizonaState University on Thursday night. “We will not accept a society today in which we have massive income and wealth inequality, where the very rich have never done better while working families are struggling to put food on the table.”For weeks, voters have been showing up at town halls to vent their alarm and rage over the president’s aggressive power grabs and the Musk-led mass firings of federal workers. But they are also furious at the Democratic leadership, charging that their party spent an entire election season warning of the threat Trump posed to US democracy, and yet now appeared either unable or unwilling to stand up to him.At the rally in Tempe, several attendees demanded more defiance.“Them just holding paddle boards up and staying quiet or wearing pink blazers is not enough,” said Alexandra Rodriguez, 20, of Mesa, referring to the Democrats’ acts of protest during Trump’s address to Congress earlier this month. “I think they do need to be willing to go to extremes.”They also expressed outrage at the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who, faced with what he called a “Hobson’s choice” between supporting a Republican-authored funding bill or inciting a government shutdown,wrangled a coalition ofDemocrats to pass the spending measure. The decision has unleashed a torrent of anger from his party’s base, forcing him to postpone a book tour as he defends himself against calls to step down as leader. On Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s western tour, the New York representative was interrupted by intermittent calls to “Primary Chuck!”“This isn’t just about Republicans, either. We need a Democratic party that fights harder for us, too,” Ocasio-Cortez said in Arizona, drawing some of the loudest, most sustained applause of the evening. She urged the crowd to help elect candidates “with the courage to brawl for the working class”.Democrats “absolutely need to get stronger”, Audree Castro, 52, said as she waited with her mother and aunt to enter the venue on Thursday night. “I want my democracy back.”In recent weeks, Democrats have sought to capitalize on the bubbling backlash to the disorienting opening months of Trump’s second term. Following Sanders’ lead, many Democrats are hosting town halls in Republican-held districts to draw attention to Musk’sslash-and-burn cost-cutting projectand Republican proposals that would almost certainly result in cuts to social safety net programs.Robbie Lambert, 70, a retired special education teacher, said keeping up with the turmoil in Washington was beginning to feel like a full-time job. Just that afternoon, Trump hadsigned an executive orderaimed at dismantling the Department of Education.“You feel helpless. It’s like, what can we do?” said Lambert, who was on vacation in Arizona and decided she had to attend the Tempe rally. “Coming together, talking with people here, makes you feel like you’re doing something.”The Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari, who attended Thursday’s rally, said she had been hearing similar calls for action from constituents across her district this week, including at an event with LGBTQ+ business leaders and an at-capacity town hall, where several people shared that it was the first political event they had ever attended.“People are really fed up,” Ansari said in an interview.Coming together, talking with people here, makes you feel like you’re doing somethingRobbie Lambert, 70For now, at least, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are the most prominent Democrats offering both a strategy to confront Trump and an alternative vision for the party.In 2024, Democrats lost support among young people and Latino voters – core constituencies – and recent polling found that the party’s popularity is at anall-time low. Few Democrats disagree that their party needs to course-correct, but how and to what degree remains a topic of intense debate.Supporters say the success of Sanders’ tour, which began last month in Omaha, Nebraska, is a clear sign that Democrats want the party to aggressivelyfight what they view as Trump’s encroaching authoritarianism – not “roll over and play dead”, as veteran strategist James Carvillesuggestedin an op-ed. They also view it as an endorsement of Sanders’ policy agenda, arguing that his brand of economic populism is the right match for this turbulent political moment.According to a memo by Sanders’ longtime adviser, Faiz Shakir, the senator has raised more than $7m from more than 200,000 donors since February, and is drawing crowds 25% to 100% larger than at the height of his presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. On Friday, more than 30,000 people attended a rally in Denver – the largest audience Sanders has ever drawn, his team said.“We’re living in an intensely populist moment right now,” Shakir wrote. “It’s not ‘left versus right’. It’s ‘very top versus everyone else’.” The title of his memo: “It’s a populist revolt, stupid.”The joint appearance by the 35-year-old New York representative and the Vermont senator who she has said inspired her to run for office naturally raised the question: is Ocasio-Cortez the heir to the progressive movement Sanders has been building since before she was born? Several rally-goers in Tempe believed she had the potential to lead the party – and perhaps even the country.“When AOC has something to say, I listen,” said Jonas Prado, 32, a first responder.“I hope she’s the first woman president,” said Norman Ellison, 60, a mechanical engineer.There was also a tinge of wistfulness in the arena. Supporters dressed in old campaign t-shirts and hats and one person sported a pin that said, “Bernie was right.”Sanders, who has all but ruled out a third run for president, was in vintage form, delivering a blistering, 50-minute critique of the “top 1%” with the moral ferocity that has long endeared him to legions of politically disaffected supporters.The senator named names, accusing executives from the fossil fuel, insurance and pharmaceutical industries of being “major criminals”, while sharing stark statistics on wealth inequality in the US that elicited boos and gasps from the audience. At one point, Sanders cited ananalysisreleased by his Senate committee that found the wealthiest Americans live an average of seven years longer than poorer Americans.“In other words, being working class in America is a death sentence,” he bellowed.Ocasio-Cortez’s opening remarks were no less visceral. She charged that Trump and Musk, his billionaire lieutenant, were “taking a wrecking ball to our country” and “screwing over” working people. “We’re gonna throw these bums out,” she declared.While both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez share a political vision, their double act showcased the distinct styles of two progressive leaders at opposite ends of their career arcs.Ocasio-Cortez offered a more personal touch, weaving elements of her biography into her speech – something Sanders is typically loath to do. She spoke of her mother, who cleaned homes, and her father, whose death from a rare form of cancer plunged the family into economic uncertainty.“I don’t believe in healthcare, labor and human dignity because I’m an extremist,” she said, pushing back on the rightwing caricature of her. “I believe in these things because I was a waitress.”She said she empathized with Americans who felt overwhelmed and demoralized, and encouraged them not to give in to despair. “We won’t do that,” someone in the crowd yelled.When the event concluded, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez left the arena to address an overflow crowd that hadn’t been able to get in.“This is where the future is,” said Sebastian Santamaria, 25, gesturing toward the empty podium adorned with a “Fight Oligarchy” placard. “As a person who has supported Democrats in the past, I don’t want to keep supporting you if it doesn’t look more like this.”Explore more on these topicsDemocratsBernie SandersAlexandria Ocasio-CortezArizonaColoradoDonald TrumpTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was more recently adopted by Björn Höcke, a high-ranking member of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland at party rallies, for which he was prosecuted.Then in August last year the slogan popped up at events attended byAlice Weidel, the party’s co-leader, but in a subtly modified form – Alice für Deutschland. The party printed blue cardboard hearts bearing the slogan and distributed them to members, who held them up at rallies to show their approval.The 46-year-old has been credited with being the driving force behind the AfD’s success in last month’s election. In a seismic result, the party doubled its vote share to 20.8% . For the first time since the second world war a far-right party is now the second largest force in parliament. When the newly elected Bundestag convenes for the first time on Tuesday, it will take up no fewer than 152 out of 630 seats as the main opposition force in the new parliament, where Weidel has vowed to do battle with her opponents at the dispatch box.“The AfD is now firmly anchored as a people’s party,” Weidel declared on election night, pledging to “hunt” the other parties in government and promising to “shift up two gears”.Under her watch the AfD has attracted donations from German millionaires, and in the run-up to the vote she was praised by Elon Musk, who repeatedly hailed the AfD on his X platform as the only party capable of saving Germany, where he hosted her for a tête-à-tête in which they appeared to downplay the Nazi era,even appearing on screen at the AfD’s final pre-election rally.In many respects her backstory and home life make her an improbable figurehead for a radical anti-immigration party that is under surveillance by security authorities for suspected extremism.A Mandarin speaker who has previously lived in Singapore and Hong Kong, she lives in Switzerland with her Sri Lanka-born wife and their children. On the campaign trail she was unable to answer a question about how many people live in the constituency she represents.Her relationship puts her at odds with the AfD’s own policies on the family unit, which it defines in strictly heterosexual terms. The party explicitly rejects other definitions and has campaigned for the abolition of same-sex marriage.“She does not exactly have the sociodemographic characteristics you’d expect from an AfD voter,” said Andreas Busch, a political scientist at Göttingen University, who contrasted her with the party’s other co-leader, Tino Chrupalla, a painter-decorator by trade. Chrupalla, Busch said, was “rather more pedestrian, down-to-earth and has no intellectual pretensions”.One AfD supporter told the Guardian they weren’t interested in Weidel’s lifestyle but instead judged her on her messaging and “her ability to address our concerns, and makes us feel counted”.Asked for her own view, Weidel has previously said she did not “see skin colour” and that “I’m not queer, I’m just married to a woman who I’ve known for 20 years.”With her trademark cream polo necks and pearl necklaces, Weidel has undoubtedly lent a different air to a party led by ageing male professors and economists when it was founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic alternative to the conservative CDU. Image, say analysts, counts for a lot: even as the party has moved ever further to the right on immigration and Islam, Weidel has helped somehow to detoxify it in the eyes of some voters.“She is often smiling at the same time as having very aggressive rhetoric,” said Busch, who added that she had at times maintained a “dangerous” ambiguity in order to expand the AfD’s electoral appeal.On the one hand, she has enthusiastically adopted the use of the term “remigration”, a highly controversial but nebulous far-right concept that is usually understood to mean the mass deportation of foreign-born people – even if they are naturalised citizens.“But at the same time as using this term, she says ‘of course we need migration’,” Busch said. “It’s that creative ambiguity which allows her to appeal to different parts of the electorate. “It’s … dangerous but also electorally attractive.”View image in fullscreenWeidel talks online to Elon Musk during a speech during her election campaign launch in Halle, Germany, in January.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPALess ambiguous has been her embrace of AfD figures who were once shunned for their extremism. She has said she wants to make Höcke – who has two convictions for knowingly using Nazi language at a political event – one of her ministers. Andlast month she welcomed Maximilian Krah and Matthias Helferich – who were sidelined over remarks they made relating to the Nazis – into the AfD’s parliamentary group.Deike Diening, a Spiegel journalist who spent months shadowing Weidel in the run-up to the election, said she had worn two hats simultaneously, staying in the party’s top ranks by tolerating and even courting the party’s most radical right wing while also remaining “the comparatively friendly face of the party for the broad public”.Having emulated the electoral gains of other women on the far right inEurope, most notably Marine Le Pen in France and Giorgia Meloni in Italy, Weidel now faces the challenge of piloting the party in opposition towards its ultimate goal of victory in the next election in 2029.Busch said: “She’s mainly interested in gaining power and that is where her main challenge now lies. The question is will she keep the AfD focused on resentment, continuing its fundamental opposition role, or is she ultimately interested in some sort of power perspective, which would require her to tone down the rhetoric?”In the short term, Weidel has little hope of breaking through the “firewall” erected by the other mainstream parties to block the AfD’s entry into government. But if another unwieldy, quarrelsome coalition fails to get Germany back on track, her party will be waiting in the wings next time round.Explore more on these topicsAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)GermanyThe far rightEuropeprofilesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Germany’s car industry is struggling with low European demand and competition from China.As Europe worries about how it can weather the economic and ­political turmoil unleashed byDonald Trump, executives from Munich and Düsseldorf say they have at least a partial answer.In January, Hensoldt offered to take on workers laid off by the car parts suppliers Bosch and Continental. The defence giant Rheinmetall made a similar ­proposal last year, and in February announced it would repurpose two automotive component factories.It was a pivot that offered hope amid America’s rapid ­dismantling of the postwar global order – ­protecting jobs and Germany’s industrial base as access to US ­markets shrinks, while ramping up Europe’s capacity to protect itself.As politicians around the world try to work out how best to ­protect their countries from Trump’s ­capricious policymaking, the one constant in all their calculations for the future is a diminished American role in their countries. Trump has mooted plans for a 25% tariff on EU goods, including cars, and has alreadyput duties at that level on steel and aluminium from the bloc.In February, his vice-president, JD Vance, launched ablistering attack on European democracyin Munich, questioning whether it was worth defending.In his first term, Trump touted decoupling from China as a way to bolster US jobs and the economy against a rapacious rival. Now, in his second term, he is pursuing a much broader decoupling from the ­country’s historical allies – a shift that few had anticipated or were prepared to face.The new US administration is sealing off its markets, retreating from America’s global security role, and cutting soft-power projects that aimed to shape the world through research, aid and culture.The only form of greater American presence beyond the country’s ­current borders that seems to ­interest Trump is ­territorial ­expansion – ­encouraging, ­perhaps, for a dictator such as Vladimir Putin as he wages an ­imperial war in Ukraine, but ­unwelcome and ­alarming elsewhere.“The idea of the US ­abandoning western Europe was ­unimaginable even a decade ago, because its role there also secures broader American influence in the world,” said Phillip Ayoub, a professor of international relations at University College London.“There is a comparative ­advantage to strong alliances because they make you richer in trade and safer because they deter other powers.”Trump’s vision of the world rejects that view, casting his ­country as a naively magnanimous ­superpower that has for decades funded and policed the world while getting little more than debt and ingratitude for its troubles.View image in fullscreenAmerican troops at the end of a joint Nato exercise in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2017.Photograph: Zurab Kurtsikidze/EPAYet if postwar American ­presidents did not pursue the ­territorial empire that Trump now dreams of, they wielded an ­imperial power not reflected on maps. Decisions made in Washington DC reshaped countries from Chile to Iraq without the participation or consent of their populations.And the global order he is ­tearing down made the country so rich and powerful that for a brief, heady moment around the turn of the ­millennium, the US elite embraced the idea that history was over, and that human society had reached its peak and permanent form in the ­liberal democracy embodied in their constitution.The details of the new American relationship with the world are still being worked out day by day in court battles at home and trade and diplomatic negotiations abroad, but the impact of Trump’s presidency will last long into the future.“An election could change ­policy in Washington DC. But the new ­reality is that from government to government you could have a ­different attitude to the US’s place in the world,” Ayoub said. “This retreat will be factored into policymaking everywhere now.”For now, the ­immediate priority in most ­countries is limiting the extent of tariffs and the impact of US cuts, in areas ranging from aid to defence.Geography and the impact of ­previous free trade deals have ­combined to make neighbours of the US extremely vulnerable to its tariffs. Exports to the US account for a quarter of Mexico’s GDP. In Canada, where all other potential trading partners are an ocean or half a continent away, they are about a fifth of GDP.European countries may be less immediately vulnerable to a trade squeeze, with exports to the US accounting for less than 3% of the European Union’s GDP.But budgets from London to Warsaw are also strained by the need to ramp up defence ­spending to make up for the US retreat, both from immediate support for the Ukrainian forces battlingRussia, and from the longer-term backing of European defence. Even ­optimistic assessments suggest it will take the best part of a decade before the continent’s own defence ­capacity can match the protection currently offered by the US, excluding its nuclear deterrent.The pain of breaking up or reshaping major relationships does not only fall on one party – ­something even Trump has ­admitted. The cost of some tariffs will be passed on to US ­consumers, and American businesses may lose customers.American music will be consumed worldwide. The Oscars are likely to remain the most coveted prize for cinema. Yet a cultural exodus would still be damagingOne early high-profile casualty could be Lockheed Martin, which produces F-35 jet fighters. Contracts allowing the US to restrict how the planes are used by allies caused little debate during friendlier times. Now, in Berlin and other capitals, defence ministers are worrying about a ­possible “kill switch” andhesitating over major new orders.Longer term, Trump could also fuel a ­cultural “decoupling”, with attacks on the arts and academia ­driving highly talented ­individuals to flee the US or avoid it.Several artists have cancelled tours, and the concert pianist András Schiff last week said last week he would no longer work in the US because of Trump. He had already boycotted Russia.Academics at elite British ­universities say they have seen a surge in job applications from US-based colleagues, many ­willing to lose tenure and take a ­considerable pay cut in order to move across the Atlantic. A French university thatoffered ­“sanctuary”to US researchers said it had received 40 applications, and one academic moved this month.As with the economy, the US’s­cultural standing is not under direct threat. American music – much of it made by ­people who publicly oppose Trump – will be consumed worldwide. The Oscars are likely to remain the most ­coveted prize for cinema, the Emmys for ­television, the Pulitzers for ­journalism. Yet an exodus would still be ­damaging in a country where research and the creative arts are key drivers of growth, and benefit the places they settle instead – the long-term US allies that Trump sees as threats.The US president has promised voters that where his economic policies cause pain it will be short-term, and pave the way for long term prosperity in America.To critics, they look like a ­template for a poorer, more ­dangerous and fragmented world, where any limited benefits of ­decoupling are as likely to be reaped by a British university or a German defence firm as by Americans.View image in fullscreenVisitors at last year’s Art Basel Miami.Photograph: Earth Pixel LLC/AlamyCultureThe hit to America’s creative ­sector, from budget freezes and threats to the federal bodies and national schemes that fund ­museums, ­galleries, theatres and libraries, is set to take a toll on its income from tourism – and send visitors to Britain and Europe instead.In response to the second Trump presidency, some international ­artists are already pulling out of ­appearances in American venues, or at music festivals, and the likely knock-on effect is a reduction in ­visits from abroad.Last week, the Canadian singer/songwriter Leslie Hudson cancelled her American tour, saying on social media: “Like a lot of Canadians, and so many others, I no longer feel safe to enter the country.” The German violinist Christian Tetzlaff cancelled a spring tour in protest at the new administration’s policies, with particular reference to Ukraine.In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the managing director of City theatre, James McNeel, has ­spoken of a growing funding threat. “What we need more than anything is stability,” he says.Prior to the pandemic, the US Travel Association ­valued the total spending of the near-80 million tourists who came into the US at about $2 trillion (£1.5tn).This was supported by federal investment in ­infrastructure and the ­airline industry, but travel experts also traced back much of this tourism success to the diverse image of many of its cities. Art tourism was a big part of this, with art fans who ­travelled to North America in 2023 ­accounting for more than a ­quarter of the global total. Cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago boast ­celebrated museums and ­galleries, and the rise of immersive art and public installations has broadened this appeal. The attraction of art fairs such as Art Basel Miami has also grown internationally. In 2023, it was reportedly visited by more than 79,000 people.But Trump has made rapid and determined cuts to all museum ­projects tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, ­affecting the Smithsonian Institution, which has closed its DEI office. The National Gallery of Art also closed its office of belonging and inclusion, while exhibitions across the ­country have been cancelled. The biggest impact may well be on cultural ­tourism associated with LGBTQ+ communities and climate activism.Trump at one point intended for 2026 to be a bumper year for American tourism, with a ­“special one-time festival” planned for “­millions of people from around the world” at the Iowa State Fairground to mark 250 years since ­independence.The level of ­international advance booking will be watched.Likewise, a new status for London, Berlin and Paris as “refuge cities” for American artists is being predicted.British and European ­institutions might also soon have to make room for American artwork. TheWashington Posthas reported that large collections of public art have been left without professional ­security or conservationists.View image in fullscreenContainers and cranes at the port of Liverpool.Photograph: MediaWorldImages/AlamyEconomicsShould the UK government decide to untangle the economy’s many ties with the US, it would need to tread carefully. America is the single ­largest market for Britain’s exports, ranging from the most sophisticated components in US navy submarines to artisan scented candles.Official figures show total trade in goods and services – exports plus imports – between Britain and the US was £294bn in the year to 30 September, 2024. The stock of investment by US companies in the UK stood at £708bn in 2023, or 34% of total of foreign direct investment.Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, is hoping to sign a limited trade deal with his counterparts in Washington that covers digital services and commits both countries to secure supply chains for vital goods.But a deal with any scope or ­judicial oversight will need Congress to agree, and that is far from certain to happen.UK manufacturers could begin to wean themselves off US raw ­materials and components, but the presumption must be that they traded with the Americans in the first place because they provided the best products. Exports could be directed back at the EU, though without rejoining the single ­market and customs union, the benefit would be limited.It would be a harder job switching services exports away from the US. The common language may often divide the two nations, but in ­practice the sector is a huge boon.In Brussels, officials believe any kind of trade deal with the US is off the agenda.As Donald Trump is only too well aware, the EU has a large trade ­surplus with America. In 2014 the surplus was about €100bn. By last year the gap had grown to almost €200bn. For this reason, the EU has already adopted a more ­confrontational stance.The British Chambers of Commerce says almost two-thirds of factory owners that export to the US are worried. European ­manufacturers have revealed similar concerns in recent surveys.Some are comforted by figures showing the US has a trade surplus in goods with the UK and how, in practice, trade and investment relationships exist well away from the White House and remain robust.However, businesses thought the same about Brussels after the vote to leave the EU. It didn’t happen and a breakdown in relations ensued.That said, rekindling relations with the EU can be part of the answer. Reset talks are under way and there is a leaders’ summit on 19 May that should address at least some trade barriers. The UK might find that food exports become easier and it gains access to a wider range of raw ­materials and ­components by rejoining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean convention.Still, the US will remain a major trading partner and upsetting the Trump White House could have huge consequences.View image in fullscreenPrevious US presidents, such as Barack Obama, have shared some of Trump’s concerns over Nato defence spending.Photograph: Alik Kęplicz/APDefenceDonald Trump’s abandonment of Europe’s defence and disdain forNatomarks one of the most ­profound and influential breaks with longstanding US policy, even for a supremely disruptive leader.Many US presidents have grumbled about European over-reliance on American deterrence in recent decades, with predecessors including Barack Obama demanding allies spend more on their own armies.But their frustrations were rooted in concern that European defence cuts undermined an ­alliance that almost everyone in Washington – across the political divide – saw as critical to American global leadership.Trump, in contrast, appears to be seeking European spending to replace or supersede Nato, not strengthen it. He says Washington’s defence priorities are now deterring China in Asia and fighting organised crime at home.In his first term, he touted the idea of withdrawing America from the alliance, which was formed in 1949 for protection against the Soviet Union. This time he has opted to undermine it from within.The president himself has ­publicly contemplated ignoring Article 5, the core mutual defence clause at the heart of the transatlantic ­alliance, which requires Nato ­countries to come to the aid of any member that is attacked. It has only been invoked once – by the US after the 11 September attacks on Washington and New York in 2001.Trump said the US might ­condition any support for other members on military spending, and questioned if US allies would come to the country’s aid if in need. His administration is considering giving up the Nato command role inaugurated by war hero president Dwight D Eisenhower and held by America ever since, NBC reported last week.Europe was already scrambling to increase defence spending and ­coordination when the US halted military aid shipments to Ukraine, and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv earlier this month.Trump’s decision came after a spectacular on-camera showdown in the Oval Office with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But his willingness to cut loose a force that Washington has trained, armed and backed, and which is fighting a major US rival, stunned even some of his own political allies.European governments who have also spent billions on Ukraine’s defence, and have been dealing with covert Russian sabotage and spy operations across the continent, were not informed in advance.The flow of weapons and aid has now resumed, but the message was clear. Major European military powers, including the UK and Germany, are now reportedly racing to put together a five- to 10-year plan for a managed transfer of European defence, to stave off any more abrupt moves from Washington.Trump’s unpredictability has been heightened by his choice of ­leaders for key security roles, ­including a former Fox television host, Pete Hegseth, as defence secretary, and Tulsi Gabbard, who has a long ­history of pro-Russian views, as director of national intelligence.Security experts warn that ­turmoil in the leadership and ­management of intelligence agencies may also lead to a less visible but highly ­damaging defence decoupling – of the relationship between America’s spies and the secret services of its allies.View image in fullscreenIsrael leader Benjamin Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court.Photograph: ReutersDiplomacyThe votes in the United Nations marking the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ­provided a bleak snapshot of the yawning diplomatic divide between Donald Trump’s America and the country’s traditional allies.On February 25, the US joined international pariahs Russia, Belarus and North Korea to vote against a resolution condemning Russia as an aggressor state and calling on it to remove its troops from Ukraine.The wording rejected by Trump’s diplomats had been put forward by Ukraine, whose defence the US has funded, and the European Union, Washington’s partner in that effort. It passed in the general assembly with backing from 93 countries.The isolationist bent of Trump’s politics extends beyond the ­economy and defence, into international diplomacy. He has ordered the US to withdraw from a host of global organisations and initiatives, from the World Health Organization to the Paris climate agreement.The process of taking the world’s second biggest emitter of planet-heating pollution out of the accord to tackle global ­emissions will take about a year. As with the UN vote on Ukraine, that move puts the world’s most ­powerful democracy in unusual ­company, with Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries outside the deal.Trump imposed sanctions on officials at the International Criminal Court over arrest warrants it had issued for the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, who was the country’s defence minister at the time.His predecessor Joe Biden had also criticised the court, but such a direct attack on an institution ­established with broad international support was unprecedented.Several former British ambassadors to Washington warned this month that there has been a seismic and perhaps permanent shift in the so-called “special relationship” between the two countries, meaning that the UK will need to seek out other allies.“It’s difficult to find either a conceptual area in ­international relations or a particular geographical area where our interests are really converging at the moment,” Nigel Sheinwald, the ­ambassador from 2007 to 2012, told a ­parliamentary committee.“On more or less any big ­foreign policy issue that we’re dealing with today, we don’t agree with the United States… whether that is the Middle East, whether it’s Iran, whether it’s climate change, China, but above all on Europe itself,” Sheinwald said.Explore more on these topicsEuropeThe ObserverEuropean UnionUS politicsDefence policyEconomicsTrump tariffsInternational tradefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing unusual inSudan’s ruinous war, but Hitham Mohund knew it was vital to act quickly. However, in an abandoned home near the Nile River he stopped searching after making a grisly discovery: wedged inside a bathroom were three bodies. Hands tied, eyes staring upwards.“They were shot in the chest,” said the 28-year-old, as he walked towards Maigoma Street, a dusty thoroughfare in north Khartoum, Sudan’s capital.It had been less than 24 hours since Mohund had found the bodies and his friend’s whereabouts were still unknown. Around him, shoppers were chatting, some were even dancing, as the street staged its first Friday market for nearly two years, since thecivil warerupted between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).Three days earlier, the RSF had finally been pushed out of the Maigoma neighbourhood by the Sudanese army, and residents were in the mood to celebrate.But even now, safety was an ­illusion. A shell suddenly exploded on the street. Black smoke belched across the market. Moments later a donkey pulled a cart into the thoroughfare, carrying a wounded man lying face down.View image in fullscreenHitham Mohund, who found three bodies in Maigoma as he searched for his friend.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The Observer“There was another random shelling yesterday,” Mohund said, as the smoke cleared. “A home was hit.”The house belonged to the Mohammeds. At 7pm the day before, the family were preparing “mullah”, the main meal of the day. Awadin Mohammed was especially excited. Schools were starting to reopen. She remembers nothing of the moment an RSF projectile fell from the dark sky, flattening her home.Dr Ahmed Ibrahim, senior ­consultant at Omdurman’s teaching hospital, recalls the 10-year-old arriving. “She had been hit with shrapnel and was bleeding heavily.”Normally a child arrives escorted by anguished family. Awadin had no one. The hospital director, Prof Abdul Moneim, said that initially they waited for a relative. Still, no one came. So they began operating. A shard of metal 10cm square was removed from her colon.No one turned up for Awadin. Her entire family – mother, father, brother and sister – were found dead in the rubble of their home.Map“I miss my mother so much, my father,” she says, blinking back tears from her hospital bed. She wonders if anyone will adopt her. “I want this to stop.”But no one seems able to stop the slaughter. Hours after the Mohammeds were killed, Sudan’s unrelenting conflict claimed more people from Maigoma Street.The injured man on the cart died halfway to hospital, bleeding out on the five-mile journey.Other tragedies on Maigoma Street are less clear cut. The three bodies Mohund found have, at the time of writing, still not been identified. His friend remains missing.The dead, bound by a single street on a single day, are a microcosm of Sudan’s agony, replicated countless times during this war.View image in fullscreenThe man injured in the RSF airstrike is taken to hospital on a donkey-drawn cart, but he died on the journey.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverIn an era of rolling crises, Sudan stands supreme. By some margin it is the world’s largest,most devastatinghumanitarian catastrophe. Every metric confirms it is worsening. Thirty million Sudanese need aid to survive; half of them are children. Fighting has precipitated theworst faminesin decades. Atrocities mount daily. More than 12 million Sudanese are at risk ofsexual violence.Such statistics are not cutting through. As Africa’s third-largest country implodes, the west looks away. “International donors are fiddling as Sudan burns,” says a senior UN official.This is not donor apathy, but a tale of outrageous chicanery; of high-profile global announcements that were always untrue. At least £500m promised by the west 12 months ago to help Sudan cope with its suffering has not been paid.Like Awadin, Sudan is waiting for an intervention that might never happen.Among the shattered remains of central Khartoum North is a modernist house with a blue-tiled swimming pool, a throwback to when the middle classes thronged to one of Africa’s leading centres of commerce and culture. The imposing three-storey property belongs to Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo, second in command of the RSF. Last month the Guardian was allowed inside his home.At the time, television screens across Africa carried footage of a beaming Dagalo 1,050 miles (1,700km) away in Nairobi as heannounceda ­breakaway Sudanese government.View image in fullscreenGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known by his nickname, Hemedti.Photograph: APHe may have presented himself as the consummate politician, but Dagalo wassanctionedfor commanding soldiers responsible for the “massacre of civilians, ethnic killings, and use of sexual violence”.Inside his home was evidence of a cosseted life: a sophisticated gym, designer furniture. In the kitchen, cans of whipped cream, a tub ofMaxtellachocolate spread, luxuries in a country where more than 26 million face acute hunger. There were clues also as to the central driver of Sudan’s conflict – gold. Display cases for gold jewellery lined the master bedroom. Dagalo and his brother, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo –known as Hemedti– built their army on the proceeds of the precious metal, which is found across Sudan.Elsewhere in the dining room: three immaculate copies of a local newspaper, dated October 2022, months before the civil war erupted. Its front page read: “No disagreement with Burhan: Hemedti.” The headline was wrong. Relations between rival generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan’s military, and Hemedti werebeyond tense.Six months later, gunfire reverberated in central Khartoum. Within days, hundreds lay dead on its streets. Hastily, the UK and US embassy evacuated staff. More than two years later there is no sign either country will reopen their diplomatic missions, even in Port Sudan, which has escaped the fighting. “Once the UK packed its bags it never really looked back,” says a senior diplomat.Yet much was expected of Britain. Not only Sudan’s former colonial power but, aspenholderof the UN security council on the country, it was responsible for galvanising the international response. “On the most fundamental issue – ­protecting civilians – the UK has failed abysmally,” said a Sudanese aid official. Both warring sides have committed myriad crimes against humanity: repeated, deliberate attacks against its people. Eleven million people have fled their homes, the world’sbiggestdisplacement crisis. At least 200,000 are dead.Asked to sum up UK leadership on Sudan, one official answers: “Total bollocks.”Pinnedto David Lammy’s X account is the message: “We must not forget Sudan.” Some wonder if it is a reminder to himself. The UK’s foreign secretary has yet to visit Sudan. No date is in the diary. Of 38 Foreign Office ministerial trips abroad during the first three months of the Labour government, none chose to witness the world’s most pressing humanitarian crisis.View image in fullscreenTwo years of war have left many parts of Khartoum, and much of its infrastructure, in ruins.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverSudan’s military-led government – increasingly confident of outright victory after Friday’ssymbolic seizureof Khartoum’s presidential palace from the RSF – feels abandoned by Britain. During last month’s Munich Security Conference, Sudan’s foreign minister attempted repeatedly and unsuccessfully to meet Lammy. “Why won’t the UK engage?” asked a source.Sections of Sudanese civil society feel similarly spurned. One group approached Lammy’s office to discuss human rights abuses. They never heard back.Disquiet simmers over the UK’s reluctance to follow the US and accuse the RSF ofgenocide. “It’s confusing. The UK receives the same intelligence as the US,” says another diplomat.Five days after Awadin’s home was flattened, senior RSF officials were allegedly spotted in the UK parliament. “How did it happen?” says Abdallah Abugarda, head of a Sudanese diaspora group. He is among those who believe the answer lies with the provenance of the gold found in Dagalo’s bedroom. Their display cases indicate it came from the UAE, where practically all most of Sudan’s gold is exported.In return for this gold, the UAE is accused ofbacking the RSF, sending it state-of-the-art drones and weaponry. At the same time, the UK is attempting to seduce the UAE for investment. Lammy describes the Emirates as “central to driving [UK] economic growth”.Some wonder if the UK is compromised. Has the UK, they ask, put its economic needs above ­helping Sudan? “Any discussion about the UK’s approach to Sudan cannot ignore its relationship with the UAE,” says a senior diplomat, requesting anonymity.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Sudanese community and supporters march to call for a stop to the escalating brutality and violence in Sudan.Photograph: Mark Kerrison/In Pictures/Getty ImagesCertainly the UK has not been sluggish to court the UAE, owner of theworld’s biggestsovereign wealth fund. Lammy chose to visitvisited Abu Dhabi before Ukraine. His first call to an Arab official was to his UAE counterpart.UK officials would not say if Lammy ever asked the UAE to stop arming the RSF. Unlike with the Sudanese, sources describe “constant chatter” between the UK and Emirati officials. .Throughout Sudan’s war, the UK has remained a steadfast arms supplier to the UAE while receiving intelligence indicating that the Emiratis, in turn, have armed the RSF. In 2023 the UK government licensed £56.4m of arms exports to the UAE, more than thedevelopment fundingit gave to Sudan last year. In the first nine months of 2024 another £19m was licensed, roughly the amount Lammyrecently announcedto help Sudanese refugees.The UK government says Lammy is “committed to pushing for peace in Sudan” while it pursues “all diplomatic avenues” to end the war.Across the Atlantic, efforts to help Sudan have drained away. The US has dismissed its special envoy with no plans to rehire. Troy Fitrell, lead state department official for Africa, has yet to mention Sudan.The abruptdismantlingof USAid has wiped out its coveted Sudan specialists. “The USAid experts on Sudan are gone, so too the state department experts. It has been gutted,” says a source.US pressure on the Emirates to cease supplying the RSF appears to have waned. A UAE official denied “providing any support or supplies” to the paramilitary group.America’s disengagement from Sudan has left the UK with even greater responsibility. Expectation is mounting before a London conference on 15 April – the war’s second anniversary – that aims to “end the conflict”. The event is already mired in controversy. Of 20 foreign ministers invited,Sudan’s was not among them. Relations with Sudanese officials deteriorated further on 7 March when they learned the UK had invited the UAE.View image in fullscreen‘It’s shameful that the international community cannot help more’: Hanin Ahmed, who volunteers at Khartoum’s community kitchen network.Photograph: Courtesy UN News ArabicA day earlier Sudan launched ­proceedings against theUAEover its support for the RSF.Abugarda adds: “The UK is putting economic interests ahead of human rights. So much for British values.”The hospital that saved Awadin Mohammed is symptomatic of a country in freefall. A former RSF command centre, its troops stole everything. Even a collection of broken walking frames weas looted. The hospital also mirrors the world’s reaction to Sudan’s suffering.Eight months after the RSF fled, its staff still wait for assistance. Requests for equipment and funding have proved fruitless. “We have received no help from the international community,” says Moneim.The hospital director, like most Sudanese people, had no idea that the same community had promised his country £515m a year ago – a promise that wasn’t upheld.Last week, Moneim sent a dizzying list of what the hospital needs to function, from life-saving drugs to stethoscopes. Two thousand patients visit his hospital weekly. Amputations are commonplace due to the shelling. Most patients, though, are dying from malnutrition.Khartoum’s residents drink from leaky water pipes. Food is scarce. One stall was seen offering a solitary bag of onions. A boy was killed last week over a falafel sandwich.At least five children a day are dying in the city of malnutrition, according toHanin Ahmed,a volunteer at Khartoum’s community kitchen network. Ahmed’s emergency response rooms, which have beennominated for a Nobel peace prize, have kept millions of destitute Sudanese people alive. But aid cuts mean they are vanishing. Just 220 out of 800 across Sudan remain. More shut daily. There is $200,000 (£155,000) to share among those still functioning: enough to run operations for several days. “It’s shameful that the international community ­cannot help more,” says Ahmed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without direct funding it takes six weeks for cash to reach them.We are losing the ability – and hope – to assist,” she says, gasping as a report from colleagues comes in. A mother of five has been raped in south Khartoum. As she reported the crime to medics, the RSF perpetrator attacked her again.“He threatened to kill her and her children. She needs evacuating to a safe area.” But Ahmed has no money to help. The mother is trapped.Things will deteriorate. Western nations are scaling back foreign aid. Five days after Awadin arrived at hospital, Keir Starmerannouncedswingeing cuts to Britain’s aid budget. The decision made humanitarians reeling from the derailment of USAid despair. During a recent closed UK parliamentary meeting, UN agencies demanded – without success – to know how much funding would remain for Sudan. One aired concerns it may have to suspend operations. A crucial scheme safeguarding displaced people could, it feared, fold in two weeks.With a quarter of the year gone, the UN’s collectivehumanitarian responsefor Sudan has reached just 6.63%, a shortfall of $3.9bn. Multimillion-pound projects have not received a penny. “It’s beyond terrifying,” says a Sudanese UN official. Thepooled Sudan fundis also struggling. Last year it granted Sudan $183m, with the UK to contribute almost a third. So far it has amassed $15.9m. The UK is yet to give anything.Perhaps the greatest indictment of the international community’s approach to Sudan was seen at a high-profile Paris conference a year ago. Before the world’s media,donors lavishly pledgedmore than €2bn (£1.68bn) for Sudan. Documentsshowthe UK pledged £87m. When asked if it was ever paid, Foreign Office officials refused to answer. By far the largest amount offered at the conference – a quarter of the total – was a massive $555m pledged by the World Bank, a transformative sum in light of the USAID cuts. Not a penny was paid.View image in fullscreenTousif Osman, who spent nearly two years living in Maigoma under the RSF.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverA World Bank source said there had been a misunderstanding: it had not pledged any extra cash at the conference. Instead, it was talking about existing World Bank programmes in Sudan. These amount to $383.9m.However, a year on from the Paris conference, itsofficial websitestill states that the World Bank had “announced” $555m for Sudan.They were closing in on her. In truth, it was far from a fair race. Heavily pregnant, she could hardly run. Amira knew what the RSF soldiers would do if they caught her. Everyone knew that the RSF raped women wherever they wanted.Early afternoon, last July, Amira turned off Alshaheeda Nada Street and hid down a side alley. There, her waters broke. She gave birth but passed out, her newborn left lying on the ground.Tousif Osman found Amira, not her real name, just in time. A large stray dog had eaten the placenta and had turned its attention to the newborn.“They were in danger. I pushed the dog away and ran to get help.” The mother was taken to the same Omdurman hospital where, seven months later, orphan Awadin would arrive.Osman never learned what happened to the mother: people vanish all the time in wartime.Fresh accounts of life in Sudan’s capital under RSF occupation confirm a hellish existence. There was no sanitation, no streetlights, no power, no phone or internet connectivity: people could only wonder if the rest of Sudan was engulfed in chaos.The RSF ruled through arbitrary violence. “When you heard their motorbikes you moved away. If you walked too close they beat you. No eye contact. Ever,” says Malik Award Siddig.Only a few people stayed in Maigoma, largely those who couldn’t escape: Osman’s father was disabled.Within days of the RSF occupying Maigoma in April 2023, Osman sent his sister away from the capital. Accounts indicate the RSF began raping women the moment they arrived.Ahmed Abdelraman, 27, witnessed at least 10 women raped in Alshaheeda Nada Street. “Many more in other streets.”View image in fullscreenA Sudanese army ‘hit squad’ search for any RSF sniper cells that might be hiding low in Maigoma.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverPeople were abducted from their homes. Mechanics and doctors were the first to be kidnapped, says Abdelraman.Others were executed. Snipers killed for kicks. Mustafa Ibrahim, pointing east towards Haj Yusuf, says a toddler was shot. People, he says, became too scared to retrieve bodies. Corpses piled up on certain corners.Some people stopped leaving their houses, preferring not to eat. All lived in fear of a knock on the door. Of about 30 people in Maigioma interviewed by theObserver, all said their homes were looted by RSF gunmen.Resistance meant likely death. Mohammad Khalil ran a jewellery shop on Alshaheeda Nada Street. The RSF demanded it, but the 37-year-old refused. “He had worked all his life to build his shops,” says best friend Mussi Mohammed.Then the RSF threatened to kill Khalil’s wife and children, so he sent them away. Last summer gunmen burst into the shopkeeper’s home. Khalil appears to have run on to the roof where, cornered, he was killed.Mohammed found his body hanging from the top of the building. Dried blood is still visible on the wall.RSF brutality was not confined to Khartoum’s residents. New testimony offers a rare insight into how the militia also treated their own.View image in fullscreenAteir Lonjar, 25, from Abyei in South Sudan in his RSF uniform.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverEnlisted at the pinnacle of the RSF’s power – January 2024 – recruits reveal how the group exploited young men from neighbouring countries.Some were later press-ganged into battle with no weapon. Others were given two days’ training.Dubbed “mercenaries” by the Sudanese military – all have been detained in a military prison in Omdurman for the past year. Their families have no idea if they are even alive. All were promised a generous salary but none received a penny.Hassan Mohammed was playing football with friends one evening before Christmas 2023 in Abéché, Chad, when RSF fighters approached them with promises of payment. All 57 footballers joined the war.“They took us into Sudan straight away. We never informed our parents,” said Mohammed, who looked no older than 14.Sent to Sudan’snational broadcast headquartersin Omdurman in January 2024, Mohammed was locked inside the top floor. Rations consisted of one portion of stale bread a day.A Sudanesearmy offensivesoon recaptured the headquarters. “By then all the commanders had left.” He witnessed four of his friends from Abéché die.View image in fullscreenResidents of Maigoma celebrate as they return home after nearly two years.Photograph: Mark Townsend/The ObserverThe cowardice of their commanders was a recurrent theme. Ateir Lonjar, 25, from Abyei in South Sudan, was charged with defending eastern Omdurman.As night fell on 12 March 2024, he witnessed the entire RSF command sailing across the Nile to safety in Khartoum. “They left us to die. I wasn’t even given a gun.”The ethnic hierarchy of the RSF was also evident. Anyone from Darfur’s Rizeigat tribe was, said Lonjar, allowed to cross the river. “Other tribes had to stay,” said Lonjar, aDinka.Other RSF soldiers confirm a two-tier system with troops from Darfur given the best food and accommodation.View image in fullscreenSudanese Armed Forces soldiers celebrate after taking over the presidential palace in Khartoum.Photograph: APMakuach Achoul, 22, from Aweil, South Sudan, said: “They call themselves the ‘RSF proper’, they don’t mix with us.” Achoul was abducted from a Khartoum charcoal factory last year and forced to fight for the RSF. “My family will think I’m dead.”It was the first Friday prayers since the war began. Inside Khartoum’s al-Noor mosque, six Sudanese army troops knelt, AK-47s laid beside them. No one led the weekly Jum’ah. Al-Noor’s imam had been killed and his successor had not appeared, perhaps concerned the area was unsafe.The mosque caretaker, Al Mogtba Obeid, had turned up, but wished he hadn’t. “They’ve even stripped the carpet. What a mess.”He could say the same for his country.Awadin’s future, like that of Sudan itself, is uncertain. As it became clear that no extended family was coming to take her in, one of the hospital nurses, Roaa Yoosif, stepped up.“My mother will take care of her for now.

In the build-up to Wednesday’s spring statement, why are many economistsurging her to flex or even rewrite them, aschancellors have on several occasionssince they were first drafted by Labour nearly three decades ago?Why does the Treasury have budget rules?Responsible governments should match day-to-day spending with their income and only borrow to invest. This is the “golden rule” adopted by Gordon Brown in 1997 and contained in the charter and fiscal framework George Osborne adopted when he became chancellor in 2010 in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Osborne provided an extra layer of oversight, telling the Treasury it could no longer mark its own homework. To this end, he ­created an independent forecaster and auditor –the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).Keir Starmer’s government is following the Brown playbook with a view to telling financial markets and voters the public finances are safe in Labour’s hands, and to avoid a jump in the cost of servicing government debtsuch as the one that followed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget,which avoided OBR oversight.What is the mandate?The charter for budget responsibility “presents the government’s approach to operating fiscal policy and managing sustainable public finances in the long-term interests of the UK”.Within this broad statement of intent,there is a budget stability rulethat forces the chancellor to balance spending with revenue over a five-year horizon. It means the costs of welfare and running services should be met by revenues in the 2029-30 financial year, at which point the government will only borrow to invest.From next year (2026-27), the rule becomes stricter and the chancellor only has a three-year horizon to meet the balanced-budget target. A balanced budget is defined as a surplus or deficit within a margin of 0.5% of GDP.In a forecastpublished to coincide with last October’s budget, the OBR estimated a surplus two years early (in 2027-28) but that the situation would not improve much beyond this point. By 2029-30, the expectation is for a small surplus of £9.9bn on a total budget in excess of £1.3tn.What are the supplementary rules?A limit on investment spending is tied to a debt rule. This instructs Reeves to reduce the total amount the UK has borrowed as a proportion of GDP in the last year of the parliament. To allow for greater borrowing to fund investment,this rule has been loosenedby changing the definition of debt.Since the October budget, public debt has been calculated using a metric called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), or net financial debt. According to the OBR forecast, Reeves has carefully crafted government spending over the next five years to meet the mandate, using the PSNFL measure. Debt will be lower in 2029-30 than 2028-29 as a share of GDP.PSNFL includes all the government debt and assets counted within the standard measure used by previous governments – known as public sector net debt (PSND) – with some add-ons that tend to reduce the net debt figure, including funded public-sector pensions, shares in private companies and the student loan book.A third rule, little mentioned, aims to limit welfare spending but does not set a target.What is the role of the Office for Budget Responsibility?Twice a year, the OBR judges whether the government will meet its fiscal rules. A forecast is combined with an assessment of what the government is likely to have to pay for its debt and what it will receive in taxes. A five-year prediction for each is drafted. OBR officials amalgamate the figures to assess whether the government’s finances are going backwards or staying in the black.What are the flaws in the current system?The eight changes to the rules since 2010 indicate the difficulties governments have found meeting them. One criticism is the influence of the OBR’s forecasts, which change as the economic picture develops. Before the last election, theInstitute for Government warned: “The UK’s fiscal framework is incentivising bad policy decisions shaped by short-termism and fictional spending plans – and does little to promote fiscal sustainability.” Fixed spending targets tied to a movable forecast were a recipe for trouble, it said.A second criticism relates to what the National Institute of Economic and Social Research callsa flawed set of rules. Meeting a debt rule is tricky when the cost of debt fluctuates daily. Predicting tax receipts five years ahead based on the likely rate of economic growth makes the task harder. Why, ask many economists, would the Treasury allow small changes in the outlook for debt payments and GDP growth, which can quickly reverse, to trigger short-term cuts in spending?How might the flaws be overcome?Many economists want the budget framework to stay, setting out how the Treasury manages the government’s finances sustainably, but for the targets to be junked. It might sound like a way for politicians to escape scrutiny, but the goals are widely disliked. Moreover, there is scepticism that investors or voters want long-term policies to be cut or reworked to meet a temporary shortfall en route to meeting a target.It’s good to have a “golden rule”, saysProfessor Iain Begg of the London School of Economics, but basing projections of public spending that are in turn based on forecasts of economic growth and debt costs is “heaping one interpretation on another, which is nuts”.The Institute for Fiscal Studies is in favour of a target that shows how the government will afford public spending in five years’ time, but says “a slavish adherence to a fiscal target is not sensible”.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The ObserverEconomicsRachel ReevesexplainersShareReuse this content"

The tax loophole that turns old pubs into places of worshipA complex corporate network is enabling big landlords to avoid business rates by claiming religious exemption – and costing cash-strapped councils millionsRob Davies,Michael GoodierandJessica ElgotSun 23 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe windows are painted over, the woodwork is rotting and weeds have sprouted through the paving outside.The former Duke of York pub in Clapham, south London, is not in the best of shape. It certainly does not look like somewhere used for regular prayer services.Yet round the back, a piece of paper has been pinned to a door, inviting anyone who stumbles upon it to “book a private religious worship session here”.The notice provides contact details for Faithful Global, an inter-faith organisation whose website preaches “the power of community, connection and inclusion”.“Our mission is to see greater opportunities for local faith communities who are seeking suitable venues for their religious practices, community activities or private prayer.” it says. However, Faithful’s mission may be more financial than spiritual. In fact, the organisation is the lynchpin of a corporate network whose primary aim appears to be tax avoidance, at the expense of cash-strapped councilsbattling a funding crisis.Details about the scheme’s reach, revealed in theObservertoday, raise questions about whether Faithful – and its landlord clients – are diverting millions of pounds earmarked for public services into their pockets.The faith room schemeTo religious groups in need of a place to gather, Faithful Global appears to be the answer to their prayers. As of last week, it listed 370 properties – stretching from Cornwall to Aberdeen – that can be booked as “safe and accessible places of worship for people of all faith backgrounds”.They range from tiny retail units to gleaming office blocks and football-pitch-sized warehouses that could hold a congregation of thousands. For lone worshippers, there is a calendar of upcoming open prayer sessions to join.Faithful presents its business model as an ingenious way of harnessing the corporate profit motive for divine ends. At the heart of its proposition are business rates – taxes collected by local authorities from the occupants of commercial property. Landlords do not have to pay rates for up to six months after a tenant vacates their property. After that, the tax – worth £25bn a year to local authorities – kicks in again.View image in fullscreenThe former dentists’ surgery that was de-listed from Faithful Global’s site.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianHowever, relief on these “empty rates” is available to landlords who allow the property to be used free by a charity or community sports group. There is also an exemption for properties offered to faith groupsunder the religious worship exemption of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, legislation passed under Margaret Thatcher that also introduced the poll tax.Tom Perry of business rates consultancy Holloway Bond says the aim is to align landlords’ interests with the common good. “The principle is that the property is made available for the public to use,” he said. “If it’s done right, it can be an ethical idea that’s beneficial to people.” Or, as Faithful puts it, landlords can “unlock their property’s potential as a space for local worship and prayer, while also benefiting from reduced costs”.However, information obtained by theObserverraises questions about whether property owners are holding up their end of the bargain.A couple of miles down the road from the building that once housed the Duke of York pub lies a former dentists’ surgery. It was also listed on the Faithful website in early March but did not appear to be usable for prayer sessions. Its front door was boarded up, the interior filled with building materials and junk.When theObserveremailed Faithful posing as a potential landlord client, a representative responded within days. But a separate inquiry about the possibility of a faith group using the dentists’ surgery elicited an automated message, promising a follow-up that never materialised. The property was removed from its listings soon after.Over two weeks, theObservermonitored a calendar of open prayer sessions on the Faithful website. Most new listings were for dates in the past. The few that promoted upcoming sessions featured no information about the denomination of worship.Faith tested in courtShaylesh Patel runs Astop, an organisation that connects charities with landlords willing to offer rooms for free, incentivised partly by business rates relief. Like Perry, he believes that this model can deliver mutual benefit for landlords and charities or genuine faith groups, and thus for wider society.“If you can imagine trying to tax a space where people go and pray, it would be unacceptable. You’re trying to tax God,” he said. But Patel questioned whether Faithful’s operation was in keeping with the intent of the exemption, pointing to a row that has arisen in Kent.Dover district council is in dispute with the owners of Discovery Park – a sprawling life sciences hub near Sandwich. More than 60 units at the park have been claimed as places of worship, the council said. It has received legal advice that suggests the faith room exemption should not apply and is now preparing to pursue the owners of the park for £1m.“If you’re saying that 60 spaces in one business park are being used for faith purposes, that’s not in the spirit of it at all,” said Patel. “That’s looking at the rules and trying to find loopholes.”View image in fullscreenDiscovery Park in Sandwich. Dover council is pursuing the vast life sciences hub for £1m, challenging a claim that 60 units onsite are faith rooms.Photograph: John Gaffen/AlamyThe site’s owner, Discovery Park Estates, pulled in revenues of £22m in 2023, although it lost £169,000 before tax. But the company is just one part of a nationwide corporate network controlled by the Schreibers, a large London-based family of property investors who appear to be the scheme’s biggest customers.Companies controlled by members of the family also own the former Duke of York pub and a host of other venues listed on Faithful’s website. Representatives of the family told theObserverthat business rates on empty properties put a “significant burden” on landlords. They said their use of the scheme was legitimate and did not constitute tax avoidance.They also said that their properties at Discovery Park and elsewhere had been used for faith purposes, and that local authorities had been provided with evidence of this.Behind the schemeA court ruling from last year raises questions about how often some of the venues offered by Faithful are actually used for faith purposes. The case also laid bare the corporate interests behind the “inter-faith organisation” itself.Bradford Metropolitan borough council brought a successful claim against a property owner for unpaid rates. The resulting ruling named three companies behind what the judge described as a “scheme” devised in 2021 for the purpose of tax avoidance.One of the companies, Room for Faith Ltd, is based in the UK. Its sister firm, Local Faith Ltd (LFL), incorporated in Hong Kong, appears to be the corporate entity behind the Faithful website.The nucleus of the scheme is a third business: Greater Manchester-based property consultancy Verity Commercial Services. The Faithful website describes Verity as a “partner” and “agent”. In fact, it was Verity that incorporated both Room for Faith Ltd and Local Faith Ltd in the first place, according to the ruling.If you’re saying 60 spaces in one business park are being used for faith purposes, that’s not in the spirit of it at allShaylesh Patel, AstopVerity’s website sets out a very different mission to Faithful’s. It boasts of a “revolutionary” business rates mitigation product that beats previous tax avoidance models.The Bradford court papers shed light on the apparent inner workings of the scheme. First, according to the ruling, Verity’s landlord client grants a lease to Room for Faith Ltd. That company in turn subleases the property to Local Faith Ltd (LFL), the company behind Faithful Global. The property can then claim relief, with Verity pocketing a quarter of the savings its client makes.The scheme appears to be the brainchild of Verity’s founder and chief executive, Simon Dresdner, a veteran property consultant who is also a director of Room for Faith Ltd. His testimony in the Bradford case raises further questions about Faithful’s prayer sessions.In a statement submitted to the court, Dresdner referred to a meeting that Faithful claimed had taken place at one of its venues. He could not say how long the meeting lasted and could provide “no evidence of how the premises was made available for worship”, according to the ruling. In pictures of the event supplied to the court, the only person that could be identified was someone acting as an “employee or agent” working for Verity.The property “had no electrical lighting”, according to evidence submitted during the case. A council inspector had to be shown round by torchlight. Ultimately, the court found that there was “no evidence that LFL was anything beyond a company upon which a legal right to occupy was conferred for no other purpose than the avoidance of liability to rates”.Data published by local authorities indicates that Room for Faith and Local Faith Ltd have held dozens, if not hundreds, of leases across the country, from North Lincolnshire to South Ayrshire, and in multiple London boroughs, including Lambeth and Tower Hamlets. The variety of properties and locations means that the sums landlords can save vary significantly.In Bradford, the council went to court for just £14,348.90. Dover said it was pursuing the owners of Discovery Park for more than £1m, although Discovery Park Estates says the sum in dispute is much lower. Verity’s own website boasts that it has saved clients £18m with its scheme.At a national level, the costs of business rates avoidance runs high. Councils lose about £250m a year due to all forms of business rates avoidance, according to a study by the Local Government Association in 2019. Birmingham cited declining business rates among the factors thatplunged it into a state of financial distress in 2023, just one example of alocal authority funding crisisthat threatens to cripple public services.So far, only a handful of councils have challenged the faith room tax avoidance scheme. But City of London is now understood to be providing assistance to less well-resourced local authorities, including Dover – part of a concerted effort to shut it down.“Tackling business rates avoidance provides much-needed funds for public services and a level playing field for firms,” said a spokesperson.“The City corporation is using its expertise to help other local authorities fight tax avoidance schemes as part of its commitment to creating a safe, secure environment for businesses and residents alike in the Square Mile and beyond.”In the meantime, councils seeking to protect much-needed revenue must use what scant resources they have – or offer up a prayer.Verity and Faithful Global did not return requests for comment.View image in fullscreenIdlewells shopping centre in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.Photograph: Ian Francis stock/AlamyThe Schreiber property empireThere is every chance that members of the Schreiber family own an office block, a shopping centre or a disused pub near you.From a nondescript three-storey brick building in London – home to 321 active companies, according to Companies House – this dynasty of property entrepreneurs controls a nationwide real-estate empire.The Schreibers appear to be the biggest customers of the “faith room” scheme, an audacious tax avoidance structure we reveal today.The scheme allows landlords to avoid paying business rates if their property is being used by faith groups. But often there is little sign of devotional activity taking place.One unlikely hive of religious fervour is Discovery Park Estates, a vast life sciences hub near Sandwich, Kent, owned by members of the Schreiber family. Dover district council is pursuing Discovery Park for £1m, challenging the company’s designation of 60 of its units as faith rooms. A spokesperson for Discovery Park said the sum in dispute was much less than £1m and that it was only leasing 18 rooms to faith groups at present. The company said it had provided evidence to the council of the buildings being used for religious worship.Discovery Park’s chief executive, Mayer Schreiber, is one of nine siblings of a family that invests via its private office, Midos Group.Midos is ultimately owned by 72-year-old Miriam Schreiber, one of two directors along with David Schreiber, who is the same age.Midos owns Cornmill shopping centre in Darlington, via a company whose directors include a Jacob Schreiber. It also owns the Idlewells shopping centre, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.Companies controlled by David Schreiber also own the former Duke of York pub in Clapham, south London and the Regent Centre, an office block in Newcastle.Another block on Newhall Street, Birmingham, is co-owned by a company whose owners include three members of the family: Miriam, Gyta and Osias.All are listed as being or having faith rooms on the website of Faithful Global, an “inter-faith organisation” at the heart of the scheme.Midos Group said its use of the scheme was legitimate and did not constitute tax avoidance. “All properties within this scheme have been made available and are accessible for faith-based activities,” it said, adding that local authorities had been provided with evidence of this. “The current business rates system for vacant properties imposes a significant financial burden on landlords, penalising them for market conditions beyond their control,” it added.Explore more on these topicsCommercial propertyThe ObserverHMRCReal estateReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has her head down, working hard, so bowed in thought her face is almost pressed right against her paper. A few seats down, a boy adopts a similar pose. One girl has her ankles crossed, while another has hers splayed. Across the room, one girl’s shoes are practical, while another’s are oddly adult, sandals with heels, hand-me-downs, maybe. You remember how imagination allowed you to disappear, to escape, to take leave of the four walls of the classroom, of the uncomfortable wooden chair and desk at which you tried not to fidget.Or were you the boy breaking the peace, wild and unruly, hanging over a table while lying flat on your stomach, legs dangling, fixing us with your cheeky gaze, as in this image from the Moroccan photographer Hicham Benohoud’s bookThe Classroom? The images were taken between 1994 and 2000 while Benohoud worked as an art teacher and found himself, like the students, stifled by the educational system. The teacher who inspires by introducing simple freedoms into a rigid educational setting is a familiar cinematic trope (To Sir, With Love,Dangerous Minds,Entreles Murs,AKAThe Class). Benohoud makes it his own in quiet black-and-white photographs that show how students, when given the opportunity to play and experiment, can redefine their surroundings with the leanest of creative means. Chairs and tables become frames within frames, reveal and conceal faces, as do paper cutouts held up playfully. Strings and tape, cardboard and fabric become interventions in space or extensions of the body, curtains and shrouds, places to hide, to refuse to be seen.Benohoud’s project and its emphasis on youthful self-authorship is as much about the present as the past, with how traditional curriculum meets ever-evolving post-colonial identity. “As soon as I took my camera out, their faces would light up. ‘What’s he going to get us to do now?’ I could feel their gaze on me: we had a real understanding,” the photographer has said of the new energy in the room. These images are portraiture as pedagogy, a reminder that how we see ourselves and others, see and are seen, frame and are framed, makes the world around us visible in myriad shapes and forms – like all the best educations should.The Classroomis published by Loose Joints (£42)Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureTeachingThe ClassfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rubio said Rasool was a “race-baiting politician” who hates the US and Trump.Although Rubio did not directly cite a reason, his post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave in a webinar organised by a South African thinktank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration’s crackdowns on diversity and equity programmes and on immigration, and mentioned the possibility of a US where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will not let this happen. We’re over the shock of the betrayal, but we can never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves. We have to look out for each other.”Moments before, Carney met the governor general, Mary Simon, requesting she dissolve the country’s 44th parliament and call an election. Under federal law, the minimum length of a campaign is 37 days.By calling the snap election in search of a “strong, positive mandate”, Carney does not have to face a hostile parliament – a showdown complicated by the fact that he doesn’t have a seat in the House of Commons. Parliament had been due to return on Monday after being prorogued for two months, following former prime minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation announcement in early January.Carney’s decision comes as the Liberals experiencean unprecedented swing in the pollsthat has now put them ahead of the Conservatives, with some projecting the party has enough support nationally to form a majority government.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoBefore the dissolution of parliament, the incumbent Liberals held 152 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives had 120, the Bloc Québécois 33, the NDP 24, and the Green party two.“Carney has been the gamechanger and has totally reversed the fortunes of the Liberal party,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University’s school of public administration. “And increasingly, this election is not really about the parties any more, or the brands they represent. We don’t elect our prime minister directly, but the feeling increasingly is that people are poised to vote for the leader they want to see as prime minister.”Numerous surveys from polling firms suggest Canadians view Carney as more capable than the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, in handling economic turbulence, trade talks and relations with a hostile and unpredictable White HouseTrump has figured prominently into Canada’s political narrative, repeatedly threatening to wage economic war on the US’s closest ally and one of its largest trading partners, with the end goal of annexing the country’s northern neighbour.Those threats, and the prospect of painful tariffs on Canadian goods, have electrified the country, with a groundswell of patriotism, calls to boycott American goods and an “elbows up” rallying cry.“The election will certainly have a ballot question. But it isn’t Trump, it’s uncertainty. Trump is a symbol of that he’s showing how Canada is vulnerable in many ways. People want a leader who can be the antidote to that uncertainty,” said Turnbull. “And if you look at poll after poll, people believe Carney offers something, in this moment, that Canadians need.”In acampaign video released on Saturday nightthat has had millions of views, the Canadian actor and comedian Mike Myers appears with Carney in matching Team Canada ice-hockey jerseys. Carney questions Myers, who long starred on Saturday Night Live, with Canadian cultural references in a test of the comedian’s identity.“Wow, you really are Canadian,” Carney says after Myers answers every question correctly. The ad ends with Carney telling Myers “there will always be a Canada” and the pair agreeing it was time for “elbows up”, the hockey phrase that has become the latest rallying cry in the country amid threats to Canadian sovereignty.The camera then shows Myers from behind with his jersey emblazoned with the slogan “Never 51”, a reference to Canada’s rejection of ever joining the US.In less than 24 hours, the ad had been viewed more than 7m times, an unprecedented level for a Canadian political ad.If the Liberals emerge victorious in April, it will be remembered as the largest political comeback in the country’s history – and for the Conservatives, a catastrophic loss of an election result that until recently was certain to fall in their favour.As early as 2023, CBC’s polling aggregator had the Tory chance at electoral victory at 99% – a seemingly insurmountable edge they maintained until mid February 2025. But a series of confounding factors, including the resignation of Trudeau, threats by Trump toannex Canadaand the rapid ascension of Carney as the new Liberal leader, has dramatically shifted the political landscape.Turnbull said: “Conservatives seem to be falling short in saying the things that connect with how Canadians are feeling. A few months ago, Poilievre was talking about affordability and housing, issues that the Liberals were tonedeaf on. But now, he’s somehow absent. The Conservatives are keeping the same messaging, even though Canadians have shifted.“They may be trying to convince themselves that Carney is on a honeymoon, and if they just stick to their notes, the polls will go back to some version of what they were before, and then they’ll cross the finish line first.”Poilievre has framed his party’s campaign as a “Canada first” platform. On Sunday, he told reporters at his campaign launch: “Trump has been very blunt that he wants a weak Canada that he can target … Electing Liberals will weaken our country still.” He added that Canada “will never be an American state; we will always be a sovereign and self-reliant country”.The Conservatives, without Trudeau as a political punching bag, say Carney is largely responsible for the country’s slow growth in recent years, given his role as economic adviser to the Liberal party. They call him “sneaky Carney” and allege he plans to bring back a controversial carbon tax he removed in his first day as prime minister.“That whole strategy rests on being able to define Carney. And if they could do that, then their strategy would probably work,” said Turnbull. “But that’s not working. Voters, in poll after poll, are not accepting the Conservatives definition of who Mark Carney is. And that will matter in the coming weeks.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The Liberals said on Saturday that Carney would run to represent the suburban riding, or district, of Nepean, noting in a social media post that Ottawa is where he raised his family and devoted his career to public service. He previously served as the head of Canada’s central bank and before that as deputy.The election campaign for 343 seats in the House of Commons will last 37 days. The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.Carney replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the governing Liberal party elected Carney on 9 March following a leadership race.Canada’s Liberals on course for political resurrection amid trade war, polls showRead moreCarney, sworn in as Canada’s 24th prime minister on 14 March, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate. The governingLiberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this yearuntilDonald Trump declared a trade war.The opposition Conservatives had hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of stability in US-Canada relations, the vote is expected instead to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.2:05New prime minister says Canada will 'never be part of the US' – videoCarney, 60, was the head of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013 he became the first non-citizen of the United Kingdom to run the Bank of England – helping to manage the impact of Brexit.Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney’s main challenger. The party and Poilievre had been heading for a huge victory in Canada’s federal election this year until derailed by Trump’s behaviour.Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st US state, put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products – as well as all of America’s trading partners – on 2 April.Trump’s frequent attacks on Canada’s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.Trump mocked Trudeau by calling him governor, but has not yet mentioned Carney by name.With Associated PressExplore more on these topicsMark CarneyCanadaAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month, China’s ministry of foreign affairspromisedthat China will “fight to the end” with the US in a “tariff war, trade war or any other war”.Daines, a Montana Republican, met Li with a group of seven American executives on Sunday, following an annual business summit in the Chinese capital attended by top foreign CEOs.Daines was accompanied by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, Boeing Global Senior Vice President Brendan Nelson, and other executives at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, according to a foreign media pool report.Daines, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee, was heavily involved in negotiations over US-China trade during Trump’s first term, and has made multiple trips toChinaas a senator. He lived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in the 1990s while working as an executive for Proctor & Gamble.Beijing has been trying to attract foreign investment to offset US tariff pressure and its slowing domestic economy.Relations between China and the US have come under new strain after Trump slapped additional tariffs on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.In early April, Trump is expected to unleash a round of tariffs on all countries that tax US imports, potentially including China. A US review of whether China has fulfilled promises made during the “phase one” trade deal from Trump’s first administration is set to conclude on 1 April. “Currently, US-China relations have come to an important juncture,” Li told Daines in their meeting, stressing the need to choose dialogue over confrontation.“Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,” Li said.The US executives were granted an audience with Li Qiang, who will not meet separately with other foreign CEOs at the China Development Forum for the second year in a row.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said it followed the prime minister having intervened to shelve a commitment to create a national Environment Protection Agency in this term of parliament.The campaign is notable in part because most environmental organisations would strongly prefer that Labor returns to government, whether in minority or majority, to a Peter Dutton-led Coalition taking power. Many of the anti-nuclear ads have also been strongly supportive of Labor’s renewable energy policies.RSPCA revokes Huon’s accreditation after video showing live salmon being dumped in TasmaniaRead moreAn Australian Conservation Foundation social media ad posted on Saturday said: “Australia’s next extinction is imminent and our PM is signing the death warrant. Not on our watch”. A Greenpeace Australia Pacific ad said: “Albanese goes all out for species extinction”.The Australian Conservation Foundation’s ad accuses Anthony Albanese of ‘signing the death warrant’ for the Maugean skate.Photograph: Australian Conservation FoundationThe chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific, David Ritter, said there was “visceral anger in the community” about a change to nature laws to prioritise an industry over scientific concerns about the skate, which had survived for more than 60m years. He said environmental advocacy groups agreed to a coordinated advertising approach “to ensure that the prime minister grasps the seriousness of the situation”, after direct lobbying failed.“Like many other groups, Greenpeace has immediately refocused campaign effort to ensure the Australian public is aware of what the prime minister is proposing to do and the impact it would have – not just on the Maugean skate, but setting an incredibly bad precedent giving special treatment to a harmful and polluting industry,” he said. “In our own advertising, this issue has taken priority over gas and nuclear policy, for now.”Ritter said campaigners believed it was not too late for Albanese to change course. “The bill should be dumped and a strong re-commitment should be made to deliver strong nature law reforms, and an independent watchdog to enforce them, within the first 12 months of government if reelected this year,” he said.Other conservation group leaders told the government the suspension of their anti-nuclear advertising was “open-ended”. Some were reconsidering where they would dedicate resources during the campaign.The government plans to amend the Environment Protection and BiodiversityConservation(EPBC) Act to end a formal reconsideration by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, into whether an expansion of fish farming in the harbour in 2012 was properly approved. The industry, Tasmanian Labor MPs and state Liberal government have lobbied for the change.The reconsideration wastriggered by a legal requestin 2023 from three environmentally focused organisations. An environment department opinion released under freedom of information laws suggested that it could lead to salmon farming having to stop in the harbour while an environmental impact statement was prepared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionGuardian Australia has learned the legislation would prevent reconsideration requests by third parties in some cases in which developments had been deemed “not a controlled action” – meaning they had not needed a full federal environmental assessment. It would apply when the development was ongoing or recurring, had been under way for at least five years before the request was made, and was subject to state or territory oversight.A government spokesperson said on Sunday the proposed change was a “very specific amendment to address a flaw” in the EPBC Act.“We won’t stand by and let workers lose their jobs because of a broken law. Under existing law, an industry could be shut down overnight when an environmental assessment commences. That is not acceptable to the government or to the community.“We want to see laws which provide better environmental protections and faster decision-making. We remain committed to that. We will consult on specifics in a second term with the states, business and environment groups.”The Maugean skate has beenlisted as endangered since 2004. Concern about its plight escalated last year when a government scientific committee said numbers in the wild were “extremely low”, and that fish farming in the harbour was the main cause of a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen levels andshould be scaled back or removed to save the species. It recommended the species be considered critically endangered.0:50Baby skates on verge of extinction in Tasmania hatched by scientists – videoA separatereport by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studieslast month said surveys suggested the skate population was likely to have recovered to 2014 levels after crashing last decade.

Is his election strategy coming unstuck? | Josh ButlerRead moreThe minister has used the figures to contrast Labor’s priorities with those of Peter Dutton’s opposition, which is planning public service cuts and a return-to-office edict if it wins the election.“The choice for Australians couldn’t be clearer – a Labor government focused on repairing the budget to pay for the things that matter, or the Coalition’s plans to cut frontline services to try to pay for their $600bn nuclear scheme,” Gallagher said.The Coalition has repeatedly criticised the 36,000 extra public service positions created under the Albanese government, without explicitly detailing how many of those jobs would be axed.The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, on Sunday said a Dutton government intended to return the commonwealth bureaucracy to the level it was when Labor was elected in 2022.That comment suggests all of the positions would go despite the Coalition’s promise, which Hume repeated on Sunday, to protect frontline worker roles.“We think that the 36,000 public servants that have been brought on haven’t demonstrated the improvements to the services to the public have been corresponding,” Hume, who is also the shadow public service minister, told Sky News.“Let’s face it, services haven’t improved but the cost and size of the public service has expanded and bloated exponentially.”The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, on Sunday sidestepped the question of whether a Coalition government would again turn to private consultants to plug gaps in the public service.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s also enabled people to overcome the tyranny of distance in this great country.The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) will launch a similar attack on Monday, claiming one in three Australian workers would be affected if private sector bosses followed Dutton’s lead.The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said clamping down on remote work would be a “productivity killer” that would hurt women the most.“Forcing hundreds of thousands of workers back on the roads will mean less time with kids and more time in traffic,” she said.“Blanket orders summoning people back to the workplace, will leave thousands without access to work from home settings and other flexible work options.“This would be an instant productivity killer, because flexible work has pushed women’s workforce participation to record highs, as one million women joined the workforce in the last four years.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAustralian election 2025Katy Gallagher (Australian politician)Australian budget 2025newsShareReuse this content"

New laws capping campaign spending will soon make these budget night soirees less important, at least financially.Tickets will have to be publicly disclosed as gifts, meaning there will be a record of those who sipped champagne with politicians and filled the party coffers. But these changes won’t apply until 2026. For now, the show goes on.4:24Dutton's referendum, Turnbull's back, and Albo's plan to fight US tariffs with soft drink – videoThis year, Labor is charging donors $5,000 a head to attend its federal budget dinner at an undisclosed Canberra location. The event will be attended by the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, and his ministry (one can only hope with that fee) after the budget speech in the lower house.As a thanks for their financial loyalty, members of Labor’s business forum can attend for a discounted entry fee of $4,000 a head; not a huge discount for those who’ve paid more than $100,000 for a top tier membership.Newsroom edition: can Dutton and Albanese get voters to listen to them? - podcastRead moreLiberal politicians and staffers get their own fundraising fun on Thursday night whenPeter Duttondelivers his budget reply speech. Guardian Australia has seen at least five separate Canberra-based events for sale with tickets ranging from $500 to $5,000.Liberal backbench MPs Alex Hawke and Simon Kennedy are both holding events at a function room at Manuka Oval, with Hawke charging $500 for a single ticket while Kennedy’s event offers tickets for between $500 and $5,000.Retiring MP Paul Fletcher will be joined by the Bradfield candidate, Gisele Kapterian, for a Canberra dinner event. Liberal members can join for $1,000 a head while non-members must fork out $2,000.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailIf travelling to the bush capital is too much of a stretch, the former prime minister John Howard will join the Liberal’s Bennelong candidate, Scott Yung, for a three-course dinner on budget night. It’s a bargain at just $220 a head.Genuine engagement or a chance to feel important?Earlier this year, many lobbyists and donors openly joked about the budget night fundraisers. Almost no one expected they would go ahead. But then ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred upended any chance of an early election.Political staff and advisers have mixed reactions to these events, ranging from contempt and disdain to mild enthusiasm.One former senior Labor figure speaking on the condition of anonymity described budget night fundraisers as a waste of time and money for anyone hoping for a genuine engagement.“You pay $5k for a seat at a table and when the minister eventually shows up, he’s exhausted,” they said. The cynic said the events were simply about filling up the party’s coffers before an election.But one former Liberal figure said the events were “incredibly valuable and five grand for access to a minister that can make decisions – it’s not that much money”.Face-to-face interactions with Canberra’s most powerful politicians was important for businesses and lobbyists to build long-term relationships, a former Labor chief-of-staff added.“No one’s forcing people to attend these events. They choose to do so,” they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One budget night veteran, who declined to be named, said there was very little “hard lobbying” conducted by anyone vaguely competent on the night itself.“If you want the government to spend more money on your client, then the literal worst possible place to be is in Canberra on budget night, when ministers will tell you about all the decisions they’ve already made,” the operative said.“But I’m sure there will always be some who turn up and think, ‘Here is how I can get my way’.“Generally speaking, lobbyists go to these events because it makes them feel important. They know that if they take their clients and the minister comes over, drops their name, they’ll get stars in their eyes.”A former state Liberal staffer said people who turn up to these events could sometimes get preferential treatment in a minister’s diary at a later date.“Or they might get the 10.30am spot in the diary, and not the 7am one,” they said.Cash-for-access a ‘blight on our democracy’Outside those attending the soirees, the view is less benign. Transparency advocates havelong argued the practice underminesdemocracy and encourages the country’s richest to spend big on elected politicians for access and influence.In October 2022, the Labor government banned political fundraising events in the “bookable” areas of Parliament House, including public areas such as the Great Hall and function rooms.However, the rules do not cover parliamentarian offices or the rooms reserved for political parties’ use in the taxpayer-funded building – aloophole used by some politiciansin last year’s federal budget.The independent ACT senator, David Pocock, said the practice was inappropriate no matter where the event was held.“Politicians are elected to represent their communities and should be accessible to everyone, not just those with the biggest bank accounts,” Pocock said.The new laws don’t take effect for some years yet but will be in operation by the next federal election sometime in 2028. By then, each ticket bought over the disclosure threshold – $5,000 – would be publicly disclosed. Those under that threshold will remain anonymous.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsCoalitionLabor partyAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonCanberraAustralian Capital TerritorynewsShareReuse this content"

As their numbers swelled, protesters increasingly clashed with police who fired teargas. In Izmir, video showed police attempting to disperse protests using armoured water cannon trucks.Prosecutors ruled that İmamoğlu’s detention on corruption charges alone was sufficient, despite “a strong suspicion of a crime”, opting to detain three others on terrorism charges but not the mayor. This decision is expected to allow the Republican People’s party (CHP), Turkey’s largest opposition party, to select a candidate to control the Istanbul municipality, rather than the state selecting a caretaker.View image in fullscreenPolice officers use pepper spray on protesters in Istanbul on Sunday.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersThe Turkish interior ministry issued a directive to officially remove İmamoğlu and two Istanbul district mayors from office, appointing a trustee to replace one in a neighbourhood long seen as a bedrock of opposition support.İmamoğlu has denied the accusations against him, telling investigators during questioning that his detention had “not only harmed Turkey’s international reputation but has also shattered the public’s sense of justice and trust in the economy”.His chief spokesperson, Murat Ongun, who was also remanded in custody, posted on X: “I was arrested on slander that was not based on a single piece of evidence!”The Istanbul mayor’s detention in a dawn raid earlier this week has sparked mass protests across Turkey, with tens of thousands taking to the streets each night and often clashing with police. The interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, announced that 323 more people had been detained overnight as part of an investigation into the Istanbul municipality, the day after he announced that 343 people had been arrested for protesting.Turkish officials rejected any suggestion that the sweeping crackdown against İmamoğlu, along with municipal officials, businesspeople and dozens of other members of the CHP, was politically motivated. This has done little to quell anti-government sentiment, and demonstrators have filled university campuses, public squares and surrounded Istanbul’s city hall each night to defy a protest ban.The growing demonstrations have sparked fierce criticism from Erdoğan, who has labelled them “street terrorism”.View image in fullscreenProtesters carry flags as they try to march to Taksim Square from the Istanbul municipality headquarters during the protest.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPAPosting on X, he wrote: “The days of taking to the streets along with leftwing organisations and vandals to point the finger at the national will are over … we will definitely not allow the CHP and its supporters to disrupt public order and disturb the peace of our nation through provocations.”İmamoğlu was jailed on pre-trial detention on the same day that 1.5 million members of the CHP held a primary vote to officially endorse his candidacy for president. The Istanbul mayor was the party’s sole presidential candidate, turning the vote into a symbolic show of support, particularly after the CHP offered non-members a “solidarity vote” in the primary.The embattled mayor issued a message from the high-security facility where he is now held. “Fifteen million of our citizens cast their votes,” he said. “Their message to Erdoğan was clear: “Enough is enough.’”He added: “That ballot box will come, and the nation will deliver a slap this government will never forget.”İmamoğlu has long been seen as the only challenger capable of defeating Erdoğan at the ballot box. A presidential election in Turkey is due in 2028, but an early vote is expected.The CHP leader, Özgur Özel, has accused Erdoğan and his government of detaining İmamoğlu over fears of an election loss. Istanbul University stripped İmamoğlu of his university diploma before his arrest, preventing him from running for president, as a degree is a pre-requisite.View image in fullscreenÖzgur Özel voting for İmamoglu during the presidential primaries on Sunday.Photograph: Erdem Şahin/EPA“Ekrem İmamoğlu’s only crime is leading in the polls,” Özel told crowds massing outside Istanbul city hall earlier this week. Speaking to reporters on Sunday he said: “Ekrem İmamoğlu is currently on the road to prison but he is also on the road to the presidency. The nation is repelling a coup through solidarity ballot boxes.”Many of those who took to the streets after İmamoğlu’s arrest said his detention had galvanised their decision to show up at the ballot boxes, even if the vote remained symbolic. The CHP said it had extended voting times to keep up with demand, amid images of vast crowds at the polls in their Istanbul stronghold of Kadıköy, and a line stretching around the block outside the polls in the opposition-held neighbourhood of Şişli.“This is a way for us to show our power, to show we’re coming in strong,” said a protester who gave her name as Devrim, who said she had been volunteering with CHP efforts to drive up participation in the ballot to demonstrate a groundswell of support for İmamoğlu.The CHP has also permitted those who are not party members to participate in the primary vote. “We were expecting a high turnout before, but now we think it will be even bigger,” said Devrim.The Ankara mayor, Mansur Yavaş, a leading member of the CHP, told reporters: “Honestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,” in reference to İmamoğlu’s arrest, after casting his ballot in the primary.“We learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been,” he said.Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

About 20 women in total have accused him of abuse and improper behaviour but several cases have been dropped as they are out of time for prosecution.Grinberg has supported the two women, saying Depardieu repeatedly made “salacious remarks” during the shoot in Paris.The trial was originally scheduled for last October but was postponed due to Depardieu’s ill health. At the time, his lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said the actor had undergone a quadruple heart bypass and his diabetes had been aggravated by the stress of the forthcoming trial.He has since been seen by a court-appointed doctor who declared him fit to appear, though the hearings will be limited to six hours a day and he will be given permission to take breaks when needed.Depardieu was placed under formal investigation on accusations of rape and sexual assault in 2020 after the actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of having attacked her on two occasions at his home in Paris in 2018, when she was 22 and he was 70.After Depardieu’s lawyers tried to get the case dropped, the Paris chief prosecutor said there was “serious and confirmed evidence” that justified maintaining the charges. The investigation continues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The mass gathering in Belgrade marked the culmination of four months ofprotests against the governmentafter the deadly collapse of a concrete train station canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad last November.1:01Tens of thousands rally against Serbian government in student-led protests – video reportCivil society groups have been warning for months about an increasingly hostile environment for independent media since the station collapse, which killed 16 people and set in motion a political backlash against Vučić’s pro-Russia administration.“The media inSerbiais at a dangerous turning point,” wrote the editors in an open letter signed by five outlets and included Igor Božić, the news director of the CNN-affiliated N1 Serbia. “The government is stepping up its attack on independent journalism, especially targeting outlets within United Media, as the political crisis worsens and public frustration grows.“Instead of addressing real public issues, the government creates false stories that paint independent media as foreign agents and enemies of the state. As a result, our reporters are assaulted, blocked from official events, and targeted with disinformation meant to break public trust.”The NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has said the pressure exerted on the media in Serbia has reached levels not seen since the 1990s. It has also urged the EU to condemn a raid on the offices of the Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability (CRTA), an NGO that runs a prominent fact-checking website.Pavol Szalai, the head of the RSF’s EU-Balkans desk, said Serbia was 98th out of 180 countries and territories on the world press freedom index last year, its lowest ranking in 22 years of the index.There have been several reports of hostility towards independent journalists since the train station disaster. At the end of last year, the N1 journalist Žaklina Tatalović and her cameraperson Nikola Popović were harassed while covering protests. Local press freedom groups said at the time that Tatalović and Popović had endured sexist insults and physical violence. Police officers were accused of failing to intervene.Another N1 reporter Jelena Mirković was attacked while covering protests against the demolition of a bridge. She suffered a neck injury and was subsequently unable to work. Last month, fellow N1 journalist Ksenija Pavkov was verbally threatened while reporting.In their letter, the group of editors said Vučić was falsely accusing journalists of “stirring unrest”. They also said financial and regulatory pressures were being applied, forcing away advertisers and business partners.“With ongoing student protests and a dissolved government awaiting new elections, we are deeply concerned for the safety of our reporters on the ground,” they wrote. “The growing hostility toward independent media, fuelled by orchestrated government rhetoric, has created an environment where violence is not only allowed but even encouraged.“In the past four months alone, our journalists, including Zaklina Tatalović, Ksenija Pavkov, and Jelena Mirković, have suffered both physical and verbal attacks. Despite clear video evidence of the perpetrators, the police have done nothing to hold them accountable.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Protests have been a regular feature in Serbia since November. The president has so far sought to deflect the blame, with a series of resignations arising from the station collapse.The Serbian government, led by the prime minister, Miloš Vučević, formally resigned last week, with Vučić saying elections could follow in June.Protesters aredemanding accountability for the disaster at Novi Sad, as well as more transparent institutions based on the rule of law. More than a dozen people have been charged in relation to the canopy collapse.

Most of the dead lost their lives in the period just after the first world war, when allied troops were sent to support rightwing White forces in the Russian civil war against the Bolsheviks, while 41 are casualties from the second world war Arctic convoys.Their resting places have been tended over decades by the Russian military and by private contractors, paid by the UK’s Commonwealth War Graves Commission. But after Vladimir Putin’s invasion ofUkraine, economic sanctions meant Britain could no longer pay for the graves to be maintained.The two countries appear to have come to a private understanding, however. The commission has continued to maintain 674 Soviet graves in its cemeteries in the UK and around the world and, although it cannot be certain, it believes that the Russians are doing the same for the 663 British military personnel.Map“We haven’t seen the graves but we think they are still being maintained,” said Gareth Hardware, the commission’s area director for the UK and northern countries. “We are maintaining their graves in our cemeteries.”Officials at the commission, which is funded by Britain and other Commonwealth nations, think the majority of the graves are tended by the Russian navy, while a private contractor has continued to oversee plots in Arkhangelsk. “Although we are currently unable to pay him, we have written confirming we will when able to do so,” a spokesperson said.Last summer, an amateur Russian historian took photographs of the graves in Arkhangelsk and they appeared to be in good condition. “The cemetery looks very well maintained. Someone is taking care of it, even in these difficult times,” he wrote in a blog post.A British diplomat from the embassy in Moscow also went to Murmansk on Remembrance Day last year with a Russian counterpart and reported back that the cemetery there was in good condition.At a commission conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London last week, the Russians’ apparent respect for the British dead was welcomed. V Adm Peter Hudson, vice-chair of the commission, said: “It transcends even those very fraught national relationships which exist between our two countries today.”Relations between London and Moscow have become so strained that earlier this month Britain was labelled Russia’s public enemy number one after the country’s foreign intelligence service accused the UK of trying to derail Donald Trump’s attempts at a peace deal.John Foreman, who served as Britain’s defence attaché in Moscow from 2019 to 2022 and visited all but one of the eight Commonwealth war cemeteries or memorials in the country, said it was a sign of how bad relations were between the two nations that there was no treaty governing the upkeep of graves. “This is all a very difficult issue with Russia, as we don’t have the treaties in place for all casualties of the 20th century,” he said. “I argued for a formal agreement while I was there.”It is even more difficult in the Russian-occupiedCrimearegion of Ukraine, where mass burial grounds housing the remains of British soldiers from the Crimean war had already been built on or desecrated. “We’ve had no sight of those,” Foreman said, adding that British diplomats from Moscow and Kyiv had been prevented from getting there during the war.Dirk Backen, general secretary of the German war graves commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge eV, still works with the Russians despite his country’s strained relationship with Moscow. “It’s the only thing still working,” he said. His commission oversees 600,000 German graves in Russia and other former areas of the eastern front. About 760,000 Soviet citizens were buried in Germany as a result of the second world war.UK accuses Russia of driving its Moscow embassy towards closureRead more“We still recover Red Army soldiers in Germany each year and will provide them a proper grave in Germany,” he said. “And the Russian ambassador is invited, but is not allowed to give a speech in front of the TV camera because he will misuse this [to repeat] a narrative which explains why everything in Ukraine is justified.”The commission’s cemeteries around the world have immaculate green lawns designed to be a reminder of English gardens. As well as international relations, climate change is a challenge and the commission said cemeteries will be redesigned over time to be more sustainable, with local plants and, in many locations, a less manicured look.Explore more on these topicsFirst world warThe ObserverSecond world warCrimeaUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He then made his way home to Casa Santa Marta in theVaticanCity, where he will convalesce for at least two months.“Our pope is coming back,” one of the pilgrims told Rai news.The health of Francis, who was admitted to hospital on 14 February and subsequently diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia, was steadily improving, Sergio Alfieri, a general surgeon at Gemelli hospital, told reporters on Saturday. However, it would still take “a lot of time” for his body to fully heal.Francis suffered two critical breathing crises in hospital before his doctors declared on 10 March that he was no longer in imminent ­danger.In the Angelus, the pope reflected on his“long period” of hospitalisation. “I have had the opportunity to experience the Lord’s patience, which I also see reflected in the tireless care of the doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the care and hopes of the relatives of the sick,” he said. “This trusting patience, anchored in God’s unfailing love, is indeed necessary in our lives, especially when facing the most difficult and painful situations.”He expressed his sadness atIsrael’s renewed bombing of the Gaza stripand called for an “immediate halt to the weapons and for the courage to resume dialogue, so that all hostages may be released and a final ceasefire reached”, while urging people to pray “for an end to wars and for peace, especially in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.”La Repubblica reported that Francis had insisted he return home, where he will need to continue his recovery and rest. “The hope is that he will soon be able to resume a work schedule,” Alfieri said. However, he cautioned that the pope would not immediately be able to meet groups of people. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, scheduled for 8 April, will take place.Despite his health challenges, on some days Francis continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood and writing a letter to the editor of Corriere della Sera newspaper reiterating his appeal for peace and disarmament.Francis is prone to lung infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.He has suffered ill health in recent years and has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. Speculation over an imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanThe papacyItalyCatholicismChristianityEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said its attack followed extensive intelligence and used precise munitions to minimise harm at the site.Hamas said a member of its political office, Ismail Barhoum, had been killed.‘There was just wave after wave’: Gaza doctors recount horror of the last weekRead moreIsrael’s defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the target was Barhoum. The military did not name the target, which it described only as “a key terrorist” in Hamas.Hamas’s al-Aqsa TV said Barhoum was being treated at the hospital for wounds sustained in a previous attack. Israel says Hamas systematically embeds personnel in hospitals, schools and shelters, which the group denies.Video on social media showed a fire blazing on the third storey of what appeared to be the hospital. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.After two months of relative calm in the war, Palestinians in Gaza have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Hamas.Another leader in Hamas, Salah al-Bardaweel, was killed in a separate strike in Khan Younis, Hamas said earlier. The Israeli military confirmed it had killed Bardaweel on Saturday.Both Bardaweel and Barhoum were members of the 19-member Hamas decision-making body, the political office, 11 of whom have been killed since the start of the war in late 2023, according to Hamas sources.Explosions echoed throughout the north, central and southern Gaza Strip early on Sunday, as Israeli planes hit targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attacks that began earlier in the week.Signalling it could escalate its actions further, the Israeli military said on Sunday one of its divisions that had operated in Lebanon, where Israel had fought Hamas’s Iranian-backed ally, Hezbollah, was preparing for possible action in Gaza.It distributed video of tanks unloaded in a field and a caption that read: “Preparations of the 36th Division for Operations in the Gaza Strip.”At least 45 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli strikes on Rafah and Khan Younis so far on Sunday, Gaza health authorities said.Palestinian officials on Sunday put the death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict at more than 50,000.The Israeli military said it did its best to reduce harm to civilians and questioned the death toll provided by health authorities in the Hamas-run territory.Most of the dead in Gaza have been civilians, according to health officials. Israel said they included about 20,000 fighters. Hamas does not disclose casualty figures.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said the aim of the war was to destroy Hamas as a military and governing entity. The ambition of the new campaign was to force the group to give up remaining hostages, he said on Tuesday.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke to Netanyahu to “emphasise US support for Israel”, a state department spokesperson said. They discussed Israel’s continuing military operations in Gaza, efforts to bring hostages home and US strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, the spokesperson added.Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.“Israel’s military offensive has caused an appalling loss of life,” said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. “As long as this war continues, both sides lose.”Kallas added Israel must respect civilian lives and that threats to annex parts of Gaza were unacceptable.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaHamasMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, Palestinian officials said the total death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict had passed 50,000.An airstrike in the city of Khan Younis on Sunday killed Salah Bardawil, a member of Hamas’s political leadership bureau, and the Israel Defense Forces (issued new evacuation orders to Palestinians in areas west of the city of Rafah on the border with Egypt, the target of a major offensive about a year ago, and where the IDF is pressing ground operations.The orders specified that movement in vehicles would not be permitted. There have been many reported incidents of civilians being killed or badly injured in attacks by Israeli forces on cars inGazain recent days. “The IDF has launched an operation to dismantle terrorist organisations. You are currently in a dangerous combat zone. Distance yourself from the combat zone immediately,” the orders said.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian boy at the site of an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Younis on Sunday.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersAt least 19 Palestinians were killed overnight, according to medical officials on Sunday. Two hospitals in southern Gaza said they had received 17 bodies from strikes, including those of several women and children. The toll did not include the Hamas official and his wife.Later on Sunday, Israel’s military said troops had encircled Tal al-Sultan refugee camp in Rafah, adding that their objective was to “dismantle terrorist infrastructure and eliminate” militants there.To date in the war – triggered by an attack by Hamas militants into Israel in October 2023 in which they killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages – more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, also mostly civilians, and about 113,000 wounded, say officials.Israel, which has accused Hamas of systematically looting aid, cut off supplies to Gaza hours after the first phase of a supposed three-stage ceasefire expired. Hamas denies the charge.Gaza’s ceasefire brought hope, but it was the calm before a brutal stormRead moreAid officials said distributions would be reduced gradually if possible, while the provision of community kitchens that feed about a million people would get progressively more difficult.“At some point we will just run out and things will get desperate … but even if we had supplies it would be very difficult to distribute them because the security environment means we can’t operate,” said one UN official based in Gaza.Six out of 23 bakeries operated by the UN World Food Programme have already been shut due to a lack of cooking gas, while Unrwa, the main UN agency with responsibility for Palestinians’ welfare, had stocks of about 60,000 bags of flour on Friday, enough for just six days of distribution.Prices for the limited amount of food still available in shops and markets have soared and are now unaffordable for almost everyone. Potatoes cost the equivalent of $6 (£4.60) a kg, five times more than a month ago, while cooking gas cylinders are selling for $60 a kg, four times higher than before the end of the fragile pause in hostilities three weeks ago.“It is very clear that people are underweight. The population is very young, and children need nutritious food,” said Khamis Elessi, a senior consultant doctor in Gaza City.Feroze Sidhwa, a US-based volunteer emergency doctor in Gaza, said the consequences of 18 months of poor diet were very evident among his patients. “We see very clearly that everyone has lost weight … I can see my surgical incisions are not healing well,” he said.Aid distribution has been hindered by displacement. “There is a lot of anxiety about what will happen, especially parents for their children. It is non-stop: evacuation orders, explosions, the hospitals are filled with casualties, we are now seeing food scarcity. It is very unpredictable,” said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson in Gaza for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).“We can hear massive explosions most of the day. Reports of casualties are received every hour but the first responders cannot reach all the sites of attacks because it is too dangerous or they have not enough fuel for ambulances.”In the southern city Rafah on Sunday, Palestinian men, women and children could be seen walking along a dirt road and carrying their belongings in their arms. Most of Gaza’s population have had to flee within the territory, often multiple times. “It’s displacement under fire,” said Mustafa Gaber, a local journalist on the move with his family. “There are wounded people among us. The situation is very difficult.”Israeli media questioned on Sunday whether the aims of the new offensive were limited to destroying Hamas and returning the hostages held in Gaza – the two goals often cited by the Israeli government.On Friday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said in a statement that he had “instructed the IDF to seize additional territories in Gaza, evacuate the population, and expand the security zones around Gaza in order to defend the Israeli towns and IDF troops”.“The longer Hamas continues to refuse to release the hostages, the more territory it will lose that will be added to Israel,” Katz said.On Saturday, Israel’s cabinet approved a proposal to set up a new directorate tasked with advancing what it framed as the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians, in line with Donald Trump’s proposal to depopulate Gaza and rebuild it as the “riviera of the Middle East”. Legal experts said any such policy would almost certainly be a violation of international law.Katz said the new body would be “subject to Israeli and international law” and coordinate “passage by land, sea and air to the destination countries”.Israel has been roiled by massive protests, with more than 100,000 demonstrating against efforts by Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, to fire boththe head of the internal security service, Ronen Bar, and the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara.Bar as the head of the Shin Bet has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including allegations of leaking classified documents to foreign media and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas. Baharav-Miara, who has frequently clashed with the government, warned the prime minister he could not fire domestic intelligence’s chief before her office had reviewed his motives for doing so.In an unprecedented step on Sunday, after accusing her of blocking the government’s policies, Israel’s cabinet voted unanimously in favour of a no-confidence motion against Baharav-Miara.The cabinet’s decision was condemned by opposition parties and thousands of protesters who took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the sixth day in row, who described Netanyahu’s move as an attempt to undermine Israel’s democratic system.During clashes with the police, three protesters were arrested outside Netanyahu’s residence in central Jerusalem.There are also widespread calls for the return of the hostages to be prioritised over the offensive against Hamas.On Friday, 40 freed hostages who were in Hamas captivity and 250 family members of Israeli soldiers and civilians still held in Gaza signed a letter calling on Netanyahu to halt Israel’s “endless war”.In the agreedceasefire’s first phase, 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone – allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remained of their homes – and there was a surge in humanitarian aid.The sides were supposed to begin negotiations in early February on the scheduled second phase of the truce, in which Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages – 35 of whom are believed to be dead – in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent end to hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal.Israel backed out of the ceasefire agreement, offering instead to extend the first phase by between 30 and 60 days if Hamas released more hostages.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military said it was intercepted with no casualties or damage.The attacks came after Israel carried out a strike in Tyre, south Lebanon, on Saturday, killing one and wounding seven people and endangering the shaky truce that ended a year-long conflict againstHezbollah, as 40 survivors of Hamas captivity called on the Israeli government to halt the “endless war”.The strike on a building came after Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes inLebanonon Saturday, its most intense aerial assault on the country in four months. In total, six people were killed, including a child, and 28 injured, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.InGaza, Hamas and Palestinian media said on Sunday that an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis killed Salah al-Bardaweel, a Hamas political leader. Pro-Hamas media said the airstrike killed Bardaweel, a member of its political office, and his wife. Israeli officials had no immediate comment. The European and Kuwaiti hospitals in southern Gaza said they had received 17 bodies from strikes over Saturday night into Sunday, including several women and children.Israel’s Lebanon strikes were its deadliest there since the 27 November ceasefire which had put an end to 13 months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The strike on Tyre, in particular, one of the largest cities in south Lebanon and far from the Lebanese border, was a major escalation and threatened to upend the fragile ceasefire agreement.An Israeli military spokesperson said it had targeted “attack command headquarters, terrorist operatives, missile launchers, and a weapons depot of the terrorist Hezbollah”.The wave of Israeli airstrikes was triggered by the launching of three rockets from Lebanon by unknown groups, which were intercepted by the Israeli air force.In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Hezbollah denied any involvement in the rocket attacks and stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. It added that Israeli claims that it was behind the strikes were “merely a pretext for continued attacks on Lebanon”.Thousands return to southern Lebanon amid uneasy ceasefireRead moreA variety of Palestinian factions, as well as other armed groups, operate in southern Lebanon and not all are under Hezbollah’s command. Both the Israeli military and the Lebanese Ministry of Defence said it was investigating who could have fired the rockets.The Lebanese army said it found and dismantled what it called three “primitive rocket launchers” in south Lebanon after the rocket fire towards Israel. Pictures released by the army showed fragments of bombs and three wooden posts dug into the earth, seemingly used in the launching of the rockets.Lebanon’s minister of defence, Michel Menassa, said the country was “continuing its diplomatic, political and military efforts to ensure Lebanon’s sovereignty”.The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, warned of a severe response to the rocket fire, which was shot at the Israeli border village of Metula.“Metula and Beirut will be treated the same. The Lebanese government is fully responsible for any fire originating from its territory,” Katz said.View image in fullscreenAn Israeli soldier stands above the Israeli border town of Metula.Photograph: Avi Ohayon/ReutersThe ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has stopped full-scale military hostilities between the two warring parties, though Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Lebanon despite the truce. Israel has maintained that it reserves the right to unilaterally enforce any violations of the ceasefire in Lebanon and has continued to strike what it says are Hezbollah targets across the country.Hezbollah launched rockets near an Israeli military post in the week after the establishment of the ceasefire, but otherwise has not attacked Israel since. The group has been severely weakened after its war with Israel, with most of its senior leadership dead, thousands of its fighters killed and its weapons stock depleted.The Lebanese prime minister, Nawaf Salam, warned on Saturday that renewed military operations in south Lebanon could risk dragging the country back into war and urged the ministry of defence to ensure that the Lebanese state, rather than Hezbollah, decides whether Lebanon goes to war.Unifil, the UN peacekeeping force that monitors the Israel-Lebanon border, warned against further military escalation that could lead to the ceasefire being broken.“The situation remains extremely fragile and we encourage both sides to uphold their commitments,” it said in a statement on Saturday.In Israel, several thousand protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday, blocking key highways across the country in a demonstration against Netanyahu’s government.The immediate trigger for the anger was the government’s attemptto dismissRonen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, a move described as an attempt to undermine Israel’s democratic system, but the prime minister’s decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has also fuelled the demonstrations.Forty freed hostages of Hamas captivity and 250 family members of Israeli soldiers and civilians still held in Gaza signed a letter on Friday calling on Netanyahu to halt Israel’s renewed military activities and return to the negotiating table in order to secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages who are still in the territory. In a letter sent to the prime minister, they warned that failure to do so would condemn the living hostages to death.“This letter was written in blood and tears,” the text reads. ‘‘It was drafted by our friends and families whose loved ones were killed and murdered in captivity and who are crying out: ‘Stop the fighting. Return to the negotiating table and fully complete an agreement that will return all of the hostages, even at the cost of ending the war’.”The signatories attacked the government for “choosing an endless war over saving and returning the hostages, and by doing that, sacrificing them. This is a criminal policy – you do not have a mandate to sacrifice 59 people.’’The letter comes as Israel’s defence minister on Friday said he had instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas released Israeli hostages still held in the devastated territory.Israeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrowHamasor face the consequences.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers stand at the Israeli side of the Israel-Lebanon border.Photograph: Avi Ohayon/Reuters“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”Gaza’s civil defence agency said more than 500 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas’s attack on Israel.A three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.Instead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.On Saturday, the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, called on Hamas to relinquish power in order to safeguard the “existence” of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.“Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men,” Fatah spokesperson Monther al-Hayek said in a message sent to AFP, urging the militant group to “step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians’ existence” if it remains in power in Gaza.Hamassaid on Friday it was still debating Witkoff’s proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt.The intense fighting comes as Netanyahu is locked in a fierce battle with Israel’s judicial system after the supreme court blocked his attempt to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, who has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.Amidprotests against ministers’ vote to sack Bar, the top court on Friday froze the decision, with the order remaining in place until the court can hear petitions filed by the opposition and an NGO against the dismissal.Netanyahu said in a post on X that “the government ofIsraelwill decide” who headed the domestic security agency, writing: “The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”About 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.Explore more on these topicsIsraelLebanonGazaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

This cycle of violence must end.”Amen’s sister Delina Teklay, 17, previously told BBC Scotland that her brother hoped to gain UK citizenship and become a doctor or engineer. She said: “This was very unexpected and shocking for us. I just think this is a dream and I’m going to wake up tomorrow. I’m still in denial.”The 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with Amen’s murder and assault, while the 15-year-old was charged with assault.Police said the 16-year-old will appear in court in due course, and that a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.Explore more on these topicsUK newsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

On 11 February 2023 they lured Brianna to a park in Cheshire where she was stabbed 28 times with a hunting knife.Both were jailed for lifewith a minimum term of 22 years for Jenkinson and 20 years for Ratcliffe. The court heard the killerswere partly motivatedby Brianna’s transgender identity.The 75-minute documentary celebrates Brianna’s life and features interviews with three of her friends, who describe the schoolgirl as kind, chatty and funny. It also explores her death and issues around online safety.View image in fullscreenThe 75-minute film celebrates Brianna Ghey’s life and features interviews with three of her friends.Photograph: Family Handout/PABrianna, who had thousands of followers on TikTok, struggled with her mental health, which was worsened by accessing eating disorder and self-harm content on X.From the age of 14, one of her killers, Jenkinson, enjoyed watching videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers.At a screening in London, Ghey said one of the reasons she had chosen to take part in the documentary was to “get answers” from social media companies about safety.Last year,Australia passed a law aiming to ban under-16s from social media. Ghey said she supported such a ban.“It is an absolute cesspit,” she said of social media. “Even if, say, I do an interview, and I’ll try not to look at comments, but I can never help myself, and I’ll look at the comments, and you’ll see people saying about my child, trying to tell me what gender my child was, and also really, really horrific comments too.“When you report things, the support isn’t there.”Ghey added: “I’ve reported so many comments, and I always get the response that they haven’t done anything wrong, that it’s not something that they can take down, and our children have access to those comments.“No matter how much love and compassion you pump into your child when you’re bringing them up, and how much empathy you can teach them, they will go online and they’ll see the way that other people are speaking about other people and they might think that that’s right.”In the documentary, Ghey meets Arturo Béjar, aformer engineering director at Meta, who testified before Congress about child safety on the tech company’s platforms. He tells her that people are “defenceless” against harmful algorithms.At the screening Ghey expressed hope that any social media company would not put “lives before profit”.Ghey foundedPeace & Mind UKto raise funds to teach mindfulness in schools. Her recently published memoir on her and Brianna’s lives, which explores how deadly social media can be, wasdescribed by the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstoneas “one of the most unflinching, inspirational autobiographies I’ve read, a remarkable cry of hope from the depths of despair”.Meta, X and TikTok have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYoung peopleInternet safetyChildrenViolence against women and girlsDigital mediaTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

There will never be another era like it again.”The broadcaster, who is now a presenter on Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, said that the show gave him “incredible memories that will stay with me forever” and “took a chance on me” when he had no experience.Reacting to Thomas’s post on X, Bacon wrote that he “loved” Blue Peter, and said “being live is what made it alive”.“I remember walking from one side of the studio to the other – doing a piece to camera – and seeing the whole crew, five cameras, and another on a crane, track with me,” he wrote.“I know that doesn’t sound like much – but the first time it happened it was mind-blowing. It was just a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well-resourced live kids TV show.“That had been live in that building for decades. It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).”Bacon was sacked from Blue Peter in the 1990s, after admitting drug taking, but did return, receiving a Blue Peter badge on the 60th anniversary.A BBC spokesperson said: “Blue Peter won’t just be available to view online and will remain on the CBBC and BBC Two linear channels, as well as BBC iPlayer and sign zone.Yvette Fielding looks back: ‘Blue Peter gave me balls of steel – it’s helped me deal with lots of backstabbing people in TV’Read more“The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change.“Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.“As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.”The current lineup of presenters include Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterTelevisionBBCChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, have visited China since taking office.Government ‘absolutely up for the fight’ over net zero, Ed Miliband saysRead moreConcern has long been expressed that Chinese-manufactured solar panels likely to be bought by Great British Energy are made using Uyghur slave labour, a charge the Chinese government rejects. China dominates the solar panel market.Labour ministers say Great British Energy will already be empowered, and indeed be required, by law to root out slavery anywhere in its supply chain.Ministers also say a pre-existing solar taskforce co-chaired by Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, is charged with addressing the issue. But Lyons said: “A decade ago the UK led the way setting new standards in the fight against modern slavery. Today we have fallen behind.”The business and trade select committee warned recently the UK is at serious risk of becoming a dumping ground for products made with forced labour: “It is well evidenced that the renewable sector is heavily dependent on companies sourcing from areas like Xinjiang in China, and that forced labour is endemic in the region through involuntary labour transfer schemes. The Great British Energy Bill provides an ideal vehicle to ensure that the green transition is not built on the back of contemporary slaves.”Sobel said: “The UK has been crystal clear that the UK will not tolerate slave-made goods and appreciates more must be done to root them out. Great British Energy provides us with the opportunity to not only pursue our green transition but bolster our national security, but only if we are to reduce our dependence on China.“Ensuring our solar supply chains are free from slavery would also see the UK take a leading position on human rights, as a force for good.GB Energy needs full £8.3bn of funding or it will disappoint, government toldRead more“We have listened to the government arguments and tabled an amendment which would provide a practical solution to this issue, assuring we are aligned with actions in Europe and the US.”The amendment passed by 177 votes to 127 in the Lords and has Conservative support, as well as the backing of the Labour peer and human rights barrister Helena Kennedy.Lord Offord, a former Conservative exports minister, said: “The UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires companies to take responsibility for their supply chains, yet we know that modern slavery remains a serious issue in the global energy sector, particularly in the sourcing of solar panels, batteries and raw materials such as lithium and cobalt.“This amendment does not create unnecessary bureaucracy or hinder investment; it simply ensures that taxpayers’ money does not fund exploitation.”In opposition Labour backed moves to declare China’s actions in Xinjiang genocide and to block trade deals with countries found by UK courts to have committed genocide.But in a speech last week Lammy said he had asked the Foreign Office “to turbo-charge the relationships which will generate the greatest returns on investment for UK plc in the medium-term. At the top of that list stands the EU, China and the United States of America”.He called for pragmatic engagement with China, cooperating on climate change goals without endangering UK national security. He said future ambassadors “will in priority markets be assessed against their delivery of trade and investment wins overseas”.Explore more on these topicsModern slaverySolar powerLabourChinaEnergyRenewable energyPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

The Fish Hook fire, which scorched 1,713 acres, was 50% contained.All are burning about 30 miles south-east of Ashville, according to the North Carolina forest service, in an area where Hurricane Helene swept through in September. The downed trees leftover from the hurricane, as well as low humidity and dry vegetation, are helping to fuel the fires which ignited last week, officials said.“It’s not just the high winds, the low humidity, the steep terrain, but they’re also dealing with storm debris that’s blocking UTV trails, regular roads, and them just getting in on foot because we have so many trees down,” Cannon toldCBS affiliate WSPA.Dense smoke from the wildfires spurred a “code red” air quality alert for Polk county. The North Carolina forest servicewarned in a social media postthat all residents should avoid prolonged exposure or heavy exertion outdoors.Cannon said the residents of Polk county are “extremely resilient” after enduring Helene and the last round of wildfires earlier this month.North Carolina was under a statewide burn ban during the critical fire weather. The state’s forest service reminded residents that the ban is remaining in place until further notice.The threat of wildfires was felt in neighboringSouth Carolinawhere Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday as part of an effort to stop a blaze in Pickens county called the Table Rock fire that started on Friday night and quickly spread to 35 acres, McMaster said.By Sunday, the South Carolina forestry commissionwas reportingthat the fire had grown to 300 acres and was 0% contained.“As this wildfire continues to spread, the State of Emergency allows us to mobilize resources quickly and ensure our firefighters have the support they need to protect lives and property,” McMaster said in a statement that reinforced a statewide outdoor burning ban issued on Friday by the South Carolina forestry commission.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US is pushing for a broad ceasefire in Russia’s war in Ukraine by 20 April, according toBloomberg,though sources said the timeline may slip given the wide gap that exists between Kyiv and Moscow’s positions.On Sunday, the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, appeared upbeat about working with the Russian president,Vladimir Putin, to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since the second world war. “I feel that he wants peace,” Witkoff told Fox News.This week’s talks are expected to delve into the details of implementing the 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure, and potentially expand into shipping in the Black Sea.“I think you’re going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries,” said Witkoff. “And from that you’ll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire.”Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said after the meeting that the talks were “constructive”, adding that the energy sector was a key focus of the negotiations.“The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy,” he said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a “just and lasting peace” a reality.Earlier on Sunday, the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said that the US was also talking through a range of confidence-building measures, including the future of Ukrainian children taken intoRussia.The Kremlin, however, swiftly poured cold water on hopes for a rapid resolution, saying that “difficult negotiations” lie ahead. “We are only at the beginning of this path,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV on Sunday.Peskov said the “main” focus in its talks with the US would be a possible resumption of a 2022 Black Sea grain deal, brokered by Turkey and the UN, that ensured safe navigation for Ukrainian farm exports via the Black Sea.Moscow pulled out of the deal in 2023, amid accusations that the west had failed to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s exports of farm produce and fertilisers.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Witkoff, a real estate developer who had no prior diplomatic experience before being tasked as Donald Trump’s special envoy, downplayed fears of Vladimir Putin launching a broader aggression.“I just don’t see that he wants to take all of Europe,” he said. “I take him at his word in this sense, so, and I think the Europeans are beginning to come to that belief, too. But it sort of doesn’t matter. That’s an academic issue … The agenda is, stop the killing, stop the carnage. Let’s end this thing.”Last week Putin agreed to Trump’s proposal for a 30-day halt on attacks to energy infrastructure. The ceasefire, however, was cast into doubt soon after, with both sides reporting continued strikes.Ukrainian officials said on Sunday that at least seven people were killed overnight after Russia launched 147 drones. Ukrainian air defences shot down 97 of the drones, and 25 others were hindered by Ukrainian countermeasures.Three people, including a five-year-old child, were killed in Kyiv, while four people were killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Donetsk region.Russian troops reportedly seized the small village of Sribne in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, while Ukraine’s army said its troops had recaptured the small village of Nadia in the eastern Luhansk region.Russian officials said Sunday that their air defences had destroyed 59 Ukrainian drones targeting the country’s southwestern regions, noting that the strikes had killed one person in Rostov.This week’s talks come on the heels of a wide-ranging interview with the former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, in which Witkoff detailed his admiration for Putin, who launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and scorned the UK’s prime minister.Witkoff said he “liked” the Russian president – “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy … He’s super smart”, he said – while he dismissed Keir Starmer’s readiness to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine post-ceasefire as “a combination of a posture and a pose”.Witkoff, who is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine, described Starmer’s idea as “simplistic” adding: “I think there’s this, you know, this sort of notion of we’ve all got to be like Winston Churchill, the Russians are gonna march across Europe. I think that’s preposterous. By the way, we have something called Nato that we did not have in World War II.”Witkoff also asserted that Kyiv had “agreed” to holdelections,though he offered no further details or backing for the claim. Ukraine’s constitutionbars national electionsfrom being held during a period of martial law, while, logistically speaking, any outcome risks being marred by disruptions from air raids, potential attacks on crowded polling stations and the Russian occupation of some regions.When asked about the upcoming talks, however, Witkoff said the “central issue” was the Ukrainian regions that had been annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces. He stumbled, however, in trying to name them.“The largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, Donbas, Crimea, you know the names and there are two others,” said Witkoff, in remarks that appeared to be an attempt to name Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson and that confusedCrimeafor one of the four occupied eastern territories.Earlier this month, Volodymyr Zelenskyystressedthat Ukraine would not recognise any occupied territories – where Russiawas accused of holding sham pollsin 2022 in a bid to provide cover for their illegal annexation – as Russian.Witkoff appeared to side with the Kremlin as he cited the largely discredited polls as evidence of local sentiment on the ground and conflated the locally spoken language with support for Russia.“They’re Russian-speaking,” Witkoff said of the four eastern regions. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”In 2022, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections,said the referendumshad not met international standards and had been held in areas where much of the population had fled and which were not secure, while there has been no evidence to suggest that Russian-speaking areas are more favourable to Russian rule.Witkoff continued: “The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Can Zelenskyy survive politically if he acknowledges this?”Witkoff, who met Putin earlier this month in Moscow, told Carlson that the meeting “got personal”, as Putin had commissioned “a beautiful portrait” of Trump from a “leading Russian artist” for Witkoff to take home to the US president.Putin also told Witkoff of his reaction to thefailed assassinationattempt against Trump. “He went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president – not because he was the president of the United States or could become the president of the United States – but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend,” said Witkoff.“And I came home and delivered that message to our president and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,” he added.His comments were swiftly slammed by the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum. “If you ever wondered how the KGB manipulated foreigners and got them to repeat Soviet propaganda, spend some time listening to Steve Witkoff talk about his wonderful conversations with Vladimir Putin,” she wrote on social media.Witkoff went on to assert that the Russians had now obtained what they had hoped for when they launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose, exactly? They don’t need to absorb Ukraine,” he said. “They’ve gotten – they’ve reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they’ve gotten what they want. So why do they need more?”Instead he envisioned a global stage where the US and Russia could build on the ceasefire to normalise relations and join forces in areas such as energy policies in the Arctic, sea lanes, LNG supplies to Europe and artificial intelligence. “Who doesn’t want to have a world where Russia and the United States are doing, collaboratively, good things together?” he asked.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There were approximately 200 people at the park when the shooting occurred.Late on Saturday, policesaidin a statement on Facebook that they arrested one 20-year-old adult, Tomas Rivas, and one 17-year-old juvenile for their involvement and charged both with three open counts of murder. Then on Sunday, a third suspect – another 17-year-old boy – wasalso arrestedand charged with three counts of murder. More charges for all three suspects are reportedly pending.Police on Saturday shared the identities of the victims: Andrew Madrid, 16; Jason Gomez, 18; and Dominick Estrada, 19. Madrid and Gomez died on scene, according to police.The other 15 victims injured in the shooting range in age from 16-36. Of the 15 victims, nine are male and six are female, police said, but did not release their names publicly.In a statement on Facebook earlier on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.Police added that casings had been located “throughout the park and parking lot” and that “all the casings located so far are handgun caliber casings”.One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy, whose parked car was struck by bullets,toldthe New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp,wroteon Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Grisham, has alsoissueda statement, saying: “The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising. This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.”Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Such data has historically been considered sensitive and thereby closely guarded, so the reported deal has raised alarm bells at the IRS, according to theWashington Post.The IRSwebsitesays that undocumented immigrants “are subject to US taxes despite their illegal status”, and because most are unable to get social security numbers, the agency allows them to file with individual taxpayer numbers, known as ITINs. The agency also subjects them to the same reporting and withholding obligations as it does to US citizens who receive the same kind of income. More than half of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US file income tax returns to document their payments to the government.While the IRS mandates that taxpayer information is protected, section 6103 on the agency’swebsiteoutlines that “under court order, return information may be shared with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws.” However, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that it would be rare for these privacy law exceptions to be weaponized for cooperation with immigration enforcement and that this is outside of standard procedure.The potential shift in taxpayer data use, from once being used to rarely build criminal cases to now reportedly becoming instrumental in enforcing criminal penalties, aligns with many of the more aggressive immigration policies Trump is pursuing.During his campaign,Trumppromised to deport millions of undocumented people in the US, and the reports of this new deal shine a light on how he is planning on doing so. Since becoming president, he has ended legal pathways for immigrants to come and stay in the US.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said onFridaythey would revoke the temporary legal status of more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicararguans and Venezuelans, and Ice raids and enforcement operations have been commonplace in major cities across the US – like Chicago and New York – with high immigrant populations.And on Sunday, members of the Trump administration defended using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport the 137 Venezuelan migrants last weekend on the grounds that they were committing violent crimes and sending money back to Venezuela. The administration deported the migrants despite a judge’s verbal orders telling them not to do so.The border czar Tom Homan said in an interview with ABC News that the administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges over its invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members.“I don’t care what the judges think as far as this case,” Homan told ABC, referring to a federal judge’s efforts to determine whether the administration already ignored an earlier order to temporarily halt deportations.The attorney general, Pam Bondi, also addressed the deportations in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, calling the fight against the alleged gang members was akin to “modern day warfare”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However three hours after the flag, and in the wake of the usual post‑race inspection of the cars to ensure they are in compliance with regulations, Ferrari were found wanting over two clearly defined rules.The skid block on the floor of Hamilton’s car was deemed to have been 0.5mm below the limit, and Leclerc’s car was 1kg below the minimum weight requirement. Both drivers and team representatives were summoned to the stewards and afterwards theFormula Onegoverning body, the FIA, confirmed Ferrari had admitted culpability. “The team acknowledged that there were no mitigating circumstances and that it was a genuine error,” its findings read.Piastri wins F1 Chinese GP but woe for Ferrari as Hamilton and Leclerc disqualifiedRead moreBoth drivers were disqualified andFerrariissued a statement conceding their errors. “Car 16 [Leclerc’s] was found to be underweight by 1kg and car 44’s rearward skid wear was found to be 0.5mm below the limit. We will learn from what happened today and make sure we don’t make the same mistakes again. Clearly it’s not the way we wanted to end our Chinese GP weekend.”The margins for error are fine in both cases and teams will always look to come as close to the limit as possible for performance purposes, but Ferrari acknowledged they had incorrectly calculated the expected wear in Hamilton’s case. “With regard to Lewis’s skid wear, we misjudged the consumption by a small margin,” the team stated. “There was no intention to gain any advantage.”Ferrari argued that Leclerc had been caught out when the team opted to switch to a one-stop from a planned two‑stop strategy, which affected their pre-race weight calculations. “Charles was on a one-stop strategy today and this meant his tyre wear was very high, causing the car to be underweight,” Ferrari said in their statement. Other teams, including McLaren and Mercedes, also switched strategy mid-race without breaching the regulations.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneFerrariLewis HamiltonCharles LeclercMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The American pumped her poles after glancing at the scoreboard as the crowd roared in approval. Vonn becomes the oldest female Alpine ski racer to step on the podium of a World Cup race – by six years.“As much as I love skiing, it’s been a hard road,” Vonn said after the race. “I just continue to prove that anything is possible. I’ve been knocked down so many times in my life personally, physically, mentally, beat down and I always pick myself back up. It’s not always easy.“It’s actually really hard work. But that’s what it takes, putting one foot in front of the other and getting through the hard days. When you keep putting one foot in front of the other, it leads you to a place like today.”It was Vonn’s first World Cup podium spot since March 2018, when she finished third in a super-G in Are, Sweden. Vonn came out of retirement this season after a partial knee replacement. “Call me naive, but I believe in the impossible,” she said when firstannouncing her comeback.Lindsey Vonn’s ‘impossible’ comeback roars on with 2026 Olympics in frameRead moreIt was Vonn’s 138th career World Cup podium in her 408th World Cup start. She is within one of tying the most starts by a female racer, a mark held by Renate Goetschl of Austria.Vonn says she hopes to race for Team USA at next year’s Winter Olympics before retiring for good. “It’s been a rough season of people saying that I can’t, that I’m too old, that I’m not good enough anymore. I think I proved everyone wrong,” Vonn, who has three Olympic medals to her name, said on Sunday.Gut-Behrami finished in a time of one minute and 12.35 seconds – edging Vonn by 1.29 seconds – to earn the season-long super-G crystal globe by overtaking Italian racer Federica Brignone. Gut-Behrami trailed by five points heading into Sunday’s race. Gut-Behrami found plenty of speed and took some calculated risks to glide through the course. Brignone finished third, 1.33 seconds behind the time of Gut-Behrami.The final season-long super-G standings ended up with Gut-Behrami in first, Brignone in second and Sofia Goggia of Italy in third.“She’s Lindsey Vonn,” Brignone said. “She’s not somebody coming back from another injury. She has qualities and she’s an amazing champion. Today, she put all the pieces [together] and did an amazing race.”On Saturday, Brignone officially clinched the downhill discipline after the race was canceled, along with the the overall title.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 32-year-old said she was flooded with a range of emotions after her second-place finish on Saturday behind Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu, who won gold.“It’s been a long journey,” Houlihan said in an interview withletsrun.com. “I’m excited for today and now, but also kind of grieving the past a bit. It’s just been a real tough journey.”Ingebrigtsen secures double gold and GB athletes enjoy day of redemptionRead moreIn the lead-up to Olympic trials in 2021, Houlihan revealed she had tested positive for nandralone and claimed it came from a tainted pork burrito. A slew of appeals ensued, but Houlihan’s argumentwas ultimately rejectedby the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Houlihan’s case divided opinion, mainly because many elements of it were similar to “no fault” cases that often result in athletes receiving little or no penalty. Houlihan, whose case was prosecuted by the internationalAthleticsIntegrity Unit, received no such leniency and spent the prime of her career on the sideline.After her second-place finish in Nanjing, China, she reflected on the journey that led to her comeback. She said her first year out of the sport was the most difficult.“Getting used to completely trying to create a new normal,” Houlihan said. “Running had been part of my life since I was five, so who am I without this? I didn’t know. [I felt] totally crumbled and trying to rebuild myself back up.”She said “a ton of anger” was driving her at the time, but she realized she had to rein in her emotions. Houlihan said she is hopeful her success at the worlds in China will lead to a sponsorship deal. The world outdoor championships are in September, when Houlihan could shape up to be a factor in the 1500m or 5000m.“It got to a point where I was just like, ‘I don’t want to give up because I feel like I’ll always wonder what could have been,’” Houlihan said. “And then I feel like I still have more to prove. I feel like the best is yet to come for myself and I wanted to see that through and not let someone else decide.”The USfinished top of the medal tableat this year’s world indoor championships with six golds and 16 medals in total.Explore more on these topicsSportAthleticsDrugs in sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His aura of strength was such that there were times when it seemed as though he’d live for ever.People know about George Foreman the fighter and George Foreman the product pitchman; holding a small American flag in the ring after winning a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics; dethroning Joe Frazier in Jamaica; losing the title to Muhammad Ali in Zaire; the quixotic ring comeback that culminated in a 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer to reclaim the heavyweight crown; and George Foreman’s Lean Mean Grilling Machine, which earned him more than $100m. I lived through those times. But I was also privileged to know George as a person.George Foreman, boxing champion and entrepreneur, dies aged 76Read moreI met Foreman in December 1988 shortly after I began working with Ali on the book that would become Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times. I was in Las Vegas for the taping of a documentary titled Champions Forever. The producers had brought Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Larry Holmes and Ken Norton together to reminisce on camera. It was an opportunity for me to interview them.Foreman’s “second ring career” was under way by then. He had scored 13 victories against lacklustre opposition and shed the surly image of his younger days. But he seemed to have a more promising future as a preacher than a fighter. We talked about Ali for several hours. I liked George. That was the start of a friendship. In the decades that followed we talked many times, including conversations for values-oriented articles that I wrote: George Foreman on religion, George Foreman on character, George Foreman on family, George Foreman on setting an example. Each time, the generosity of Foreman’s spirit shone through.In talking about the surly persona of his younger years, George explained: “Sonny Liston had been heavyweight champion of the world. I’d see that title belt sitting there in his home and the way he treated people. I said: ‘I guess that’s the way you ought to be when you’re champion.’“I remember once, I was walking with Sonny and some of his people. We passed a woman who was kind of top-heavy and very good-looking. She was out with her husband. Sonny stopped and stared, very obvious like. Then he looked at the woman’s husband and said: ‘Yeah! I’m lookin’! Yeah! Yeah! What are you gonna do about it?!’ When Sonny said that, his people laughed. So there I am, 19 years old. I thought that’s the way a man is supposed to be. And I started being the same way. I picked up a lot of bad habits because I didn’t know they were bad habits. I thought they were just traits of being champion of the world.“When I left boxing for the first time, for a while it was hard. When you’re a famous athlete everyone is always giving things to you and doing things for you. In those 10 years [when I wasn’t fighting] I learned how to do things the hard way; things other people think of as simple. How to clean up after myself. How to stand in line and buy something in a store when I didn’t have much money and not be embarrassed. I gained a lot of weight. I’d go around the country preaching, not always dressed the best, and no one knew who I was. I wasn’t flying first class any more. I was in the cheapest economy seat I could buy.View image in fullscreenJoe Frazier, George Foreman and Muhammad Ali together in London in 1989.Photograph: Micheline Pelletier“One time I was on a plane and the stewardess came over to me and said: ‘Hey, big guy. That seat is kind of tight. After we take off, I’ll bring you up to first class. I can’t give you a meal there, but you’ll be more comfortable.’ And that meant a lot to me. I said to myself: ‘Hey, people are good. People are nice.’”We live in an age when many people of faith assert that their way is the only road to heaven. George was a born-again Christian and took his religion seriously. But he had an all-encompassing view of God’s love and told me: “Good is good, whether or not one believes in Jesus. To be good is to be saved. If I treat everybody nice, that’s religion.”After the article ran George told me: “I was criticised a lot by some people for saying that. But I had something to say and I’m glad I said it.”Other thoughts that George shared with me over the years included:“Character doesn’t just evolve on its own. It has to be acted upon every day of our lives. But now we’ve got a whole generation of young people, and another generation that’s not so young any more, who haven’t found anything in their lives to promote character. And that’s sad. Life is so brief. You have to do more than just try to have a good time. You have to ask yourself: ‘What am I giving to other people? What will I leave behind?’ It’s like a baton that we’re all passing on to future generations.”“For a lot of young people, character comes from who they imitate. I don’t like the phrase ‘role model’. It sounds too commercial to me. I’d rather talk about being an example. When I was young, I saw very few good examples. I saw a lot of sports heroes. When I look back on myself in my teens, I was like an empty bottle. Each day, I saw another [sports hero] I wanted to be like, walk like, talk like. If they’re not nice, don’t be nice. They buy fleets of cars. So when you make it, you should buy fleets of cars. Some of those guys were good people. But when I grew older and got to know them, a lot of them were downright nasty or stuck-up clowns.”“What I want to do most for other people is set a good example. All of us are examples in life. Parents are examples for their children. Ten-year-olds in school set an example that younger children follow. Sometimes you’re an example for someone else and you don’t even know it.”“I can’t stand it when a person puts labels on someone else. The fat guy … the stupid person … the gay guy … the ugly girl … the whatever … people are people. We’re all different, but we’re all the same.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I had a question I’d send him an email. Invariably he’d call or email back within 24 hours. Sometimes a telephone call or email from George arrived unexpected.We also talked often about Ali. A strong bond had developed between them. “We agreed that good is good and bad is bad,” George told me after Ali died. “And most people, whatever their religion is, or even if they don’t follow a particular religion, know the difference. When I’d hear his voice on the phone it would always bring me happiness. It seemed with us there was something greater than religion – a longing to love and belonging to each other, a thankfulness we had each other.”George kept a close eye on his money. He wasn’t an easy touch. But when the spirit moved him, he engaged in acts of extraordinary generosity. A woman who freelanced in a menial pre‑production job for HBO in Las Vegas fell on hard times. George heard about it and one day – completely unsolicited – handed her a cheque for $50,000. He quietly funded scholarships so that young men and women he barely knew could attend college. After the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, following the acquittal of police officers charged with beating Rodney King, most of the drug stores in the city’s south-central area shut down. George wrote a cheque for $1m to keep prescription drugs for the elderly flowing.View image in fullscreenGeorge Foreman, aged 42, against Evander Holyfield in April 1991. Foreman had Angelo Dundee (left) as his trainer and former light-heavyweight champion Archie Moore (right) also in his corner.Photograph: Amy Sancetta/APAbout a year ago, George was felled by an infection that attacked his kidneys and other organs. His weight dropped precipitously. For a while he needed a walker. He rallied. Then the inevitable happened.Life is a journey. It’s the process of becoming. In today’s world, more than ever, we need people of good will. People who value truth. People who believe in tolerance and understanding. People who care about the difference between right and wrong and do what’s right. George Foreman became that kind of person.After Ali died, George reflected on his death and the earlier deaths of Frazier and Norton, and told me: “I never did visualise a world without them. When they started passing, it hurt. It’s like a part of me died.” Then he added: “I don’t know what it will be like in heaven for Muhammad. But I can tell you one thing for sure: Muhammad had quite a life here on earth.”The same was true of George Foreman.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ForemanBoxingUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Pep Guardiola was unimpressed about losing John Stones to injurywhen the Manchester City defender started both of England’s friendlies against Brazil and Belgium last year.However, while Tuchel had a similar view to Guardiola when he worked at club level, he stressed his priorities have shifted and there will be no favours when it comes to managing his side’s physical demands.The 51-year-old coach, whose options on the wing have been limited byAnthony Gordon withdrawing from the squadafter sustaining a hip injury during England’s 2-0 win against Albania on Friday, pointed out that Arsenal overlooked a chance to rest Declan Rice in thesecond leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against PSV Eindhoven.“Given the fact Declan Rice played after a 7-1 first leg the next match with Arsenal, I didn’t have the feeling that they think so much about us,” Tuchel said.View image in fullscreenTuchel insisted he can fit Phil Foden (pictured) into a team with Jude Bellingham.Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock“So I don’t think we have to break our heads about this. I take care about the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players: ‘Hey, you have tough matches coming up so I rest you now.’ We have a qualifier to play, we do what’s good for us, we monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs and we won’t take any unprofessional risks.“I feel responsible for the players. I don’t want the player to be injured, I want the players to play quarter‑finals of the Champions League because I want to watch it. We take care about us and the clubs take care about themselves and the main focus is taking care of the players.”A more pressing issue for Tuchel is finding the right balance in attack. He has a glut of creative players but he cannot fit them all into the team. He warned that there would be some high‑profile omissions from his World Cup squad if they qualify.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is about our standards. How do we win, how do we play and how do we impose ourselves and deserve a win against Latvia? It’s to raise the standards.“There are a lot of No 10 positions. It’s just not possible we play all these No 10 positions. We have to get the process right to find the best group. If that means we leave very good and talented players out of the squad this can happen. In the next 16 months it is important we find the right team and not the most talented 26 players.”Tuchel said that Phil Foden, who struggled against Albania, is missing “confidence and flow” for club and country, yet he insisted that he can fit the City playmaker and Jude Bellingham into the same team, even though both want to play as No 10s.“One hundred per cent they can play together,” Tuchel insisted. “I don’t see one reason why they should not. The numbers of Phil are unbelievably good for Man City. They are not so good for the national team, so we need to try to build something to see the Phil Foden from Man City.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

Relegation to the second tier of theNations Leagueis no disaster for Scotland. Indeed, it may be their natural habitat. It is just that the calamitous circumstances in which Clarke’s men crashed out of League A were alarming for anybody with an affiliation to Scotland.Greece outfought, outthought and outplayed their hosts at Hampden Park. The tie was effectively over while the corporate classes were still shuffling back to their seats at the start of the second half.Greecedid not add to that third goal; it never looked as if they would need to.Resentment towards Clarke, unavoidable afterScotlandflopped at Euro 2024, had dissipated after a recent upturn in fortunes. Greece sent Clarke and Scotland spiralling several steps backwards. Ivan Jovanovic and his Greek players will be licking their lips at facing Scotland again on World Cup qualifying business.Scotland v Greece, Spain v Netherlands, Germany v Italy, and more: Nations League – liveRead moreThis was an evening when no part of the Scotland team performed even adequately. The hosts were overly generous in defence, wasteful in midfield and no threat whatsoever in attack.Clarke makes great play of the fact his squad contains great international experience. The flipside, as evidenced here, is that perhaps this is a team which has reached the end of their cycle. Clarke can reasonably argue there is no emerging batch of talent to draft in. The friendly matches against Iceland and Liechtenstein in June, three months before Scotland begin their World Cup quest, suddenly look rather important.“We didn’t play how we can play,” Clarke said. “We didn’t have enough energy in the team.On Thursday night in Greecewe defended as a team, from back to front. We didn’t do that tonight and were punished. This is a bump in the road. There are bumps in the road, it’s about how you react to them.”Clarke suggested the exertions of the first leg played a part in Scotland’s lethargy in game two. “I’ll go away and look at myself to see what I could have done better,” the Scotland manager said. “Maybe I didn’t make enough rotations. Maybe I could have made more to freshen the team up. We have to analyse it, park this tournament because we go down to League B and try to do better.”John McGinn was even more candid. The Scotland midfielder labelled this an “embarrassing” affair.The game had opened in rousing fashion. Tribute was paid tothe late Denis Law, with members of the Scotland icon’s family joining Sir Alex Ferguson pitchside. What Law would have made of what happened next is anybody’s guess. It was grisly, gruesome stuff for the Scots.“Wonderkid” is an overused term. In respect of Konstantinos Karetsas, it is perfectly apposite. The 17‑year‑old is such an elegant, creative force that Genk should enjoy him while he lasts; bigger clubs are casting admiring glances. In his first action of this clash he fed Georgios Vagiannidis on the right flank. The use of marauding full‑backs was a key Greek tactic that Scotland could not combat. Vagiannidis crossed for Giannis Konstantelias in blissful isolation inside the Scotland penalty area: Konstantelias slammed home to level the tie.Greece forged ahead on aggregate three minutes before the break. Karetsas endorsed his star quality with a curling finish after Konstantelias flicked the ball into his path. Andy Robertson, one of umpteen Scotland players who endured an awful evening, had been drawn towards the ball in leaving Karetsas totally unmarked.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Billy Gilmour was visibly irked at being substituted, sentiment shared a Scotland support which made its collective feelings plain. It took until the dying seconds of stoppage time for Konstantinos Tzolakis, the Greece goalkeeper, to make a save of note. By then, this stadium was largely empty. Any Scot who remained did so only to voice their displeasure at full time.“I had no doubt we could rise to the occasion,” Jovanovic said. Such an emphatic victory was, surely, beyond the coach’s wildest dreams.

After Erin Cuthbert’s late header won this contest and sent the away fans into raptures, there is a 15-point gap between Chelsea and fourth-placed City, who will feel aggrieved about one controversial first-half incident that might have altered the game’s course.WSL roundup: Arsenal thrash Liverpool thanks to Matthews’ damaging doubleRead moreLong before Cuthbert’s winner in the 91st minute, City were understandably baffled after Jess Park curled the ball into the top corner from just outside the penalty area only to realise the referee, Kirsty Dowle, had stopped play for a free-kick, moving to blow her whistle just as Park was connecting with her shot.“The officials admitted that they got it wrong and that they should have played on,” City’s interim head coach, Nick Cushing, said. “The frustrating thing for me is, about two or three minutes before, because we were so dangerous on the counterattack, when the whistle was blown [for a separate foul] I asked the fourth official to ask the referee to play advantage, and she said: ‘OK, I’ll pass that message on.’ Then three minutes later that happens.”Sonia Bompastor, the Chelsea manager, said: “I can understand their frustration. If I was the City manager I would probably be in the same place. But I don’t think it changed our belief going into the second half. We created a lot in the second half, 24 shots on goal, their keeper made really great saves. We could maybe have scored more.”A goal at that stage would have put City 2-0 up after Kerolin’s strike on 32 minutes. Instead, Chelsea survived and emerged after the break a completely different team.The defending champions levelled as Aggie Beever-Jones met Johanna Rytting Kaneryd’s cutback and supplied a quality finish into the bottom corner. What followed over the next 15 minutes was nothing short of an onslaught from Chelsea as they raced forward relentlessly with attack after attack, and Rytting Kaneryd began to dominate the contest.Quite how Chelsea did not score in that spell of pressure was unclear to everybody except perhaps the City goalkeeper Khiara Keating. First, she produced a terrific diving save to her left to keep out Wieke Kaptein’s effort. After Rytting Kaneryd had hit the post, Keating then did superbly well to make a low save at the feet of the same player, before stopping another close-range Kaptein shot.Keating went on to make another top-class save low to her left to keep out a powerful Lauren James strike in the closing stages, before Chelsea’s pressure told in stoppage time as Cuthbert’s header won the game for the visitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Twisting and weaving in front of a retreating Millie Bright, Kerolin eventually placed the ball through the defender’s legs and into the far corner.Shortly afterwards, Kerolin was running straight at Bright again. This time Bright did make a challenge, fouling the 25-year-old just inside the D, and as the ball rolled straight to Park for a first-time shot Dowle brought her whistle to her lips to award a free-kick, much to the bewilderment of Park, Cushing and almost everybody inside this stadium.The result was a second victory for Chelsea in the three consecutive games played between these sides in nine days, with the fourth in a row still to come on Thursday when Chelsea will need another comeback to overturn the two-goal deficit in the Champions League.

The 42-year-old’s side were also surprisinglyknocked out of the Champions League in the playoff round by PSV Eindhovenin February. Less than a week later, they exited the Coppa Italia, knocked out by Empoli after a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals.“Juventus FC announces that it has relieved Thiago Motta of his position as coach of the men’s first team,” read a club statement on Sunday. “Juventus FC also announces that it has entrusted the leadership of the men’s first team to Igor Tudor, who will direct the first training session tomorrow.”Motta was appointed as Juventus manager on a three-year contract in June after leading Bologna to Champions League qualification last season. Juve went 21 league games without defeat earlier in the campaign but in that period Motta’s team drew 13 matches, which meant they were never in the title race. The manager has paid the price for the recent heavy defeats, which have angered supporters.Since his arrival, Motta took a hard stance with players, with Federico Chiesa told he was not part of the manager’s plans before he was sold to Liverpool last August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gathered around the Resolute desk, constructed from the timbers of a British naval vessel, a series of pastors laid their hands on the president’s thinning hair and prayed for his success. The only other item on the desk? The enormous intricate bauble that will serve as the trophy for Fifa’sClub World Cup.That Trump should like the look of an object lacquered in 24-carat gold plating, and designed by the New York jeweller Tiffany & Co, is not perhaps a huge surprise. But its prominent position on the world’s most consequential desktop will surely have been welcomed by Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, who left the trophy with Trump this month on his visit to the White House, a week after Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s.Fifa to hand out $1bn prize pot at expanded Club World CupRead moreInfantino has a competition to sell after all. The Club World Cup is taking place in the US this summer and, as the countdown speeds up, key issues are yet to be resolved. With fewer than 100 days to go, tickets are still available for each match in the tournament, with many fixtures showing large areas of seating unsold. A groundbreaking global broadcast deal between Fifa and the streaming platform Dazn, meanwhile, has yet to translate into sublicensing arrangements with national broadcasters. There is also fury from other competition organisers – the Premier League included – over what is regarded as a landgrab and an imposition on a strained fixture calendar. At the same time, the Club World Cup stands a real chance of creating a paradigm shift in how club football is played.Upgraded and expanded from the competition that began in 2000, when eight regional champions faced off against each other in a knockout tournament, the Club World Cup this summer will feature 32 teams in a 63-match format that has group and knockout stages and will run for a month. Chelsea and Manchester City will compete, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Inter too. These giants will face off against lesser lights of the international game such as the 2022 African Champions League winners Wydad of Morocco and New Zealand’s Auckland City, who qualify by virtue of their ranking as the best club side in Oceania.That there are still a good number of tickets left at the 25,000-capacity Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando to watch Auckland play Benfica on 20 June should perhaps be expected. Ditto Manchester City against Al Ain at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta (even if it is an Abu Dhabi derby). But there are many tickets available for matches between more recognisably household names, too. As much as a third of the 20,000 Camping World Stadium in Orlando remains unsold for City v Juventus on 26 June, for example, while Inter Miami against Porto on 19 June looks like being way too small for that 75,000-capacity stadium in Atlanta, Messi-effect included. The pattern of lukewarm sales recurs across the knockout‑round ties.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi’s Inter Miami play Porto at a 75,000-seat stadium in Atlanta but there are fears attendance will be well under capacity.Photograph: Collin Reid/APFifa says that some matches are sold out, though the controversial process of authorised ticket resale in place for the tournament – whereby you can buy a ticket and instantly sell it on again for a new price on the same platform – means you can buy a seat all the same. It observes too that there is a higher demand in the new soccer hotbed of Florida than in other parts of the country. At the same time, however, it acknowledges it is trying to launch a tournament in a country where soccer is at best the fourth most popular sport, and at a time of year when the average American consumer has any number of possible entertainments from which to choose. Fifa intends to intensify its marketing in the coming weeks, hoping to sway those punters in their decisions, but must first find a replacement for one of its competitors, after theMexican side León were removedfrom the competition for a breach of Fifa’s rules on multiclub ownership.The sporting world is watching every shift in the cup’s development keenly; some with dread, others with anticipation. For Adam Kelly, president of the sports marketing giant IMG, there is no question that Fifa is undertaking the kind of project that audiences want to see, even if the risks are substantial.“I look at this and honestly have to commend Fifa because they are being bold and they’re taking a really significant risk here,” he said.“I think they’ve got a responsibility to better reflect the industry they are in, especially around product innovation. I think they’ve got an obligation to try something new. And Fifa are building a club event that they’re saying hands down, without doubt, is [going to be] at the top of the club game and that is their ambition. I think you’ve got to applaud it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will ask questions about the number of fixtures. But of the numbers that we see, where sport is setting new records is where you’re driving fans and engagement clearly to the pinnacles, to the very top of the pyramid. So we’ve seen records set for the World Cup for both men and women. The Copa América, the Euros, the Gulf Cup in the Mena [Middle East and North Africa] region, they’ve proven that trend too.”Kelly says he is not surprised that ticket sales are slow for an unfamiliar competition, but argues Fifa has a number of marketing levers to pull before the event, even without an intervention from the White House. And if there are empty banks of seats when the South Korean side Ulsan face Mamelodi Sundowns on 17 June, Fifa will still have taken big steps towards globalising the club game in an unprecedented way.“If you look at everything in the round, there are leagues that are unhappy, some of the federations, while at the confederation level it’s a mixed bag as to whether they’re truly supportive or have some concerns. But overall, when the first game kicks off, I think the interest will be strong.”Explore more on these topicsClub World CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Piastri was almost 10 seconds ahead of McLaren teammate Lando Norris in second, while Mercedes’ George Russell came third for the second week in a row.Piastri’s win followed his bitterly disappointing season-opener, after the Australian made a crucial error on lap 44 last Sunday when he appeared to be cruising in second on his home track at Albert Park, only to spin off and finish ninth.“It’s been an incredible weekend, from from start to finish,” Piastri said. “The car’s been pretty mega the whole time. Just proud of the whole weekend. This is what I feel like I deserved from last week, so extremely happy. The team did a mega job.“Very proud of the race we managed to pull off because it wasn’t an easy one going in.”McLaren continue to power away from their rivals after claiming a long-awaited constructors championship last year. Norris won in Melbourne and McLaren were set for a one-two finish there before Piastri’s crucial mistake.“Oscar drove well, he was quick the whole race – I tried to get close, but in the end I just couldn’t,” Norris said after the race in China. “He deserved the win, and he drove very well all weekend.”Ferrari admit ‘genuine error’ after Hamilton and Leclerc disqualifiedRead moreAfter two rounds of the 24 this season completed, Piastri sits fourth in the driver standings, 10 points behind leader Norris (44 pts).Piastri’s fellow Australian Jack Doohan came 16th, after being unable to finish in his first home GP last Sunday. He was running in 14th position, but was slapped with a 10-second penalty with only a few laps to go.The drivers will have next weekend off before heading to Japan for the next round on 4 to April.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The teams’ fatesin the Chinese Grand Prixcould not have been in greater contrast and it is doubtful that it would give Hamilton occasion for so much as a wry smile.In a processional race at Shanghai, McLaren’s Oscar Piastri won with a commanding drive from pole and with his teammateLando Norrisbehind him they secured McLaren’s 50th one-two finish and the team’s first of the season. On this form, it will not be the last.Hamilton hits out at ‘yapping’ critics after sprint race success at Chinese GPRead moreFerrari, meanwhile, pulled the chocks away and let the scarlet rollercoaster rip. FromHamilton’s superb poleandvictory in the sprint raceon Saturday, the dizzying highs and expectations fell to a dismal low in less than 24 hours. In the race, their car was steadfastly off the pace, fourth fastest behind the McLarens, the Mercedes of George Russell, who was third, and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen in fourth.It was a troubling enough prospect, given the team seem puzzled as to why their performance is coming and going with insouciant disregard for their feelings. At least they crossed the finish line, albeit in fifth and sixth for Charles Leclerc and Hamilton respectively. As for adding to their points tallies, unfortunately not.Three hours after the flag fell, both Leclerc and Hamilton had been summarily disqualified for breaking technical regulations. No grey area, no appeal, just a slam dunk, got it wrong.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton discovered after the race that his Ferrari had been disqualified for a technical infringement.Photograph: Go Nakamura/ReutersAfter the usual checks on the cars in parc fermé the skid blocks on the underside of Hamilton’sFerrariwere found to be below the legal thickness by 0.5mm and Leclerc’s car underweight by 1kg. These are tiny margins but they are known, calculated for as part of the preparation. Conforming is a given and forms part of what is considered precision execution. Push the boundaries for performance but stay within them for points.Ferrari did not manage to achieve either. They cited high tyre wear because Leclerc adopted a one‑stop rather than a two-stop strategy, causing the car to be underweight, a variable that might be excused but that equally should have been factored in. In Hamilton’s case, the skid blocks that are part of the plank beneath the car are required to be a specific depth after the race to ensure it does not run below the minimum ride height and gain an advantage.This was a pre-race calculation. In this case a pre-race miscalculation, or “misjudged consumption” as the Scuderia had it, with “no intent” of gaining an advantage.There was certainly no advantage on show for Hamilton, who ploughed round in an uncompetitive car all afternoon and also ceded his place on track to Leclerc, who was quicker despite a damaged front wing. This was insult to injury even before the FIA waded in to further spoil the Scuderia’s doleful day as Ferrari concluded their mea culpa by admitting they would learn from the mistake.Cold comfort for Hamilton, even though he is no stranger to a team pushing the envelope in this regard, having been disqualified for a similar infringementat the US GP in 2023for Mercedes. Notably it tends to occur when teams are chasing performance, looking for every possible edge, while those enjoying a quick car can afford to ensure a greater margin of error.Enter with something of a swagger then, Hamilton’s old outfit,McLaren, who were once more in complete control. Piastri was flawless for his third race win, with Norris completing the job, if offering what little drama there was when he suffered a brake problem late in the race that he just about managed to contain in claiming second.View image in fullscreen(Left to right) second-placed Lando Norris, race winner Oscar Piastri and third-placed George Russell celebrate on the podium.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty ImagesWhat was striking, however, was how anonymous McLaren’s opposition appeared. Once Norris had claimed second place from Russell through turn one off the start, he and Piastri were untroubled.In both opening races now – despite the variance in tracks, weather and tyre demands – McLaren have coped with conspicuous ease. Serene and commanding in front, it was impossible not to sense that they had far more in the locker were it needed. It was noticeable that it was not. Verstappen, the four-time defending world champion, was never even in the game and he knew it.Once more, as it had been in Australia, the McLaren was rock-solid on its tyres, while at Ferrari even a new set of rubber had not improved Hamilton’s fortunes and the team principal, Fred Vasseur, admitted they were at a loss to explain why.“It’s difficult to understand and to read,” Vasseur said. “We have to do a better job, to understand. We all have the same tyres. As soon as they are not in the right window it is much more difficult.”McLaren have found that operating window and it is wide open and welcoming. Norris and Piastri are seizing their opportunity, the British driver leading the championship by eight points from Verstappen, with Piastri 10 behind.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri speeds down the home straight on his way to victory in Shanghai.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty ImagesAs things stand Hamilton, who claimedMcLaren’s last drivers’ title in 2008, may be naught but an observer as his old team look on course to finally return another, while Ferrari, on a similar winless streak since Kimi Räikkönen’s championship win in 2007, have no little work to do.Alpine’s Pierre Gasly was also disqualified post-race for an underweight car, having originally crossed the line in 11th.After the penalties were imposed, Esteban Ocon was in fifth for Haas and 18-year-old Kimi Antonelli in sixth for Mercedes. Alex Albon was in seventh for Williams and his teammate Carlos Sainz in 10th, while Britain’s rookie Ollie Bearman delivered a superb drive with some decisive overtaking and clever racecraft to take eighth place for Haas.

But the reaction to it reveals the limited ways we allow Black athletes to express themselvesSun 23 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 08.33 EDTShareWhen a teenager from Texas named George Foreman waved a tiny American flag in the boxing ring afterwinning Olympic gold in 1968, he had little awareness of the political minefield beneath his size 15 feet. The moment, captured by television cameras for an audience of millions during one of themost volatile periods in American history, was instantly contrasted with another image from two days earlier at the same Mexico City Games: Tommie Smith and John Carlos, heads bowed and black-gloved fists raised in salute during the US national anthem, a silent act of protest that would become one of the defining visuals of the 20th century. Their message was unmistakable: a rebuke of the country that had sent them to compete while continuing to deny civil rights to people who looked like them. Their action was seen as defiant resistance, Foreman’s as deference to the very systems of oppression they were protesting.George Foreman: a charmer who left his mark in the dirt and dust of the fight gameRead moreBut that reading, while emotionally understandable amid the fevered upheaval of 1968, misses something deeper – about Foreman, about patriotism, and about the burden of symbolic politics laid on the shoulders of Black athletes.To understand the backlash the 19-year-old Foreman faced in the context of 1968, particularly from within the Black community, is to understand the mood of that year: a procession of funerals and fires, of uprisings in Detroit and Newark, of young people trading dreams of integration for the sharp rhetoric of militant self-determination. Dr Martin Luther King Jr had been gunned down in Memphis just months earlier. Black Power was no longer a whisper in back rooms or college classrooms – it had become a rallying cry, a style, a stance. And in that charged atmosphere, there seemed to be only one acceptable way to be Black and politically conscious: with fist raised, spine straight, voice sharpened by injustice.In that climate, Smith and Carlos’s silent, defiant protest was seismic. Theypaid dearly for it– expelled from the Games, vilified at home and exiled from professional opportunity for years. They were heroes, then and now. But the demand for unity behind that particular kind of protest was strong. To many, in that moment, there was only one acceptable way to be Black and political. Foreman’s flag violated that code. It did not speak the language of protest. It did not name the enemy. And so, some saw it as a profound misstep.View image in fullscreenTommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medalists in the 200-meter run at the 1968 Olympic Games, engage in a victory stand protest against unfair treatment of Black people in the United States.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveForeman had long insisted that there was no statement embedded in the flag he waved. “I didn’t know anything about [the protest] until I got back to the Olympic Village,” he said years later. “I didn’t wave the flag to make a statement. I waved it because I was happy.”That kind of apolitical happiness wasn’t just seen as suspicious – it was infuriating to those risking everything to challenge the systemic racism at the foundation of American society. The fact that the mainstream white media embraced Foreman as a “good” Black athlete in contrast to Smith and Carlos only deepened the rift. He was positioned, perhaps unintentionally, as the safe symbol of patriotism, the counter-image to fists in the air.But Foreman’s story was never simple. He grew up poor in Houston’s Fifth Ward, a tough and segregated neighborhood. He found boxing through the Job Corps, a federal anti-poverty program. For Foreman, the flag didn’t represent a government that had failed him – it represented a country that had offered him a way out. His patriotism was anything but performative; it was deeply personal.In a nation that often demands that Black people perform either rage or gratitude, Foreman dared to be something else: complexToo often, different experiences of Blackness are mistaken for ideological betrayal. Not every expression of pride in America is a denial of its sins. Sometimes it’s a hard-earned survival mechanism. For Foreman, the flag may have symbolized escape, opportunity and the dream that somehow, in spite of it all, he belonged.Still, the criticism followed him, stubborn and sharp. He was branded an Uncle Tom, accused of pandering to white America, made to feel, by his own account, unwelcome in many Black spaces. His response was not to explain but to retreat. In the ring, he became a fearsome presence – angry, sullen and distant. Outside it, he said little, and seemed to carry a quiet fury beneath the surface. When helaid waste Joe Frazier in 1973, knocking him down six times in two rounds to claim the heavyweight crown, he celebrated not with a grin but with a kind of grim inevitability. He looked less like a champion than an avenger.But narratives have a way of bending, especially in American life, and Foreman’s eventually did. Not long after losing it all withhis crushing loss to Muhammad Aliin Zaire the following year – a defeat that humbled and haunted him – he disappeared for a decade. He found God, became a preacher, opened a youth center. When he returned to boxing in the late 1980s, older, heavier and unfashionably gentle, the public met him with something approaching affection. He smiled now. He cracked jokes. He appeared on talk shows. And when, at 45 years old, hereclaimed the heavyweight titlein one of the sport’s most improbable comebacks, it felt not like redemption but reinvention.View image in fullscreenForeman’s reinvention culminated with his 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer in 1994 to become the world heavyweight champion for a second time.Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe same man who once waved the flag and was scorned for it now hawked millions of countertop grills bearing his name. He starred in aprimetime network TV sitcom. He named all five of his sons George. He leaned into the myth and made it charming. In doing so, he reshaped the cultural meaning of his image – from the quiet bruiser to thejoyful elder statesman, a symbol of resilience, reinvention and a kind of pragmatic hope. There’s a credible argument that he succeeded Bill Cosby as America’s dad.We should not forget, nor flatten, the radical clarity of Smith and Carlos’s gesture. Nor should we mistake Foreman’s act for anything it was not. But perhaps we can now make room for both. Black patriotism has never been a monolith; it has always contained tension, ambiguity, contradiction. Some express it through protest, others through perseverance. A fist raised, a flag waved – both can be acts of love, not of submission, but of insistence: that the country be made to live up to its promise. And in a nation that often demands that Black people perform either rage or gratitude,George Foremandared to be something else: complex.The enduring lesson of 1968 is not that one form of Black political expression is inherently more valid than another, but that the burden placed on Black athletes to symbolize a collective experience is often impossibly heavy. Every gesture is scrutinized. Every silence is interpreted. Every celebration is suspect. In that sense, Foreman’s flag was never just about joy – it was about the impossibility of being apolitical in a body already politicized by history. He did not salute a perfect America. He saluted the possibility of one.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ForemanBoxingUS sportsMuhammad AliJoe FraziercommentShareReuse this content"

He was given a suspended sentence but no deprivation order, leaving the police with no legal power to retain and wipe his devices.The findings provoked a backlash from campaigners, who called for urgent action and said the failings were leaving victims “living in fear” that images could be re-shared. The CPS admitted that more must be done to “stop ­perpetrators retaining these images and continuing to take gratification from their crimes”.It has now made changes to its guidance for prosecutors on communications offences. The new guidance, to be published this week, will urge them to make better use of deprivation orders to ensure they are routinely asking courts to impose them.Prosecutors will be told to consider use of the orders from early on in their case strategy. It is hoped the changes will lead to more offenders being stripped of their devices post-conviction, as well as a more consistent approach to the process of confiscating devices from suspects in the first place.The changes were welcomed by campaigners, who said they were a “step in the right direction”.Elena Michael, from the campaign group#NotYourPorn, said the guidance would be helpful provided it was “extensive and thorough”, but that there was “so much more to do”.She called for better investigation processes and a “more comprehensive piece of work” to look at other issues preventing justice for victims, such as a failure to confiscate phones during cases.More clarity was also needed on whether the guidance would also extend to hard drives and cloud storage as well as physical devices, she added.Law professor Clare McGlynn said the new guidance was a “very welcome development” that represented “progress”. “It also remains the case that, while very welcome, and shining a light on this very important issue, this will help only a few women and girls who secure a conviction,” she said. “There remain far too few cases getting through investigations and prosecutions. The CPS therefore still has a lot of work to do to improve its performance in relation to image-based sexual abuse.”The Sentencing Council, which publishes guidance for judges and magistrates, said it was monitoring the government’s plans for new intimate-image legislation and would look at “what new guidelines or changes are required” when that came into force.Explore more on these topicsOnline abuseThe ObserverViolence against women and girlsInternetCrimeSocial mediaDigital mediaCrown Prosecution ServiceShareReuse this content"

It’s completely pointless – and weirdly beautifulMiles HerbertSun 23 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 10.02 EDTShareSpending too much time onYouTubecan be a dangerous game for men my age. Algorithmic gyres can pull you rightwards – towards misogynistic extremes and away from the parts of the internet that build connections and foster consensus.Thankfully the rabbit hole I fell down led me – in a perfectly straight line – towards a renewed sense of childlike adventure.It’s the title of the video that got me: “I attempted to cross an entire country in a straight line. PART 1”.While I have always been attracted to useless conquests, this one was particularly useless: a man filming himself journeying across Wales in one unbending route – along the way jumping fences, running through gardens, climbing mountains, wading through rivers, almost dying in peat bogs and getting yelled at by farmers.It was a feat of sheer folly and foolish machismo. Mere minutes into the video, things go south: unable to cross a fast-flowing river, our hapless traveller is forced to divert from his line by a few metres. I was hooked regardless.Straight story? The YouTuber taking a direct route to successRead moreThe man in this video is Tom Davies (AKA GeoWizard), the inventor of this impossible challenge: straight line missioning. Soon after his video, copycats began to pop up. Creators began traversing rugged terrain – sometimes for days on end – in pursuit of this juvenile glory.I devoured it all. Video after video, I watched as YouTubers transposed the best parts of the internet on to the natural environment. The world is tumultuous and hostile, andnature is no different. To apply the internet’s gamified principles to the sprawl of nature is to bring order to chaos.In straight line missioning, there is no danger: only obstacles to complete. Jumping over thorny hedgerows, scrambling over mountains and skirting the edges of cliffs prove no problem at all. Angry landowners become NPCs (non-playable characters) – to be studied and skirted. It’s like a classic platformer: if you fall, the worst thing that happens is the game restarting. If you don’t make it across Wales on your first attempt, you spawn back at the start line forattempt two. Thenattempt three, andso on.Straight line missioning is (mostly) innocuous, pointless, even inane; at its best, it feels transgressive in a cultural moment where masculinity is so often blatantly harmful. On Reddit, there are stories of fathers and sons spending the weekend togethercompleting their own challenge. My favourite contribution to the canon is the pair ofNew Zealand teenagerswho moved me to tears with their friendship and care. They reminded me of the banal misadventures of my own youth, with my own male friends whom I lost touch with long ago.It is probably important to note that GeoWizard – and the many straight line missioners in his wake – are technically breaking the law when they traverse through large swathes of private land required to complete a mission. “It’s a bit naughty,” he told the Guardian back in 2021.I like to think there is a political purpose in their transgressions. GeoWizard has successfully “missioned” across England, a country whose landmass is owned by less than1% of the population.The Fieldhouse Boyswere the first people to take a perfectly direct route across Scotland, where land ownership isthe most inequitable in the western world.Landmarks review – Robert Macfarlane finds poetry in the peatlandsRead moreThe British writer Robert MacFarlane, in hismeditations on moorlands, has opined that the natural world is in danger of disappearing when there is a disconnect between people and place. When seen from a distance, the moors can appear a nothing place; it’s only when you walk the moors that the complex ecology comes sharply into focus.Perhaps that’s exactly what straight line missioners are encouraging: to feel the earth beneath your feet, to reconnect with lands that have been overruled by private owners and garish wealth. It might be one of the few internet phenomena which has inspired people to touch grass.Explore more on these topicsCultureInternet wormholeYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It ultimately lost that crown to theOtty Original Hybridbut, goodness me, it gave me some glorious sleep along the way.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As with other hybrid mattresses, the Simba Hybrid Pro combines pocket springs with various types of memory foam to offer a balance of support and softness. Its outstanding motion isolation makes it a particularly fine choice for couples who need some peace from each other’s nocturnal fidgeting.Given its price of £1,149 for a double, you’d hope it would provide the sleep of your dreams – but it’s hard to find out for yourself until you actually buy it because Simba doesn’t have showrooms. You can follow expert advice onchoosing your ideal mattressand avail yourself of Simba’s 200-night free trial period, but you’re still buying blind. Here, I’ll try to shed some light on the matter (… ess) and reveal why I think it’s a worthy investment.View at SimbaHow I testedView image in fullscreenTesting the Hybrid Pro’s motion isolation credentials.Photograph: Jane HoskynI slept on a Simba Hybrid Pro double for three months, alongside my husband, on our slatted bed base. As with all the mattresses I’vetested for the Filter, I tracked its impact on our sleep quality and other factors, such as body aches, night sweats and disturbances from tossing and turning, and ran tests to measure things like sinkage and heat retention. I also enlisted the help of our locally based family to assess its firmness, comfort and value for money.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreenThe Hybrid Pro is made up of eight layers and is 28cm deep.Photograph: Jane HoskynView at SimbaThe Hybrid Pro is the middle child in Simba’s Hybrid range, which all have pocket springs and different types of memory foam. It sits halfway between the averagely priceyHybrid Essential(£599 for a double) and the outrageously expensiveHybrid Ultra(£2,799 for a double). The Pro merely costs “a lot”, starting at £799 for a single and rising to £1,349 for a super king.You get what you pay for in terms of sophisticated construction. The Hybrid Pro’s eight layers exceed the usual five or six in a hybrid mattress, and its spring count is more than four times the typical 1,000. There are up to 4,800 springs in aking size, individually wrapped and with a layer of “micro springs” to add bounce and durability.View image in fullscreenThe Hybrid Pro’s cover is machine washable.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe largest foam layer is a high-density base for support and durability, while more technologically advanced layers include one made from open-cell graphite-infused foam to encourage airflow. There’s also a top layer of natural wool for cushioning and temperature regulation and a fabric cover you can unzip and wash in the machine.Simba describes the Hybrid Pro as “medium firm”, and my tests with weights suggested it’s about right. During my first month of testing, the Hybrid Pro sank a maximum of 29mm under 7.5kg of weight – halfway between the firmest mattress I’ve tested (theOrigin Hybrid Pro, which sank 18mm) and the softest (theEve Wunderflip Hybrid, 40mm).The Simba Hybrid Pro isn’t the heaviest mattress I’ve tested but it is beefy, measuring 28cm deep and weighing about 40kg for a double. Luckily, you’re not supposed to flip it, but you should rotate it from head to toe once a month to avoid indentations where you sleep. A 10-year guarantee covers manufacturing defects and there’s the 200-night trial – during which you can return the mattress for a full refund if you don’t get on with it.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030. Hybrid Pro foam is CertiPUR approvedDeliveryView image in fullscreenThe mattress arrives boxed and vacuum-packed in plastic sheeting.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe Hybrid Pro, as with most of the mattresses I’ve tested, was delivered by third-party couriers (Expert Logistics, in this case), and I had to be at home to receive it. This worked well enough, with regular text alerts from Simba, a driver tracking link and a four-hour delivery window.Simba claims it will deliver your mattress to any room you want, but this was never presented as an option by the delivery team. The boxed mattress was heavy, weighing more than 40kg, so I’d recommend asking the drivers if they’d carry it upstairs if needed. In the event, my husband and I unwrapped the Simba downstairs so we could run tests and let our family try it, later ferrying it upstairs with some effort and the odd bleepable word.What we loveView image in fullscreen‘I felt fully supported when I sat up to read in bed and the support continued up to the edge and corners of the bed.’Photograph: Jane HoskynA new mattress often requires an adjustment period, so I’ve had a few sleepless nights reviewing mattresses (I know, it’s a tough job). The Hybrid Pro, however, had me sleeping soundly from the start. I woke up feeling refreshed, and there was no sign of the lower back pain I’d suffered with some firm beds.The surface feels cosy without being too soft, and supportive without being too firm. In the mattress game, that’s bullseye. In the words of my 22-year-old niece, “It has squishiness but it’s surprisingly firm when you actually lie on it.” The hint of softness is ideal for us side sleepers because our hips, shoulders and knees need cushioning, but I also felt a reassuring pushback when I laid on my back and front. I felt fully supported when I sat up to read in bed, too, and the support continued right up to the edge and corners of the bed. That’s a distinct advantage over the cheaperOtty Original Hybrid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I also liked the feel of the natural wool layer immediately beneath the sleeping surface, although I was torn on its supposed cooling powers. More on that in a moment.At 28cm deep, the Simba is chunky enough to look and feel luxurious, but slim enough to accommodate our non-stretchy fitted sheets, albeit with an effort to get all the corners snug. The 31cm-deepOrigin Hybrid Pro, by contrast, is too big for any standard-depth fitted sheet.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘I didn’t get sweaty while sleeping on the Simba, but it was autumn and winter.’Photograph: Jane HoskynWith a collective firmness score of 7/10 from our panel, the Hybrid Pro won’t be firm enough if you love the solid pressure relief of a hard mattress. This may be especially noticeable if you’re a larger person and you sleep on your back, but my husband (a back and side sleeper) and sister (side sleeper) – perfectly average-size, middle-aged people, if they’ll forgive me – felt it was slightly too soft. My niece and I, who agreed with the 7/10 firmness measure, awarded 9/10 for overall comfort. Clearly, firmness preference is subjective.Less subjective is the sinkage effect of foam. All mattresses that contain memory foam soften in their first few months. After I’d slept on the Hybrid Pro for three months and rotated it as instructed, the central section of the sleeping surface felt noticeably softer. I whipped out the weights again and, sure enough, the central area now sank 41mm under 7.5kg instead of 29mm.This alarmed me at first – especially consideringthe issues some customers have had in the past– but apparently it’s quite normal.Simbaclaims a “dip tolerance” of 25mm in the first six months, and my October and December measurements were well under 25mm. That initial sinkage is a bit like wearing in cushioned shoes and hard to avoid, so be aware of it – especially given that you can’t flip a hybrid mattress to get a freshly firm surface.Memory foam also tends to hold on to body heat, and this can spell misery if you suffer from night sweats like I do. I didn’t get sweaty while sleeping on the Simba, but it was autumn and winter.My tests with a heat pad, thermometer and my husband’s bottomfound that it hung on to body heat marginally longer than theOtty Original Hybrid, the Origin Hybrid Pro and the airy-but-much-less-robust Ikea Valevåg.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe plastic the mattress comes in can be recycled – but at household waste centres rather than regular refuge collections.Photograph: Jane HoskynBed-in-a-box delivery is an environmental challenge in itself. Like its rivals, the Hybrid Pro is vacuum-packed into a sausage-roll shape and wrapped tightly so it can’t expand en route to your front door. This requires metres of plastic that you probably won’t reuse unless you’re decorating and need a dust sheet. Most household waste centres will accept it for recycling, but bin collections won’t.Then there’s memory foam used in hybrid mattresses like the Hybrid Pro. Viscoelastic LRPu (low-resistance polyurethane foam), to give it its full name, is made using energy-intensive processes, and is not biodegradable. Simba, like many of its rivals, has made notable green efforts, perhaps in a bid to compensate.Simba’s onlineSustainability Hubdeclares its aim to be net zero by 2030 and says it’s the UK’s first sleep brand to be certified by global bodyB Corp, which demands strict and constantly monitored environmental and social standards from its members. All its foam is certified byCertiPurto minimise the impact on health and the environment.Simba runs amattress recycling serviceand, again, this is common among bed-in-a-box companies. It’s not free – it charges £50 to take away your old mattress and recycle it, whether it’s a Simba or not – but it does at least offer peace of mind that it’ll be handled by specialists.I gave the recycling service a try. Simba sent me a collection bag (essentially a thick, mattress-size bin bag) and then dispatched third-party couriers to collect it. “Oh no, it’s a mattress,” they lamented. Interesting that they’d not been forewarned, and it made me wonder for a moment where my old mattress might end up, but Simba guarantees that its collected mattresses are recycled responsibly with UK recycling partners.Simba Hybrid Pro: should I buy it?The Hybrid Pro is a sumptuously comfortable mattress that improved my sleep from the first night, offering the luxury of softness without sacrificing support. Its price is pretty deluxe, too, and it’s worth being aware that memory foam can soften in time, though if you treat it well this mattress is a worthwhile investment.View at SimbaJane Hoskyn is a freelance consumer journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and ‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Last year, it was ITV’sMr Bates vs The Post Office, in which the plight of subpostmasters was rendered withsuch successthat it actually hastened in real-world legislation to compensate them.And now we have Netflix’sAdolescence, which looks at the online radicalisation of young boys by men’s rights activists (MRAs) such as Andrew Tate. Last week, Keir Starmer told the Commons he had been watching the series with his family and that it portrayed an “emerging and growing problem”that needed to be tackled. Now MPs are examining ideas to address the issue with greater urgency.It probably shouldn’t work like this. Policy decisions would ideally not hinge on the quality of an actor’s performance (Adolescencehad some spectacular ones, which explains its success), and whether politicians manage to catch the latest Netflix series. It makes us look a little emotionally incontinent, as a country, when the decisions of TV drama commissioners weigh quite so heavily in our politics. But the fickle spotlight of political attention has landed here, for now.The issue of rising misogyny among young boys, fuelled by online influencers, has long been troubling. If we are approaching a point that action might be taken, that is a good thing. But what should that action be? There are, roughly, two lines of thought.One is that the problem stems from an unfulfilled need among these young men – a lack of guidance, or self-esteem or of other men on which to model themselves. That was the central contention ofGareth Southgate’s Dimbleby lecturelast week. He talked of an “epidemic of fatherlessness” and the fact that boys are spending less time at youth centres and sports events where they might have met the kinds of aspirational figures Southgate looked up to: coaches, youth workers and teachers. Without this, he said, boys are driven on to the internet “searching for direction”, where they stumble on role models who “do not have their best interests at heart”.As tech geniuses devote their brainpower to keeping people engaged, algorithms are getting smarter, and online life more excitingThe other argument is that the poison starts and ends with the influencers themselves: these men are so compelling they can radicalise boys who are otherwise well looked after and have plenty to do. This is the thesis at the heart ofAdolescence. Its central character is a boy drawn into MRA culture, which eventually persuades him to kill – but he also comes from an ordinary family, with a loving father and many male role models around him. There is no trauma in his life, no abuse. As thewriter, Jack Thorne, puts it: “He comes from a good background, like me; he’s a bright boy, like I was. The key difference between us? He had the internet to read at night whereas I had Terry Pratchett and Judy Blume.”Proponents of the first idea want investment in youth centres and mentoring programmes, and to encourage more men into teaching. These notions have much merit, and would of course be good on their own terms. But as a solution to the problem of misogyny among radicalised schoolboys, I lean more towards the ideas offered by the second school of thought: getting them away from their smartphones.Here’s one indication that youth clubs may not be the answer: online culture is not merely compensating for the real world, but outcompeting it. As tech geniuses devote all their brainpower to keeping people engaged, algorithms are getting smarter, and online life more exciting. I’ve previously written about the similarities betweensocial media and casino slot machines: both use league tables, points, lucky streaks and rewards to get the dopamine pumping and keep us hooked. A survey last week of 14- to 17-year-olds found 40% spentat least six hours a day online– the equivalent of a school day. This is not just about a lack of other options. These platforms take the stimulus to socialise – recognition, inclusion, approval – and gamify it to an addictive level. Why spend time with your friends or go to community centres when online culture is more rewarding?There’s an argument, too, that spending large chunks of your life online itself creates the preconditions for the kind of radicalisation offered by the “manosphere”. A central trait of MRA culture, for example, is that followers are obsessed with their status. But that fixation is also fuelled by social media platforms themselves, which revolve around improving your social standing and projecting it to others. That is one difference with real-world socialising, where overconfidence tends to be kept in check.In the offline world, a dent to your ego can be laughed off; online it can be devastating, and longer lasting. This makes people brittle and insecure. No wonder there is an exploding online market for self-improvement and self-help, which MRA influencers tap into – promising young men routes to status and approval.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And now enter Tate and his ilk, with a package of promises: status, female attention and a target for resentment. You can see why this might be hard to resist.Is it time for the government to restrict teenage access to social media? A bill that campaigners hoped would ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers was watered down earlier this month; that may have been a mistake.

Experts lostAustin SaratThe governor dismissed an ex-judge studying the death penalty in the state and failed to heed a leading voice on the matter. It’s no surpriseSun 23 Mar 2025 09.32 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 09.33 EDTShareOn Wednesday, 19 March, Arizonaexecuted Aaron Gunches by lethal injection. As ABC Newsreports, he was put to death for “kidnapping and killing 40-year-old Ted Price by shooting him four times in the Arizona desert”.Gunches’s case was unusual in many ways, not least that he stopped his legal appeals and volunteered to be executed, then changed his mind before changing it again. His execution was scheduled to be carried out almost two years ago. Itwas put on holdwhen the Arizona governor, Katie Hobbs,commissioned an independent review of the state’s death penalty procedures after a series of botched executions.But over the last several months, she pushed hard to make sure Gunches died for his crime. She evenfired the expert retired Judge David Duncan who she had chosen to do that review, before he could complete his report.Her decision to let Duncan go was shocking. At the time, sheoffered the following explanation: “Your review has, unfortunately, faced repeated challenges, and I no longer have confidence that I will receive a report from you that will accomplish the purpose and goals of the Executive Order that I issued nearly two years ago.”The governor also noted that the department of corrections, rehabilitation & reentry had conduct “a comprehensive review of prior executions and has made significant revisions to its policies and procedures”. But doubt about whether she could rely on a review conducted by the group which is in charge of the state’s executions in why she appointed Duncan in the first place.That is why I suspect that Hobbs tossed Duncan aside because she didn’t like the facts he was finding or the conclusions he seemed to be reaching.Facts are stubborn things, but, in our era, they can be tossed aside with little political cost and no regret. Why rely on expertise if it gets in the way of achieving a result you want to reach?Still, Hobbs’s unprecedented decision to “kill the messenger” was another low moment for a society increasingliving by a line uttered by a newspaper editor in the classic movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence: “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”In the world of capital punishment, the “legend” to which politicians like Hobbs are attached is that it can make America a safer and more just place. They want us to believe that they embrace the death penalty to bring closure to family members of murder victims rather than to accrue political capital.Note what Arizona attorney general Kris Mayessaid during a news conference following the execution: “An execution is the most serious action that the state takes, and I assure you that it is not taken lightly. Today, Arizona resumed the death penalty, and justice for Ted Price and his family was finally served.”After Gunches’s death, the sister of the man he murderedechoedthat sentiment. Karen Price called the execution “the final chapter in a process that has spanned nearly 23 years”.Ted Price’s daughter added that Gunches’s deathmeans that she will no longer have to revisit“the circumstances surrounding my father’s death” as she had to for over two decades of seemingly endless legal proceedings. “Today,” she said, “marks the end of that painful chapter, and I couldn’t be more grateful”.That chapter would not have ended if Governor Hobbs had been willing to listen to her own expert.Before being sacked, JudgeDuncan prepared a draft of his report and wrote a letter to the governor’s office previewing his conclusions. He called lethal injection an unreliable method of execution and said: “Drug manufacturers don’t allow states to use the appropriate drugs.”Political leaders know they can play into the burgeoning culture of disrespect for what experts have to sayDuncan had spent nearly two years reviewing Arizona’s use of lethal injections. As heexplained, “Early on, I thought lethal injection would work. The more I learned about it I learned that that was a false hope.”Duncan told the governor that, in his view, using lethal injection was too risky. In his view, the best course would be forArizonato adopt the firing squad because “it has the lowest botch rate.”That was not the news Hobbs hoped her expert would deliver, so shelet Duncan go. It seems he just didn’t understand that she wanted him to ease the way toward a resumption of lethal injection executions rather than suggesting that the state should not execute anyone until it could adopt what he considered to be a better method.And Duncan was not the only one raising questions about Arizona’s resumption of lethal injection executions. Last January, law professor Corinna Lain, a leading expert on lethal injection,said: “The evidence is overwhelming that Arizona cannot lawfully carry out an execution by lethal injection at this time. Its pentobarbital protocol is sure or very likely to cause a tortuous death even in the best of circumstances.”She went on to say: “The circumstances here are far from optimal. The State is on the cusp of using an inexperienced, untrained team to inject likely expired drugs stored in unmarked mason jars that were produced by a company that does not make drugs for human consumption and that will be compounded by a pharmacy that the … (the state) itself has previously disavowed.”Disregarding expert knowledge is very much in fashion in many areas of American life, not just where the death penalty is concerned. The Atlantic’s Tom Nicholsexplainsthat “Trump allies make noises about expert failures … [and] demonize what its constituents believe was the medical establishment’s attempt to curtail civil rights during the coronavirus pandemic.” He argues that Elon Musk’s attack on civil servants is really an attack on the “very notion of apolitical expertise.”But, as Nicholsexplains, such doubt is not confined to Washington DC. It is found in the “homes of ordinary American families”. There, “knowledge of every kind is also under attack. Parents argue with their child’s doctor over the safety of vaccines. Famous athletes speculate that the world might actually be flat. College administrators ponder dropping algebra from the curriculum because students keep failing it.”So, it is not surprising that the attack on knowledge would infect decisions about how to end the lives of people condemned to death. Political leaders – including Democrats like Hobbs – know they can play into the burgeoning culture of disrespect for what experts have to say, so they dispense with Duncan and ignore Lain.The more publicly they display that disrespect, the more politically they can benefit.It wasn’t always this way when decisions had to be made about methods of execution. At the end of the 19th century, before New York decided to abandon hanging, the state convened a commission to consider and recommend alternatives.That commission sought out the best minds to help them make their decision. It chose the electric chair.The decision whether electrocution “would be by Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC)”was informed by a competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, both pioneers in the development of electricity.That was then. Today, as the Arizona example shows, such expertise does not govern the choice of execution methods.In the wake of the Gunches execution, Governor Hobbs and the “down with experts crowd” may feel vindicated becausenothing seemed to have gone awry. But they should not rest easy, and neither should any of the 112 inmates on Arizona’s death row.Studies have shown that lethal injectionhas the worst track recordof any method of execution used in the last century in this country. That is why it is only a matter of time before an execution in Arizona proves the folly of ignoring experts and the insights they offer.Explore more on these topicsCapital punishmentOpinionArizonaUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Admittedly, this creates inconveniences for persons subject to capital punishment.Bye, bye. Enjoy the flight.Reveal7.According to the 12th Amendment, when certifying the vote of the Electoral College, the “President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.”  This means:The president of the senate—that is, the vice president—is to play an entirely ceremonial function, like a presenter at the Academy Awards. He is to open the state certificates and then hand the opened certificates to a “teller” (a member of the House or Senate), who reads aloud the results of each state.The president of the senate—that is, the vice president—is to open each certificate and peek at the result. If the state certificate supports his and the president’s reelection, he is to hand the certificate to a teller, who announces the result. If the state’s certificate awards its electoral votes to the opposing party, the vice president is to quietly tear the certificate to shreds and call out, “Next!”The president of the senate—that is, the vice president—is to perform the ceremonial function described in (A) up until the moment that a mob of “peace-loving patriots” dressed in bison fur and armed with pitchforks and nooses invade the chamber. At this point, the president of the senate is to act as described in (B).Reveal8.According to the 22nd Amendment, “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” This means:Are you seriously asking?Impossible to say. The language is so profoundly obscure and ambiguous as to invite a wide range of equally plausible interpretations.Provided that a second-term president doesn’t stand for election for a third term, he can stay in power for as long as he wants.Steve Bannon gets to say what it means.RevealThe answer key to this quiz was recently removed from usa.govLawrence Douglas is a professor of law at Amherst College in MassachusettsExplore more on these topicsUS constitution and civil libertiesOpinionDonald TrumpElon MuskTrump administrationLaw (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

For subtle discussion of diversity, equity and inclusion, talk to Lorraine KellySun 23 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 07.39 EDTShareIn the second world war, Navajo code talkers transmitted sensitive US military information in their own undocumented language. Which was nice of them, as their immediate ancestors had been dispossessed and destroyed by white settlers, and then had all their waterpoisoned with uranium. “Were it not for the Navajos,” concluded major Howard Connor, at the time, “the marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.” And thatfamous photoof the American soldiers raising a flag would just have shown some Japanese boy scouts letting off a party popper.But last month Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said: “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength’.” Predictably, some Navajo code talkers had to have bodyguards to protect them from white American servicemen who thought they were Japanese. Plus ça change, as they say over there in that Europe.The Navajos’ efforts went unrecognised. When the son of one of the code talkers got to live the American dream by opening a Burger King in Kayenta on Navajo lands in 1986, he made the buildinga partial museumof his father’s unit. I visited it 30 years ago, with the comedian Kevin Eldon (Narvi the dwarf smith in TV’sThe Lord of the Rings: The Ringsof Power), and it remains the most edifying fast food restaurant I ever ate in. It was even better than that KFC near Bletchley Park that does that delicious Alan Turing chicken strips and alphabetti spaghetti meal deal ™ ®.Despite the fun-size fascism we’re seeing across the Atlantic, the woke folk panic still sells papers and farms online engagementThe Kayenta Burger King also has a more extensive archive of code talker artefacts than any official government repository. Especially since, last week, videos, photos and stories of the Navajo code talkers were temporarily removed online as part of Trump’s assault on diversity. A page commemorating corporal Ira Hayes, a Pima of the Gila River Indian Community, and one of the servicemen photographed raising that Stars and Stripes at Iwo Jima, also disappeared for a while in Trump’s thwarting of the woke. Boris Johnson must be delighted. But I wonder if Trump’s actions please the British daytime TV treasure Lorraine Kelly?Kelly’s interview in theTimeson 14 March, culled from a book promotion appearance on Times Radio, seemed to suggest she believed gender and racial diversity are wrongly prioritised in the workplace at the expense of offering opportunities to the (presumably white) working class. The headline spoke for itself: “Lorraine Kelly: Diversity push is leaving working-class people behind.” Was our Lorraine an unexpected supporter of Trump’s anti-diversity agenda?Probably not. This is the rightwing press, or the press as I call it, that we’re talking about, and Kelly didn’t quite espouse the view the headline implies. Even the elements of the radio interview that the paper chose to transcribe show a Lorraine Kellyprincipallyconcerned about how the cost of living affects working-class access to media jobs, and she made explicit that she hoped to see diversity initiatives tackle exclusion on the basis of classin additionto concentrating on gender and race. It’s a subtly different position and an example of the nuanced thought that has made Kelly the Socrates of the sofa, while her competitor Richard Madeley stares out of his kitchen window at a donkey in a field while thinking about bread.But this is how papers work. For two decades I was lucky enough to review records (remember them?) for theSunday Times.So when they asked me, 20 years back, to write an insider comedian’s view of attempts to boycott the Edinburgh comedy awards because the sponsor, Perrier, was owned by Nestlé, which pushed unsafe formula milk initiatives to the developing world, what could possibly go wrong? And the money didn’t hurt either!I wrote a balanced piece about how the boycott was morally the right thing to do, with the appended caveat that high-profile supporters were asking a lot of young broke performers to walk away from a cash bung of £10,000 that might shift at least some of their debts. The headline? “‘Emma Thompson needs to grow up’, says comedian Stewart Lee”, which wasn’t anything I said, but perhaps fitted the paper’s agenda better, and left me apologising, cap in hand, to the charity Baby Milk Action and Miss Thompson herself, who has conspicuously failed to cast me in any of her hit films since.Despite the fun-size fascism we’re seeing across the Atlantic, the woke folk panic still sells papers and farms online engagement. TheTimesgot what it wanted out of massaging Kelly’s quotes, and in the US the fourth estate is finished, jeopardising democracy worldwide. Maybe it’s time for writers to work out what they believe and stand up for it. But the British press is staffed by a class of professionals happy to drift between theTimes,theTelegraph,theNew Europeanand yes, even the last liberal papers, refining their opinions as required by their offshore billionaire employers. It’s as easy as changing the look of your byline photo from sensible suit and tie to a beatnik polar neck jumper and beard. And that’s just the women. These days.Ironically, some wag at theTimeshas chosen to illustrate Kelly’s interview with an old photo of her GMTV colleague, the black fitness expert Mr Motivator, holding her aloft on the roof of a building. Presumably there were dozens of more motivated white working-class Mr Motivators, but the woke agenda meant they never got the opportunity to lift a Scottish woman. Let’s see if we can’t see a white working-class TV fitness instructor raising Lorraine Kelly high above their head by the end of 2025, but ideally let’s do it without playing into the divisive playbook of Trump, Musk, Vance and Farage, apportioning blame to the disadvantaged, while consolidating their own chrome-plated futures.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionSecond world warNative AmericansStewart LeeRaceUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But the reaction to it reveals the limited ways we allow Black athletes to express themselvesSun 23 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 08.33 EDTShareWhen a teenager from Texas named George Foreman waved a tiny American flag in the boxing ring afterwinning Olympic gold in 1968, he had little awareness of the political minefield beneath his size 15 feet. The moment, captured by television cameras for an audience of millions during one of themost volatile periods in American history, was instantly contrasted with another image from two days earlier at the same Mexico City Games: Tommie Smith and John Carlos, heads bowed and black-gloved fists raised in salute during the US national anthem, a silent act of protest that would become one of the defining visuals of the 20th century. Their message was unmistakable: a rebuke of the country that had sent them to compete while continuing to deny civil rights to people who looked like them. Their action was seen as defiant resistance, Foreman’s as deference to the very systems of oppression they were protesting.George Foreman: a charmer who left his mark in the dirt and dust of the fight gameRead moreBut that reading, while emotionally understandable amid the fevered upheaval of 1968, misses something deeper – about Foreman, about patriotism, and about the burden of symbolic politics laid on the shoulders of Black athletes.To understand the backlash the 19-year-old Foreman faced in the context of 1968, particularly from within the Black community, is to understand the mood of that year: a procession of funerals and fires, of uprisings in Detroit and Newark, of young people trading dreams of integration for the sharp rhetoric of militant self-determination. Dr Martin Luther King Jr had been gunned down in Memphis just months earlier. Black Power was no longer a whisper in back rooms or college classrooms – it had become a rallying cry, a style, a stance. And in that charged atmosphere, there seemed to be only one acceptable way to be Black and politically conscious: with fist raised, spine straight, voice sharpened by injustice.In that climate, Smith and Carlos’s silent, defiant protest was seismic. Theypaid dearly for it– expelled from the Games, vilified at home and exiled from professional opportunity for years. They were heroes, then and now. But the demand for unity behind that particular kind of protest was strong. To many, in that moment, there was only one acceptable way to be Black and political. Foreman’s flag violated that code. It did not speak the language of protest. It did not name the enemy. And so, some saw it as a profound misstep.View image in fullscreenTommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medalists in the 200-meter run at the 1968 Olympic Games, engage in a victory stand protest against unfair treatment of Black people in the United States.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveForeman had long insisted that there was no statement embedded in the flag he waved. “I didn’t know anything about [the protest] until I got back to the Olympic Village,” he said years later. “I didn’t wave the flag to make a statement. I waved it because I was happy.”That kind of apolitical happiness wasn’t just seen as suspicious – it was infuriating to those risking everything to challenge the systemic racism at the foundation of American society. The fact that the mainstream white media embraced Foreman as a “good” Black athlete in contrast to Smith and Carlos only deepened the rift. He was positioned, perhaps unintentionally, as the safe symbol of patriotism, the counter-image to fists in the air.But Foreman’s story was never simple. He grew up poor in Houston’s Fifth Ward, a tough and segregated neighborhood. He found boxing through the Job Corps, a federal anti-poverty program. For Foreman, the flag didn’t represent a government that had failed him – it represented a country that had offered him a way out. His patriotism was anything but performative; it was deeply personal.In a nation that often demands that Black people perform either rage or gratitude, Foreman dared to be something else: complexToo often, different experiences of Blackness are mistaken for ideological betrayal. Not every expression of pride in America is a denial of its sins. Sometimes it’s a hard-earned survival mechanism. For Foreman, the flag may have symbolized escape, opportunity and the dream that somehow, in spite of it all, he belonged.Still, the criticism followed him, stubborn and sharp. He was branded an Uncle Tom, accused of pandering to white America, made to feel, by his own account, unwelcome in many Black spaces. His response was not to explain but to retreat. In the ring, he became a fearsome presence – angry, sullen and distant. Outside it, he said little, and seemed to carry a quiet fury beneath the surface. When helaid waste Joe Frazier in 1973, knocking him down six times in two rounds to claim the heavyweight crown, he celebrated not with a grin but with a kind of grim inevitability. He looked less like a champion than an avenger.But narratives have a way of bending, especially in American life, and Foreman’s eventually did. Not long after losing it all withhis crushing loss to Muhammad Aliin Zaire the following year – a defeat that humbled and haunted him – he disappeared for a decade. He found God, became a preacher, opened a youth center. When he returned to boxing in the late 1980s, older, heavier and unfashionably gentle, the public met him with something approaching affection. He smiled now. He cracked jokes. He appeared on talk shows. And when, at 45 years old, hereclaimed the heavyweight titlein one of the sport’s most improbable comebacks, it felt not like redemption but reinvention.View image in fullscreenForeman’s reinvention culminated with his 10th-round knockout of Michael Moorer in 1994 to become the world heavyweight champion for a second time.Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty ImagesThe same man who once waved the flag and was scorned for it now hawked millions of countertop grills bearing his name. He starred in aprimetime network TV sitcom. He named all five of his sons George. He leaned into the myth and made it charming. In doing so, he reshaped the cultural meaning of his image – from the quiet bruiser to thejoyful elder statesman, a symbol of resilience, reinvention and a kind of pragmatic hope. There’s a credible argument that he succeeded Bill Cosby as America’s dad.We should not forget, nor flatten, the radical clarity of Smith and Carlos’s gesture. Nor should we mistake Foreman’s act for anything it was not. But perhaps we can now make room for both. Black patriotism has never been a monolith; it has always contained tension, ambiguity, contradiction. Some express it through protest, others through perseverance. A fist raised, a flag waved – both can be acts of love, not of submission, but of insistence: that the country be made to live up to its promise. And in a nation that often demands that Black people perform either rage or gratitude,George Foremandared to be something else: complex.The enduring lesson of 1968 is not that one form of Black political expression is inherently more valid than another, but that the burden placed on Black athletes to symbolize a collective experience is often impossibly heavy. Every gesture is scrutinized. Every silence is interpreted. Every celebration is suspect. In that sense, Foreman’s flag was never just about joy – it was about the impossibility of being apolitical in a body already politicized by history. He did not salute a perfect America. He saluted the possibility of one.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ForemanBoxingUS sportsMuhammad AliJoe FraziercommentShareReuse this content"

In a society often fixated on material pursuits and instant gratification, fasting provides a sense of contentment that cannot be found in worldly possessions.As I walk past restaurants and the aromatic coffee shops ofMelbourne, the inner struggle to resist temptation serves as a vivid reminder of what hunger and thirst must feel like to millions of people. While poverty is not as visible here as it is in other parts of the globe, this experience confronts the invisible greed that often compels us to do things we would disapprove of, were others to act in the same way.In stark contrast to the chaotic juggling of multiple responsibilities I encountered during my previous fasting experiences in Afghanistan and Pakistan,Ramadan in Australiaprovides a more relaxed rhythm to daily life. It synchronises work, rest and leisure with the movement of the sun.Fasting begins at sunriseand concludes at sunset, yet the overarching sense of being in a state of meditation lingers throughout the entire month. This immersion in a soul-cleansing process helps instil the lovely values of truthfulness, kindness and charity that endure long after Ramadan has ended.As I celebrate Ramadan reunited with my family, I’m reminded that the holy month has lessons for us all | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreIn Melbourne, the coolness of dawn feels refreshing as families prepare for a day of fasting and reflection.

The absence of mosque speakers amplifying the call to prayer in this diverse Australian community is, for many Muslim migrants, the first aspect of life in this new country that fosters harmony and coexistence.Our neighbourhood mosque’s prayer leader shared a heartwarming story of a Scottish lady who had lived next door to him for decades, kindly offering citrus fruits from her garden to the children heading to the mosque for prayers. His first sermon addressed the value of being a good neighbour and, the following day, he spoke on the importance of truthfulness in relationships to a packed mosque of people from a variety of ages, genders and cultural backgrounds.Ramadan is not merely about abstaining from food and water; it is also a time to refrain from even the smallest acts of selfishness, impatience or dishonesty in all areas of life. As stated in the second chapter of the Qur’an,al-Baqarah:Fasting has been prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may learn self-restraint.The Qur’an positions fasting as an act of worship, designed to fostertaqwa– a deeply personal sense of self-awareness, motivating individuals to continually strive to do good and avoid harm.Ramadan helps to dispel the illusion of “maturity” based solely on self-grooming or moral conduct, reminding us to pause and reflect on our words and actions. It cultivates self-discipline and a profound sense of empathy.InIslam, as in many other religions and ethical systems, faithfulness is not only about the performance of rituals – it is also about one’s behaviour and treatment of others, particularly during the challenging task of fasting. One’s true commitment and regard for others is tested in these moments.Ramadan also serves as a deadline for Muslims to “cleanse” their finances and assess their charitable giving. This practice aligns beautifully with the Australian tradition of charity and volunteerism. In a world that often appears divided, this shared commitment to giving brings people of all faiths together, united in universal values of compassion, honesty and service.Zakat, the charity obligation for Muslims, is one of the five pillars of Islam. As expressed in thishadith: “Zakat is a right that the poor have upon the rich.” The Qur’an provides a clear framework for gauging one’s wealth, instructing the faithful to set aside a minimum share for charity each year and ensuring it is given with sincerity.In this sense, truthfulness is not just about being honest with others – it is also about being honest with oneself. Performing these charitable acts with integrity during Ramadan is not merely a transient task but an opportunity to adopt a lifestyle rooted in honesty, selflessness and transformation. The act of sincere repentance, ortawbah, during Ramadan offers a chance to rid oneself of negative traits and focus on inner growth.Shadi Khan Saif is a Melbourne-based journalist and former Pakistan andAfghanistannews correspondentExplore more on these topicsRamadanOpinionIslamReligionPhilanthropyPersonal financeMelbourneVictoriacommentShareReuse this content"

If Reform is the answer, she may have to goSun 23 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 15.38 EDTShareKemi Badenoch may only be four months into her leadership, but already Westminster is talking about her successor. Nigel Farage declared over the weekend that the Conservative party leader would be“lucky to survive past June”. Of course, hewouldsay that. The Reform UK leader has a personal interest in Tory misfortune. But more concerning for Badenoch is that some in her own party are starting to ask if she’ll still be leader at the next election.Her problems are piling up. The Toriesregularly come thirdin national polls behind Reform and Labour. There is little money to go around (despite a spurt in Tory donations late last year) and redundancies at Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) are seen as inevitable. Badenoch’s performances at prime minister’s questions are regularly criticised among Tory MPs for being too scatter-gun and missing open goals. The May local elections will be the first electoral test of her leadership – and CCHQ sources are attempting some serious expectation management as they warn of losses.But perhaps worst of all for Badenoch, there are simply plenty of figures on the right who never wanted her to be party leader and have even less time for her now. Alongside Farage, rarely a week passes without Dominic Cummings – the former leave campaign supremo – taking to social media or his Substackto criticise Badenoch, recently suggesting “it’s better for the country when she’s playing iPad games all day than playing ‘policy’.” The factCummings met Faragefor dinner a few months ago has spurred excited chatter that a rightwing coup could soon be under way to push Badenoch aside. Her critics are a mix of those who find her too abrasive and those who think her shadow cabinet is too one-nation and lacks the bite to take on Reform.However, this talk has not yet caught on too widely within the party. “I don’t think she is doing that well but she’s not going anywhere at the moment,” says a former cabinet minister. Others point to her performance last week – in which she announcednet zero was “impossible” by 2050and launched a series of policy commissions – as evidence that things are improving. While Badenoch has been accused by the former Tory MP Chris Skidmore of going back on a pledge she made to a group of MPs in 2022 to back the net zero target, many of the current intake welcome the move as a way of taking the fight to Reform. “Her position is much stronger than a few weeks ago,” says a member of the shadow cabinet. Even the Badenoch critics are keen to downplay talk of her imminent exit. “Angela Rayner has saved Kemi,” says one Conservative source, pointing to the limited number of local council elections after local government changes. “The most difficult votes have been postponed so May won’t be the crunch point.”Yet while the Tory mood is far from regicidal, there are long-term questions being asked about Badenoch’s leadership. “There are things she should do to increase her survivability,” says one Tory MP. “Net zero was one good thing in a desert of five months – and she needs the self-awareness to understand that and then the ability to respond.”But the first step is perhaps understanding the forces that will be working against her. As well as the odd explosion from Cummings or Farage, Badenoch has to contend with the likely launch of a campaign group in the next few weeks that will argue for an electoral pact between Reform and the Tories. For now, the campaign is loosely referred to as “unite the right”. However, a different official title is expected – to be revealed at the launch.On paper, a mix of supporters of Reform and theConservativespointing at the polling and making the point that there could be an argument for the two parties working together isn’t that sinister. However, the reason this poses a threat to Badenoch is that she has come out firmly against a pact and there is no love lost between her and Farage. “If we have to work with Nigel – and the current polls suggest the Reform vote is too sticky to not – you can’t have Kemi as leader,” says a former government adviser. They argue that Badenoch’s leadership style is too abrasive, even if she did change tack.It’s here that a game of fantasy leader tends to happen. Names being floated as Reform-friendly Tory leaders include Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick. Jenrick – who lost to Badenoch in the leadership contest – is these days seen as the most likely successor were Badenoch to go. While the shadow justice secretary has his critics – particularly among Badenoch loyalists – he is slowly but surely winning round some through his hard work. He is far and away the shadow minister making the biggest impact when it comes to social media, policy work and setting the news agenda.“Some of the shadow cabinet are jealous of Rob [Jenrick] as he keeps making news but he is also working a lot harder,” argues a Tory MP. A Jenrick ally adds: “Rob is willing to work all hours unlike some – and it shows.” Others pine for Boris Johnson – but for now this is yet to be a real movement. “It’s the same people as before talking up Boris and they will say, ‘Oh, he stopped Farage,’” says one Tory MP. “He also oversaw increased legal migration.”It’s why, for now, Badenoch’s inner-circle plan to ignore the noise and focus on showing MPs they have a plan through their actions. “It’s the same people mouthing off. They’re like the Japanese soldiers who didn’t know the second world war had ended and were trying to keep it going,” says a Badenoch ally. Instead, Badenoch hopes that the cracks appearing in the Reform party sinceRupert Lowe’s exitmean most of the drama will be coming from the other side.Yet there are small signs that the Tory leader recognises she will need all the friends she can get in the long term: she has recently started lunches with MPs after prime minister’s questions. Given Badenoch takes issues with sandwiches (previouslytelling me they were not a real food), the food of choice is pizza. She ultimately knows that while she has breathing space for now, that will change if she can’t point to progress in the coming year. If the Tories stay third in the polls, her critics won’t find it too hard to win supporters for their cause.Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political editorExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionConservativesNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

When will ministers wake up?John HarrisA day with a care worker in Bury showed me the intolerable pressures of her life – and then I heard the news of a new squeeze on benefitsSun 23 Mar 2025 08.08 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 10.48 EDTShareJust under a fortnight ago,my working day beganat 6.45am, on a silent cul-de-sac near Bury, in Greater Manchester. I was there to shadow Julia, a domiciliary care worker, on her daily morning rounds. She was about to let herself into the home of a 93-year-old woman. “She’ll be asleep in bed,” Julia told me. In 30 packed minutes, she had to wake her up, get her dressed, deal with any overnight accidents and mishaps, make her breakfast and “have a good chat with her, and get her communicating”.Julia was in the middle of a seven-day working week, with between 10 and 15 “clients” to look after on each shift: elderly people, mostly, but also a 42-year-old mum of two recovering from a stroke. And as we drove from house to house, she explained the tension that runs through her working life: between the squeezed budgets that dictate how she does her job, and the profoundly human needs that she has to see to.In all our conversations, a few key themes were present. Bury council, like so many local authorities, is in dire straits. Just over a year ago, it declared that it was in a state of “financial distress”, and there are no signs of anything improving. Its care spending is impossibly stretched; the people who deliver such a vital service are usually paid £12 an hour, and their workloads are mind-boggling. Spreadsheets drawn up by local bureaucrats dictate the quickfire schedules that have to be followed, and the few moments when care workers can find time for meaningful human contact.To cap it all, with the start of a new financial year, the company Julia works for is about to be hit by Rachel Reeves’s rise in employers’ national insurance contributions. Only last week,Labour voted down Liberal Democrat amendmentsto the relevant legislation aimed at exempting hospices, GP surgeries and care providers from the increase, soa huge jump in costsis about to hit all those services. In Bury, as with lots of other places, that might push the kind of work Julia does to breaking point.In the early afternoon, I paid a visit to the offices of Homecare Services, the company that employs her, and spoke to Leanne, one of its managers. In its two-room offices in the centre of the town of Ramsbottom, there was a palpable sense of emergency. “Our accountants are looking to see how long we can hold on for before we have to say enough’s enough, and give notice to the local authority,” she said. “There’s only so long you can pay the wages if you’re not getting the funding.” She paused. “The social care sector will break … it’ll maybe sustain [itself] for a matter of months before people close down.”We were a long way from Whitehall, but it was clear how decisions made in the all-powerful Treasury are playing out in people’s everyday lives. As usual, reports about this week’s spring financial statement and the likelihood of even more bad news have centred onReeves’s fiscal rulesand predictions made by the Office for Budget Responsibility, but there is a much more human story woven into everything. In the real world, mounting numbers of people are simply scared. Many are also baffled about why ministers are constantly averting their eyes from the human costs of their decisions.2:03Keir Starmer defends calling benefit cuts plan 'moral' – videoSince thecutting of pensioners’ winter fuel payments last year, the government has developed a habit of behaving like that. Senior Labour people no longer speak the language of hope, or even reassurance. Increasingly, this feels like an administration that exists to enforce fiscal orthodoxy and issue bureaucratic edicts framed by abstractions: “tough decisions”, the need to “kickstart the economy” and an all-consuming quest to “bring stability to the public finances”.Which brings us to a story that began to boil over when I got back from that social care trip: all thoseproposed cuts in disability and sickness benefits. Last week, I spoke to someone from the National Autistic Society about what the much-reported “tightening” of people’s eligibility for personal independence payments (Pip) would mean for the daily living component of the benefit, which is one of those about to be hacked back.Here, once again, was a story about complicated human lives being subject to metrics so cold and impersonal that they look almost absurd. When they are assessed, people are given a series of marks between zero and 12 for their ability to do things summarised inso-called descriptors, such as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” or “needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to wash or bathe”. In the current system – and how surreally bureaucratic is this? – a minimum score of eight entitles people to the lower rate of £72.65 a week, while a total score of 12 or over entails the higher weekly rate of £108.55.Social care sector faces collapse as NICs and wage rises loom, providers warnRead moreBut not any more, if the government gets its way. To quote fromthe new benefits green paper, “only those who score a minimum of four points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip”. What that ignores is people with more nuanced needs whose deficits and impairments nonetheless amount to something real and debilitating, which is often true of learning disabilities or autism. We have ended up, in other words, with a redefinition of disability completely driven by the need to save cash.When the Tories were in charge, there was a clear narrative about their brand of austerity, and how awfully they treated so many vulnerable people: it was to do with the cruelties and ignorance that come with privilege. NowLabouris in power, the story has changed: there is a clear sense of Labour being the party of bureaucrats and bean counters, still clinging to the old statist idea that society’s complexities can be captured in statistics, and policy should be all about technocratic efficiency and competence. We can now see the results of that thinking: a profoundly unempathetic style of government, disconnected from the messiness and complexity of real life.Given that there is a lot of talk about changes to special educational needs provision andreform plans for the NHS, we should worry about what the government might focus on next. Equally alarming, it seems to me, is a belief in Downing Street that reviving the UK demands embracing the wonders of artificial intelligence, whichKeir Starmer believeswill have an almost magical effect on everything from social work to education, and realise his new dream of “totally rewiring government”. Because this is an administration so lacking in everyday humanity, that is a much more scary prospect than he and his colleagues seem to realise.John Harris is a Guardian columnistJohn Harris’s new book, Maybe I’m Amazed: A Story of Love and Connection in 10 Songs, is published this Thursday.

The first: Labour’s ceaseless repetition about its terrible legacy has led itsarmy of criticsfrom left and right almost to dismiss the profundity of our economic plight as political staging. Yet a succession of feckless, intellectually bankrupt Conservative governments really did leave a disastrous mess.The second: while there must be a determined response, it must be more than regressing to the Gradgrind orthodoxies of the penny-wise, pound-foolish “Treasury brain”. A Labour government must have a credible political vision and some imaginative, progressive ways of finessing the desperate need for more resources for defence, together with repairing our overstretched public services; of boosting growth and raising extra revenue that does not provoke electoral wrath. It’s not just the Labour party and its voters that expect this – so dofinancial markets, which understand that economic and political credibility are intertwined.Turn to the first truth – that Britain lives on a tightrope. Our international accounts have been in the red continually since 1984, paid for by selling off land, companies and property to foreigners, so we now dangerously owe the rest of the world increasingly more than it owes us. At home, the last primary overall government budgetary surplus was in 2000. The national debt is about 100% of GDP; annual interest payments exceed £100bn and represent close to 4% of GDP. Productivity is poor and its growth paltry. Our stock market ails, with very few hi-tech growth companies. Britain is not the US or Germany, which can and now do take fiscal risks: we are an outlier economy, certainly with some underlying strengths in our innovation and our science base, but essentially vulnerable.To stem the possibility of a financial market attack, whoever runs the British government would be compelled to forecast that day-to-day public spending is more than matched by day-to-day tax receipts within a five-year foreseeable future. This is not some performative fiscal rule that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has willingly imposed on herself to prove her iron credentials; it is an indispensable, minimal guarantor of our creditworthiness and sovereign autonomy.Thus the expected broad outlines of Wednesday’s spring statement. The Office for Budget Responsibility, given Donald Trump’s assault on the global trading system, will emphasisethe precarity of the tightropeby dramatically cutting its economic growth forecasts. By shaving the growth of departmental budgets so they show positive real growth in name only, reinforced by last week’s welfare green paper bluntly curbing the growth of health-relatedwelfare payments, the chancellor will more or less hit the necessary target of day-to-day receipts exceeding spending. With luck and a fair wind, she should avert a repeat of the Liz Truss debacle, which would shatter the government.But it’s not enough. And so to the second truth. One of the worst mistakes in politics is to imagine that the more emphatically you deny what everyone can see is inevitable enhances your credibility. Wrong. Everyone can see that British defence spending must rise to 3% of GDP or more in the immediate future. And everyone can also see there is no possibility that departmental spending in our already resource-starved public services and welfare system, driven by extensive poverty, can be further shaved to finance that necessary rise.The sure-footedness and growing confidence that Starmer has shown in handling Trump, Ukraine and the EU now needs to be shown at homeOn defence, there are three options: carve out defence from current spending totals as a separate line item; explain that geopolitics has changed the world, and argue for increased taxes not only on property wealth but higher levels of income; or apply for membership of the proposed EU defence loan scheme. Carve-outs will not fool the markets. The best option is to combine making common cause with the EU – even if there will be horse-trading over its reciprocal requests over student visas and/or fishing access – while also simultaneously levying higher taxes. If fair and reasoned, the electorate will accept them.Most of the revenue can be allocated to defence, but some must be found to head off another round of generalised austerity. Equally, on welfare there must be a further, and much better thought through, effort to contain its exponential growth. The best way is to have the faith to invest in people. Work opportunities for the one in five adults not working, and especially for the one million 16- to 24-year-olds not in education, employment or training, have to be created and funded (and people rewarded for changing their behaviour). New Labour’s successfulFuture Jobs Fundshowed the way: as a flexible principle, up to a third of the saving through getting a person off welfare and into work should be offered to the employer as a job subsidy; a third could reward those formerly out of work as a wage bonus every year they work; while only the last third should go to the Treasury. Experiment with giving young people an annual £20,000 grant to find work and training; pilots in Wales have been an astonishing success. Create a US-style Civilian Conservation Corps. Use all the leeway possible to boost public capital spending. The aim would be genuinely moral – a mobilisation to give those out of work or with disability and depression a chance to live life.Equally, there is no growth with no growth companies, a stock market flat on its back and chronically poor investment levels. A devastating recent Goldman Sachs briefing, “A very British problem – low equity ownership and potential solutions”, argues that British pension funds invest less in their own stock market than any other pension fund system in the world. The result is depressed share prices, defensive companies and too little risk capital across the board.This self-reinforcing doom loop has to be broken. Britain needs much bigger, risk-taking pension funds that can support our too buried innovation capacities. The government has embarked on this process but, amazingly, has abjured from the fastest and most effective option – boosting the publicly owned Pension Protection Fund so it can bring more, smaller pension funds under its wing. But real transformative change, short of mandating investment, is to require that tax concessions on all forms of investment saving should be conditional on investing in Britain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is also, with her irrepressible urge to solve other people’s problems and her coltish steps towards self-knowledge, one of the most endearing. Millennial women like me, who grew up watching the movie again at every sleepover, will defend her against all comers.Now,Cluelessis the latest millennial coming-of-age movie to hit the West End as a stage musical, opening to critics last week at TrafalgarTheatre. It followsMean GirlsandThe Devil Wears Prada,both of which opened in London last year, each built to replicate the success of the repeatedly revivedLegally Blonde: The Musical. (Sadly, Jennifer Coolidge has yet to cameo.)All of this would normally be reason for me to get snippy about mindless trends in musical theatre. Instead, I took one of my oldest friends from school and we had a blast. My only regret is that neither of us had the energy to replicate Cher’s yellow-and-black tweed miniskirt. Not since Shakespeare’s Malvolio first burst on to the stage in yellow cross-garters has an erotomaniac wasp look-alike left such a cultural footprint.Yet it’s not clear how long producers can keep pumping these familiar stories through the intellectual property reconfiguration mill. Teen life has changed since the turn of the millennium. The protagonists ofCluelessandMean Girlswere always defined by their deft navigation of in-group/out-group bullying, but their real-life descendants now have to handle social media, online misogyny and seemingly constant requests for nudes.Even the heroines ofLegally BlondeorThe Devil Wears Pradarepresent young women now entering an increasingly fraught and fast-paced professional landscape. (Imagine Miranda Priestly’s after-hours demands if she had access to WhatsApp, or Elle Woods and her law school tutor boyfriend filling out a post-#MeToo relationship-disclosure form.) Most notable, however, is the experience gap between high school pre and post social media. The smartphone shift turns Hollywood’s teen movies from contemporary social commentary to retro relic.Of these stage musicals,Cluelesshas the advantage in incorporating adaptation and adaptability into its story DNA. As every true fan knows, Amy Heckerling’s film was a step-by-step recreation of Jane Austen’s Regency novelEmma, with the eponymous Surrey heiress reincarnated as the queen bee of a Beverly Hills high school.Austen’s Emma had to learn that she couldn’t make illegitimate charity girl Harriet Smith any happier by crafting her into a social climber; Cher, played by a glowingly blond Alicia Silverstone, learns the same lessons on awkward school newcomer Tai (Brittany Murphy). Heckerling’s great success – alongside the zinging one-liners – was to hit each of Austen’s narrative beats as her protagonist makes the same mistakes. Changes are modernising but not structurally significant. Where Cher’s desirable classmate Christian turns out to be gay, his equivalent in Austen’s novel, Frank Churchill, is unavailable to her because he is secretly engaged to another woman. In both cases, our heroine learns the hard way that not every man is hers for the taking.Clueless, The Musicalhas had mixed reviews. As critics have noted, the sets are underwhelming for a West End show; the songs, crafted by KT Tunstall to mimic the original soundtrack, don’t always work. Yet for many millennials,Clueless, The Musicalwill deliver a reverie of 90s nostalgia so joyful, it has the power to distract us from worrying about our children’s toxic schoolrooms.That’s due in part to the perky central performance by Emma Flynn. It’s also due to one essential production decision. At no point does anyone involved in this production try to kid us that the world has changed since the 1990s. Cher and best friend Dionne still speak on brick mobile phones; when someone brings a mobile to the dinner table, it’s a shocking novelty, not a depressing norm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next to damaged boys like Jamie, Cher’s braggish suitor Elton is a pussycat.By contrast, whenMean Girls: The Musicalopened in London last year, it tried to tell a 2004 story with 2024 technology. In Meet The Plastics, an introductory number for the story’s frostiest girl-gang, anti-heroine Regina George boasts that “the filters you use all look just like me”. We’re in the world of Instagram and Snapchat and we’re told these are the cruellest teenagers known to man. Yet, while they still construct a pen-and-paper “burn book” of rumours about their classmates, not one Photoshops their victims into pornography.I do appreciate that delving fully into the world of digital sex crime might not make for the upbeat story most audiences have come to see in the West End. It does speak to the difficulty of remaking analogue tales of adolescence in a digital world. This week,Mean Girls: The Musicalannounced closing notices. It’s probably relevant that I couldn’t remember a single catchy song, but it also seemed to fall irredeemably between two stools. Was it a tale of adolescence past, or present?The issue of social media isn’t the only challenge that these teen comedies dodge. BothMean GirlsandCluelessexcise any reference to a character offending a protected class, which means we lose the epic description of Christian as a “disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streisand ticket-holding friend of Dorothy”. (Surely, what matters in the movie is that Cher immediately accepts him as a friend?) Cher’s most shameful moment no longer includes an expression of racism towards her housekeeper, perhaps because a modern audience would find it harder to accept her atonement.The result is a rose-tinted, effervescent show that avoids any relationship with modern reality. Our nostalgia for 90s films is a nostalgia for a simpler teenage time. At some point, however, we can no longer keep rehashing the same teen stories. Some darker musicals have begun to explore growing up online:Dear Evan HansenandBe More Chillcome to mind. Are we ready forEuphoria: The Musical,in the spirit of the cult TV series about school-age pill-popping and sexual violence?

To which you might retort: so what? Everyone knows the weekly bout of mouth-to-mouth combat between prime minister and leader of the opposition is a theatrical ritual. The typical voter deplores it as a load of yah-boo, signifying nothing. Only a small minority of the public tune in on a consistent basis.Mrs Badenoch’s problem is that PMQs is taken seriously by two audiences that should be important to the Tory leader. One is made up of Westminster reporters and commentators. Their verdict about who has “won” PMQs influences the overall judgment about whether a leader has forward momentum or is going nowhere. The other critical audience is made up of MPs. They crowd into the chamber for a ringside seat at the prize fight. A robust performance by a leader energises them, while a flop disheartens. More often than not, the Tory leader sends her side away feeling deflated. They were led to expect better from someone who was marketed on the basis that she had a zesty and combative personality. “She was hired because it was thought she would kick ass,” remarks a Conservative veteran. During the Tory leadership contest last autumn, one of the claims made for her by supporters was that she’d rattle SirKeir Starmer. He leaves his encounters with the Tory leader looking distinctly unrattled.Used well by the leader of the opposition, PMQs is an opportunity in parliamentary primetime to make themselves relevant to the national conversation, prosecute their case against the government and showcase themselves as a potential prime minister. After nearly five months in the role, Mrs Badenoch is still struggling to get the hang of it. Where she needs to be fresh, agile and rapier-like, she is nearly always a predictable, clunking blunderbuss. She tends to be a bit better when sheconcentratesher fire on one topic, but often takes a wildly scattergun approach. There have also been quite a lot of occasions when she has appeared surprisingly ill-prepared. Given the many troubles crowding in on the government, and given that the Labour leader is not the most sizzling performer in this format, she lands a blow on him much less often than Conservative MPs would like. As her most recent joust with Sir Keir illustrated, one of the Tory leader’s handicaps is that she has yet to find a way of framing questions about tax, spending and growth that he cannot simply swat aside by responding “they crashed the economy”, whilescorning herfor being a policy-free zone “carping from the sidelines”.It has become painfully obvious to Tory MPs that the prime minister isn’t losing any sleep worrying about Mrs Badenoch. With a grimspring financial statementcoming up and a tricky vote onreductions to disability benefitsto follow, the prime minister is more troubled by incoming brickbats from his own side than he is by the leader of the Tory party. Muttering about her performances seems to be getting to Mrs Badenoch. At a recent PMQs, she responded to ridicule from the prime minister by accusing him of “being patronising”. That he is, often dismissing her for failing “to do her homework”. But it is a mistake for the Tory leader to complain in this fashion because it concedes that she can be patronised.She is not the worst I have seen. That would be Iain Duncan Smith when he led the Tories in opposition in the early years of this century. Infamously croaky, IDS’s frequent humiliations at the dispatch box contributed to his rapid demise as Tory leader. Westminster folklore remembers William Hague as a master gladiator. He took the role in the wake of a landslide defeat for his party – so in circumstances not that dissimilar to those in which Mrs Badenoch finds herself. Though up against Tony Blair when that Labour prime minister was in his pomp, Mr Hague often got the better of their clashes because his sallies were sharply crafted to expose his opponent’s weaknesses, and came salted with a lot of wit. The jokes were sufficiently well-designed and landed to get Labour MPs to laugh with him at the expense of their government. This kept up Tory spirits when all else seemed bleak for the party. That helped him survive in the job.One of her failings has been to shrink from a full acknowledgment of the reasons that inspired so many voters to loathe her partyBeing poor at PMQs is hazardous to Mrs Badenoch’s political health because nothing else is looking good for her either. The latestpoll of pollshas the Tories languishing at 22 points. That puts them third behind Labour and Reform with a vote share even lower than it was at lastJuly’s election. Donors closing chequebooks or defecting to Reform have triggered morale-sapping job losses at Conservative HQ. Once a darling with Tory members, Mrs Badenoch’s standing among them has dived to the point where the ConservativeHome league tableplaces her behindmost of her (almost entirely unknown) shadow cabinet. On Thursday, she launched her party’s campaign for theMay local elections. With 1,600 council seats in play, along with six mayoralties, she declared that the contest would be “extremely difficult” for her party.That’s not a rousing message to put fire in the bellies of what is left of the Tory activist base.It is true, of course, that any leader would face a monumental challenge rebuilding the party in the wake of the most calamitous defeat in its long history while fending off Nigel Farage’s bid to become the primary voice of the right. Supporters plead that it is too early to judge Mrs Badenoch. “She’s still learning the game,” says one sympathetic senior Tory. More restive Conservative MPs retort that five months is enough to decide that she’s a dud. They are beginning to speculate how long she has left before their notoriously regicidal party decides to try something different.She likes topresent herselfas someone who will tell hard truths “even when it is difficult to hear”. Yet one of her failings has been to shrink from a full and frank acknowledgment of the host of reasons that inspired so many voters to so loathe her party. She has criticised predecessors for breaking their promises to lower immigration and chastised their approach to Brexit while declining to repudiate Brexit itself. That’s been about it for atonement. She has flinched from recognising that Boris Johnson debauched standards in public life nor has she expressed regret for cheering on Liz Truss as she blew up the national finances. The Tory leader has not offered the comprehensive, deck-clearing, line-drawing apology to the country that is required before voters are likely to be willing to give the Conservatives a hearing.Her attempts to attract attention come tinged with desperation, as when shemade the Truss-ish declarationto one rightwing audience that the survival of “our country and all of western civilisation” depends on the revival of the Conservative party. If that is really the case, “western civilisation” is in more trouble than I feared. It sounded like wilful contrarianism, rather than a considered position, when last week she made the assertion, without evidence, that itwill be “impossible” to achieve net zeroby 2050.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She evinces next to no interest in the kind of voter who defected from the Conservatives to Labour or the Lib Dems. “If you’re going to panic, panic about the Lib Dems, for God’s sake,” says one Tory MP. Moving closer to Farageiste positions and associating her party with Donald Trump’s Maga movement is unlikely to be attractive to centrist voters. If shifting further right is designed to win back voters attracted to Reform, it is failing. She has sometimes played into Mr Farage’s hands bystarting fightsabout which of their parties has the fewest members and whether or not politicians should do reality TV shows. I’d say he won both of those little spats. Some Tories are now openly saying that they should strike some kind of Faustian bargain with the Reform leader to “unite the right”. Mrs Badenoch sets her face against that, but will find the pressure ratcheting up unless she can convince fellow Tories that she possesses a viable route map to recovery.As for PMQs, you can say that being adept at that ultimately did a fat lot of good for William Hague. He still led the Tories to an election defeat. But Mrs Badenoch might note that at least he survived long enough to get to fight one.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionConservative leadershipConservativesKeir StarmerNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

If this were so, then it might be made to bear the burden of my experience if I could find the stamina to challenge it, and me, to such a test.”As he did so, “My relationship… to the language of Shakespeare revealed itself as nothing less than my relationship to myself and my past. Under this light, this revelation, both myself and my past began slowly to open, perhaps the way a flower opens at morning, but more probably the way an atrophied muscle begins to function, or frozen fingers to thaw.”Baldwin is one of America’s most important writers, a novelist and essayist of great acuteness and humanity, a moral conscience for the nation as he chronicled the turbulent years of the 50s and 60s. Like many of his essays,Why I Stopped Hating Shakespeareis a beautifully crafted account of Baldwin wrestling with demons, his own and those of America; a portrait of a man brimming with rage at the ferocity of the racism that encased him and struggling to find a language that could speak to his condition and help him transcend it.The sense that Shakespeare spoke the language of the oppressors, yet also a language that helped think beyond that oppression, was not unique to Baldwin. It is revealed in the way so many writers and directors from the global south have constantly reworked the 16th-century playwright to illuminate contemporary struggles and tensions. From well-known adaptations such asAkira Kurosawa’sRanand Vishal Bhardwaj’sShakespearean trilogyto lesser-known works such asBelarus Free Theatre’sKingLearandSulayman al-Bassam’sThe Speaker’s Progress, Shakespeare has long possessed a global presence. All of which gives an ironic edge to the current debate about “decolonising” Shakespeare. The controversy began when theSunday Telegraphlambasted the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT) for seeking to“decolonise” the Bard. As virtually all the documents quoted were several years old, it is unclear why this should be a news story now. Nevertheless, the issues raised deserve debate.The SBT, interim CEO Rachael North says, “is an organisation formed during the period of empire-building. We are constantly looking at the history of our collection and our interpretation of it.” Which is as it should be. Yet, framing reappraisal as a matter of “decolonising” suggests a project shaped by broader themes. And while North insists that the SBT is re-evaluating not the playwright himself but the objects for which the trust is responsible, it is difficult not to see it as a reconsideration of Shakespeare, too. “Decolonisation” has become such a voguish movement in recent years, with universities and museums tapping into the trend, and calls to decolonise everything from counselling to photography, that even some of its advocatesnow decry the “bandwagon”. To decolonise used to mean winning national independence from colonial rule. Today, it describes the desire to erase colonialism from knowledge, a desire resting on the belief that “colonial knowledge” continues to be “produced, consecrated, institutionalised and naturalised” throughout society.‘Decolonisation’ has become such a voguish movement recently... even some of its advocates now decry the ‘bandwagon’It’s a belief that runs through the project to decolonise Shakespeare. The project’s core theme, though, is a critique of the claim that there is a “universal” quality to Shakespeare’s work. “The notion of universality,” writes Helen Hopkins, an academic whose work has helped shape SBT’s decolonising project, “is deeply intertwined with imperial logic” that “privileges white Anglo-centric, Eurocentric” views. The “narrative of Shakespeare’s greatness has caused harm,” she adds, “anchored” as it is in “whiteness” and undermining “pride in native culture”.The argument draws on a longstanding critique of ideas emerging from the Enlightenment as being “Eurocentric” and “white”. In so doing, it conflates ideas and identity, the value of a claim being indexed by the group to which the claimant belongs, a perspective that ironically mirrors colonial approaches to race and knowledge.The argument also conflates the imposition of western power with ideas that might have emerged from within the western tradition but which are essential to challenging such power. It was universalism – the belief that equality, democracy and self-determination belonged to all rather than the property of a privileged few – that fuelled the great radical movements that have shaped the modern world, from anti-colonial struggles to battles for women’s rights.The problem, as many recognised, was not universalism but the exclusion of so many from universalism’s reach. “I sit with Shakespeare and he winces not,” wrote WEB Du Bois, historian, philosopher and the most important African American campaigner before the civil rights movement. “I summon Aristotle and Aurelius, with what soul I will, and they come all graciously, with no scorn nor condescension.” “Is this the life you grudge us?” he demanded of America.Troubling, too, is the insistence that claims of universalism harm “native culture”. It veers dangerously close to a perception of cultures – of “native” cultures at least – as “mummified” objects, in Frantz Fanon’s words, “put into capsules” and embraced as “authentic”, rather than as living entities continually “grasped anew” through interaction with the wider world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe African American novelist Ralph Ellison was as contemptuous of essentialist notions of culture as Fanon. A writer like Baldwin, he insisted, was the product not “of a Negro store-front church but of the library”. As was Ellison himself. It was through reading “Marx, Freud, TS Eliot, Pound, Gertrude Stein and Hemingway”, and “books which seldom, if ever, mentioned Negroes” that he had been able to “release” himself “from whatever ‘segregated’ idea I might have had of my human possibilities”.Questioning the ways in which we think of national icons and the place they occupy in our culture is always a useful task. Yet, long before the decolonial bandwagon rolled in, the appropriation of Shakespeare by myriad global cultures should have told us something about his relationship to those challenging injustice and seeking to speak truth to power.It should have warned us, too, against ways of thinking that reinscribe colonial ideas about culture and knowledge in the name of challenging such ideas. The greatness of Shakespeare, Baldwin wrote, lay in his desire “to defeat all labels and complicate all battles”.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last year, it was ITV’sMr Bates vs The Post Office, in which the plight of subpostmasters was rendered withsuch successthat it actually hastened in real-world legislation to compensate them.And now we have Netflix’sAdolescence, which looks at the online radicalisation of young boys by men’s rights activists (MRAs) such as Andrew Tate. Last week, Keir Starmer told the Commons he had been watching the series with his family and that it portrayed an “emerging and growing problem”that needed to be tackled. Now MPs are examining ideas to address the issue with greater urgency.It probably shouldn’t work like this. Policy decisions would ideally not hinge on the quality of an actor’s performance (Adolescencehad some spectacular ones, which explains its success), and whether politicians manage to catch the latest Netflix series. It makes us look a little emotionally incontinent, as a country, when the decisions of TV drama commissioners weigh quite so heavily in our politics. But the fickle spotlight of political attention has landed here, for now.The issue of rising misogyny among young boys, fuelled by online influencers, has long been troubling. If we are approaching a point that action might be taken, that is a good thing. But what should that action be? There are, roughly, two lines of thought.One is that the problem stems from an unfulfilled need among these young men – a lack of guidance, or self-esteem or of other men on which to model themselves. That was the central contention ofGareth Southgate’s Dimbleby lecturelast week. He talked of an “epidemic of fatherlessness” and the fact that boys are spending less time at youth centres and sports events where they might have met the kinds of aspirational figures Southgate looked up to: coaches, youth workers and teachers. Without this, he said, boys are driven on to the internet “searching for direction”, where they stumble on role models who “do not have their best interests at heart”.As tech geniuses devote their brainpower to keeping people engaged, algorithms are getting smarter, and online life more excitingThe other argument is that the poison starts and ends with the influencers themselves: these men are so compelling they can radicalise boys who are otherwise well looked after and have plenty to do. This is the thesis at the heart ofAdolescence. Its central character is a boy drawn into MRA culture, which eventually persuades him to kill – but he also comes from an ordinary family, with a loving father and many male role models around him. There is no trauma in his life, no abuse. As thewriter, Jack Thorne, puts it: “He comes from a good background, like me; he’s a bright boy, like I was. The key difference between us? He had the internet to read at night whereas I had Terry Pratchett and Judy Blume.”Proponents of the first idea want investment in youth centres and mentoring programmes, and to encourage more men into teaching. These notions have much merit, and would of course be good on their own terms. But as a solution to the problem of misogyny among radicalised schoolboys, I lean more towards the ideas offered by the second school of thought: getting them away from their smartphones.Here’s one indication that youth clubs may not be the answer: online culture is not merely compensating for the real world, but outcompeting it. As tech geniuses devote all their brainpower to keeping people engaged, algorithms are getting smarter, and online life more exciting. I’ve previously written about the similarities betweensocial media and casino slot machines: both use league tables, points, lucky streaks and rewards to get the dopamine pumping and keep us hooked. A survey last week of 14- to 17-year-olds found 40% spentat least six hours a day online– the equivalent of a school day. This is not just about a lack of other options. These platforms take the stimulus to socialise – recognition, inclusion, approval – and gamify it to an addictive level. Why spend time with your friends or go to community centres when online culture is more rewarding?There’s an argument, too, that spending large chunks of your life online itself creates the preconditions for the kind of radicalisation offered by the “manosphere”. A central trait of MRA culture, for example, is that followers are obsessed with their status. But that fixation is also fuelled by social media platforms themselves, which revolve around improving your social standing and projecting it to others. That is one difference with real-world socialising, where overconfidence tends to be kept in check.In the offline world, a dent to your ego can be laughed off; online it can be devastating, and longer lasting. This makes people brittle and insecure. No wonder there is an exploding online market for self-improvement and self-help, which MRA influencers tap into – promising young men routes to status and approval.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And now enter Tate and his ilk, with a package of promises: status, female attention and a target for resentment. You can see why this might be hard to resist.Is it time for the government to restrict teenage access to social media? A bill that campaigners hoped would ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers was watered down earlier this month; that may have been a mistake.

Even qualified practitioners offer no guarantees. One introduced our daughter to an online forum full of arguments against psychiatric diagnosis, thwarting any progress in her mental health.It’s clear this industry is booming because there is easy money to be made. Many patients (and organisations) seem in awe of talking therapy as a concept. Our experience shows, however, that this lack of regulation is having harmful consequences.Names and address suppliedMartha Gill highlights problems the public face when looking for psychotherapy. Good psychotherapy, with a well-trained therapist, can change lives for the better. However, as the article reveals, the terms “therapist” or “psychotherapist” are not protected by law and can be used by anyone. Thankfully, some psychological professions, including practitioner psychologists and art therapists, are statutorily regulated with protected titles.No one can describe themselves as an art therapist, art psychotherapist, music therapist or drama therapist unless registered with the Health and Care Professions Council. Registration can only be achieved following successful completion of a recognised master’s level degree or master’s level apprenticeship.Voluntary accredited regulation for other modalities, through the Professional Standards Authority, has increased transparency and offers some protection. Anyone looking for therapy should ensure the person claiming to be a psychological practitioner is on one of the accredited registers, or for increased reassurance, registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.Gary Fereday, Chief ExecutiveBritish Association of Art Therapists, LondonTeachers are ‘Uberised’Teaching, and especially teaching languages online, is commodified to such an extent that even the so-called gold standard, jewel in the crown British Council is not immune (“‘Exploited teachers forced into work feeding frenzy’ by British Council”, News).Uberfication is the right word for it. As Tefl teachers, we are sick and tired of being required to get the highest qualifications yet be subjected to minimal wages and zero-hour contracts. Websites that take punishing and variable commissions are the norm.This uncertainty and exploitation has to end.

Also, after the pain of the tortuous Brexit negotiations, it is unlikely that the EU would have welcomed any attempt.However, thanks to Donald Trump and the resulting radical changes to the global situation, a golden opportunity is rapidly developing. For economic and security reasons, the UK, a nuclear power, is much more likely to be welcomed back by the EU. The EU might be prepared to put an offer to the UK for our return on broadly the terms of our previous membership, including hopefully some or all of the opt-outs. The offer could be put to a referendum.David NewensGreat Linford, Milton KeynesEel Pie was a jazz hotspot tooThough Eel Pie Island may have been a venue for rockers and royalty, some octogenarians might recall it was the hot destination in the late 1950s of traditional jazz royalty such as Ken Colyer, Chris Barber, Acker Bilk and George Melly (“Loved by rockers and royals, Eel Pie Island threatened by flood ruling”, News). Riverboat shuffles from Westminster pier to the island were favourite weekend gigs for fans when trad jazz was in its heyday.David HandleyGargrave, North YorkshireTaking my cash elsewhereSo Zizzi, Gails and Itsu don’t want the disabled or young kids who don’t have bank cards? I was intrigued to see from your article on cash-free shopping that these business feel they can legally positively discriminate against the disabled (“‘A fundamental right’: UK high street chains and restaurants challenged over refusal to accept cash”, News).This policy is discriminatory and excludes everyone with difficulties in remembering pin codes or indeed those without a bank card. This includes those who, while able in many ways, are not able to fully manage their own financial affairs. I’m boycotting all these chains – if they are discriminatory and don’t take cash I’ll take my business elsewhere.John JenkinsThame, OxfordshireMines and the seven dwarfsSnow White’s seven dwarfs are unlikely to have suffered from achondroplasty. It is generally caused by a rare mutation, so unlikely to have a cluster in one small community (“‘It’s controversial and polarising’: is Disney’s new Snow White a poisoned apple?” Focus).The story was first collected by the brothers Grimm near the Carpathian mountains where gold and silver mining was common. The mines also contained radioactive ores. Radiation exposure in early adolescence leads to premature fusion of the bony epiphyses preventing further growth, a different form of dwarfism.Dr Michael PeelLondonJust who was it in my seat?Julian Barnes’ memory about Howard Hodgkin’s black towel put me in mind of a contretemps I had with the late artist at the theatre 25 years ago (“We remember as true things that never even happened”, New Review).

In 2011, he smuglydismissedthe Chinese carmaker as unimpressive, its products unattractive and its technology “not very strong”. He’s not laughing now – and not just because Tesla’s stock has plummeted amid aboycottby motorists protesting against his embrace offar-rightpolitics. More pressingly, Mr Musk, like other western carmakers, has beenoutpacedby BYD.Last week, the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturerunveilednew charging technology that, it says, is capable of delivering 400km (249 miles) of driving range in just five minutes – as quick as filling up a petrol car. The system, released next month, will be fitted in two EVs, priced from 270,000 yuan (£29,000) – comparable to Tesla’s most affordable model in China. Yet BYD claims toquadrupleTesla’s kilometres-per-minute charging rate. Technological supremacy at a competitive price may help to explain whyBYDnow sells seven times as many cars in China asTesla.A lack of fast-charginginfrastructuremaydelayBYD’s progress in the west. But that shouldn’t diminish the scale of China’s technological advance. It was only in 2015 that Beijing launched itsMade in China 2025plan, targeting 10 strategic industries – including EVs – for rapid indigenous development. China’s approach follows a familiar playbook. Just as theUS once did, China shifted from exporting raw materials to becoming a manufacturing powerhouse by protecting domestic industries, acquiring foreign technology – sometimes dubiously – and prioritising exports. Taking cues from history, Beijing has used tariffs, subsidies and state investment to dominate industries from steel and electronics to EVs.When a country rapidly monopolises export markets, its industrial dominance becomes inevitable. That advantage has often hardened into a global stranglehold over key industries. With itscommandingedge inEVs, China’s leadership is poised to set the rules and dictate, on its own terms, the future of the technology. It did so on the cheap: BYD reportedly receivedChinese government subsidiesworth about a quarter of the $15bn that Mr Musk’sTesla obtained from US authorities.Thecasefor electric cars is clear. They cut emissions and pollution while preserving personal mobility. But the climate crisis raises a deeper question – not just how we power vehicles, but whether our reliance on them is sustainable. Switching to EVs is vital, but so is asking: do we need fewer car journeys, not just cleaner ones?Despite its lead in EVs, China’s30,000 milesof high-speed rail network offers a striking alternative. Meanwhile, Mr Musk’s transport visions often appear to beself-interestedsleights of hand. His high-speed transportation system,Hyperloop, was never meant to be built – its true success was in derailing California’s high-speed rail project. His Boring Company is building a 68-mileundergroundsystem in Las Vegas, primarily, it seems, because regulators agreed to minimal oversight.There’s an old joke about dictators: at least the trains run on time. Can a democracy taken over by oligarchs manage eventhat? China has high-speed rail; Mr Musk has acoupleof miles of tunnels under Nevada. But supposed “authoritarian competence” is not the answer. Only morecapable, more democratic government – the kind Mr Muskscorns– can reverse the US’s steady loss of economic, industrial, technological and governance competitiveness.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsOpinionTeslaChinaSelf-driving carsTravel and transportElon MuskeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Now, happier and more free than ever, she’s found her feet – and her voice – at her healing retreat in the Welsh valleysSun 23 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 11.47 EDTShareWhenCharlotte Churcharrives, she starts to cry. “I break down,” she says, “every time I reach here. It’s the first thing I do when I set foot on this soil.” It’s a two-hour drive from her home in Barry to The Dreaming, the retreat centre she opened in 2023, a pilgrimage across Bannau Brycheiniog and into the myth-steeped hills of the Elan Valley in Powys, central Wales. “Two to three weeks,” she’s explaining, icy ground crunching underfoot, “is the longest I can stay away before I start clucking. As I get closer, I feel myself relaxing, a calm coming over me, my nervous system resetting.” That bodily response, she’s sure, is physiological. Tears stream. “This land holds me like nothing else. It feels like coming home; I’m enveloped here.”It’s early January when I visit. Through the small market town of Rhayader and out into dramatic landscapes, snow-dusted peaks atop rolling hills. A hand-carved sign marks a single-track turning. Through morning mist, The Dreaming comes into view: a three-storey manor almost built into the valley, flanked by moss-lined rocks and woodland. Fresh from being photographed alfresco, Church greets me outdoors: “It’s bloody lush, love, isn’t it?”It sprawls to 50 acres, 33 of it Celtic rainforest. We pass the waterfall, Nant Gorwen, and yomp deeper into the trees. There’s such joy in her voice as she talks about the seasons changing and wildlife here, and what it means to be this land’s custodian. Visiting practitioners run workshops: womb yoga, willow weaving, night-sky gazing; retreats for grief, queer people, goddesses and another she’ll be leading with “two other witches”.It’s tempting to be cynical, but Church is aglow, at ease with herself: in a flowy sky-blue dress, sheepskin coat and cowboy boots, the 39-year-old has gone full Earth Mother. There’s a yurt down by the redwoods where Church stays when on-site. “Then in the morning, I’ll come up here and sing to the land.”View image in fullscreen‘Voice of an angel’: Charlotte Church at the height of her popularity in in 1999.Photograph: Alamy/AllstarAnd that is…? She grins. “Going round the land and having a little sing at it,” she says, “obviously.” A burst of laughter. “It can be whatever you want it to be.” She looks around then hums, a mournful, melancholic tune. “It’s a dialogue to connect with nature, but your own emotions, too. So much of the time we’re in the dark. Start to sing, everything comes to the surface.”Church opened The Dreaming to offer respite to guests. Really, though, it became immediately clear, for Church it’s also a much-needed sanctuary. For years, she took regular, vicious poundings in the tabloid press. A child star, her early classical albums went multiplatinum worldwide. In adulthood, record releases have been less forthcoming. “Part of all this for me has been having the time to cocoon and to heal my wounds inflicted in that exposure. I was made such tabloid fodder, for such long periods of time, lots of people just saw me as a celebrity.” A pause. “A piss-head celebrity, really. It was a time with lots of misogyny flying about, especially towards working-class women, or women who were outspoken.”She came of age in the early noughties: lad mags, body-shaming, a rabid tabloid press capable of unrestrained cruelty. “I was out there, in a toxic culture and environment. I have had to rehabilitate my little creative self. I think I was really exploited. My artistry and talent wasn’t taken seriously. It’s taken some time to remember that Iaman artist; to refind my own creativity.”In November 2020, Church came with her newborn to Rhydoldog House – on the market as a private, residential property – to look around. “It was out of my price range,” she says. “I was just here for a nose: this used to be Laura Ashley’s gaff.” Church was hunting for something else entirely. “A glamping thing, to house an educational, family holiday place.” A neat follow-on from theAwen Project, the free-to-attend, democratic forest school she co-founded in 2019, focused on reconnecting families and rewilding childhood. “And on a personal level, I also didn’t want to have to make a living from show business any longer. I wanted to make art and music, but not be reliant on celebrity; to live more in line with my values. With the money I had left, I wanted to invest in the land.”View image in fullscreen‘I was really exploited. I have had to rehabilitate my little creative self’: Charlotte Church.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The ObserverArriving here, she felt a pull. “I cancelled everything else, I knew right away, I could feel it.” We come to a halt. “I stood right here,” says Church, “on this very spot, and realised: ‘Ah, right,thisis my life now.’” She waves at the thick, verdant forest ahead. “I had this vision of people full of wonder, play and joy here. I could see women with their feet in the waterfalls crying; writing love-letters to themselves in the trees. What exactly I’d do with a whopping great house I couldn’t afford in need of complete renovation? I didn’t have a fucking clue.” The plot cost £1.5m. “I was going to have to put myself in a really precarious position. Friends and family said I was mental.” They’d be proved right: budgets were blown; Church sunk her life savings long before planning permission was granted. “We’re not breaking even yet here. I’ve taken a lot of financial risk. But I fell in love, and that was it.”Still and silent, we stand, for a minute, absorbed by nature. “Right, love,” she interrupts, “you have a wander around the woods and I’ll meet you inside. I’m busting for a wazz, see.”I’m shown aroundthe house by Naoko, the general manager. Guest bedrooms are upstairs. Below, there’s a workshop, library and office, all wooden floorboards, candles and draped curtains; earth tones, gongs everywhere. In the refectory, two long tables. A blackboard sets out the next retreat’s schedule: “celestial blessings” in the elemental garden; “farewells at the fairy door”, etc. Church appears with a loaf of bara brith. “Fancy a tea?” She sings to herself as she puts the kettle on to boil: “I’m a little teapot, short and stout…”“This land, this project,” she continues, “has taught me a lot.” There’s the practical side of running a business, yes. “I didn’t have a fucking clue, but also about myself. I’ve always been incredibly open, porous as a cloud. Which is sort of insane, considering how much shit I’ve had thrown at me. Here, I’ve learned to have boundaries.”View image in fullscreen‘I was growing up, getting a hold of myself, with a towering brain box partner by my side’: Charlotte Church and Jonathan Powell in 2017.Photograph: Polly Thomas/Bafta/ShutterstockHow so? “I’d always been very free with my trust and care,” she says. “I’m the opposite of misanthropic. I’ve a deep love for people, even when they’ve been awful. I always held that as a badge of honour. That no matter what happened to me, I kept faith. Only, it’s really fucking naive.” She laughs from the belly. “I do still have that,” she clarifies, “but also, get real, babe.”Being here has taught Church just how desperately she longed for an escape; a place to shelter and take refuge. First, from the strains of family life. She lives with her two teenagers, four-year-old and husband, Jonathan Powell. “I love being a mother, but it’s complicated… bringing up teenagers.” She recently relocated in part to be close to family. “Looking after the rest of them is a lot, particularly my dad, who is terminally ill.” Her stepfather, James, has AL amyloidosis, a rare disease affecting the internal organs. Church’s mum has bipolar, and her parents separated when she was two. Her biological father, Stephen, from whom she was estranged, died of coronavirus in 2021.“It means I have a massive amount of care duties,” says Church. “I’m back and forth from the hospital, and lots of other things are going on with my extended family. So coming here is a balm. It’s also allowed me to become more of who I am, to drop some of the façade and pretence.”Primarily, for Church, that has meant being more forthright in her politics. Since her 20s, she has been outspoken. Proudly left-wing, her activism traversing anti-austerity movements, the climate crisis, Palestine: “I’m less afraid of what people think about all that now.” At times, she used to feel almost embarrassed about her ideals. “I’d make out like I couldn’t help that I cared, or act like I was just being rebellious. Now, I feel more backed up, stepping into my integrity. The only way we’ll sort out the right fucking mess the world is in is to come back together, in community. There is no alternative and I will battle until my last breath to do it.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m proud that I’ve survived. That even as a little one, I’ve had courage’: Charlotte Church at The Dreaming.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/The ObserverA colleague plonks down a plate of roast dinner in front of Church. “Do you mind if I munch?” she asks, tucking in. “I’m absolutely fucking ravenous.”Church can tracethat steadfast spirit back to her Cardiff childhood. “My family,” she says, “instilled a fierceness in me: that we fight and love and live with every fibre of our beings. And a sense that you have to battle – my family has struggled for generations; there are scars and intergenerational trauma. I grew up with this sense of who we were, as a working-class family. There was a lot of humour and music, alongside the really fucking dark shit.”Church was just 11 when she landed her music industry break, singing a phone-in rendition of Pie Jesu onThis Morningin 1997. That same year, she performed on an ITV talent show. It catapulted her to international fame: the nation’s sweetheart, “voice of an angel”. Within 12 months, she’d released her first classical album. She performed with orchestras around the world. Music itself, she always adored. “But I was in a hardcore capitalist machine,” says Church. “A child star in a psychological grinder making a lot of money for big corporations. Sure, I fucking hated bits, but I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m deeply grateful for it, what a privilege.”As she approached her late teens, however, the tabloid press made Church the subject of obsessive attention. There were hidden cameras outside her home, fake stories galore, up-skirting attempts by paparazzi. She believes a suicide attempt by her mother was “at least in part” down to a looming story about the family. Radio DJ Chris Moyles publicly offered totake her virginityas she turned 16, the age of consent. TheSunpublished a story about her pregnancy before Church had even told her family. “I feel my character,” Church says, “the narrative of who I was in the world, was taken from me, and made into something salacious, or something to be ridiculed.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to do something’: Charlotte Church marching with pro-Palestinian supporters in Bath in 2024.Photograph: AlamyShe’s confident that “this isn’t me being overly sensitive”. Take her appearance onQuestion Timein 2015. “I suggested, as was being presented in research at the time, that climate change and drought played a role in war breaking out in Syria.” It was a position posited by a host of experts. “When I said it, it was all over the papers: ‘Voice of an Angel, Brain of Angel Delight: Charlotte Church blames climate change for jihadis.’ I’ve been made into this caricature: sexualised, patronised, ridiculed.”In 2011, Church detailed the effects in evidence to theLeveson inquiry. “I started to understand deeply what the experience me and my family had at the hands of the press really was,” she says. “How dramatic and painful and shaming and ugly it was for us all. It really politicised me, seeing the insidious relations between police, press and government. Especially meetingMilly Dowler’s family. It ignited that fierceness in me, latent before then, maybe, but deep within the female line of my family: right, fuck you fuckers, I’m coming for you all.”For a while, the attacks intensified. “It was revenge,” Church believes. “They tried to discredit me as hard as they could. To make me a figure of ridicule who was thick, and a tart, and a drunk.” The diatribes, she’s sure, were brimming with classism and misogyny. “Now don’t get me wrong, I got myself into certain…” She comes to a stop, reassessing. “Well did I, actually? I mean, I had sex. I went clubbing with friends. Only the tabloids were always right there, poised to orchestrate any sort of downfall.”Through her 20s, Church had become an impassioned activist. “It started with having kids. It started to prickle things in my soul. Thinking about society – about others – in a way I hadn’t as a pretty egocentric teenager.” Church had her first of two children with rugby player Gavin Henson at 21. The couple split in 2010.She met her current husband 15 years ago. “We started writing music together.” He plays guitar and viola. “He really introduced me to the more formal political sphere. Before then, I’d never voted; I wasn’t remotely interested. I felt it had nothing to do with me, aside from being certain I paid too much tax when I was a teenager.” Aged 14, at the Labour party conference, Church set out this very stall to Tony Blair, then prime minister.I still dance my tits off, regular, do not worry. I’m not  rebrandingSo when the media intrusion escalated after Leveson, Church felt emboldened. “I was growing up, getting a hold of myself, with a towering brainbox partner by my side,” she says. The pair jointly wrote her statement after she settled her phone-hacking claim against theNews ofthe Worldin 2012 for£600,000. The now-defunct paper admitted her voicemails were hacked repeatedly over a number of years, and that they’d “unlawfully obtained” then published “private medical information” about Church and her mother. “They basically forced us to settle,” says Church, “otherwise I’d have happily taken it all the way and tried to nail them to the floor. But they were putting my mother in far too much danger.” She cuts herself off. “I can’t really talk about that, blah blah blah. More tea, love?”The tabloid drubbings have died down in recent years. Based on the speed at which any sniff of a story spreads across gossip columns and sidebars-of-shame, it’s likely to be a consequence of Church’s relative absence from the public eye, rather than a lack of malintent or interest. Her recent public positions on Palestine have, however, attracted headline-making criticism.Today, she’s wearing a keffiyeh; Church has spoken at marches, fundraised and performed at Palestine solidarity events. “What’s happening there,” she says, “is the greatest spiritual awakening of our time. Children are being killed in the most cruel way. To me, it’s an absolute no-brainer.” Loud and public accusations of antisemitism have been directed her way. “It’s unpleasant to weather those things,” she says, “have my name dragged through the mud and my family’s security put at risk. But what else is there?” She’s resolute. “I don’t know what the alternative is – its so fucking serious.”And then, of course, there’s all of this. Does she not worry about being painted as a hippy-dippy tree-hugger? She sips her herbal tea. “I don’t mind being castigated or ridiculed for it,” Church says. She leans in, and drops into a whisper. “Because I know the gold, the feeling. How much more enriched life becomes when you embark on this journey. There’s such beauty here, living in the world this way.”I know the gold, the feeling. How much more enriched life becomes when you embark on this journeyWith that same resolve, she’s making new music, too. “I’m going to release an album,” she says, “hopefully, in 2026.” It’ll be her first since 2010. It doesn’t sound like a commercial proposition – “I’m meeting indigenous elders in Peru, Burkina Faso, Australia… I want to sing about nature, healing and sisterhood” – but that’s of little concern. “I want to create experiences,” she says, “to really make peoplefeel. Pop Dungeon did that, in a way.” Long, sweaty nights spent dancing to the cover band she frontedbecame the stuff of legend. “We would get people excited, ecstatic and into hysteria. So much of modern society is trying to manufacture a minor emotional reaction from you with fake shit. To really whip people up in music, song and rhythm is the greatest magic.”We speak foralmost two hours about sound healing, creating ritual and communing with the cosmos. It’s striking how appealing she makes it all sound: not preachy or tiringly tedious. She’s foul-mouthed, quick-witted, great company. In this new dawn, Church is still a laugh, basically.“Listen,” she makes clear, “I’m not holier-than-thou. Life is difficult; do what you need to do to get through it. All last year I was smoking.” She’s now quit again. “I have, naturally with age, stopped going out drinking so much. But I still dance my tits off, regular, do not worry. Just now, it’s less drunk in a club, more at home with friends, or at 6am, alone on a beach, absolutely shaking my arse as an act of devotion. So no, I’m not rebranding.” A shake of the head. “I fucking hate all the pious wellness industry shite. So much of that multi-billion-dollar pile of crap says ‘do this’, ‘buy that’, ‘subscribe to me’, ‘swallow a pill’, and this result will happen. It’s all bollocks.” She gestures out the window. “All this is much more esoteric. We’re not trying to get people to subscribe to a programme. It’s not all peace, love, light; stillness and meditation. It’s exploration. Have a go, and see what works.” That’s been Church’s approach. “I’m not an expert, I’m just following my nose and intuition.”She knows it could have gone so differently: child star turned tabloid target. “I’ve certainly done my hard yards,” she says. “I’m proud that I’ve survived. That even as a little one, I’ve had courage.” The sun is starting to set. Her yurt awaits. One final question.When Church first set foot here, feeling all she did, was she not tempted to snap it up for herself? Shut the world out and raise her family? She smiles, then turns towards the dusk-drenched valley. “Well,” she replies, “I’m a socialist. I believe in public luxury. Ever since I was a little girl, I’ve been driven to heal and help. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that the early Celtic and religious songs I sang were found by many to be healing.” What she’s doing now feels full circle. “I see people suffering, whether in my immediate network of family and friends, or out among my kin and peoples. I want to do something about it. That first day, I asked: how could this beauty belong to one family? It might be the way it is in the world today, the wealthy owning vast swathes of the best of nature, but it’s bullshit. This beauty right here is a thing for sharing.”For more about The Dreaming, visitthedreaming.co.ukThis article was amended on 23 March 2025.

It’s not so much the clumsy attempts to defuse the political insensitivity of the original cartoon that sinks the movie. The problems are more fundamental, starting with the fact that this is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen: it has the look of an AI-created migraine and is awash with sentiments so sappy that you rather wish the huntsman would just get over his moral scruples and put us all out of our collective misery.

Still, it is an entertaining and enlightening ensemble work that captures the delicate moment in 17th-century stage history when these pioneering women straddled empowerment and economic independence with sexual objectification and hostile moral judgement.Nell Gwyn, played spiritedly by Zoe Brough, is famously known to be among these early female actors, but De Angelis draws out several others stories and plaits five lives together, on and off stage. There is Mrs Betterton (Anna Chancellor, giving a glinting performance), something of an elder who brims with stage wisdom and technique; Mrs Marshall (Katherine Kingsley), a steely type whose former affair with an earl has left her vulnerable to heckling and attack; Mrs Farley (Nicole Sawyerr), who starts off as a soapbox Christian before taking to the stage; and finally Doll (Doña Croll), who assists them.Michael Oakley’s production brings them to live with charm and economy as they talk about their jobs, loves and dreams, as well as the work being staged by the King’s Company: the Scottish play, Othello the Moor and “Hamlet the Ditherer”. They perform snatches of shows in front of invisible 1660s audiences, and it is a mixed bag from Cleopatra to Amazonians, sometimes leaning into sexualised stereotypes with archness. It is in the backstage drama that they come most to life – although their interpersonal stories are drawn with rather too light a touch.View image in fullscreenWisdom and technique … Anna Chancellor as Mrs Betterton.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThere is camaraderie, confidences and competition – the competition being mostly between Gwyn and Farley, who first catches the eye of the king before he turns his attentions to Gwyn. A host of issues are covered, from ageism in the theatre company and among the actors themselves, to the accidental pregnancies that can force these women off stage.The stories are always compelling but only slight, and the characterisation is broad-brush. But the actors elevate it, bringing warm, lively comedy. There is a limber, light touch to Fotini Dimou’s stage design too, and it works well in this space, with candle-light lowering or rising to signify when the women are on or off stage, and a sense of glitter and glamour conjured through costumes and confetti.This is a play that exudes a love of the trade, from sawdust to the stars, as well as serving as a reminder of a turning point in theatre history, when these women were regarded simultaneously as trailblazers, renegades and oddities akin to dancing bears.AtOrange Tree theatre, London, until 12 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreApril De AngelisOrange Tree theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

You only need to look at Disney’s princess industrial complex to understand that sparkle-dusted happily-ever-after is big business; that the appetite for this particular breed of magical thinking (plus associated merchandising and sequined tat) is enduringly healthy. But the beguiling,Oscar-winning, dialogue-free Latvian animationFlow, which tells of a solitary cat who must learn to cooperate with a mismatched pack of other species to survive a catastrophic flood, is a little different.The fairytale here is not the story the picture tells – it’s the story of the film itself. Created by a tiny team with a minuscule budget of about £3m, and rendered entirely on the free open-source 3D softwareBlender,Flowhas been on a journey: its premiere in Cannes; the haul of prizes (54 to date), culminating in the Oscar for best animated feature – that is the stuff of film industry fantasy.While the limited budget certainly shows on screen at times, it also gave director Gints Zilbalodis a considerable degree of creative freedom. With more money comes compromise and consensus film-making, plus a tendency to spoon-feed the audience rather than challenge them.Flow, however, embraces mystery: we see a disaster unfold in the same way the animals do – with no warning or context.All the animal sounds are real, rather than voice actors cosplayingZilbalodis has chosen not to explain the recent history of what seems to be a post-apocalyptic but stunningly verdant, geographically unspecified world. There are signs, in the lush forest, of human habitation and the remnants of civilisation. The cat lives in a house that appears to have once been home to a kitty-obsessed sculptor. Feline statues of varying sizes stand like sentinels in the grounds; a half-finished carving still rests on a workbench. But whether the former inhabitant has been relocated or is long since dead – perhaps along with the rest of humanity – is left open to the audience to interpret, and your reading of the background to the story very much depends on how bleakly apocalyptic your worldview is.The cat’s happy solitude in the abandoned building is interrupted by a sudden environmental disaster: rapidly rising flood waters submerge the house and the forest surrounding it. A last-minute reprieve comes in the shape of a drifting sailboat, but the cat is outraged to discover that the vessel must be shared with another passenger – an unflappable and permanently chilled-outcapybara. As the boat drifts, it takes on other creatures: an acquisitive ring-tailed lemur with a weakness for shiny trinkets; a wise but haughtysecretarybird; and an excitable goofball of a dog.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Sideshow and Janus FilmsOne of the most distinctive elements of Zilbalodis’s vision is his decision to let his animals remain animals, instead of attempting to squeeze them into the mould of personhood. The character design and animation of the creatures are where the film’s meagre budget is most evident, and yet behavioural details are minutely observed. The cat – a neat, slinky, self-contained little black moggy – is pure feline, from the insouciantly twitching tip of its tail to its testy chirrup of annoyance (all the animal sounds are real, rather than voice actors cosplaying) at having to share a space with other critters. As an alternative to stamping human personalities on them, Zilbalodis instead encourages us to see elements of ourselves in the animals.Being a self-taught animator accustomed to working on his own (his previous feature film,Away, was an entirely solo project created on his computer), the director has revealed in interviews that he identifies most with the self-sufficient cat, who must learn to cooperate with others. And anyone with a tendency to hoard accessories and to overpack when travelling will feel a kinship with the lemur.An eco-parable,Flowis not exactly mining new thematic territory; fromWall-Eto Cartoon Saloon’sMy Father’s DragontoThe Wild Robotand numerousStudio Ghiblipictures, animated movies dealing with imminent climate collapse are relatively plentiful. However, the approach ofFlow, with its animals’-eye, in-the-moment immediacy and its resistance to cutesiness and anthropomorphism, is bracingly fresh and unexpected. The animation, meanwhile, transcends its financial constraints to achieve moments of shimmering, heart-swelling loveliness.Halt Disney! Flow’s director, and fellow upstart animators, on a new era for the artformRead moreDeliberately enigmatic in approach, with its focus on tiny, cat-level details and a provocative hint that the end of humanity may not be the end of the world,Flowdoesn’t hammer home a single message. Other takeaways include the need to work together to survive, the value of adaptability – and that cats will always push stuff off tables given half the chance.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Flow.Explore more on these topicsAnimation in filmWendy Ide's film of the weekOscarsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 37-year-old actor isn’t in a performance art piece or strange social experiment, but rather starring in director Omar Elerian’s new production of Eugene Ionèsco’s 1959 absurdist play,Rhinoceros;it ishis first stage role in seven years. “It sounds mental but it’s the theatre of the absurd, so it’s meant to be baffling at points,” he says with a smile, back in human form in a white T-shirt and cap while on a break from rehearsals, where he is clearly enjoying taking on the story of a small French town whose inhabitants gradually turn into rhinos.If you have watched a British comedy over the past decade, it’s likely you’ve seen McGuire in it. The endlessly energetic performer is usually found next to the leading man, sporting a frizz of curly hair and delivering anxious one-liners or slapstick pratfalls. He has featured in everything from Netflix seriesLovesickto Richard Curtis’sAbout Timeand Emerald Fennell’sSaltburn.On stage, meanwhile, he had his breakthrough in Laura Wade’s 2010 satire on the British upper classes,Posh, playing a member of a fictionalised version of the Bullingdon Club, and has since starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in David Leveaux’s 50th anniversary production ofRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.“I was a class clown so it’s not surprising so many of my roles have been comedic,” he says, speaking in the quick nasal tone of his many characters. “But in recent years the work has been getting darker, which is welcome, since it’s nice to be morally dubious for once.” In 2022, McGuire starred as “clever asshole” Chris Clarke in the Downing Street thrillerAnatomy of a Scandal, while inRhinoceroshe is tackling material that has been read as a critique of postwar fascism, challenging the audience and its central character Bérenger to question how much people will believe and go along with – even if it means succumbing to a crash of rhinos bolting across the stage.I was drawn to Cheaters because everyone in it has committed some sort of betrayal but they’re also empathetic and lovable“The play is about groupthink and the dangers behind the ideas we might buy into,” McGuire says. “You can read it as a comment on social media and how we can become indoctrinated to follow the crowd, even if we don’t initially agree with where we’re going. But ultimately it’s the cast in a white box with no props – the audience can fill it with whatever they’re seeing and that’s the most confronting thing of all.”While his role as Jean inRhinocerossees him showing a darker side to his usual playfulness, it was McGuire’s top billing in2022’s BBC seriesCheatersthat has done more than anything else to transform him from a sputtering sidekick into an unlikely leading man.Starring alongside Susan Wokoma,Cheaterssees McGuire playing Josh, a downtrodden sound engineer whose adulterous one-night stand with Fola (Wokoma) while on holiday ends up following him home when he realises she has just moved in across the road.View image in fullscreenWith Susan Wokoma in Cheaters.Photograph: Screen Grab/BBC/Clerkenwell“I was drawn toCheatersbecause everyone in it has committed some sort of betrayal but they’re also empathetic and lovable,” he says. “I really liked how Josh isn’t macho or a gym guy but he’s still shown in moments of passion and is working his way through the difficulties of a long-term relationship.”Created by Oliver Lyttelton,Cheatersfeatures plenty of well-observed relational dynamics, as well as a lot of sex. In the 18 10-minute episodes of series one, characters masturbate, get naked, perform oral sex and experience several orgasms. “It was my first experience doing intimate scenes on screen and it was such a gift to be performing alongside Susie [Wokoma], not least because we were both at Rada together in the same year, so I’ve known her for ever,” he says. “We would be in bed almost totally naked, surrounded by 20 crew putting up lights, and we would just be chatting about which mutual friends we had seen recently.”The show became a sleeper hit and a second series came out last year. With the increased popularity, though, it must have been a challenge to prepare his family for the show’s steamy content? “I had to tell my mum that there was nudity in episode one and that it arrives pretty fast,” McGuire laughs. “It’s like five minutes in and bam – there’s my full bum out! There was no easy way to tell her that but she’s seen it all and she’s proud of me.”View image in fullscreenIn rehearsals for Rhinoceros with Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù.Photograph: Marc BrennerGrowing up in Warwick as the youngest of three siblings, McGuire fell into acting seemingly by accident. “I didn’t have a particularly thespy family since my mum’s a paediatric nurse and my dad worked for IBM,” he says. “We were only a 10-minute drive from the RSC in Stratford-on-Avon though and my mum would always take me to see new productions – both the good ones and the not so good.”In 2001, at 13, McGuire was cast as one of the young actors in Gregory Doran’sKing Johnat the RSC and soon caught the bug for performance. “They would just get local boys from the nearby schools to fill in as the young parts for some of the RSC performances and I thought it would be a fun thing to do,” he says. “I was suddenly part of this mad world where people were getting paid to have fun every night and then going for drinks afterwards. I was enchanted and to this day whenever I smell incense it takes me right back to the Swan stage and the cardinal in the play swinging his censer across the boards.”Getting into Rada at 19, McGuire joined a mightily talented cohort, including Wokoma, Daisy May Cooper, James Norton, Cynthia Erivo and Phoebe Fox. “It was a magic time because from 10am to 6pm each day you’d just be playing and discovering,” he says. “I would laugh at what my older brother might have thought if he could see me spending all day being water or jelly.”View image in fullscreenWith Daniel Radcliffe in Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead at the Old Vic.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his final year, McGuire was cast with Norton to play members of the riot club in Wade’s Royal Court send-up of the Oxbridge Tory elite,Posh.“His talent was immediately evident,”Observertheatre critic Susannah Clapp says of his performance in the ensemble. “He gleamed in an excellent cast and has since been a good picker of good plays – rumpled in James Graham’sPrivacy(2014) and garrulous and bossy inRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.”While McGuire says his experience ofPoshwas overwhelmingly positive – “I thought all jobs would be as fun, as popular and as pertinent to the moment as that” – future stage roles were less straightforward. “I had the opening line ofRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Deadand one night I began it by skipping the first two pages of the script entirely,” he laughs, head in his hands. “It’s like suddenly thinking about walking and you trip up. Thankfully, I don’t think anyone noticed because Dan [Radcliffe] is so famous that for the first five minutes of that show at least, no one was looking at me.”Does he wish his career had taken off to similar heights, rather than largely being known for supporting roles? “God no. I have mates who have lost all anonymity and it’s really tough, especially if you have kids,” he says. “I have a two-year-old son now and I love being able to go to work but then also come home, put him to bed and leave it all at the door.”View image in fullscreenWith Simon Shepherd in Posh by Laura Wade.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn 2022, McGuire married actor Amy Morgan and the pair share parental responsibilities in their London home alongside their work. “We’re living the dream because we’ve been able to work and have our boy and not really sacrifice any roles,” he says. “It does take a village and we’re very lucky to have so many friends and grannies around for babysitting!”At least McGuire’s current rehearsal schedule means he can be home for bedtime and once the play’s run begins he can spend the day with his son instead. “As a dad, this show takes on another resonance, thinking about how social media groupthink might affect his life in the future,” he says. “But he can’t even read yet so there’s no use worrying too much – I’m more desperate instead to be in one of those Julia Donaldson Christmas adaptations, which he might just about understand!” Until then, it’s a welcome return for McGuire to the London stage, bringing his comedic excitement and recently showcased vulnerability to both rhinoceros and human beings.Rhinocerosruns at the Almeida, London N1 from Tuesday 25 March to 26 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverEugène IonescoTV comedyTelevisionRoyal Shakespeare CompanyAlmeida theatreComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Stars of the arts world and politics, including prime minister Tony Blair, attended. All of them were dwarfed by a giant ­spider – Louise Bourgeois’s visiting sculpture – perched on the gangway over the vast, packed Turbine Hall.For Alex Beard, particular joyous moments still stand out, but not just from the evening: “It was a remarkable night, but I most clearly remember the first morning, 12 May, when I walked around outside, really early doors, and saw people lining up right around the building. I talked to the first person in the queue, who told me this was something they’d been waiting for all their life,” recalls Beard, who was deputy director of Tate.“The queen had officially opened the building with the words, “I declare the Tate Modern open”, adds Beard, remembering howNicholas Serota, the director and the driving force behind the venture, discreetly winced at the monarch’s use of the definite article. This was simply Tate Modern.“The last gallery proposed for London was in 1936, so this one took a long time coming,” says Beard, who now runs the Royal Opera House.“There were worries about funding, and a moment when we discovered some asbestos in the Turbine Hall, but our most spectacular inaccuracy was in the projection of business for the first year.View image in fullscreenLouise Bourgeois’s giant spider sculpture, titled Maman, in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern in 2000.Photograph: Tate Photography“We thought there might be two million visitors, and it was more than double that.”Last week, the gallery, built inside the brick hulk of a former power station on the south bank of the Thames in London, revealed plans to mark its anniversary with a “birthday weekender” of events. It will host a free celebration of visual art, live music and performance, running from 9 to 12 May.Bourgeois’s spider will be back, as it was in 2007, and in honour of an eventful ­quarter-century, a trail of 25 art works is being installed around the galleries, featuring modern art landmarks such as Andy Warhol’s images of Marilyn Monroe and Salvador Dalí’sLobster Telephone.Art historian Tim Marlow, director and chief executive of the Design Museum, feels that another party is justified. “Tate Modern has utterly changed the face of London’s museums. We didn’t have a separate museum for modern art and it pretty quickly gained status, up alongside Moma [the Museum of Modern Art in New York] and the Pompidou [in Paris], even if there are some questions about its collections.”It has helped London become one of the greatest cities in the world rather than the dysfunctional capital of a lost powerAlex BeardIt is, Marlow believes, everything Tate wanted it to be, although the original Tate Britain – on the other side of the river – may have suffered at its expense.“Tate Modern was the result of a series of things happening, not just one key moment,” says Beard. “There was the lottery money, of course, then all those ‘YBA’ graduates of Michael Craig-Martin’s at Goldsmiths College, as well as Charles Saatchi collecting at Boundary Road, and then all the new technology, turning us into a more visually aware nation. All that came together to create a gallery that could further energise what was going on.”But the chill March wind also brings sobering news. Tate, the parent organisation, is now inserious survival discussionswith the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It isbanking on central governmentcoming to the rescue while it looks for a “financially viable model”. The most recent annual report also reveals that trustees have approved a deficit budget for this financial year.View image in fullscreenDamien Hirst with his work, Shark, part of his 2012 exhibition at Tate Modern.Photograph: Rune Hellestad/Corbis/Getty ImagesSo while Tate Modern may have held on to its high place in the annual popularity rankings for British visitor attractions, released on Friday, it does face a dilemma. The Tate’s four galleries have jointly lost 2.7 million visitors in five years, according toAssociation of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva) figures.Tate Modern is in fourth place with 4.6 million visitors, 3% fewer than last year and 25% down on 2019. Only Windsor and the Natural History Museum lie between it and the British Museum, in the top spot again. Its neighbour up the river, the Southbank Centre, also celebrating 25 years since it was significantly overhauled, lies just behind in fifth.Tate cuts 7% of workforce in effort to reduce funding deficit from pandemicRead moreAs some other attractions return to pre-pandemic visitor levels, the original site, Tate Britain, is still down 32% on 2019, though up a bit on last year. The financial lifeline discussions and visitor figures come after recent reports outlining plans to cut staffing numbers by 7%.Alva’s director, Bernard Donoghue, suspects that Tate “has been heavily dependent on overseas visitors”, and so is being hit by the comparative lack of Chinese tourists since the pandemic.Tate points out that 2019 was a record-breaking year as Tate Modern pushed the British Museum out of first place in Britain for the first time in nine years on theArt Newspaper’s annual survey of international museums and galleries. The success was chiefly down to the appeal of itsacclaimed 2018 Picasso exhibition.Alison Cole, a former editor of theArtNewspaperwho now directs the Cultural Policy Unit, a new thinktank, believes that renewal – and money to carry it out – is now vital: “Tate is not alone in facing these issues, and it has to manage many sites in terms of attracting visitors.View image in fullscreenAi Weiwei with his work Sunflower Seeds, on show at Tate Modern in 2010.Photograph: PA Images/Alamy“It’s hard to continually reinvigorate yourself; it is a question now of renewal. Many institutions are feeling their age since that big museum expansion at the turn of the millennium, not only in terms of deteriorating buildings but also flagging staff morale when finances are under strain.”Cole’s thinktank would like to see a temporary switch in the way lottery funds are distributed, in an effort “to help these great organisations put themselves on a sustainable footing”.The first Tate Gallery at Millbank was founded in 1897 by the sugar magnate Sir Henry Tate to champion British art. Away from the action in a residential area and with a limited collection of foreign and modern works, it wasn’t until the 1980s that it became a prominent feature of the art world.Its creation of the Turner prize in 1984 brought it – and the modern art world – much needed publicity and controversy. Then the appointment of Serota as its director four years later changed its fortunes.“Right from the beginning, on a crisp, two-sided application for the job, Serota laid out his vision,” says Beard. “He has got the most fantastic 60,000ft view of the role art plays in society and also knows how to get things done, with incredible attention to detail.” Now in the hot seat as chair of Arts Council England, Serota is becoming accustomed to less enthusiastic praise, after criticism of the organisation’s most recent round of cuts.View image in fullscreenArtist Oscar Murillo invited visitors of all ages to make their mark on a vast painting, The Flooded Garden, in the Turbine Hall last year, creating a collaborative work of epic proportionsChildren and young adults were at the heart of the new Tate Modern gallery “from the get-go”, explains Beard. The idea was to avoid the atmosphere of a reverent temple to the arts. “The entrance into the Turbine Hall was that liminal space between the city and the museum and part of the whole philosophy. It established what was so different about Tate Modern.“It was genuinely groundbreaking in its relationship with the city. The bridge over to St Paul’s was conceived really early on and it caused a great opening up of the river. It’s ridiculous to think you couldn’t walk along it easily then. It has helped London develop its confidence, to become one of the greatest cities in the world, rather than the dysfunctional capital of a lost power.”The two sides of the river have since reached a fairer balance, putting the Thames back at the centre of the city.“I was recently on the Southbank and it was heaving,” says Marlow. “Before, there was a sense that all the arts happened north of the river. Now it is a vibrant cultural ­corridor. And it seems incredible that a city with so much major art being produced in it didn’t have a separate museum for modern art until 2000.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernThe ObserverArtNicholas SerotaMuseumsArts fundingAndy WarholLouise BourgeoisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Beatles songs aren’t like most pop songs; instead of fading, they take on a richer colour and nuance, not least because new generations of fans inquire more deeply into what previous listeners might have overlooked or simply misunderstood. One twist of the kaleidoscope and a song we thought we knew suddenly sounds even better than it did the first 100 times we heard it.This is the effect of reading Ian Leslie’s brilliant study of the Beatles’ music, a book that offers not only a lesson in listening (again) but an enthralling narrative of friendship, creative genius and loss. At its centre is the songwriting partnership of John Lennon andPaul McCartney, and the unprecedented peaks the two of them scaled in remaking English popular music. You may find it impossible not to be awed by their achievement all over again. But Leslie also wants to challenge a myth about the pair. After the Beatles finally disbanded, a consensus formed that Paul was the straight man to John’s rebel bohemian – vanilla against brimstone – which hardened into holy writ on Lennon’s murder in 1980. McCartney’s inadequate off-the-cuff response to the news (“it’s a drag”) took some living down. Leslie lays to rest this old opposition, arguing that there was “no John without Paul, and vice versa”. Their collaboration was as tight and co-dependent as two climbers roped together on a mountain face.The two boys who met in 1957 at a summer fete in Woolton village were bonded by talent and by family tragedy. Both had lost their mothers when they were teenagers, a spiritual wound that was borne in silence but linked them in understanding. “In music they could say what they felt without having to say it.” As they practised at home, they taught each other the art of songwriting and intuitively felt their way into a partnership. Leslie conveys the excitement and pace of this self-discovery, from the fledgling years of Hamburg and the Cavern through the “ecstatic bounce” of Please Please Me to the end of 1963, when they had four No 1 singles and two No 1 albums.Leslie scores highest in his penetrating analysis of the differences that drove their creative alchemyHe is also alert to the way their songs reverberate between eras. The first song McCartney ever wrote, I Lost My Little Girl, just after the death of his mother, is captured again when the band play it together during the Get Back sessions at Savile Row in January 1969. He spots another proleptic link from the unusual dynamic dramatised in She Loves You, “a boy-girl love song about friendship between boys”: 11 years later, McCartney was a real-life go-between for Lennon during a crisis withYoko Ono.But Leslie scores highest in his penetrating analysis of the differences that drove their creative alchemy. As the songwriting grew in complexity, their characters emerged more distinctively: Lennon being sardonic, self-critical, volatile; McCartney romantic, joyous and inquisitive. In time, a rivalry flared up, and yet far from stalling the partnership, it inspired them to greater heights of inventiveness and daring. Two pairs of songs, close upon one another, illustrate this duelling spirit. In early 1966 Lennon wrote Tomorrow Never Knows after hearing McCartney play Eleanor Rigby, disparate in mood and effect yet both built on an alternation between two chords. Leslie’s musical ear picks up the odd consonances between the pair and “the sounds of words as connecting fibres”, the mirroring of phrases and gaze-of-eternity perspective. Counterintuitively, the Lennon song is emollient in its message, the McCartney cheerless and unforgiving, yet “the two songs speak to one another”.View image in fullscreenPaul McCartney and John Lennon photographed in 1963.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesIn another great cadenza, Leslie considers the double vision of the single Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever, obverse sides of the same golden coin; this time Lennon’s fugue-like journey into the unconscious set against McCartney’s jaunty “toytown diorama” with its everyday characters made strange – “McCartney’s Magritte”, as Leslie calls it. Of all the songs featured here, these are the two that flame brightest in the author’s close interpretation, and I felt I was understanding them properly for the first time. In Penny Lane we hear “the singer-narrator has a child’s enthusiasm and an adult’s experience”; in Strawberry Fields Forever we hear anew its “gauzy ambiguity” between dream and nightmare: “The listener is oriented just enough to take pleasure in being lost.”This takes us into 1967, “the year when John and Paul were most in sync”, to the point where their actual voices were sometimes hard to tell apart. They even dreamed the same dreams. But their different personalities were becoming marked, partly under the influence of drugs, partly through Lennon’s increasing fragility and neediness. “Only when he was working with Paul did he feel like a genius.” Leslie has previously written books on human psychology, and here he gets thoroughly stuck into the crosscurrents of dependence and resentment that roiled beneath the surface.At times, he sounds like a couples therapist, and indeed when Ono enters the scene, he identifies Lennon’s new alliance as a “triangulation”, the possibly unconscious undermining of a partner through befriending a third party. Woah, heavy!, you think, and yet it might make perfect sense. It doesn’t require a psychologist, of course, to hear deep strains of depression and paranoia in a lament such as Yer Blues, but Leslie’s occasional overegging of the psychodrama tips the mood towards daytime soap: “John thought Paul understood how insecure he felt… and sought emotional reassurance. Paul thought John needed to feel he was the most important person in the group: hence his insistence that John is the boss. But John didn’t want power, not any more. He wanted love.”The book’s subtitle is nonetheless pertinent, since it really is a love story, and in Lennon’s mind might have been something more. During the Get Back sessions, he says to McCartney, only half-joking: “It’s like you and me are lovers.” When their partnership was sundered at last, the fallout was commensurately intense, with Lennon vituperating McCartney as bitterly as any scorned ex. His rancorous denunciation of McCartney in How Do You Sleep? on theImaginealbum shocked at the time, but now sounds “preposterous” (“The only thing you done was Yesterday”), as did a lot of the interviews he gave in the aftermath of the split. The relationship eventually recovered, albeit hedged around by Lennon’s enthralment to Ono. What came as a surprise to me – one of several here – was the story of Lennon being galvanised to make music again on hearing McCartney’s Coming Up on the radio (“It’s driving me crackers”).I had up to now considered the gold standard of Beatles books to be Ian MacDonald’s formativeRevolution in the Head, published more than 30 years ago.John & Paulis its equal in passionate engagement with the songs and possibly its superior in originality. But is it too late to register a regret that one vital song has been overlooked? And Your Bird Can Sing is a sour-sweet blast of energy that perfectly fits Leslie’s argument about the two writers talking to each other, a song of misunderstanding that both airs a grievance (“You can’t hear me”) and offers reconciliation (“Look in my direction, I’ll be round”). There’s an outtake of the song onThe Beatles Anthologywhen McCartney starts giggling, which sets off Lennon, and they both laugh helplessly through to the end. It reminds you what fun, aside from everything else, genius could be.The Mouthless Dead by Anthony Quinn is published by Abacus (£20)John & Paul: A Love Story in Songsby Ian Leslie is published by Faber (£25).

Our readers want what we do’The venerable magazine is thriving and its long-time editor David Remnick tells us why a dedication to literate, conversation-provoking and veracious reportage has never been more vitalAndrew AnthonySun 23 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareLast month theNew Yorkercelebrated its 100th anniversary. It’s an impressive achievement because the magazine is the bumblebee of publishing: it flies in the face of prevailing wisdom. Just as the bee’s wingspan was once thought to be too small to keep it airborne, so does our smartphone-blitzed attention span appear too short for what the magazine offers.Everything about the 10,000-word pieces, learned criticism and meticulous accuracy on which the weekly has built its reputation seems anachronistically at odds with the age of TikTok and X, influencers and instant opinion.Nor is it renowned for a ready adaptation to change. Tina Brown caused a huge storm in the 1990s by modernising what had become a rather staid format, and lost a number of protesting writers in the process. One, George Trow, accused her of “kissing the ass of celebrity” in his resignation letter.With the sort of stiletto wit that the one-time home of Dorothy Parker had forsaken, Brown replied: “I am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything, I should say I am notionally distraught.”Yet for all its conservative habits, three decades on theNew Yorkeris not only surviving but thriving. Worldwide circulation is said to be 1.3m, there is a lively dailywebsite, a podcast calledThe New Yorker Radio Hour, and by its own account the whole enterprise is making a profit. Much of that success can be attributed to the current editor, David Remnick.View image in fullscreenDavid Remnick, centre, at the magazine’s 100th anniversary party in Manhattan.Photograph: Dolly Faibyshev/eyevineWhat’s his secret?“Our readers want what we do,” he says on a video call from his office on the 38th floor of One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. “They want us at our best. And that’s true now more than ever because we live in a world of misinformation, disinformation, and crap and speed and a lack of verification, lack of fairness. We are awash in it.”Remnick is a lean 66, but could pass for a decade younger, owing to a full head of hair with a thickness and, most conspicuously, darkness no man of his age has any right to possess. He has occupied the editor’s seat for almost 27 years, but recently questions have been asked about when he might leave and who might replace him.By tradition,New Yorkereditors are not bolters. There have only been five in the magazine’s entire history. The first, Harold Ross, lasted 26 years, before his deputy William Shawn took over and wielded his blue pencil for a full 35 years.Back in 1998, six years into her reign, I interviewed Brown in her office, which was then in Midtown. She had done the most difficult restructuring, and she seemed enthused as she told me about her plans and love for the job. Five months later, I remind Remnick, she was gone, off to set up the ill-fatedTalkmagazine.“I think I know where this question is going,” he interjects.Condé Nast editors are obliged each year to submit a shortlist of candidates who could replace them. So what are his own plans? Does he intend to surpass Shawn’s 35 years?View image in fullscreenFormer editor Tina Brown, in June 1993.Photograph: Shutterstock“Let’s put it this way,” he says, avoiding speculation about possible successors. “I love this job. I’m pretty sure I’m going to love this job when I wake up tomorrow morning too. I’m here. I’m not dissatisfied. Once in a while, I could use a better night’s sleep, but I really love this work.” There’s a meaningful pause. “But I’m not going to break William Shawn’s record.”Veteran cultural writerAdam Gopnikhas worked under four different editors since he joined the magazine in 1986. Remnick, he says, was always unusual for a “first-rate writer”, in that he took as much pleasure in other writers’ accomplishments as he did in his own. It was a quality, Gopnik believes, that marked him out as editor material. “If the Yiddish word ‘mensch’ were in a dictionary, David’s portrait would be next to it,” he says. “I think if you had a vote among the writers, it would be by North Korean margins for David Remnick to remain.”When Brown resigned, Si Newhouse, then owner of Condé Nast, offered the position to Michael Kinsley, founding editor ofSlate, before changing his mind over the weekend and withdrawing the offer. Remnick was at the time one of theNew Yorker’s star writers, brought in by Brown from theWashington Post.“I was asked to do it on a Monday morning,” he recalls. “And [Newhouse] basically said, ‘You’ve got an hour to decide, and I’d like to announce it at 11 o’clock in the morning.’ It was a little bit like getting arrested – you know, I had one phone call.”The magazine was losing a lot of money and in shock from Brown’s departure. She was one of two “truly great editors” Remnick had worked for, the other being Ben Bradlee at thePost, but he hadn’t edited anything himself since high school and whatever confidence he had “was shrouded in blessed ignorance”.He called his wife, who told him he should do it, and if he wasn’t any good or didn’t like it, he could go back to writing. In the event, he continued writing, not as often but just as brilliantly, and steered the magazine to profitability through a digital revolution, 9/11, the global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic.“David has kept a very steady hand on the tiller through the most treacherous waters any editor of theNew Yorkerhas ever been through,” says Gopnik.View image in fullscreenAn exhibition celebrating the magazine’s centenary at the New York Public Library.Photograph: Getty ImagesEven so, Remnick says he’s not experienced anything before like the second term of Donald Trump. “It’s not one event,” he says. “It’s 10 events a day. It’s 20 astonishing posts on Truth Social in a given week. I lived in the Soviet Union for four years and one of the things that always emotionally struck me was what it must be like to live in a place where you feel such antipathy to your own country. One feels a sense of shame to hear one’s own president brand a heroic figure likeZelenskyy a dictator, and to see how he deals in an opposite way with Vladimir Putin. But how to cover that on a human level, on a factual level, on an institutional level, is a challenge.”It’s obvious that he wrestles with the best way to stay relevantandfair at such a politically polarised and emotionally febrile moment. Although theNew Yorkermaintains its well-established mix of cartoons, reviews and fiction, some believe the centre of the magazine’s gravity has swung too far towards politics under Remnick.We live in political times. If we weren’t publishing concerted political pieces, I would be accused of trivialising the enterpriseDavid Remnick“We live in political times,” he says. “If we weren’t publishing really concerted political pieces, I think I would be accused of trivialising the enterprise.”With its faster turnaround, the internet, he says, has allowed him to respond to the news agenda online while maintaining reporting depth in the magazine. It took time to master the digital speed, and initially dissenters found the website dominated by youth-driven social justice politics. Was that a reasonable objection?“Why would I be dismissive of social justice?” he replies. “If you’re asking if we’re a liberal magazine, I’d say in all senses of the word, yes. But it’s not ideologically uniform. When it’s at its best, it’s arguing with itself.”The one thing he is insistent upon is the need to remain politically engaged.“I find with worrying frequency that I go out to dinner and meet with people and friends and someone will announce, ‘I’m not watching the news. I can’t bear it. I’m taking care of myself and doing pilates.’ That’s lovely but as the great poet said, meantime life goes on all around you.” Can he understand the sentiment? “I understand it but I have no patience for it.”Last year, Gopnik was in a terrible funk about the approaching election and complained to Remnick over breakfast at Barney Greengrass – “His Café de Flore, his Algonquin.”“I poured my heart out about how agitated I was. He listened and made jokes and then he said, ‘Your job is not to whine or to be fearful. Your job is to write, so go write that.’ And I thought: yeah, that’s our task, to write. It sounds so simple but it was hugely emboldening. David makes you feel that the things that matter to you are the things that are most worth publishing.”One of the names mentioned as Remnick’s possible successor isPatrick Radden Keefe, author ofSay NothingandEmpire of Pain, two of the finest nonfiction books of the past decade and both the product ofNew Yorkerpieces. I ask him if he would find the idea of making the move from writing to editing appealing:“I’ve never done it before, so it would be hard to say,” says Keefe, before going on to pay testament to Remnick’s many skills, not least his handling of the business side of things.View image in fullscreenFace of the future: author Patrick Radden Keefe, who some tip to be the next editor.Photograph: Mike McGregor/The Observer“Business is hard,” says Remnick. “In the cliche of the business world there are headwinds and tailwinds, and the headwinds outweigh the tailwinds. David Halberstam wrote a book about the American media [The Powers That Be] in 1979. He focused on four institutions: CBS News,Timemagazine, theWashington Postand theLos Angeles Times. Do I need to go on?”In other words, it’s not easy to remain where the heat is.Timemagazine is all but finished, the evening news is almost history, theLA Timesis struggling and theWashington Postis now a ratherforlorn playthingof Jeff Bezos.When he’s not worrying about performance and sales, Remnick says his favourite part of the job is the weekend reading, when he sits down with a stack of manuscripts of pieces for forthcoming issues. “When you hit one that’s really wonderful, there’s nothing like it,” he says. “It’s the best feeling you can have with your pants on.”He has an impressive roster of writers to stimulate that feeling, not just honoured veterans like Hilton Als and Elizabeth Kolbert, but also a younger generation that has taken up the torch of long-form journalism, people such as Jia Tolentino, formerly of the female-oriented website Jezebel, and Rachel Aviv, whose recent contributions onAlice Munro’s daughter’s sexual abuseand Lucy Letby have both caused international headlines.View image in fullscreenThe 10 May 2004 issue, which featured Seymour Hersh’s article on torture at Abu Ghraib.Photograph: The New YorkerThe Letby piece, like Keefe’s on thesuspicious death of Zac Brettler, is one of many British-based stories in a magazine that maintains a watchful eye on events this side of the Atlantic. “We have endless people in your town,” Remnick mock-complains. “We are lousy with Londoners.” When I ask him which pieces he’s most proud of publishing, he mentionsSeymour Hersh’s expose of torture at Abu Ghraiband Ronan Farrow’s #MeToo work, but says there are many other examples he could cite.As Gopnik noted, Remnick is quick to praise the writers he admires, but his years as a reporter have also given him a nose for sniffing out their ploys. Keefe recalls pitching the idea that he should go to Marbella to look into an arms merchant who was by then locked up in a US prison. All the thrust of the piece was at home, but Keefe was angling for a trip to southern Spain.“David said, ‘I will absolutely send you to Marbella if there are important people to talk to there, but I don’t want to send you just so you can smell the bougainvillaea.’”To many of us, though, theNew Yorkeristhe place where you can smell the bougainvillaea, even if, as one of the magazine’s factcheckers would doubtless spot, it’s a flower without a scent. As budgets shrink and reportage becomes ever more constrained, it’s a magazine that still promises to capture the colour and atmosphere of far-off locations, as well as those at the end of the street.It’s a principle of the magazine that the quality of its prose is inseparable from its veracity. The factchecking process is famously exacting, with no less than 28 staff employed to pick over every minute detail, however trivial.The drama of editing is one element of an overarching mythology that no one is more prone to romanticise than the magazine itself. One-time fact-checker Jay McInerney made the protagonist of his first novel,Bright Lights, Big City, a coke-snorting fact-checker at an unnamed highbrow magazine.Several rungs above the grunt checkers are the dedicated editors about whom writers talk in slightly mystical terms, not unlike the way other New Yorkers refer to their therapists. They are gurus, sounding boards, ego-masseurs and muses all rolled into one. Keefe namechecks his own and the “brain trust of incredible editors generating great ideas”. Remnick himself defers to his own editor, Henry Finder. “The writer is running the race but some guidance doesn’t hurt,” he says.Ross, the founding editor, had a number of rules, including that writers should never write about writers, never name editors and never write about the magazine. That these edicts are regularly flouted is in large part because everyone connected to theNew Yorkeris steeped in the lore of the place. James Wolcott, the acerbic New York writer, once characterised the practice of this institutional nostalgia as people “who touched the old walls and thought, ‘Oh, the ghost of Benchley.’”Then there are the great works, the founding documents on which the magazine’s monumental sense of itself is built: John Hersey’sHiroshima, the harrowing account of the aftermath of the atomic bomb; Rachel Carson’sSilent Spring, which almost single-handedly placed environmentalism on the political agenda; Hannah Arendt’sreport from the Adolf Eichmann trialthat examined the banality of evil; and Truman Capote’sIn Cold Blood, which effectively invented the true crime genre.All were produced in theNew Yorker’s financial glory days, when advertising was at a premium, and deadlines were viewed as a vulgar interruption to the creative process. But as much as the writing has always been exalted, there has also been something of a cult around not writing. Gopnik, although prolific himself, speaks in respectful tones of “terrific writers who were famously laconic”. He recalls befriendingJoseph Mitchell, “who hadn’t published anything since 1964” when Gopnik first joined the magazine in 1986. “He was an extraordinarily elegant man,” he remembers, “beautiful, soft North Carolina accent, and he looked as though he hadn’t changed his clothes since 1939.”View image in fullscreenAmerican biologist and natural history writer Rachel Carson, whose article Silent Spring exposed the environmental damage caused by crop spraying.Photograph: Getty ImagesMitchell continued to type away every day in his smallNew Yorkeroffice for more than two decades, his words perfectly unsullied by print. It’s no wonder that Brown bemoaned unproductive writers on her arrival, comparing herself to Hugh Hefner in the Playboy Mansion and unable to get a date.Remnick, who is renowned for the speed at which he turns in immaculate pieces on Putin, Bruce Springsteen or the Israel-Palestine conflict, is not someone who esteems writer’s block. He is, as Keefe says, a newspaper man by training who is prepared to remind writers that the point of writing is to publish.“He believes you should take exactly as long as it takes to get the reporting right and turn around a beautifully written piece, and not a week longer.”For all its veneration of the role of the writer, theNew Yorkerhas sometimes been criticised for enforcing a narrative house style, a way of telling a story with thumbnail descriptions (One warm spring afternoon, X, who was dressed in a plaid sport coat and diamond-pattern cravat, ate a lunch of pan-fried venison and recalled his first orgasm…) and appropriate cultural references (as the Romanian aphorist Emil Cioran observed…).Gopnik is familiar with the reproof but is adamant that personal voice nonetheless shines through. He says Mitchell told him that the bestNew Yorkerwriters had a “wild exactitude” of their own, a combination of passion and precision that Gopnik believes is the defining mark of the magazine’s writing.“People who prosper at theNew Yorkerare comfortable reading, reporting, researching and having a foundation of facticity in everything they do,” he says. “Writers who are all attitude have never been good here. They have a very brief audition and are gone.”He may have been thinking of Wolcott, who was out in just four years, and went on to write a vicious screed against Gopnik, which began: “I sometimes wonder if Adam Gopnik was put on this Earth to annoy.”The point of such spats is to remind us that if, in terms of its intelligentsia, New York is a village, then theNew Yorkeris its church and the magazine’s writers a kind of secular priesthood.View image in fullscreenFrançoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman’s sombre cover after the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001.Photograph: The New YorkerThere’s a scene inAnnie Hallin which Woody Allen’s character tries to make love to his wife while a sophisticated drinks party takes place beyond the bedroom. She stops him with the outraged words: “Alvy, there are people out there from theNew Yorkermagazine! My God, what would they think?”Allen himself contributed humorous pieces to the magazine, but he wasn’t above mocking the lofty position thatNew Yorkerwriters and editors occupied – and continue to occupy – within the city’s cultural elite. Remnick knows all the caricatures, but it’s not the kind of stuff over which he’d lose any sleep.His mind is committed to the higher calling of what he called, in the anniversary issue, “a journal of record and imagination, reportage and poetry, words and art, commentary on the moment and reflections on the age”.The act the magazine finesses is to recognise that the world is a large place while still being alive to the social mechanics of the city in which it operates. It must try to be both urban and urbane. No contributor has ever achieved this balance more effectively or memorably than Saul Steinberg, whose inspired 1976New Yorkercover,View of the World from 9th Avenue, was both a critique and example of New York exceptionalism.“The most devoted readers of theNew Yorkertend not to be in New York,” says Gopnik. “They’re in Seattle or Tucson or Tulsa, and they’re passionate because they feel connected not just with New York as a place but with a set of cosmopolitan values that they feel the magazine reflects.”He is speaking the morning after theNew Yorkerparty at Jean’s, a fashionable club in NoHo, to celebrate the centenary. Guests including Tina Brown; the cartoonist Art Spiegelman, author ofMaus; his wife Françoise Mouly, the magazine’s art editor; and various staff writers, rubbed shoulders with novelists like Jennifer Egan, Jeffrey Eugenides and Zadie Smith.View image in fullscreenCartoonist Art Spiegelman at The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary party.Photograph: Dolly Faibyshev/eyevineAccording to a report in theNew York Times, one guest, the New Yorker’s art critic Jackson Arn, appears to have got a little too excited amid such illustrious company. He was “accused of making inappropriate overtures to some of the attendees”. The magazine subsequently parted ways with the critic.It drew a cloak over Arn’s departure, thus avoiding the public embarrassment that accompaniedlegal reporter Jeffrey Toobin’s firing in 2020after he was caught masturbating during a staff meeting video call (he wrongly believed his camera and microphone were turned off).Such unforeseeable indiscretions are an editor’s nightmare, but during the party Remnick broke off from the festivities to say that, while it would be the height of presumption to think it could last another 100 years, he firmly believed “that people will always want what we do at theNew Yorker”.Who knows what the future holds, but it’s a good thing for journalism, for writing and, if it’s not too pompous to say, for the world at large that this exceptional magazine continues to flourish. If it can on occasion be precious, even sometimes a little dull, it more often attains reportorial heights that very few, if any, publications can match. One hundred years old it may be, but like the bumblebee, theNew Yorkerstill knows how to create a buzz.Explore more on these topicsCultureThe ObserverThe New YorkerDavid RemnickCondé NastMagazinesNewspapers & magazinesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There will never be another era like it again.”The broadcaster, who is now a presenter on Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, said that the show gave him “incredible memories that will stay with me forever” and “took a chance on me” when he had no experience.Reacting to Thomas’s post on X, Bacon wrote that he “loved” Blue Peter, and said “being live is what made it alive”.“I remember walking from one side of the studio to the other – doing a piece to camera – and seeing the whole crew, five cameras, and another on a crane, track with me,” he wrote.“I know that doesn’t sound like much – but the first time it happened it was mind-blowing. It was just a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well-resourced live kids TV show.“That had been live in that building for decades. It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).”Bacon was sacked from Blue Peter in the 1990s, after admitting drug taking, but did return, receiving a Blue Peter badge on the 60th anniversary.A BBC spokesperson said: “Blue Peter won’t just be available to view online and will remain on the CBBC and BBC Two linear channels, as well as BBC iPlayer and sign zone.Yvette Fielding looks back: ‘Blue Peter gave me balls of steel – it’s helped me deal with lots of backstabbing people in TV’Read more“The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change.“Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.“As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.”The current lineup of presenters include Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook.Explore more on these topicsBlue PeterTelevisionBBCChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Knew his music and cricket inside out. Raise your bat and enjoy a long rest in the pavilion.”Read posted a recent picture of him having lunch with Peebles and fellow formerRadio1 DJs Dave Lee Travis and Adrian Juste.Tony Blackburn, the first DJ to be heard on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967,posted: “So sorry to hear that fellow DJ from Radio 1 when I was there Andy Peebles has passed away. He was a lovely man and a great broadcaster, very sad news. R.I.P. Andy.”Peebles said the highlight of his career was interviewing Lennon in 1980, although it was bittersweet because two days later the former Beatle was dead after being shot by Mark Chapman.The interview lasted three hours and 22 minutes, Peebles later recalled. “It is a staggeringly long time to actually talk to somebody and that was all down to him.”Peebles’ final question was about how safe Lennon felt living in New York. Lennon suggested he felt very safe as he could easily walk down the street and go to movies and restaurants, whereas in London he “couldn’t walk round the block”.Peebles,in an interview with RTÉ to mark the 40th anniversary of Lennon’s death, recalled going for dinner with him at Mr Chow’s in Manhattan after the interview. The whole restaurant turned their heads, he said; Lennon put his arm around Peebles’ shoulder and said: “They’re all saying who the bleep is that with Andy Peebles?”Born in 1948, he began working as a club DJ in the 1960s before joining BBC Radio Manchester in 1973 and then helping to found Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio, where he presentedhis weekly Soul Train programme. He joined BBC Radio 1 in 1978 and presented a variety of programmes including a soul show andMy Top Twelve, in which music stars would choose their favourite records and talk about their life and career.Peebles also presented 15 episodes of Top of the Pops anda number of Radio 1 roadshows. After Radio 1, he had stints at Manchester’s Smooth FM and London’s 102.2 Jazz FM, and was inducted into the Radio Academy’s hall of fame in 2011.Explore more on these topicsRadioRadio 1BBCJohn LennonRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

I am terrified of what comes next and think empowering parents is a vital ingredient in this struggle.”The pact has garnered more than 100,000 signatures since its launch six months ago and itscelebrity backersinclude the singer Paloma Faith, the actor Benedict Cumberbatch and the broadcaster Emma Barnett. According to research by the media regulator Ofcom, 89% of 12-year-olds in the UK own a smartphone, a quarter of three- and four-year-olds do, and half of children under 13 are on social media.View image in fullscreenJack Thorne at a screening of Adolescence in London this month.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APLast week, the Guardian revealed the government was to beginin-depth scrutiny of smartphone bansin schools in England. It is understood that the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has become frustrated that there is a lack of evidence as to whether the guidance is being followed and its impact on classrooms. However, there are no plans to legislate for a ban.Adolescence, which isabout a teenage boy who is accused of killing a female classmate, has stoked the debate about social media and managing children’s access to smartphones. Last week, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, said he had been watching the drama with his children, while Thorne has called for screenings in parliament and further restrictions on under-18 access to social media.Smartphone Free Childhood, which started as a WhatsApp group formed by three parents, argues that smartphones damage children’s development by displaying harmful social media content, distracting classrooms and enabling cyberbullying.However, opponents of a full ban for teenagers include Ian Russell, a prominent internet safety campaigner who has said blocking the sale of smartphones to the under-16s and raising the minimum age for accessing social media risks doing more harm than good. Russell’s daughter, Molly,killed herself in 2017after viewing large amounts of content related to suicide, depression, self-harm and anxiety on Instagram and Pinterest.Writing in the Guardianlast year, Russell said a ban would be “naive”, because it would at best delay encounters with harmful online content and would not remove the danger – because damaging material was still present on social media platforms.The recently introduced Online Safety Act contains a series of provisions protecting the under-18s from content that is harmful but not illegal – such as, potentially, content from “toxic” male influencers such as Andrew Tate. The legislation requires platforms to shield children from content that is abusive or incites hatred against people with certain characteristics such as their sex.Ofcom is alsodeveloping codes of practiceto protect women and girls from online harm. These measures could include introducing “nudges” to ask whether someone is sure they wish to post a potentially harmful comment – a feature that has been shown to lead to significant behaviour change. Also, under a provision requiring tech firms to enforce their content guidelines, if for instance a social media platform’s rules bar misogynistic material, then that site needs to make sure such content is removed.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceJack ThorneInternet safetyYoung peopleChildrenSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Last year was the first in over 20 years without a UK global top 10 single or album in the charts.”Sheeran has called upon the government to provide a cross-departmental taskforce to work together on these issues to ensure music education remains high on the agenda.The letter continued: “The time to act is now. State schools – which educate 93% of the country’s children – have seen a 21% decrease in music provision … we also need you standing up for music education. Artists and industry can’t deliver on the world stage for the UK without schools, youth clubs and stages at home.“We collectively ask for a £250m UK music education package this spring to repair decades of dismantling music … Music in and out of school should be for all, not a few.”A 2025 report by Music Mark, the UK association for music education, found that the Labour governmenthad inherited a £161.4m shortfallin its budget to ensure the future of music education over the next five years.Before winning the 2024 election, Starmer –a former child flautistwho has spoken of the joys of travelling with his youth orchestra – told Classic FM that he “passionately” wanted to reverse the “degrading of creative arts and music” in state schools.Annie Lennox, Dave, Paloma Faith, YolanDa Brown and Sleaford Mods are also among the 500 signatories from the music industry. The Brit awards Rising Star winner Myles Smith has also signed; at the awards ceremony last month, he called on the government, venue conglomerates and music executives to support emerging artists.“How many more venues need to close, how many music programmes need to be cut before we realise that we can’t just celebrate success, we have to protect the foundations that make it?” he asked.Arts advocates are hoping Labour’s long-awaited curriculum review, led by Prof Becky Francis, will lead toa boost for the artsand greater educational inclusion, closing the access gap between state and private schools, and those in wealthy and less well-off areas.In 2022, the Conservative government published the second iteration of its national plan for music education, emphasising the “power of music to change lives”. It proposed that all children and young people should be able to learn to sing, play an instrument and create music together, and have the opportunity to progress their musical interests, including at a professional level.But music studies in schools are at a historic low. In August, the Independent Society of Musicians reported a 43% drop in A-level applicants and almost 40% in GCSE applicants since 2010, when then-education secretary, Michael Gove, introduced the Ebacc qualification, which does not include music or art. Last year, the Cultural Learning Alliance found that 42% of state schools enter no pupils for GCSE music.Femi Koleoso, a drummer with Ezra Collective, also advocated for support for music education when the London jazz band won group of the year at the Brit awards. The ensemble formed in 2016 after meeting through the Tomorrow’s Warriors youth jazz programme.Their victory, Koleoso said, was “because of the great youth clubs and the great teachers and the great schools’ that supported young people playing music. “The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK, where we’re unsure of how to fix it … the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies with giving a young person a saxophone, because when you do that you give them a dream and aspiration and a goal,” he added.Sheeran previously called for public funding for music in schools in 2023. Hesigned a letter from Andrew Lloyd Webberto Starmer and Rishi Sunak, calling for funding to scale up the work of Lloyd Webber’s music education charity, the Music in Secondary Schools Trust, which provides free musical instruments and weekly music lessons in disadvantaged schools.A government spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of this government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and we are committed to ensuring art, music and drama are no longer the preserve of a privileged few.“To help achieve this our curriculum and assessment review will seek to deliver a broader curriculum, and our new national centre for music and arts education will promote opportunities for children and young people to pursue their artistic and creative interests in school.“We are also expanding the creative careers programme to £3m over the next financial year, to help provide even more schoolchildren with information, advice and guidance on creative career routes.”Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranElton JohnSchoolsColdplayHarry StylesCentral CeenewsShareReuse this content"

There’s an essential emptiness at the core of this generic showLucy ManganSun 23 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShare“Isort of hope they all die,” is never the reaction a television drama wishes to evoke. But in relation to the drug-running family the Phelans and their colleagues and connections that make up This City Is Ours, that just might be your response.Sean Bean plays cocaine-smuggling patriarch Ronnie Phelan, who has enjoyed a long career dominating Liverpool’s drug trade. He is now considering retirement and, it seems, is planning to hand over the reins to his right-hand man of 20 years, Michael (James Nelson-Joyce, recently brilliant as Treacle Goodson in A Thousand Blows). Michael is pretty pleased. It almost makes up for his discovery that he has a low sperm count and that he and Diana (Hannah Onslow), the love of his life, will need to use IVF to start a family. If that all seems a jarring juxtaposition, it is. Scenes of violence are spliced with Michael’s sentimental moonings over pictures of his embryonic children, demanding that we see the irony and feel the humanity of a thirtysomething who is only now beginning to see what life may be really all about and to start groping towards some kind of escape and betterment for the next generation.But you know how it goes. Just when you’re thinking about getting out after IVF implantation, they pull you back in. This time because a large shipment of drugs goes missing, putting the scouse Sopranos in hock to their Colombian pals and requiring them to identify the rat in their midst. This is duly done, but in the course of the bloody investigation, Ronnie’s eldest son Jamie (Jack McMullen) moves up in his father’s affections and is soon effectively challenging Michael for control of the family empire. Some of this takes place in the luxurious Phelan villa in Spain, which is nice for them and also provides handy outbuildings where people can be shot and nearby clifftops from which bodies can be tossed.View image in fullscreenToughened … Julie Graham as Elaine Phelan in This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesThe Sopranos’ influence can be felt in the insistent interspersal of Normal Family Life Events interrupting the action (which is tense and well done) – Sunday lunches, wives nagging husbands about healthy diets, communal dancing at Jamie’s son’s christening – but this is diffusion-line stuff in the extreme. There is no emotional depth, no heart to it and, thanks to many lingering shots of people with faces expressing inner turmoil and/or conflicted loyalties and/or crushing moral burdens, a languorous pace lets any momentum built up by those tense set pieces drain away.There is a subplot around Diana’s past – her mother is in prison but they remain close – that seems designed to hint at the power of intergenerational trauma and makes us fear for her and Michael’s future babies. It adds a little interest. So, momentarily, does the approach by Cheryl (Saoirse-Monica Jackson) – the wife of one of Ronnie and Michael’s associates – at the christening to warn Diana that being a moll is a soul-sucking existence. “There’s nothing good about our men” she says, as lovestruck Diana looks at her with disbelief. “I’m you,” she adds, “sooner than you think.”Perhaps if it had followed the lives of the compromised women behind the bad men there might have been a richer experience here. Instead, the series follows the traditional route and tropes as power struggles, beatings and scary negotiations with bigger boys up the chain take place, further betrayals are uncovered, ambition and greed war with finer feelings, and more inner turmoils, pained expressions and grisly murders ensue.The essential emptiness at the core of This City Is Ours is tempered by the performances, especially from Sean Bean, who can do gnarly bastard in his sleep, and from Julie Graham as Ronnie’s wife, Elaine, toughened by years on the periphery of violent crime, who nails the hard-bitten vibe the part requires. And Stephen Walters as Davy Crawford is wholly convincing as a man just not made for gangland life, however much he wishes he was.It is entertaining enough. But it feels too much like too many things we have seen before. Michael, despite Nelson-Joyce’s best efforts, remains an underwritten cipher and there is no one to root truly for or against. Liverpool and Spain look nice, though.This City Is Ours aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewSean BeanreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a particular head-scratcher for Barry Levinson, whose lacklustre latest,The Alto Knights, about the bad blood between 1950s mafia bosses Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, is destined to be compared to his own multi-Oscar-nominated 1991 crime pictureBugsy, in which Vito and Frank appear as supporting characters.For this picture, Levinson hit on the bafflingly ill-advised idea of castingRobert De Niroin both of the two lead roles of Frank and Vito. Which, while it does make the picture distinctive, unfortunately doesn’t make it good. A meanderingGoodfellas-style narration, growled to camera by Frank, fails to boost the film’s flagging energy, and since De Niro’s approach is to deliver two very slightly different but equally hammy performances, the whole dual-role gimmick is more distracting than interesting. Still, if you must watch it, you can at least amuse yourself by spotting the join where De Niro-as-Frank’s fake nose is glued on.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for The Alto Knights.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsThe ObserverRobert De NiroCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her dream? To sing country songs on Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry stage. The reality? Glasgow, a criminal record, a curfew bracelet on her ankle, two young children and a job as a cleaner.In this fast-moving, heart-grabbing new musical by Nicola Taylor, directed byJohn Tiffany, we follow Rose-Lynn – a star performance from Dawn Sievewright – as she stumbles, staggers, dances, sings and fights her way along the path to self-realisation, backed all the way by a mood-shifting eight-piece band country-kaleidoscoping from rockin’ rhythms to hushed ballads under Ali Roocroft’s toe-tapping direction.Taylor’s storyline, based on heraward-winning 2018 filmstarring Jessie Buckley, follows aWizard of Oztrajectory, mussed up and gritted down, highlighted in the lyrics of the climactic closing number: “Ain’t no yellow brick road/ Running through Glasgow… Ain’t no place like home.”In overcoming obstacles of self-doubt and social deprivation, Rose-Lynn is fairy-godmothered by her art school-trained, bored housewife employer (pitched perfectly by Janet Kumah) and enlightened by an invisible presence (real-life DJ, “Whispering” Bob Harris, “appearing” as voice-off in a BBC studio). At times, plot improbabilities require us to do more that merely suspend disbelief: we have to eradicate it from our consciousness. What makes us want to do this is an involving emotional through line.Rose-Lynn’s evolving relations with her three companions – mother (played by Blythe Duff) and children (Lily Ferguson and Alfie Campbell) – are touchingly credible. Their peculiar, particular situation nevertheless connects to anyone who has ever felt torn between family and career. The gradual shift from fracture towards healing begins with their soul-stretching rendering of Peace in this House (who knew Duff could sing like that?).Changes of tone, tempo and location are executed with the brio of a Texas two-step thanks to an excellent creative team and Tiffany’s clear-sighted direction. In Sievewright’s generous performance, the mega-watt Rose-Lynn commands the stage without dominating an impressive ensemble in which every actor/singer and musician shines.Wild Roseis at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 19 AprilExplore more on these topicsMusicalsThe ObserverTheatreRoyal Lyceum theatreJohn TiffanyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Neither, it’s fair to say, appear to be easy people to live with. But they are exceptionally courageous and generous in laying open their relationship in this painfully intimate documentary.Directed by husband-and-wife team Manon Ouimet and Jacob Perlmutter, this is an uncomfortably raw picture that touches on ageing, artistic fulfilment and the fear, on Maggie’s part, of being subsumed and sidelined by the juggernaut of Joel’s career success. It’s fascinating but not an easy watch: there’s one scene so stingingly intense that you wonder it doesn’t strip the paint from the walls of their Manhattan apartment.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Two Strangers Trying Not To Kill Each Other.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsThe ObserverJoel MeyerowitzMarriagereviewsShareReuse this content"

What you see can be simply described. The word “star” appears a dozen times, screenprinted in silver on deep grey. They graduate down the page in a swaying column. Right at the bottom is a 13th word, “steer”, as if tethering – or guided by – all these descending stars.Each star is like an instance of itself, glimmering out of a fog, and the winding pattern irresistibly evokes starlight on rippling water. You look up to the stars, and down to the invisible boat summoned by that noun-verb “steer”. Which star to follow, how to navigate at sea, what the night skies can hold: the work is a visualisation, a poem and a prayer.View image in fullscreenStar/Steer, 1968 by Ian Hamilton Finlay: ‘a poem and a prayer’.Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton FinlayFinlay achieves all these sublime effects purely through the subtle arrangement of two words against two colours. His is an art of distillation, juxtaposition, thrift and contemplation. A poet before he became a concrete poet, a sculptor who became an “avant gardener”, as he put it, of that fabled landscape known asLittle Spartain the Pentland Hills beyond Edinburgh, Finlay understood as few other artists the emotional power of letters cutting into form, shape and colour.You sense it over and again in this wonderful centenary commemorationat the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. It’s there in the blue and white screenprintEveningSail, which consists of the words “Evening Will Come They Will Sew the Blue Sail” running in classical script down a long deep blue banner, as if to suggest both the sail and the mariners’ shrouds sewn in antiquity from such sails at the end of the day. It’s there in the scarlet invectives, so exquisitely lettered on his behalf byNicholas Sloan, against the government quangos Finlay despised: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (Let Perish the Money Tyrants).View image in fullscreen‘Scarlet invectives’: Posters against the SAC: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (with Nicholas Sloan).Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton FinlayAnd it runs through this show, as through his Pentlands garden, incised in all kinds of stone. A tank is delicately inserted into the pastoral reliefEt in Arcadia Ego, embodying Virgil’s ringing memento mori, carved in the marble below. A bird table for Finlay’s garden doubles as a miniature aircraft carrier (imagine the birds landing and taking off), the letter E incised into its deck, a reference to the USS Enterprise, the longest nuclear-powered carrier in the world.One gallery is filled with haunting photographs of Finlay’s artists’ signatures at Little Sparta, including his tribute to Albrecht Dürer. Above a stand of tall grass resembling Dürer’s ownGreat Piece of Turf, hangs his famous AD monogram incised in stone – as if Dürer had himself signed nature.His art scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutionsFinlay selects themot justewith a poet’s precision. Take a work such asWaveRockfrom 1966. The word “wave” runs back and forth, horizontally, up against a vertical heap of the word “rock”. The waves meet, depart, always unpredictable in their encounter with the rocks. Look closer, and the words “wreak” and “wreck” become discernible in the collision of letters. And all these words are etched on a sheet of sandblasted glass propped up in a bit of driftwood, like a letter in a rack. Everything flows, and connects.Finlay’s art is so refined, philosophical, antic in its wit and elegance, that it scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions, galleries and publishers. But his long-running conflicts were notorious. A vivid gallery of films and photographs recounts his 1980s campaign against Strathclyde council for trying to force him to pay business rates on an old byre that he had converted into a classical temple. Local farmers joined in, blocking the marauding tax officials with their tractors. I especially like the posterShock Tropesfor Little Sparta(Sparta, of course, was at war with Athens).View image in fullscreenWave Rock, 1966.Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay“Mors Concilio Artium” (Death to the Arts Council) is inscribed on blazing prints. When the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) accidentally returned some of Finlay’s stone carvings, his revenge was classical. The names of council functionaries, along with other enemies – including well-known painters and poets such as Elizabeth Blackadder and Iain Crichton Smith – are now carved in perpetuity on the back, along with a rousing tribute to Robespierre. Not incidentally, the SAC eventually gave them to the nation.The French Revolution, battles on land and sea, historical warfare – all have enduring significance in Finlay’s art. He joined up in the second world war and his own position is always ambiguous. Two curious stone boots, exquisitely carved byJohn Andrew, are in fact representations of the funnels ofthe Mikuma, a Japanese cruiser deployed during the war. Terrifying on a vast scale, they are reduced to what Finlay ironically called paperweights. But lest we forget, the Mikuma was sunk in 1942 by the US with most of its crew.View image in fullscreenEt in Arcadia Ego, 1976 by Finlay, with John Andrew.Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay © the estate of John AndrewIt feels apt that such a show should take place in the neoclassical grandeur of the former Dean Orphanage in Edinburgh. One of the most immaculate works here – poised between antiquity and conceptualism – is the tinyMarble Paper Boat, in which an origami vessel crests the fluted waves of a stone finial that would not look out of place in the Georgian architecture of the city’s New Town.If only this exhibition stretched from the ground floor to the upper galleries too. But Finlay is widely spread in his centenary year, with several other shows, includingone at Victoria Miro, London(30 April-24 May), and anillustrated book of essaysby writers including thelate, lamented Tom Lubbock.What makes this particular exhibition so special, moreover, is its emphasis on the intimate: many small sculptures raised up to perfect viewing levels on plinths, the walls dense with exquisite screenprints. What you see is Finlay’s mind in closeup – words and ideas forming into two- and three-dimensional works of unique and visionary art.Ian Hamilton Finlayis at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (Modern Two), Edinburgh, until 26 MayExplore more on these topicsArtThe ObserverSculpturePostersScotlandGardensreviewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t real life, thank God. This is a delicious, funny fantasy.Netflix’s new murder-mystery comedy-drama,The Residence, begins with the president hosting a state dinner with “Australians”, a word drawn out by his entourage in a sour mixture of scorn and amusement. The big boss doesn’t appear until 44 minutes in. He’s unimportant. The real action is happening upstairs.We briefly meet Giancarlo Esposito, his hair longer and greyer than when we knew him as the chicken-selling, meth-producingBreaking Badvillain Gus Fring. As the White House’s head usher, AB Wynter, his poker-straight stance is officious rather than chilling for a change – and then something happens before the opening credits. We get to the crime scene in a dizzying way, cameras speeding us across the White House lawn, through doorways, hallways, stairwells, endless ornate rooms; the mood of this show at times is Wes Anderson on acid.Inspired by a book by American journalist Kate Andersen Brower (which theTodayShow called “Downton Abbeyfor the White House staff”),The Residenceis the latest series by US mega-production company Shondaland, which previously brought usGrey’s Anatomy,Howto Get Away With MurderandBridgerton. Here, Emmy-winningUzo Aduba(Orange Is the New Black;Mrs America) plays birdwatching, tweedily tailored super-detective Cordelia Cupp, a long overdue 21st-century successor to David Suchet’s quirky Poirot.Binoculars around her neck, she’s trying to solve a murder in a White House containing 157 suspects, and doing so in a blunt, eagle-eyed way. “I once stayed up for 43 hours looking for a buff-coloured nightjar,” she intones. She shall not be moved.The script, by creator Paul William Davies (For the People;Scandal), is crisp, biting and often hilarious, if at times slightly overblown, as when security detail Colin repeats his interest in Kylie Minogue, the dinner’s star turn. She plays herself in a great cameo. “I’ve sung Can’t Get You Out of My Head seven times,” she complains. “Seven fucking times.”Severance 2’s main purpose seems to be providing Twin Peaks-style memes for unpacking on Reddit threadsMore memorable minor characters make this show zing: a sweary female chef; a calligrapher “having issues”; the male president’s first gentleman (I told you this was fantasy). Other stars from TV’s past pop up, including Jason Lee (My Name Is Earl) as the president’s dressing gown-wearing dropout brother, and Julian McMahon (Home and Away;Nip/Tuck), who plays the Australian prime minister (fun fact: in real life, McMahon’s father, William, actually was Australia’s prime minister).A jaunty soundtrack by the brilliant Mark Mothersbaugh, once of post-punk bandDevo, feels like a character in its own right, and I whipped through two episodes in a flash. It’s so nice to have some delight from DC for a change.Less laughter is required for Amazon Prime’s new comedy series. I write that with my tongue in my cheek, asLast One Laughinggets 10 comedians together in a brightly coloured,Big Brother-type set, then challenges them to keep a straight face for six hours.Adapted from a Japanese format that’s been successful elsewhere (includingIreland, in a 2024 serieshosted by Graham Norton), the British version has quite the A-list ensemble, including Daisy May Cooper, Joe Lycett, Sara Pascoe, Richard Ayoade and Bob Mortimer, a man whose sweet face twitches an inch and I’m hysterical.View image in fullscreenHosts Jimmy Carr and Roisin Conaty (at the back) and the ‘A-list ensemble’ of Last One Laughing.Photograph: Amazon MGM StudiosWatched over by hosts Jimmy Carr andRoisin Conatyon many TVs (“Think of this, Roisin, as our audition for Gogglebox,” Carr hams), the first episode feels sluggish. The comics walk away from each another, stand around stony-faced, pull their jaws into grimaces. “Not hearing laughter when you’re a comedian, it’s like being a shit comedian,” says Carr. That mood balloons.When Cooper mimes a rollercoaster ride on stage, without laughter, it’s like watching a weird experiment or an outtake from David Lynch’sEraserhead. Joe Wilkinson’s RNLI speech works better in episode two, as do the cheeky interventions of Lou Sanders, giving the show much-needed tension and momentum. Towards the end is a sketch that had me (and one of the contestants, whose laugh the hosts bizarrely missed) in stitches. I won’t spoil the surprise, but it involves Mortimer, a hula hoop, a tea towel, a handbag and an egg. A slow start, then, but warming up.That description also fits the second season ofSeverance. Its final episode aired on Friday, after a discombobulating though still mesmerising 10 episodes. If you have yet to braveSeverance, in short, it’s centred on four characters who have consented, for different emotional or practical reasons, to undergo a procedure whereby their brain has been severed, to separate their normal (outie) life from their working (innie) one. The innies each do a baffling job for Lumon Industries, a company straight out of a dystopian novel, based in a headquarters full of exquisite, intensely eerie mid-century design.View image in fullscreen‘Mesmerising’: Adam Scott as Mark S and Britt Lower as Helly R in the season two finale of Severance.Photograph: Jon Pack/Apple TV+Flung out of Lumon’s strip-lit inner sanctum to the characters’ wider, wilder worlds, this second season has lacked the narrative drive of its predecessor, in which Mark S (Adam Scott) slowly realised that something was dreadfully wrong. Its main purpose seems to have been providing more fodder for nightmarish,Twin Peaks-style memes destined for unpacking on Reddit threads: that haunting black corridor; the appearance of the first Lumon factory; the Mammalians Nurturable breeding ground, run by “goat lady” Lorne (played to chilling perfection by Gwendoline Christie).(Spoilers ahead!) Some intriguing storylines have been annoyingly sidelined, such as the influence of Mark’s brother-in-law’s self-help book on the Lumon employers and employees. The wonderful connection between Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) was also dispatched far too quickly. Nevertheless, the finale remained an enjoyable head-rush, full of bloody action, as well as a great speech from Helly R (Britt Lower) in the middle of a surreal sequence featuring – verySeverance, this – a marching band.The diverging motivations of Mark’s innie and outie, and a neat twist after he found Gemma/Ms Casey (Dichen Lachman), were satisfying touches too, although the ending felt mildly disappointing. Perhaps it’s because I wonder how on earthSeveranceseason three will work. Sometimes even delicious fantasy needs a little more grounding in reality.Star ratings (out of five)The Residence★★★★Last One Laughing★★★Severance★★★★What else I’m watchingProtection(ITV)Siobhan Finneran (Happy Valley;Rita, Sue and Bob Too) is as wonderfully no-nonsense as ever in this solid if grim witness protection drama.View image in fullscreenSiobhan Finneran in Protection.Photograph: Thomas Wood/ ITVThames Water: Inside The Crisis(BBC Two)A weirdly compelling two-part plunge into one of the UK’s most famously failing companies.

I make this recipe often at home – it’s a moist cake filled with decadent ganache. It is rich and indulgent, as all good chocolate cakes should be, yet needs no gadgets to make. Serve it as is, or make it a showstopper and switch up the filling (perhaps with nuts, or cherries to cut the richness) and finish with a few edible flowers.You will need two 20cm cake tins and baking parchment.Serves 8-12Dutch-processcocoa powder60g, plus 2-3 tbsp for dustingunsalted butter150g70%dark chocolate125gmilk chocolate125geggs3 largebuttermilk100mlsunflower oil50mlvanilla extract2 tspplainflour150gbaking powder1½ tspbicarbonate of soda1 tspfine sea salt½ tspcardamom pods2, seeds finely crushed (optional)golden caster sugar125glight muscovado sugar200ginstant coffee2 tbsp mixed with 125ml of hot wateredible flowersa few, to decorateFor the milk soak (optional)whole milk100mlinstant coffee1 tbspcardamom pods4, seeds finely crushedFor the ganache filling70%dark chocolate200gmilk chocolate200gdouble cream250mlunsalted butter25gsalta pinchvanilla extract1 tspMake the ganache filling first.Finely chop both types of chocolate and place in a large bowl. Warm the double cream gently until it just simmers. Add to the chopped chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Once it has melted, gently stir and add the butter, salt and vanilla extract. It should be glossy and smooth. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Butter two 20cm cake tins, dust with the 2-3 tablespoons of cocoa powder, shake out the excess, then place a disc of parchment paper on the base of each tin. Set aside.If you are making the milk soak, prepare it next so it has time to infuse. In a small saucepan, add the milk, coffee and crushed cardamom seeds. Bring it to a gentle simmer for 3-4 minutes. Switch off the heat and let the milk cool and infuse until required.To make the cake, first melt the butter and both the chocolates all together in a bowl over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water. Once melted, remove from heat, stir and set aside.In a small jug, mix the eggs, buttermilk, sunflower oil and vanilla extract.In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt, 60g cocoa powder and crushed cardamom seeds, if using. Add both the sugars and sift again.Add the flour and sugar mix to a large bowl, then pour in the melted butter and chocolate mixture and hot coffee, and fold with a spatula. Add the egg and buttermilk mixture and gently fold it all in. The batter will be quite loose and an almost pouring consistency.Pour the batter into the prepared tins and give the tins a gentle tap. Bake for 20-22 minutes in the middle shelf of the oven. Each cake should be well risen and springy to touch.Let the cakes cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then brush the cakes using half of the milk soak prepared earlier (if using). Let it sit in the tins for another 5 minutes and then unmould on to wire racks.Once completely cooled, remove the parchment paper and place one of the cakes on a cake plate or cake card. Brush it once more with milk soak. Add 5-6 generous tablespoons of the set ganache and spread it in a thick layer.Gently place the other cake (bottom side up) over the ganache layer and nudge it into position if you need to. Carefully peel off the parchment paper and brush it with the milk soak. Spread the remaining ganache on top, swirling it casually for a decorative look. Finally, decorate it with a few edible flowers if you wish.The cake keeps well for up to 4 days in an airtight container.Chopped chocolate cookiesView image in fullscreenChopped chocolate cookies.Photograph: Kate Whitaker/The ObserverI always have some cookie dough prepped in the freezer. I like cookies to have crisp edges and a soft texture in the middle. This recipe has been my go-to for many years as it’s a base that works with many flavours (see tips, below). It’s easy, quick and all you need is a large bowl and spoon. You can use chocolate chips or chopped chocolate, which I prefer.Makes 15-16plainflour240gcornflour1 tbspbicarbonate of soda1 tspfine sea salt½ tspunsalted butter120g, at room temperaturecaster sugar120gsoft light brown or light muscovado sugar120gegg1, plus 1 yolkvanilla extract1 tbsp70% dark chocolate150g, coarsely choppedmilk chocolate150g, coarsely choppedSift together the flour, cornflour, bicarbonate of soda and salt and set aside.Place the butter and both the sugars into a large bowl and beat using a large wooden spoon. It should come together in 3-4 minutes. Now add the egg and egg yolk and mix it all in till combined. Stir in the vanilla extract.Add in the sifted flour mix and stir it all together until combined. Add nearly all the chopped chocolate (reserving a handful of pieces for later) and mix. (If using nuts, flavourings or spices as suggested below, add them at this stage.)Divide the dough into 15-16 portions (approximately 55-60g each) and form each into a rough ball. Take the reserved chopped chocolate and stud 3-4 pieces on each cookie ball.Place the balls on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and chill for at least 6 hours. After this, they can be frozen for 6-8 weeks.When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5.Place 6 cookies, spaced well apart, on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and put on the middle shelf of the oven.Bake for 12-14 minutes, or a couple of minutes longer if baking from frozen. If any are misshapen when they come out of the oven, you can easily shape them: place a large round cookie cutter, or a glass slightly bigger than the cookie, over the cookie and quickly swirl the cutter or glass in a tight circle around the cookies a couple of times, hitting the edge of the cookie. It is important to do this when the cookies are still warm if you want them to be neatly round.Leave the cookies on the tray to cool. They will be quite soft when first out of the oven but will harden and crisp around the sides, staying soft in the middle.I recommend eating them slightly warm if you can. You can warm them in the microwave for 10-15 seconds if eating later.TipsA few flavour suggestions – this really is a versatile cookie-base recipe. Add 100g of toasted pecans and ¼ tsp cinnamon powder to the base recipe for warming winter flavours. The zest of a large orange with a few colourful chocolate mini eggs studded in makes these Easter-ready. Or replace the milk and dark chocolate with the same amount of white chocolate, plus ½ tsp ground cardamom, ¼ tsp rose water and 100g coarsely chopped pistachios.Another tip is to take out the tray halfway through baking and bang it on your kitchen counter, then put it back in the oven for the remainder of the baking time. This will yield a thinner cookie, which you can then use to make ice-cream sandwiches.Pistachio and kataifi chocolateView image in fullscreenPistachio and kataifi chocolate.Photograph: Kate Whitaker/The ObserverI don’t usually follow trends but the Dubai chocolate bar is one I’ve given in to – crunchy kataifi pastry, pistachio and chocolate is a winning combination. In my no-bake take on the social media sensation, good quality tahini and pistachio paste add depth and flavour. I add rose water because I like it, but you don’t have to. I’ve made these quite small, so you can share them with others (if you love them enough).You can buy thread-like kataifi pastry from large Mediterranean or Middle Eastern grocers. Pistachio paste is available online and in speciality shops – you want the sweetened kind. You will need a 12-hole cupcake mould and paper cases.Makes 12-15 pieceskataifi pastry400gunsalted butter125g, cubedwhite chocolate100g, choppedtahini60gpistachio paste125g, plus 2 tbspicing sugar50g, plus 50g extrarose water1 tsp (optional – I use Nielsen Massey)finesea salt¼ tsppistachios100g, shelled, finely chopped, plus extra to decorate70% dark chocolate200g, choppedmilk chocolate200g, choppeddried rose petalsa fewchocolate mini eggs12-15Chop the block of kataifi pastry into 2½cm cubes then loosely separate into shreds.Place a large frying pan on a medium heat.Melt the butter and add the shredded pastry to the pan. Keep moving the pastry gently so that it toasts evenly. This takes about 25 minutes or more, but results in the golden, crunchy pastry that we want. Do not rush this part, otherwise it may end up unevenly cooked or burnt. Once toasted, remove from the heat.Place the white chocolate in a glass bowl and melt in the microwave for 20 seconds at a time, stirring each time you check it. Alternatively, melt it in a bowl over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water.Place 300g of the toasted kataifi pastry, the tahini, 125g of the pistachio paste, the melted white chocolate, 50g of icing sugar, the rose water and salt into a large bowl. Give it a good stir. It will be slightly loose. Set aside.In another bowl, add the remaining 50g of icing sugar and 2 tablespoons of pistachio paste to the remaining 100g of kataifi pastry. Mix well and set aside.Place the dark and milk chocolate in a bowl and melt in the microwave at 20-second intervals, or in a bowl over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water.Take a 12-hole cupcake tin and place a paper cupcake case in each hole. Place a large spoonful of the melted dark and milk chocolate in each case and use a small spoon to spread it halfway up the cases.Place a generous 2 tablespoons of the tahini-kataifi mix in each case. Top each one with another large spoonful of the melted chocolate, making sure to encase the kataifi filling.Sprinkle some of the reserved sweetened pistachio kataifi round the edge of the top of the chocolate layer, like the rim of a nest. Finish each case with a few rose petals and pistachio kernels. You can decorate them with mini eggs too, for some Easter fun. Place in the fridge for 2 hours till the chocolate is set.Once set, remove from the fridge and peel off the paper cases. They will come away neatly, leaving you with 12 chocolate discs.It is best to eat these at room temperature as the filling will be softer and more flavourful. You can store them in a airtight container for up to 5 days.Chocolate, hazelnut and ginger friandsView image in fullscreenChocolate, hazelnut and ginger friands.Photograph: Kate Whitaker/The ObserverBrown butter, toasted hazelnuts and chocolate add so much flavour and texture to this gluten-free bake. And, because you can never go wrong with chocolate and hazelnut, this, which has an optional gooey filling. If you’re planning ahead, these also freeze really well. You will need a 12-hole cupcake or friand tray.Makes 12unsalted butter150g, cubed, plus 50g, softened, for greasingcocoa powder40g, plus 30g extra for dusting70% dark chocolate100g, chopped smallmilk chocolate100g, chopped smallchocolate hazelnut spread12 tbsp (optional)icing sugar225ggluten-free flour75g (I use Dove’s Farm)fine sea salt¼ tspground almonds75gground roasted hazelnuts75gblanched hazelnuts75g, toasted and coarsely choppedegg whitesfrom 5 large eggsvanilla extract1 tspinstant coffee2 tbsp, dissolved in 25ml hot waterstem ginger in syrup4-5 pieces, chopped smallGrease a 12-hole cupcake or friand tin generously with the softened butter using upward strokes. Dust with the 30g of cocoa powder and set aside. You can chill the prepped tin if you have space in the fridge or freezer till the batter is prepared. Though this is not necessary, it helps give a little hump on the baked friand.Place both the chopped chocolates on a tray in a single layer and place in the freezer until required. If you are using chocolate-hazelnut spread for the filling, spoon 12 blobs of it on to a tray lined with baking parchment. Place the tray in the freezer until required.Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Place the cubed butter in a small saucepan and let it simmer on a gentle heat for 4-5 minutes. Once the butter is melted, continue to cook till it is golden in colour, gives out a nutty aroma and leaves dark milk deposits in the base of the pan. Take off the heat, strain and keep it warm.Using a large bowl, sift together the icing sugar, gluten-free flour, salt, 40g of cocoa powder, ground almonds and ground hazelnuts. If any crumbs are left in the sieve, tip them into the bowl.In another bowl, gently whisk the egg whites with a balloon whisk for a minute or two, just to the frothy liquid stage. There’s no need to whisk them any further.Incorporate the whisked egg whites into the flour and nut mixture in 2-3 additions. Give it a gentle stir with a spatula after each addition.Pour the warm melted butter into the above mixture. Add the vanilla extract, coffee, 75g each of both the chilled chocolates, the chopped ginger and 50g of chopped hazelnuts, saving the rest for later. Give it all a good stir until there are no flour lumps. Do not over-mix the batter.Use an ice-cream scoop or large tablespoon to portion the batter equally into the prepared tin.If you are using chocolate-hazelnut spread, place one blob into each friand batter, slightly pushing it in. Use the back of a spoon to cover the spread with the batter if needs be.Top each friand with a sprinkle of the leftover chopped chocolate and hazelnuts.Bake for 20-22 minutes on the middle shelf of the oven. The friands will be risen, springy to the touch and may have a few cracks on the crust. Once baked, take them out and let them cool for 5 minutes. To demould, ease out of the tins gently and place on a wire rack to cool. Use a palette knife to run around the sides to loosen them if you need to.The friands are best enjoyed warm for breakfast, or at any time of the day, but are also good for a day or two stored in an airtight container.TipFriands are a great make-ahead bake. Once cooled, you can pack them in airtight containers or bags and freeze for up to 6 weeks. Warm them from frozen in the microwave for 30 seconds or in a warm oven for few minutes. To toast the hazelnuts, dry roast them in a frying pan.Chocolate fondantView image in fullscreenChocolate fondant.Photograph: Kate Whitaker/The ObserverEveryone loves soft-centred puddings but many don’t dare attempt to make them at home. However, this is a great make-ahead dessert and can be prepped a few weeks in advance and kept in the freezer. There are a few steps to follow and the baking time is crucial – make sure you know your oven – but you’ll soon wonder why you ever feared them. My recipe works for me every time.You will need 10 dariole moulds.Makes 10unsalted butter225g, cubed, plus 75g, melted, for greasing the dariole mouldscocoa powder40g, plus about 50g for dustingplain flour180gmilk chocolate125g70% dark chocolate125gfine sea salt¼ tspvanilla extract1 tspeggs4, plus 5 extra egg yolkscaster sugar200graspberries and cream or ice-creamto servePrep your dariole moulds before making the batter. Brush each one with a thick layer of melted butter, using upward strokes. Place on a tray and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Remove and coat the moulds with a second layer of melted butter. Generously dust the moulds using the 50g of cocoa powder. Tap out any excess and set aside.To make the fondants, sift the flour and 40g of cocoa powder into a bowl and set aside.Break the milk and dark chocolate into pieces and place in a large bowl along with the cubes of butter. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure it doesn’t touch the water, and let the chocolate and butter melt completely over a gentle heat. Once melted, remove from the heat. Add the salt and vanilla and give it a stir, then set aside.Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment or a handheld beater, whisk the whole eggs, egg yolks and caster sugar until thick, airy, pale and almost tripled in volume. Then, using a large metal spoon, add the flour and cocoa powder mixture in 3-4 batches, incorporating them very gently. Take care not to deflate the batter too much.In 3-4 parts, add in the melted butter and chocolate mixture prepared earlier. Use the same large metal spoon to give a stir after each addition. Gently mix the batter so everything is well incorporated. Using a large ladle, portion the batter equally into the prepared moulds, leaving a ½cm space below the rim. Chill the fondants overnight in the fridge or freeze for up to 6 weeks.When ready to serve, heat the oven to 190C fan/gas mark 6½. Place the fondants on a baking tray and cook from chilled (11-12 minutes) or frozen (14-15 minutes) on the middle shelf of the oven. They should be slightly risen with a crust on top.Leave them to sit for a minute or two, then loosen the sides very gently with a palette knife. Tip the mould upside down with a gentle tap on the serving plate and gently lift the mould away. Serve immediately with cream or ice-cream and a few raspberries.TipBecause all ovens are different, I suggest you bake one fondant in advance – maybe even a few days ahead. This way you can adjust the bake time by a minute or two to get your preferred level of molten centre.Tarunima Sinha is a cook, recipe writerand supperclub host, and runs a bakery business, My Little Cake Tin.

Small plates from £4.50; large plates £18-£29; desserts £9; and wines from £36I feel I shouldn’t be writing at all because I am so full and so happy. I have just had the meal of meals – a Sunday lunch of such perfection that really my next move should have been to lie down. I live in an ancient part of Britain, where once upon a time if you wanted to pick sides, it was between Wessex and Mercia. Of course, in the ninth century the pesky Vikings turned up and imposed Danelaw. Being Danish myself I now realise that the locals missed a trick in defending themselves. Instead of battling or giving in they should simply have served the naughty Norsemen a perfect plate of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, carrots, parsnips, buttered greens and gravy and the invading hordes would have been putty in their hands.Sunday lunch is such a British institution it’s hard to know when it started. Possibly in medieval times, but that’s between the 5th and the 15th century, which doesn’t really narrow things down. The theory is that back in the day, village serfs (the poor) worked for the squire (the rich) six days a week. Sunday morning was for church after which the serfs would get together to practise, I don’t know, anti-Viking bow-and-arrow techniques, and their boss would reward them with a feast of oxen roasted on a spit.View image in fullscreen‘Sunday lunch perfection’: roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.Photograph: Paul Stuart/The ObserverWhat I take from all this is that ideally you should work hard for your lunch. My wife, Debbie, and I are in the process of restoring 40 acres of ancient woodland. We do this on a Sunday morning with a glorious assortment of volunteers. Together we clear the land around gnarled, coppiced beech trees and venerable oaks, bringing sunshine back down on to the forest floor. It is our church, after which we all are ravenous. As we have no squire to conjure a feast and there is no immediate threat of invasion, this week we determined to finish the day at a pub a few miles down the road.With sawdust in every crevice, 10 of us went off to the Crown in the small Hampshire village of Arford. I tell you the name of the village because the pub name doesn’t really help by itself. There are more than 1,000 inns and public houses in the UK called the Crown because they were once located on Crown lands and the British are nothing if not clear-minded about such things. (I mean, not always. I used to drink in an inner-city pub in London called Harbour Lights whose naming no one ever understood.)View image in fullscreen‘The happy snap of pork crackling’: roast pork.Photograph: Paul Stuart/The ObserverSince somewhere deep in the late-17th century there has been a beer house and inn standing in the centre of Arford and you can still step in straight off the village lane into the oldest part of the building. A wide, black-beamed fireplace hosts a roaring log burner and we were all childishly pleased to see stacked logs that had come courtesy of our own woodland work. Our coppicing gang entirely filled the seats at a table beneath 200-year-old wooden beams, while down in the bar extension the place was full. We bumped into a friend just finishing her meal. She teaches cooking at the Gordon Ramsay school and waxed lyrical about the lunch ahead.When it comes to Sunday lunch, I feel there is a certain sacredness about it which no one should really mess with. You want a big plate of juicy meat, properly cooked potatoes with no stinting on the gravy, a Yorkshire pudding that has never touched a freezer and the odd veg to feel as though you are doing yourself a bit of good. The menu boded well: no one trying to sell us a “foam” or a “jus” of anything. The mains were listed sensibly: beef, chicken, pork, nut roast. Everything one might want.View image in fullscreen‘I need to lie down to make room’: pecan pie and ice-creamPhotograph: Paul Stuart/The ObserverWe all know each other well now and the chatter was lively with much laughter, but as the food was served a hush fell over the table. On the whole, Debbie and I dislike the modern penchant for endlessly photographing one’s dinner, but I saw her whip out her phone and take a shot. This was Sunday lunch perfection. The juiciest of beef. Large slices. Rare in the middle. A small pillow of Yorkshire pudding. Roast potatoes as they should be, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. A whole carrot, a whole parsnip, extra bowls of creamy cauliflower cheese and deep red cabbage. Buttered greens and extra jugs of gravy. A whole half of a succulent chicken lay on Deb’s plate while in the corner where our Swedish woodcutter sat, all I could hear was the happy snap of pork crackling in his mouth.The servings were vast. Surely none of us would ever eat again? But then there was pudding – sticky toffee, chocolate brownie, pecan pie and ice-cream, tiramisu, apple and sultana crumble with custard. Somehow we soldiered on. We nattered away, men and women from many walks of life united in giving nature a hand. I realised we have been together as a team for quite some time. We spoke of individual trees as if they are our friends and I wondered if the medieval lunch mob might have had much the same conversation. All morning and all through lunch not one of us looked at our phone. We were filthy, but we were free.View image in fullscreen‘Somehow we soldiered on’: sticky toffee pudding.Photograph: Paul Stuart/The ObserverThe Crown is not a large place. It has a small kitchen run single-handedly by a remarkable woman called Stella Malone. We asked if she would come and take our thanks. She did, but shyly, then escaped away. There is great skill in producing this most traditional of meals to such a standard. I expect Michelin or whoever rates these things would never even glance this way, but she is an artist.We need to support these small country inns and local watering holes. The number of pubs in England and Wales is at a record low. Last year more than 400 closed and there had been some danger of Arford’s own public house closing after two centuries of service. It would have been terrible. It is a beating heart for the locals but, rather like our woodland, the village was galvanised into action. Since July 2024, the Crown has been taken over by a few locals who set up a limited company to manage the place which is now enthusiastically supported by the whole community. Lively, local and lovely. I need to lie down to make room for the next time.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe ObserverRestaurants (Food)Restaurants (Travel)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Rare is the wine of character and taste at less than £8, or even £10, these days, and I can count the number of genuinely appealing £5 bottles I’ve tasted in the past year on one hand. Retailers are trying to get around this issue by trawling away from classic, established areas and presenting whatever random assortment of cheaper offbeat wines they have found on the bulk market as “hidden gems”: hence the proliferation of own-labels with names on a theme of Found (Waitrose) Loved & Found (M&S) and Discovery Collection (Sainsbury’s). Despite the “virtue of necessity” feel, the wines are frequently among the more interesting supermarket bottles, none more so than Aldi’s latest find in its “Unearthed” line: a racy, tangy, springtime-floral aromatic Austrian white that punches some way above its £8.99 price tag.Buenas Vides Argentinian Organic Malbec, Uco Valley, Argentina 2024 (£7.99,Aldi)Austria was also the source for one of my favourite new Aldi red wines, a satisfyingly spicy, blackberry-juicy, refreshing and chillable red Specially Selected Austrian Zweigelt, Niederösterreich 2024 (£8.99). It was all the more appealing for being properly dry – as is so often the case when I taste supermarket wine ranges these days, far too many reds at Aldi’s recent tasting came with an unwelcome dose of sugar. Red wines that avoided the sweetness trap and that offer the same kind of bargain hunter’s buzz I feel when I buy a jar of Aldi’s palm oil-free peanut butter included what I think is Aldi’s best-value wine: the authentically savoury, supple Chassaux et Fils Côtes du Rhône 2023 (£5.29); and a pair of malbecs from Argentina’s Uco Valley: both the Buenas Vides Uco Valley Malbec 2024 (£6.29) and Buenes Vides Organic are worth the price of admission, although the extra violet-aromatic lift and succulent plum and cherry of the Organic really stand out when you taste them back to back.Castellore Organico Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV (£6.99,Aldi)On the white side of the Aldi wine aisle, I thought Baron Amarillo Rueda Verdejo 2024 (£5.99) was a nicely tropical-tangy, bright and limey example of the verdejo variety from the Rueda region in Castilla y León, which is typically, punchily aromatic in a way that will appeal to drinkers of the passion-fruit-and-guava end of the New Zealand sauvignon blanc spectrum. I also liked Specially Selected Costières de Nîmes Blanc 2024 (£8.99), a languid fleshy peachy take on the classic white Rhône Valley blend. Perhaps Aldi’s strongest suit, however, is fizz: the retailer has a knack of finding good-value sparklig bottles in a variety of styles, with highlights right now ranging from the reliably biscuity flavours of bestseller Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut NV (£14.99) to the invigorating apple crisp Specially Selected Crémant de Loire NV (£8.99) and the pristine, gently pear-scented Organico Prosecco.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodAldiSupermarketsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Something that says, quietly, deliciously, “Welcome home!” The house is cold and empty, and I have a fancy for ham with cauliflower cheese. A dinner that I make so rarely, if ever, and yet for which I have something of a soft spot. The nudge came from a quick trip to the shops and seeing from the most perfect cauli I had seen in ages, its cream-coloured curds crisp and without blemish, complete with its crown of green leaves.The sauce was left to blip quietly on the stove, seasoned with bay leaves and a fistful of parsley, a sauce just thick enough to see the knubbly clouds of cauliflower beneath. I cooked a ham hock to eat with it, then got the idea to tear the meat from the bones and stir it into the cheese sauce, using some of the cooking broth in place of milk. A side dish instantly became a full dinner.Later in the week, my nostalgia quenched, a last-minute supper of fried rice came to the rescue, the grain matched to chopped winter greens (chard and kale) and freckled through with sesame and toasted peanuts.Cauliflower, ham hock, parsleyServes 3.

Peel and halve the onion, cut the carrot and celery in half, then tuck them around the hock. Add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Remove and reserve the parsley leaves, adding the stems to the pot. Pour the water over and bring to the boil.Lower the heat so the water bubbles gently, partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer for 45 minutes or until the meat is soft enough to be easily removed from the bone. Take off the heat and leave until cool enough to handle. Reserve about 250ml of the ham stock. Pull the meat and fat from the bone, tearing up the meat. Don’t chop them, rough, jagged pieces is the way to go.Make the sauce: warm the milk with the bay leaves and peppercorns, bringing almost to the boil, then remove from the heat. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan, then stir in the flour and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring regularly until you have a pale, biscuit-coloured paste.Stir in the warmed milk with a wooden spoon, adding the bay leaves, but discarding the peppercorns. (They have done their work.) Pour in 250ml of the ham stock through a fine sieve and stir until completely smooth.Finely chop the parsley leaves and stir most of them into the sauce. (Save some for the topping.) Grate the parmesan and stir in all but 10g. Lower the heat so the sauce is barely bubbling, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring now and then stop it sticking. Add the ham pieces.Cut the cauli into large florets, leaving the stems intact. Steam over a pan of boiling water for 7-8 minutes until the florets are tender to the point of a knife. Drain and add to the sauce. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.Quickly melt the butter in a shallow pan, add the breadcrumbs and let them colour. Stir in the reserved parmesan and parsley. Transfer the cauliflower, ham and sauce to a shallow ovenproof, dish. Scatter over the crumbs and bake for 45 minutes until golden and bubbling.Fried rice, greens and peanutsView image in fullscreenStir it up: fried rice with vibrant greens and crunchy peanuts.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverServes 2.

Warm the oil in a shallow pan, stir in the onions and fry over a moderate heat until deep golden brown. It is best not to hurry this. Take your time, keeping a close eye on the onions as they soften. They will take about 15-20 minutes. Lift them from the pan with a draining spoon and drain on kitchen paper.Wash the rice in warm water until the water is no longer cloudy, then put it into a medium-sized saucepan. Add the peppercorns, cardamoms and cloves, 1 tsp of salt, then pour in enough water to cover the rice by 1cm. Bring to the boil, then cover tightly with a lid, lower the heat and let it cook, gently puttering, for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat without lifting the lid.Peel and grate the garlic to a paste. Seed and finely chop the chilli. Trim and wash the greens, then roughly chop them. Warm the oil in a shallow pan, add the greens and let them cook briefly, then remove with a draining spoon. Wipe the pan, add a little more oil, then stir in the garlic and chilli let them cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Scatter in the peanuts and sesame seeds and let them toast for a second or two. Remove the whole spices from the rice, then tip the rice into the pan and let it sizzle briefly. Stir in the greens and let them warm through. Trickle over the sesame oil and soy and serve.Explore more on these topicsFoodNigel Slater recipesrecipesShareReuse this content"

Self-taught cook, traveller, recipe collector, historian and anthropologistClaudia Rodenhas reshaped how we think about food, its cultural heritage and social meaning.It’s not just celebrated chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi and Moro’s Samantha Clark who pay tribute to her pioneering work. The historian Simon Schama once observed that “she is no more a simple cookbook writer than Marcel Proust was a biscuit baker”.Yet there is nothing grand or entitled about this remarkable 88-year-old. She has travelled to our meeting place in Hampstead on the tube, her preferred mode of transport, and speaks with scrupulous modesty, exceptional recall and a gift for anecdote that makes her a dream lunch partner.La Cage Imaginaire, a small French-Italian brasserie in Flask Walk, is her chosen venue. It features in the latest Bridget Jones film, she tells me, as the scene of a romantic date. It’s a quiet Tuesday lunchtime and we are, at first, the only guests. Although she adores restaurants, she seldom eats out, she says, partly because of her age and partly because she enjoys cooking so much for family and friends. But she came here recently with one of her two daughters and was impressed by the quality of the food. “We should order quickly,” she says, “because they do everything from scratch.”It’s wise advice, which neither of us takes, because as soon as we take our seats we slip into a conversation that scarcely takes a breather for the better part of the next three hours.Roden’s first book,A Book of Middle Eastern Food,was published in the UK in the revolutionary year of 1968 (and four years later in the US). With crystalline prose and exotic recipes she summoned up both the food and the atmosphere of her childhood in Cairo, where she lived a privileged life in the city’s then thriving Jewish community. She grew up speaking French, Italian, English and Arabic, and became Egypt’s national backstroke swimming champion at 15. In the same year, she moved to boarding school in Paris, where her younger brother was being treated for a serious infection. She lived there for three years before moving to London. “I wanted to stay in Paris,” she recalls.People would say they don’t want wine at lunchtime because it softens their brainsLondon was rather drab in 1954. Rationing only ended in the middle of that year, and British cuisine left something to be desired – taste, mostly. But she took to St Martin’s School of Art, enjoyed living with her two brothers in a flat in north London and began cooking for her fellow art students.“They kept coming to dinner,” she explains. I bet they did.We order two glasses of viognier. “For a while people would say they don’t want wine at lunchtime because it softens their brains,” she comments dryly.She bought Elizabeth David’sA Book of Mediterranean Foodwhen London became her home, and was pleased to find a recipe for molokhia, an Egyptian soup. “I learned how to use recipes,” she says, “because there hadn’t been recipes or cookbooks in Egypt. Everything was just handed down.”In 1956, her parents, along with most of the remaining Jewish community, were forced to leave Egypt after the Suez crisis. They moved to London to join their children. Cut off from her homeland, Roden missed her extended family, but not so much that she wanted to marry one of them – her parents had tried to encourage her to make a match with a cousin. “There was the fear of you being on the shelf,” she says. Her mother and father both came from families with a large number of girls, who were seen as a burden because they required dowries. She says she tries to understand how her parents saw things but at the time she made it clear that she “didn’t appreciate that attitude”.It’s time to order. The three-course set meal is enticingly priced and Roden opts for the duck and cognac mousse with ciabatta to start, followed by egg tagliatelle with king prawns and homemade green pesto topped with parmesan.I go for the creamy wild mushroom risotto, then baked salmon with new potatoes, baby spinach and french beans in a white-wine butter sauce.She was 23 when she married Paul Roden, a clothes importer, with whom she would have three children. The marriage ended after 15 years but in the middle of it she wroteA Book of Middle Eastern Food, a product of nostalgia, love of food and deep scholarship (she buried herself in the Soas library looking for clues to the origins of the meals she carefully documented).Roden and her children formed a close bond during the years of single parenthood (her ex-husband relocated to the US), which remains strong – they all live near her home in Hampstead Garden Suburb and there are weekly meet-ups. When the children left home she decided to travel around Europe and the Middle East to research what would becomeThe Book of Jewish Food(1997); the trip also provided material on Mediterranean cooking that resulted in a number of books and a BBC TV series.She didn’t enjoy the process of being filmed or the demands to emote in an unnatural manner. “I looked so stupid, but also terrified,” she says. “I don’t wish television on anybody.”Still in her forties, she did most of her travelling alone, which attracted a certain amount of unwanted male attention. Her ingenious method of dealing with it was by talking about her five grandchildren. “I didn’t have any then,” she says, “but after I said I did they were totally respectful, though one man said I shouldn’t mention my grandchildren because it puts men off!” It’s a typical Roden story: finely attuned to local cultures but not blind to their shortcomings.The starters are generous, but Roden declares hers “good, though not quite as good as the first time”.View image in fullscreenClaudia ate duck and cognac mousse with ciabatta; egg tagliatelle with king prawns; and green pesto topped with parmesan.

They both drank a glass of viognier, £8; and an espresso, £3.80.La Cage Imaginaire, 16 Flask Walk, London NW3.Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverWe discuss a paradox that runs deep in her books. The best traditional food is almost always the product of conflict, the clashing of cultures, the exchanging of culinary ideas and practices. But food is also, as the former war photographer and triple amputeeGiles Duleysays, the antithesis of war; a means of bringing people together.“Yes,” she agrees, before adding, “I know Giles. He’s come to dinner at my place. He’s really wonderful. I can’t believe he can cook with one arm!” The longer we talk, the more I realise that she has met an awful lot of people down the years, but retains a youthful enthusiasm for the new and innovative.Our main courses arrive as she talks about returning to Egypt for the first time, 30 years after her family were expelled. While her Jewish identity is important to her, the prawns confirm that she’s happily secular.The return was “very, very emotional but also thrilling”, she says.A Book of Middle Eastern Foodhad helped Egyptian chefs rediscover their own cuisine and she drew crowds of fans and journalists wherever she went, all asking her why she left Egypt. “It’s not taught,” she says of the Jewish expulsion that took place across the Middle East.Her instincts, though, are all about what unites people rather than what divides them, and she made a whole new group of friends on that first trip back with whom she remains in contact.She’s currently working on another book, her 22nd, in which she revisits the Middle East but this time to explore the regional cooking and peasant food that has only recently begun to gain the appreciation it deserves.“There’s more beans and vegetables. I’m not a vegetarian,” she quickly adds. “But let’s just say there’s more of that and the recipes are marvellous, because they taste so good.”Her tagliatelle is also “very good”, though again not quite up there with her previous experience.She says she’ll return to work after our lunch, although she worries – entirely without justification – about her writing. “You see,” she says, “I feel I’m lacking in words.”I tell her that the past two and half hours strongly suggest otherwise.We finish off with a couple of double espressos, before I accompany her back to the tube station. I could have happily stayed on until dinner. But this amazing cultural ambassador, this inspirational wandering gastrophile, has another book to write.Explore more on these topicsClaudia RodenLunch with...FoodMiddle Eastern food and drinkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We talk to the restaurants riding the wave of viral-video successJimi FamurewaSun 23 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 23 Mar 2025 04.23 EDTShareWill Murray isn’t sure about the toad in the hole. In the soft gleam of a prep kitchen, deep below St James’s in London, the chef-patron and co-founder of Fallow frowns at a pan of puffy bronzed batter and extruded sausages. “Do you think we need to do it again?” asks one of his chefs, Emma Taiwo, approaching the pass. “I think we need to do it again,” says Murray, striking an apologetic tone amid the waft of simmering gravy.On the face of it, this level of perfectionism is not surprising – Murray and his fellow chef and co-founder Jack Croft both emerged from the fastidious, Michelin-starred environment of Heston Blumenthal’s Dinner. What is unexpected is that the people this dish is being made for will never actually taste it. Next to the worktop where Murray and Croft stand, a three-person production crew fiddles with iPhones, audio equipment and propped-up wearable cameras.That toad in the hole is one of 14 dishes being cooked and tasted during a day of filming for an “Iconic British Dishes” YouTube challenge that will be beamed out toFallow’s 1 million subscribersand beyond. It’s the latest in a long line of attention-grabbing videos that have seen Murray and Croft compare scrambled-egg techniques, turn beef fat into soap and replicate a cockentrice, a complicated Tudor dish. “Yeah, that didn’t really work,” says Croft.It’s like Jamie on TV or Nigella writing books, but there’s a brand new delivery system and the scale is almost limitlessWelcome to the weird and increasingly lucrative world of restaurant social media and content creation; a digital-age gold rush that has seen hospitality businesses of all kinds seek to transform their fortunes throughInstagram, TikTok and YouTube. From the moment Croft, Murray and restaurateur James Robson launched Fallow, initially as a pop-up in 2020, they have been embracing the potential of a savvy online presence. What began with social-media accounts for their three restaurants (including chicken shop Fowl and Canary Wharf blockbuster Roe) has mushroomed into four accounts with millions of views a month across different platforms. They feed into an operation that employs 345 people (six of whom are part of a dedicated content team) and, in Fallow, has a flagship restaurant doing 5,200 covers a week.Where once a restaurant’s digital footprint consisted of some Instagram, a few dutiful promotional Facebook posts and a blog last updated during “eat out to help out”, now it is just as likely to be an ambitiously shot mix of kitchen documentary, reality show and meme-literate sketch comedy. Crisply technical, ASMR-style recipes walk us through the process of dishes (seeThomas StrakerandMaison François’s Matthew Wryle). Day-in-the-life videos demystify the hospitality business and valorise tasks such as dough-proving and wiping down surfaces.TopJaw-style interviewsthrust clip-mics into the faces of commis chefs and bartenders.View image in fullscreenPatrick Brown, co-founder of Onda Pasta Bar in Manchester, filming in the kitchen for the restaurant’s social media accounts.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThe result is a lightning bolt of virality and real-life restaurant success stories (such as solo operation Patio Pizza in Kingston; Bristol-born Sandwich Sandwich; and Spud Bros in Preston, the jacket potato tram turned TikTok phenomenon with 3.7 million followers). Internet culture, having given us Instagrammable interiors and cartoonish, phone-eats-first dish aesthetics, is now transmogrifying much of the restaurant landscape. In a2024 interview withRestaurantmagazine, Croft suggested Fallow’s business “might become a social media group with restaurants rather than a restaurant company that’s funding our digital”.The days when a chef’s “content” was limited to what they put on the pass are long gone – but what does it all mean for the future of hospitality, and old-fashioned notions such as whether the food is any good?One of Fallow’s formative social-media breakthroughs was born of a problem perhaps as old as restaurants themselves. “Saturday morning service was always our slowest of the week,” explains Murray. “One of our general managers said, ‘Why don’t we do brunch?’ And, of course, every other chef is like, ‘Fucking hell, we’re not doing brunch.’ But we thought: actually, that’s a great idea.” After developing a menu, they posted photos of their new “royale pucks” – decadent, drippy riffs on egg McMuffins, wedged between proprietary pressed croissant buns – to their Instagram. “We sold out the brunch service for the next three months,” says Murray. “It went from our worst service of the week to being 450 covers.”People want something authentic, a little more raw, with some personalityHere was a measurable justification for the energy expended on an Instagram account. Boosted by the arrival of experienced creative director Joe Cowie, the Fallow team built on this proof of concept. Longer YouTube content followed, including a series of popularPOV videos(the first has 6.4m views and counting) which featured GoPro cameras strapped to the chests of Murray and Croft in the midst of a busy service. The success of those absorbing clips, a kind of culinaryCallof Duty, led to a couple of other lightbulb moments. The first was the discovery of their exact YouTube demographic (96% male and 25 to 45 years old); the second was a meeting with a YouTube department head who explained what worked on the platform.“People interact with content for three different reasons,” says Murray. “Education, access or entertainment. A pillar of our content is that it’s educational.” This targeting forms the basis of the technical dish breakdowns and playful, YouTuber-coded challenges (“We cooked the best Michelin star dish from every decade”) Murray and Croft devise alongside their content team. These are filmed every Monday, and put out on restaurant channels and theHerd Chefsaccount that is the umbrella entity for their virtual cooking school.I get a closer look after Murray orders that toad in the hole to be remade. Downstairs, he and Croft taste and rate a plate of fish and chips as part of the British Dishes challenge; Cowie films and directs with two iPhones while production manager Russell Clamp supplies sheets of research. It feels like the kind of thing that might once have been an anarchic TV series.“The idea of promoting your restaurant and a brand as a story is age old,” says Frances Cottrell-Duffield, publicist and founder of Tonic Studio, a social media agency for the hospitality industry. “It’s not that dissimilar to Jamie getting on TV or Nigella writing books. It’s just that there’s a brand new delivery system, and the scale is almost limitless because of the number of people you can reach.” Social media’s tendency to prioritise scrappy honesty over gloss has enabled creators to go where TV seldom would. “We view our specific niche as teaching people how to cook, being radically transparent and taking away the veil of restaurants,” adds Murray.View image in fullscreen‘Need this in my beside table’ … Onda Pasta Bar’s ‘tiramisu drawer’ post on TikTok was viewed 3m times in one morning.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverThat notion of transparency is key. If restaurants have traditionally been predicated on theatre, and careful obfuscation of exactly what goes on beyond the swing doors of their kitchens, today’s businesses are making a feature of how the operational sausage comes together. Fallow has turned explanatory videos about not wearing rubber gloves and thehigh mark-up on its £29 sriracha butter cod’s headinto content. Dalston’s Dusty Knuckle bakery has used Instagram to provide detailed breakdowns of why prices are going up. Gina, the forthcoming Chingford restaurant from chef and Junior Bake Off judge Ravneet Gill and her husband, Mattie Taiano, has a companion Substack, which acts as both a crowdfunding mechanism and a diary of the process of opening a restaurant. This approach doesn’t just reflect a TikTok-age prizing of authenticity and get-ready-with-me fascination about the minutiae of other people’s lives. It also mirrors a cultural moment that has given usThe BearandBoiling Point, when there is a particular, alluring fascination with professional kitchen environments that can be harnessed into something transformative.No British restaurateurs know this better than the founders of Onda Pasta Bar in Manchester. In September 2023, the restaurant was four months into operating from a temporary space on the edge of Ancoats, struggling for consistent bookings and not getting much traction from its social media. Then, co-founder Patrick Brown noticed the refrigerated drawer where chef Sam Astley-Deankept a scoopable slabof tiramisu. “Because I’m not from a chef background, I was just like, ‘What is that?’” says Brown. “And Sam said, ‘Oh, it’s just something I did to save a bit of time in the kitchen when we get an order.’ I had it in my head for about a month.”The subsequent social-media post altered Onda’s fortunes. Following a like-magnet comment onTikTok(“Need this in my bedside table”), the viral video of Astley-Dean’s tiramisu drawer was viewed 3m times in one morning, shared on Instagram by the actor Florence Pugh and almost melted the booking function on Onda’s website. “By the end of that week we were fully booked from October until February,” says Brown. “It gave us confidence to start looking at permanent sites, rather than looking at the finances and thinking we could go under any week.”View image in fullscreenUrban Tandoor’s TikTok.Photograph: @urbantandoorbristol/TikTokCreative dessert storage and the aspirational reality of kitchens are not the only routes to virality. In the past 18 months or so, Bristol-based Indian restaurant Urban Tandoor has had a business-reviving uptick in bookings via an unlikely source: captivatingly shonky music parodies shared on TikTok. Aqua’s Barbie Girl has become Bhaji Girl, performed by waiters and chefs in cheap wigs; Sophie Ellis-Bextor’sSaltburn-soundtracking hit is now a terrifically silly 55-second love story called Murder at the Tandoor. The restaurant’s owner, Sujith D’Almeida, notes that tourists from as far afield as Australia have been prompted to make pilgrimages for selfies with befuddled front-of-house staff, and that “about 40%” of business now comes from fans of their TikTok. “The restaurant market is saturated on social and the appetite for content is changing,” notes Nat Brereton, head of TikTok at Nonsensical, the dedicated TikTok marketing agency behind Urban Tandoor’s videos. “You can only look at so many gorgeous plates of food, so people want something that feels authentic, a little more raw and has some personality.”Of course, if everyone is hurling things at the same algorithmic target, the impact is going to be dulled. Brereton acknowledges that it takes until “the 70th post or something” to see cut-through. Brown thinks that we may have already passed saturation point. “I can’t say for certain, but it feels like the wins mean less,” he explains. “If so many restaurants are going viral for day-in-the-life videos, that’s going to stop putting bums on seats. It’s only been a year and a half since our tiramisu drawer reel but I don’t know if it would have been as successful or had the same impact now.”Cottrell-Duffield also points out that the unstoppable engine of social-media popularity can occasionally backfire. “We had a restaurant where something went viral on their dessert menu and it totally brought in the wrong audience,” she says. “The customers didn’t enjoy it when they got there so it was this unhelpful flash in the pan.”Murray acknowledges that worries about screen time and what some in the US have started to call “attention fracking” will undoubtedly grow in the next six months. “A hundred per cent there will be a move away from it and we’ll be first in the firing line,” he says. “If it gets to the point where we’re prioritising content over the success of the restaurant, we’ve gone too far.”A hundred per cent there will be a move away from it, and we’ll be first in the firing lineSigns of a shift in approach may already be here. One of the notable restaurant trends of recent months has seen some places taking an ascetic approach to social media. The Dover in Mayfair has a placeholder Instagram presence, and Canteen in Notting Hill favours soft-focus kitchen candids and a single, repeated screenshot of the day’s changing menu. At Lucia’s, a small, Mexican-inspired counter in Hackney Wick, a rush to open accidentally turned into a hugely successful, digital-averse approach. “People loved that their initial contact with us was a conversation rather than a picture on Instagram,” says founder Jo Kurdi. “They had to come in, explore and find out for themselves.”To swim against the tide is a strategy in itself. But it’s worth noting that all these chefs and owners are using wildly different methods to search for the same thing: the joyful interactions that arise when customers discover delicious food. “I think it comes from the lack of money in hospitality,” says Cottrell-Duffield. Last November, accounting firm Price Bailey reported that 12% of restaurants in Britain were at imminent risk of closure. “There is an air of desperation, in all honesty, and people are just trying to find a way to bring people in, at a time when no one has really caught up to how quickly the media landscape has changed.” Viral dishes that aren’t actually good are as ephemeral as an Instagram story.This competitiveness is what is driving Fallow and others to double down on digital content; not to replace traditional hospitality, but to navigate an increasingly brutal trading environment. It’s at the forefront of Murray’s mind as he prepares to make a pork pie for Cowie’s cameras and millions of viewers. “The food is the most important thing, and the customers, too,” he says. “But at the same time, what does the food matter if there’s no one there to taste it?”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsThe ObserverSocial mediaFoodHospitality industryTikTokYouTubeInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"
