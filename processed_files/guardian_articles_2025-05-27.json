Here are 10 questions to bring you closerSometimes friendships end for a good reason, but all too often we just fail to look after them. The right conversation can do a lot to patch things upEmine SanerTue 27 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 12.50 EDTShareWe know that good relationships are vital to health and happiness, but friendships can wither without time and attention. It’s normal for friendships to change, and a relationship cooling isn’t necessarily bad. “Sometimes we struggle to accept that a friendship has run its course for any number of reasons,” says Nina Badzin, host of the podcastDear Nina: Conversations about Friendship. “Pivoting the relationship to a more casual connection honours the past friendship without forcing an affection and chemistry that cannot be forced.” So ask yourself: is this a friendship you really want to save?If the answer is yes, here are some questions you could ask your friends to get your relationship back on track.Are you just busy, or is it me?One of the great thing about friendships, says Max Dickins, author ofBilly No-Mates: How I Realised Men Have a Friendship Problem, is they’re largely “free of the obligations and expectations of other forms of love. You or I can disappear from view for a while, and that’s OK. This is a good thing – grown-up life can be overwhelming, and we want our friendships to be a relief, not another thing we feel we are failing at.” But when months go by without contact, especially if you were more regularly in touch before, “it can be hard not to wonder whether you’ve done something wrong”. Perhaps you have, says Dickins. “Better to talk about it, so you might repair things.”What have you been up to?It’s simple, but it might be all you need to relight a friendship, especially if time has passed. “Everyone likes to talk about themselves,” says Robert Waldinger, director of the Harvard Study on Adult Development – research that has shown the importance of good relationships – and co-author ofThe Good Life. “Just ask people to tell you about the things that are most important to them, because curiosity goes a long way toward reconnecting people.” If you haven’t been in touch for a while, their life might look very different from how you remember it. “Just really be interested in who this person is now.”How do you think our friendship has changed over the years?“This can bring up the fact that you don’t feel as close as you used to,” says Michelle Elman, author ofBad Friend: Why Friendship Breakups Hurt and How to Heal. “It allows the question to be open and can make someone reflect and question something they might not have noticed.”They might not have realised you’ve spent less time together in the last year. “Being more distant isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as long as it works for both of you.” Change in friendships is normal, she says, and can be positive “if your friendship is flexible and can adapt”.Perhaps the distance turns out to be deliberate on your friend’s part. How can you prepare yourself for an answer you’d rather not hear? “Clarity is kindness and while it might be difficult to hear, it is better to know,” says Elman. “You are allowed to have hurt feelings and also be grateful they were honest with you, so you can put that time and energy towards someone who appreciates it.”Do you know that I miss you?View image in fullscreenIllustration: Spencer Wilson/The GuardianOne of the tricky things about friendship, says Dickins, “is that it is ambiguous. How do I know that you like me as much as I like you? It is a relationship without ritual – unlike in romantic love, we do not publicly mark a friendship’s significance.” For men, especially, he says, “it’s rare to call out the importance of a friend”. The simple act of telling your friend that you miss them, “has a clarifying effect and – when reciprocated – leads to a mutual recognition that makes the whole enterprise feel more meaningful”.Can we put a date on the calendar?“This may seem obvious, but some people are terrible at making plans,” says Badzin. “When you’re inviting a friend to hang out, don’t offer a generic ‘Let’s hang out’ text. Always suggest specific dates. A huge hurdle to seeing friends is scheduling. If you’re willing to do the heavy lifting of suggesting the dates and even the place, you’re already ahead.”Perhaps your friendship is waning because you’re frustrated that you always seem to make the first move and do most of the planning, but annoying as it is, don’t give it too much weight. “You may need to accept that we all bring different strengths to our friendships,” says Badzin. “Perhaps yours is reaching out and planning, but your friend’s strength is being an excellent listener. Learn to look for complementary friendship skills, and not skills that are the exact match of your own.”Would you like to join me at …?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty ImagesIdentify something you could regularly do together. A weekly walk? A monthly cinema date? Remove the stress of scheduling and commit to something that happens at the same time and place – perhaps a course, or pub quiz, or running club. Keeping up with each other in small but regular ways avoids the pressure of feeling like you need to make time for a long meeting just to catch up. “If you talk to your friend every week or every month even, you have more things you can check in about, particularly if you share interests,” says Waldinger.Do you prefer to communicate in a different way?“Sometimes we’re over-texting the friend who prefers a phone call,” says Badzin. “Perhaps we’re calling the friend who communicates best with voice memos on their own schedule.” It’s very likely, she adds, that we’re relying too heavily on our smartphones to stay in touch, “and forgetting to spend time together in person. A close friendship cannot exist on texts and exchanges of memes alone. If a friendship is drifting apart, changing the method you use to get in touch could be a simple fix – and make sure to see your friend in person.”What’s the most important way a person shows up for you?“This is to check whether you are both getting your needs met,” says Elman. You may have every intention of being a good friend, and assume you are succeeding, but there’s a chance you’re missing the mark. “‘Showing up’ will look different for everyone, and without asking, you won’t know what matters to your friend most.”What’s something you wish you could talk to me about and haven’t?You might discover new depths to your friend, allow them to talk about their worries or hear some hard truths about something you’ve done to annoy them. “Sometimes people don’t know how to bring up conversations and this is a way you can open that door and see if there is anything unresolved,” says Elman.‘You have to set time aside for friendship’: the radical power of hanging outRead more“Keep an open mind and remove as much judgment as possible. Instead of focusing on why someone didn’t tell you something sooner, continue the conversation with curiosity, with the goal of understanding them better.”If I were to organise a great day out for us, what would it be?We tend to judge, says Dickins, the “closeness” of a friendship based on “levels of mutual disclosure. Yet for many people, especially men, the intimacy they miss is of a more active sort. They may have drifted from their friend because they have lost a spot on the horizon, some mutual destination they are travelling towards. These journeys are often tied to a certain time of our life.” Friendships can suffer when people find themselves at different life stages or crisis moments from their friends, such as starting a family, facing redundancy or losing a parent. “A useful place to begin rejuvenation is to ask, what might we share together now?”Explore more on these topicsFriendshipSocial mediaHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Starmer and Reeves must not waste their chanceGordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Tue 27 May 2025 12.08 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 13.14 EDTShareAs Labour continues its inquest into the reasons for its local election losses, attention has focused on thepensioners’ winter fuel allowanceand the changes in incapacity benefit. And in the past few days, there have been internal criticisms of the decision todelay the publicationof its child poverty review.But Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have made the right call in delaying until the autumn. This new timetable means that the government is not only consulting widely, determined that Labour must never lose its reputation for fairness, but also considering how to fund the changes the child poverty review will propose – something only the budget can address. I know from my 10 years as chancellor that the public spending statement Reeves will deliver next month (which is not like a budget where tax and spending announcements are made together) will not be able to undo the scale of the damage done to the4.5 million childrenin poverty – the ever-increasing victims of the long tail of Tory austerity.Only a budget in which, for example, agambling or a banking levycan be announced, can generatethe more than £3bn that would cover the estimated cost of abolishing the two-child cap and take nearly half a million children out of poverty to meet theelection promise“to end mass dependence on emergency food parcels”, and honour themandategiven to the child poverty taskforcein this parliament to ensure a “reduction in child poverty”. By investing in children,we will affirm our moral purpose and deliver the promised “decade of national renewal”.The Conservative years of austerity may now feel distant in our minds. But from their political grave, David Cameron and George Osborne’s pre-determined, post-dated decisions are still casting a dark shadow, making Labour’s task difficult. The two-child limit was announced in 2017, but applied only to children born after that time. This timebomb set by the Conservatives means that about50,000 more childreneach year experience its poverty-making effects – this will continue until 2035, when the policy will finally apply to every family with a third child under 18.Already nearly one in two children inBirmingham (46%) and Manchester (44%)are living in poverty, and in some local communities the figure rises to85%. By the time the Tory policy agenda has run its course, more than five million children will have been cast into poverty. Shakespeare was right: “The evil that men do lives after them.”For a time, the bogus self-serving Tory claim seemed acceptable to the public: that middle-class parents were unable to afford to have more children because they were paying taxes to subsidise work-shy, feckless parents having additional children just to game the benefit system.But this allegation was never accurate. About70% of childrenin poverty – more than 3 million – are in working families, and most of the rest are in families hit by sickness, redundancy or a shortage of childcare. Indeed, we know that most of the half a million children who have been thrust into poverty in the past few years are not part of a permanent class of families trapped in dependency culture: instead,60% of familiescaught by the two-child benefit rule have at least one adult in work. If the Conservatives had listened to parents, they would have discovered that it is invariably family crises, like a bereavement, cancer, or time out of work between jobs, that caused them to fall temporarily below the poverty line.To her credit, in her spending review, Reeves will announceradical measuresto prevent homelessness and destitution especially in 75 of the UK’s most deprived areas, including introducing more breakfast clubs and newfamily hubs, along the lines of Sure Start, which helped a previous generation of children from low-income families realise their talents. And she will be able to show from the success ofSure Startthat savings from early interventions are twice as big as the costs.But child poverty cannot be eradicated by breakfast clubs or family hubs alone. Breakfasts are worth about £9 a week off the family budget, and cannot compensate for the harm caused by Osborne’s cut in benefits of £66 a week for a family with three children, and £132 from a family of four. Indeed,evidence showsthat the most cost-effective way to take 350,000 children out of poverty immediately and rescue 700,000 from deep poverty is replacing the two-child rule. If this is the case, the public say they will support the change.According tonew opinion pollingthat I commissioned, Seventy-five percent 75% alsobelieve poverty is “morally wrong” and almost as many are acutely embarrassed that Britain has fallen far behind Ireland, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries in the way we treat our most vulnerable children.There are a number of ways in which we can remedy this injustice. Frame new spending around an education premium or special financial support to help children be properly fed and equipped to succeed at school. If only 65% of children are poverty-free at the age of five, it is impossible to achieve the government’s most recently stated objective of75% of childrenbeing ready for school by 2028. The government could also place conditions on its receipt, from requiring children to attend school or parents to attend parenting classes. What matters is that children should not suffer and have their potential destroyed because of poverty.According to the new poll, the public not only agrees that we must invest in the next generation, but also that all of us benefit if children grow up to be healthy, educated and productive members of society. Once “don’t knows” are eliminated from the sample, 85% favour a £3bn tax on gambling, and 75% favour a tax on the banks – most also agreeing to earmark the money for poverty reduction.That isone reason why changing the two-child rule will have support from the Lib Dems, the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and Reform UK. But do note the Farage promise to restore tax credits to children in low-income families has to be set against his“Contract with you”, which would hit the very same children with £150bn of spending cuts, andthe effective privatisation of the NHS.Fairness has always been a watchword of the British public. A fairness guarantee would mean that no one is condemned to poverty as a result of changes in pensioners’ allowances or incapacity benefit. This funding for an anti-poverty lock would also mean that every child is prepared for school and supported during their schooling. For the first time in 15 years, we can ensure for that all children get the finest possible start in life.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionChildrenBenefitsLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesGordon BrowncommentShareReuse this content"

Not every new entry is a Bohemian Rhapsody-level smash; some, like the dreary Amy Winehouse biography Back to Black or the misbegotten Whitney Houston movie I Wanna Dance With Somebody, outright flop. But there are still enough success stories like A Complete Unknown ($140m worldwide, eight Oscar nominations) to assure every pantheon pop artist in America will probably receive this treatment eventually.‘I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had armed people say they’ll shoot’ – Dan Reed on the fallout from his Michael Jackson filmsRead more“Eventually” has become the operative word for Michael, a biopic of the globally revered but controversial pop star Michael Jackson. The film from Antoine Fuqua was supposed to have been released by now; it was originally set to come out in April 2025. After an initial delay to October of this year, it’s now looking likely to shift tosometime in 2026, not least because it has scheduled 22 days of additional shooting in June. Two months after its intended release, it’s going back in front of cameras for nearly enough time to shoot an entirely separate film.That may be the eventual result, though it’s not the intention of the additional filming this year. The plan now seems to involve reconfiguring Michael into a two-part movie; the new material will be used to expand the first half of the story, which – for “part one”, anyway – will leave off around 1980. That’s before Thriller, before Bad, and well before the 1993 allegations of child abuse, which gave way to a 1994 settlement and a separate trial over child molestation charges in 2005. The movie apparently included scenes with a Jackson accuser whose settlement with his estate included the provision that he not be included in any dramatizations. As is often the case with modern musical biopics, the estate is signing off on the film, and their lack of proper oversight has turned a dramatic decision into a legal problem. Turning one movie into two buys the film-makers more time to figure out how to fix the later stretch of the film so that it’s no longer in breach.View image in fullscreenJaafar Jackson as Michael Jackson in Michael.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/LionsgateAnd, hey, maybe it’ll also double the box office – eventually. Another sign of musical biopics leaning into their status as event movies is their apparent willingness to embrace modern-day franchise tropes. Hence an upcoming quartet of Beatles biopics, one for each member of the band, and film-makers turning the Jackson estate’s carelessness into an opportunity to treat his story like a YA fantasy.The dissonance, of course, comes from the fact that this particular case of eventizing is meant to better address multiple accusations of child abuse against the King of Pop. That these accusations are included at all is surprising and, at first, sounds downright bold for a subgenre that favors legally agreed-upon narratives of questionable veracity. (Even a film as initially electric as Straight Outta Compton eventually settles down into feeling like a mutually beneficial talking points hashed out by lawyers and producers, rather than a story with genuine meaning.) But that’s just it: there’s no chance the ultra-protective (and lucrative) Jackson estate has signed off on a biopic that is anything short of deeply sympathetic to Jackson’s side of this upsetting story. The actor playing Jackson, for example, could hardly be more estate-approved: it’s Jaafar Jackson, the musician’s nephew. Does that sound like a casting choice aiming for an unflinching portrait, or one that indulges the spectacle of allowingMichael Jacksonto live again?A Jackson semi-hagiography that still manages to include child-molestation material – whether treated carefully or with legally actionable cruelty to Jackson’s accusers – seems like a worst-of-both-worlds proposition. It’s notable that some of the biggest recent biopic flops, both financially and creatively, are those that must contend with some degree of tragic, relatively recent history: the early death of Amy Winehouse; the addiction issues that the Whitney Houston movie gracelessly sanitizes. Those films still felt like legally fussed-with estate agreements – like authorized merch, in other words – while also bumming audiences out with the unavoidable sadness at their center.On top of that, Jackson’s story has that early-death factor alongside accusations far more troubling than the self-destruction of Houston or Winehouse. To unapologetically celebrate Jackson would mean skewing some details of his final decade-plus of life beyond recognition – or simply ignoring much of it. There are signs that Jackson is so beloved, so close to a kind of pop martyrdom, that this is a winning strategy. The success of MJ the Musical, a jukebox accounting of Jackson’s creative process, suggests that there are plenty of people willing to overlook Jackson’s personal demons in favor of a de facto greatest-hits concert. That Broadway show has raked in millions over the past three years, expanding toLondon and Australia, while conveniently orienting itself in 1992, the year before the first public allegations against Jackson.Maybe that’s the strategy behind making Michael into a two-part epic. No matter what the second half may bring (and it sounds as if the film-makers may legitimately not know how or if that will pan out), a movie that ends shortly after the release of his solo debut Off the Wall can get away with peddling nostalgia, otherworldly talent, and triumph over adversity. Then a second movie can provide the illusion of due diligence while also selling itself as a sequel to a blockbuster crowd-pleaser. (It’s also not too far removed from the old music-industry scam of counting double albums as two sales instead of one.) On paper, the details of Michael sound like a potential fiasco: an involved but careless estate, a money-sucking repair job, a first-time actor in the lead, and material that tests audiences’ willingness to tolerate in their theme-parky tributes. Yet in reality, it could be a gamechanger in further eroding the boundaries between the art of biography and the business of legacy-making. Jackson changed music history in his lifetime; now he’s being given a chance to change movie-music history from beyond.Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why would they? As cases of voyeurism against women soar in the UK, victims say it’s too easy for men to get away with itAnna MooreTue 27 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 07.13 EDTShareThe first time Heidi Marney took a bath in her new, temporary home, she felt she was being watched. “I had this overwhelming sense that there were eyes on me,” she says. She remembers scanning the room. “It was a big, double bath and above, on the wall, there was a TV with a device hanging down with a flashing red light.” Marney sent a photo of it to a friend who assured her that it was a dongle and said he had one too so that he could get Sky in every room.“Logic told me that, if someone was filming me, there’d be a camera in my bedroom,” Marney continues, “so I went to my room and looked everywhere – the wardrobe, the lights; I was meticulous. There was nothing, so I told myself I was being ridiculous. My landlord was the kindest human you could ever meet. He would never do that.” She pauses for a second then sighs. “I’ll never ever ignore my instincts again.”This happened in December 2019, when Marney had moved into Robert Holden’s rural home, a former farmhouse in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire. Marney had known Holden for a decade – he was her half-sister’s uncle, so she had long viewed him as a family member. Holden was also well known in the area, a councillor who had won awards for his services to the community. “He coordinated flood relief, he fed elderly people on Christmas Day, he mowed little old ladies’ lawns,” says Marney. And now that she was at a low point, temporarily homeless after leaving a difficult relationship, Holden had offered Marney and her 16-month-old daughter a room in his spacious house while she got back on her feet. (It was something he had done many times for many others, taking vulnerable people into his home.)Aside from that first, fleeting discomfort, the arrangement seemed to proceed well. “He’d make me a cup of tea of an evening and I opened up to him about my struggles,” says Marney. “He was intelligent and compassionate. I couldn’t praise him enough.”View image in fullscreen‘Knowing that he had been watching me felt awful – I felt shameful, I felt disgusting’ – Marney.Photograph: Posed by model. Giselleflissak/Getty ImagesShe stayed for 11 months and towards the end, as Marney began to think about moving on and dating again, she felt Holden’s behaviour change. “He didn’t like it. He was acting like a weird, jealous boyfriend,” she says. When she discovered that he was tracking her through the Find My app, she called her aunt, a police officer, who advised Marney to check the home for cameras. “I sent her a video of the bathroom and she screen-shotted a sensor attached to the wall and asked: ‘What on earth is that? Why is there a sensor in the bathroom?’”Marney took a kitchen knife and, balancing on a stool and two paint pots, reached up and prised the sensor apart. Inside, she saw the words “camera” and “microphone”. “I just completely and utterly froze,” says Marney. “It was like holding your breath. What on earth happens now?”When she Googled the device’s serial number, she saw that the “sensor” was a camera, specially designed to avoid alerting the subject that they were being filmed. It had gone out of production two years previously, so had clearly been there a while. In fact, it later emerged that Holden had been filming women through hidden cameras for almost 15 years, creating an extensive digital library neatly organised under their names. Last September,he was jailedfor six years and two months.Holden’s voyeurism conviction is one of the few to make national headlines – but local news reports offer an alarming insight into the possible scale of this behaviour. Just this month, adoctor was jailedfor filming guests at his Glasgow Airbnb for more than three years, through cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms disguised as air fresheners (one pointed at the loo, the other at the shower) and a smoke alarm. Other UK cases includephotographer David Glover, who filmed more than 100 women using covert cameras in his studio changing rooms;Adam Devaney, who used a camera disguised as a pen to film colleagues in the toilet of his North Yorkshire workplace, andAdam Dennis and Robert Morgan, who used hidden cameras to film more than 5,000 people in swimming pool changing rooms and toilets in London and Surrey, then shared and traded the images online.View image in fullscreenSpy cameras are widely available online.Photograph: Posed by model. Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesJanuary to December of last year saw a 24% rise in reported cases of voyeurism and exhibitionism (crime statistics unhelpfully combine the two) in the UK. This is partly why the government is attempting to tighten legislation around hidden cameras, which are easily available in specialist spy stores, as well as on sites such as Amazon and eBay, and often made to look like clocks, adapters, photo frames, humidifiers, even disposable coffee cups.At present, UK law defines voyeurism as nonconsensually observing or recording someone during a private activity for sexual gratification or to cause distress. Under proposals in theCrimeand Policing bill, it would become a criminal offence to install equipment intended to take intimate images without someone’s consent. Motive wouldn’t be a factor – and even if no images were taken, installing a camera for this purpose would become a crime. For Marney though, this isn’t nearly enough. “How are those cameras even legal?” she asks. “The potential for abuse is so huge and obvious. It’s far more common than people would think.”Dr Vicky Lister, a research fellow in the School of Psychology at the University of Kent, confirms that the cases we hear about represent the tip of an iceberg. Many that come to light have gone undetected for years – and few result in prosecution. In 2020, out of more than 10,000 reported cases, fewer than 600 reached court. As part of her PhD,Lister interviewed men in UK prisons for voyeurism offences(there are no women serving time for this crime). Many had used covert cameras, including one disguised as a shampoo bottle in a public shower. “It’s scary, isn’t it?” she says. “As soon as you start digging, you start to realise. The men I interviewed were saying: ‘Everyone’s probably been a victim at some point.’”Research on prevalence of voyeuristic behaviour is patchy. “A population study in Sweden suggests a lifetime prevalence of voyeurism of 11.5%,” says Lister, “but smaller non-population studies across lots of different countries, including the UK, generally estimate higher Even [such estimates] are likely to be an underrepresentation, as there’ll be people who won’t admit it to a researcher.” There’s every reason to believe that the technology now available to facilitate this will lead more to do it.One study in Canadafound that 79% of participants would engage in voyeuristic behaviours if there was assurance they would not be caught.Lister is hoping that her next research focus will be voyeurism as a “gateway crime”. Does it lead to physical sexual assault? Some studies of rapists and sexual murderers have revealed a history of voyeurism – up to 45% – but that doesn’t necessarily mean one has caused the other. “We do know that voyeurism is addictive and compulsive,” says Lister, “so people who’ve done it once will generally keep doing it until they’re caught. Unfortunately, there’s a stark lack of literature on this whole topic. I think it’s because it’s ‘noncontact’ and seen as a victimless crime – until you’re the victim.”If I’m in a toilet, I will check plug sockets, mirrors, cracks in tiles. It has made me so paranoidFionaFor Fiona*, learning that someone filmed her while she was in her bedroom, having sex with her girlfriend, has had a lasting impact. In December 2023, she was contacted by police in Aberdeen who informed her that they had uncovered indecent images of her, taken by an electrician, James Denholm. He hadused hidden cameras to film women(some of them his customers) in their bedrooms, bathrooms and pub toilets for over a decade. “By the time it came to light, I hadn’t lived in the flat where the images were taken for five years and I wasn’t dating the same person any more,” she says. “It was so long ago and I have absolutely no idea if he did some work for us or where the cameras were or how it happened. I know that he lived a five-minute walk from our house.“It’s so grotesque and inhuman,” she continues. “It makes me feel so angry, so embarrassed and mortified and so, so exposed. It has really made me distrust men I don’t know. I’d feel very uncomfortable letting anyone come and carry out work inside my home. I’d need to watch them constantly. My blinds are closed 100% of the time. I never open them now.”View image in fullscreenA camera can be disguised as many things, such as an air freshener.Photograph: Tolola/Getty Images/iStockphotoFiona also checks for cameras in public toilets. “I avoid using them if I can but if I am in one, I will check everywhere – plug sockets, mirrors, cracks in tiles. It has made me so paranoid and anxious.”Marney experienced similar emotions. “Knowing that he had been watching me felt awful – I felt shameful, I felt disgusting,” she says. “I remember staying at my new partner’s after this had all happened and taking a shower,” she says. “He had all these fancy water gadgets on the ceiling. My brain was saying, ‘Are they cameras? Is he watching me?’ I just fell to the floor, crying my eyes out.”Although UK laws around voyeurism – and the proposed changes to the Crime and Policing bill – focus on the taking of intimate images, this doesn’t cover all the harms caused by hidden cameras. They can also be weapons of control. Emma Pickering, the head of technology-facilitated abuse and economic empowerment at the domestic abuse charity Refuge, says that many women they support have been spied on by current or former partners.Labour to make taking intimate images without consent a criminal offenceRead more“Most cases we see involve hidden devices – listening, tracking, filming or sometimes all three,” she says. “It’s really difficult to help someone conduct sweeps of their home as [cameras] are designed to blend into a domestic setting. They look like everyday items. We’ll be asking if all the plug adapters work and if the remote control is really connected to the TV.” One survivor uncovered 80 spycams in her home.An abusive partner can use the footage in various ways, says Pickering. “In one case, he was gathering intimate images and putting them online, profiting financially. Others use it to monitor everything someone is doing, who they are seeing, how they’re spending their time. With that information, they can gaslight and control and stay one step ahead.”This is what happened to Linda*, who was in an eight-year relationship with an abusive man. “At first, he was charming and attentive but the control started subtly,” she says. “First, he convinced me to delete my social media because it was ‘bad for my mental health’. Eventually, I stopped going out with my friends as it caused so many arguments, it was easier not to.” Isolated, home alone, she would sit down to watch TV and have a cup of tea and he would text to ask, “Enjoying your cup of tea?” If she went to answer the doorbell, he would message, “Who was at the door?”“I was so confused,” says Linda. “It was like living in a television show – like it wasn’t actually my life. I tried sitting down at different times in case he was just guessing my routine but he always knew. He seemed to know my every move.”They are marketed as harmless gadgets, but they’re used by stalkers and abusersLinda uncovered the two tiny wireless cameras by accident while deep-cleaning. One was on the mantelpiece, the other in a light fitting. “I just felt sick and disbelief,” she says. “Why? In our home?” When she confronted her partner, he insisted that they weren’t cameras, then they quickly disappeared. “A couple of months later, I found them hidden in a different place,” she says.Although Linda escaped the relationship when it escalated into physical abuse, her former partner continued to stalk her, threaten her online and drive past her place of work. He also left some of her clothes on her doorstep – since Linda had escaped in a hurry – and it was only later that she found the same tiny camera sewn into the lining of her returned coat.View image in fullscreenPicture frames can conceal spying devices.Photograph: Strauss/Curtis/Getty ImagesIt’s very hard to secure convictions for these cases. “There are usually no consequences for the perpetrators,” says Pickering. “Someone can claim that the cameras were in the house as a security measure, and that their partner consented to them being there. The threshold to removing evidence stored on a perpetrator’s phone or hard drive is very high and there’s also a huge backlog. Even when [material] is seized by police, there has usually been plenty of time to remove any incriminating evidence.” Attempts by Refuge to engage with manufacturers and suppliers of surveillance technology have not enjoyed much success. “It’s completely lawless,” says Pickering. “We need to be looking at why these things are available when they are causing so much harm.”Linda agrees. “They are marketed as harmless gadgets, but in reality they’re used by stalkers and abusers,” she says. “There’s no regulation, no safeguarding. Why do they need to be hidden? Why can anyone buy them? I don’t ever feel safe now. I’m hypervigilant, it’s with me the whole time. The government should listen to women like us. It’s not that we’re paranoid – it’s just that we know what’s possible.”* Fiona and Linda’s names have been changed.In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

I heard it in Richard Hell’s band at CBGB. I heard it at block parties, in the Cuban music bleeding through the walls of my Lower East Side apartment. I heard it in Haitian rara, in Croatian wedding music. I couldn’t figure out yet what all this music had in common, but I was ready to go to war for this cause. I wanted to reach people’s souls and make them dance, or cry, or puke.”Marc Ribot is on a phone call remembering the kaleidoscopic sounds of the New York he moved to in the late 70s, in an acerbic New Jersey drawl that melts with the warmth of the memory. In the decades since, Ribot has gone on to become a wildcard sideman treasured by icons and iconoclasts includingTom Waits, Marianne Faithfull, Robert Plant and many more. He’s a guest instructor at the New England Conservatory, and has released dozens of collaborations and solo albums exploring his various fascinations with Latin pop, jazz, avant-noise, protest folk and much more. Now, he’s made his first vocal album at the age of 71: Map of a Blue City, which has been in the works for three decades.View image in fullscreenMark Ribot performing in 1993.Photograph: Frans Schellekens/RedfernsBut this restless and charmed career would have seemed a pipe dream during his early days in New York, when he was a 24-year-old jobbing guitarist clinging to his belief that “jazz was the music of freedom” and gritting his teeth through gigs with veteran bebop organist Brother Jack McDuff. “He would fix me with his infamous death-ray glare across the bandstand every night – I was not, and have never been, a good bebop player.”He persisted, his nights spent transcribing solos by freethinking jazz artists such as Eric Dolphy and Albert Ayler, his days spent earning $50 a session for novelty albums starring kids’ characters such as Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake. It wasn’t until he saw jazz-adjacent No Wave groups – James Chance and the Blacks, DNA and the Lounge Lizards – that he found the kind of scene he’d moved to New York for, and Ribot ended up joining the latter band.Led by painter John Lurie, the Lizards charmed the hip cognoscenti of New York, and on New Year’s Eve 1984, Tom Waits clambered on stage for their punk-jazz rendition of Auld Lang Syne. Waits invited Ribot to play on 1985’s Rain Dogs, and amid a starry cast of guitarists – including Keith Richards – Ribot was the most idiosyncratic, duelling ribcage-rattling marimba on Singapore, etching the gothic Cemetery Polka and channelling southern soul on the sorrowful Hang Down Your Head.Waits wasn’t interested in musicians who simply played the parts he assigned them. “We were all involved in the process of creating,” Ribot says. “There were no written charts or orchestrations; Tom would play guitar or piano or congas, set a rhythm and a vibe, and then we’d come up with parts. He conceived his songs theatrically, asking the listener: who is the singer? What kind of bar are they singing in? Are they breathing their disgusting breath into your ear? It’s like as a guitarist, you’re always making choices: play loud or soft, simple harmonies or discordant tone clusters. Are you a remote god atop a mountain, bellowing commands to the faithful? Or are you whispering in somebody’s ear? We always tailored our playing to support the stories the songs told.”View image in fullscreen‘I usually play better on other people’s records’ … Marc Ribot.Photograph: Ebru YildizRibot also joined Waits’s live band. “We rehearsed 60 to 70 songs. And Tom could call off any one of those, or something we hadn’t rehearsed, and you had to roll with it. Tom was a demanding bandleader – he needs stuff to groove, and if the band is being wishy-washy, it wounds him personally and physically. You’ve seen footage of him in concert, banging the mic stand on the stage? That’s not a gimmick, that’s him telling us toget with the program. But he was always respectful. Tom understood the difference between a musician and a servant.” Ribot has continued to work with Waits over the years since, though Waits hasn’t put out an album since 2011. “Tom’s processes are a deep mystery to everyone, probably including himself. But he knows that if he wants to jam, I’m here.”After Rain Dogs, Ribot’s session career blossomed in myriad directions, working with Elvis Costello, Madeleine Peyroux, proto-industrialist Foetus and many more. “The few people who’ve hired me as a one-size-fits-all player or asked me to play like I do on Tom’s records have been quickly disabused of their concept,” he says. “What I try to do is make sense of what I’m hearing. I didn’t play what I played on Tom’s songs because I think that’s ‘good guitar’ – it made sense on those songs.”He has the unflappable confidence of a hotshot sessioneer who’s held his own alongside absolute legends. But when T Bone Burnett invited him to play on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss’s 2007 album Raising Sand, Ribot was “totally intimidated”, he laughs. “My junior high rock band was called Love Gun! Like every other guitarist in the world, I always dreamed of playing Whole Lotta Love! I took 20 different fuzzboxes in with me: finally, I get to play some metal!” Raising Sand was, however, an exercise in Americana, which nevertheless suited Ribot’s playing perfectly. “Still, whenever I’d hear Plant’s voice in my headphones, I was like Dr Strangelove when he can’t stop doing the Nazi salute, my foot twitching towards the fuzzbox. But Alison’s such a great singer and storyteller. I was so carried away by her voice and the story she was singing that I straight-up forgot to play. That had never happened to me before.”Ribot then jumped aboard The Union, Elton John’s 2010 album with legendary musician and songwriter Leon Russell, who gave Elton’s career a crucial boost early on. “Leon was ill, it was towards the end of his life,” Ribot says. “But towards the end of the sessions he came out of surgery and overdubbed his parts. Elton was very much in the room all the time. I remember walking into one of the isolation rooms to find Elton playing bebop piano, and he had great chops. And that’s why that record made sense, because you could hear the strong New Orleans roots in both their playing. Elton’s absolutely a closet jazz musician!”View image in fullscreen‘It’s how I pay the rent … Marc Ribot playing in Oberhausen, Germany, in January.Photograph: Imago/AlamyWhen not sharing the rarefied air of rock royalty, you can find Ribot downtown, shredding with the likes of far-out composer John Zorn. “John really understands extended technique,” he says admiringly. “It’s one thing to ask someone to play guitar with a balloon, and another to actually make music playing with a balloon, to own that language, as we did on The Book of Heads”. And his interest in Latin and Caribbean music – which began when he was a 10-year-old, taking guitar lessons from family friend Frantz Casseus, “the father of Haitian classical guitar” – has become another area of specialism, as he’s recorded albums of Casseus’s pieces, played for Latin stars like Caetano Veloso and Marisa Monte, and won a passionate following in South America with his band Los Cubanos Postizos (The Prosthetic Cubans), reinterpreting the music of Arsenio Rodriguez, who Ribot says “was both the Duke Ellington and Jimi Hendrix of Cuban music”.“I usually play better on other people’s records,” he says, “because on my own records I’m dealing with so much more than playing guitar.” Map of a Blue City began in the mid-90s as sparse demos recorded in his apartment. Rejected by punk-rock label Epitaph Records for being “too dark” (Too Dark for Epitaph became the album’s title for a while), the project was later helmed by legendary producer Hal Willner, who secured a budget and a string section to fully realise Ribot’s early sketches. “But I liked the demos better,” Ribot winces. “It got shelved, and I paid Hal back over seven or eight years.” Ribot then lost the original multi-tracks – but another producer friend, Ben Greenberg, used modern technology to recover the lost music.“It’s like chamber music: intimate,” he says, of the album. Alongside his own songs, Ribot covers the Carter Family’s apocalyptic vision When the World’s on Fire, and adds music to Allen Ginsberg’s Sometime Jailhouse Blues; For Celia is inspired by Heinrich Heine’s poem The Lorelei, and Holocaust imagery. “The song is about not trying to impose a romantic narrative on history,” he says, “and instead looking upon it like the disaster it is.”The ongoing disaster of the present is increasingly occupying Ribot, who in in 2018 released Songs of Resistance 1942-2018, featuring friends including Waits, Steve Earle and Meshell Ndegeocello. “I don’t often go in for straight-ahead agitprop, but Donald Trump is a fascist,” he says, gravely. “We are on the edge – or over the edge – of a crisis of legitimacy.” In response, he’s seeking translators so he can publish Italian-language “histories of what the Italians calllaresistenza lungaagainst Mussolini. We’re searching for a language of resistance, and that’s a good place to look.”But even during wartime, life goes on. Marc has to set off for that morning’s class at the Conservatory, and after that, no doubt, begin work on the next additions to his epic discography. I tell him that Discogs.com lists Ribot as having performed on an astonishing 576 individual releases, from Barbie’s Country Favourites in 1981, to this year’s Music for Roads by Finnish duo Tuomo & Markus. When does he sleep?“I like playing on records. I’ve been lucky, it’s how I pay the rent,” he chuckles, softly. “There are corners of what I’ve done that evenI’mnot familiar with.”Map of a Blue City is out now on New West Records.

Now swimmers await the whistle to hit the pools againAthina KontosTue 27 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 11.13 EDTShareThe vastness of Tarlair lido is hard to comprehend. Just a mile east of the town of Macduff, in Aberdeenshire, the lido’s three bodies of sea water are supplied by a tidal filling system and divided by a concrete wall, slippery with seaweed. The water’s reflection announces a striking mint-and-cream art deco pavilion, and a cinematic sea view. From the pavilion’s roof terrace, where dandelion-coloured tables and chairs are set out, it’s easy to lose a few minutes gazing beyond the salty outcrops to a northerly horizon.Originally commissioned by Macduff town council in 1929, the pavilion and pools – a paddling pool, boating “lake” and swimming pool – were designed by architect John C Miller and opened two years later as one of only three art deco lidos of their kind inScotland. The site reopened in late March after 30 years of closure and a decade of work costing approximately £2m. Momentum is building around the pavilion’s heavily anticipated summer comeback and it is hoped that the pools will eventually be able to welcome swimmers again, too.Tarlair trustee Reg Connon fondly remembers swimming here as a child in the late 1950s. “We used to come down as a family on weekends. We’d arrive at 10 in the morning and that was us until five at night … weather permitting,” he laughs.View image in fullscreenCold-water swimmers have also gathered for centuries at the nearby Salmon Howie cove.Photograph: Athina KontosGala days, swimming championships and even concerts catapulted Tarlair into a top leisure destination between the 1950s and 70s, serving communities and visitors alike as an attended pool from May until late August. It kept up its reputation until the 1980s and, on occasion, the water was emptied to host crowds for bands such as Jethro Tull, Wet Wet Wet and Celtic rockers Runrig.However, the early 90s saw a mass transfer of staff to an indoor pool in neighbouring Banff, which led to the lido’s gradual closure. Then, as rival attractions held sway, it crumbled into an abandoned playground until 2012.It’s haunting, serene, saturated with nostalgia – a panoramic portal to another time“The indoor pool at Banff changed everything,” Connon says. “Around the same time cheap flights abroad became available and it was never the same again.” In the high season, Moray Firth tourists were ushered instead to Speyside whisky distilleries, bottlenose dolphin lookout points and lifeguard-monitored beaches.Tarlair’s revival has been an arduous and inspirational 12-year effort by theFriends of Tarlair, a loyal band of 34 volunteers with the sole aim of restoring this once-thriving marine haven. The pavilion renovation project is a finalist in theScottish Design Awards.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Athina KontosOverseeing a pot of cullen skink for the pavilion’s lunch menu, Pat Wain, a former art teacher and chair of the trust, reflects on the process. “We’ve been messing around here for 12 years, but seriously trying to gain funding for 10 and, in that, many attempts were thwarted,” she says.A decade of funding has been granted by the Scottish government and Aberdeenshire council, rooted in the conservation of its status as an A-list property, but several conflicts meant its future was threatened continuously.“At one point two proposed outcomes were to turn it into a lobster hatchery or do nothing,” Wain laments. “I was just so incensed that doing nothing could be an option that three of us got together and formed the beginnings of the committee.”Registered charity status for the Friends of Tarlair followed in 2013, after the trio were told they couldn’t officially speak at a district meeting. They eventually acquired a 99-year lease on the pavilion and haven’t looked back since. It took a further eight years for a feasibility study to become a priority on the council’s agenda, with tireless campaigning from the trustees to keep the lido. “We carried on doing other things – keeping the rights of way clear, weeding the roads in the bay area, even though the road down here was well broken.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year later, Pat called, asking if he and a business partner atStudio Octopi, James Lowe, would take on the pavilion renovations. Closed since 1996, the mesmerising pools are now a visual spectacle only, and stand next in line for extensive renovations. Planning permission for their restoration will be submitted this summer.It’s still early in the day, yet streams of visitors circumnavigate the water, their curiosity – like mine – piqued. As a whole, the space is a crater of sorts, nestled below a jagged face of quartzite and limestone, framing a natural inlet once known as Loch Craig. It’s haunting, serene, saturated with nostalgia – a panoramic portal to another time and almost enough to make you forget your train of thought. Yet we’re all wondering: when can we get in?Cold-water swimmers have been a feature of this bay for centuries, gathering at Salmon Howie, an enchanting sandy cove on the inlet’s edge.“The lido – it’s as if it grew from the rock,” says Pat, who volunteers on the site six days a week. “Swimmers were always meant to be here.”Tarlair lido pavilion is opendaily, 9.30am-2.30pm,friendsoftarlair.co.ukExplore more on these topicsScotland holidaysSwimming holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysHeritageScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chief officers from some of England and Wales’ biggest forces argue they cannot take further budget cuts.Several key departments are yet to agree their budgets with the Treasury, including the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.The IMFsuggested on Thursday that Reeves could refine her fiscal framework, potentially giving the chancellor some political cover to ease her spending cuts in response to changes in growth forecasts.It said the current system, inherited from the previous Conservative government, of twice-yearly assessments of the public finances by theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) was ripe for an overhaul. It said the chancellor should examine ways to avoid having to make short-term savings when there is a downturn in economic forecasts.But government sources said there were definitively no plans to change the government’s “ironclad” fiscal rules, pointing to the already high borrowing figures. One source said there were clear costs to any further changes to the rules, shown by the market’s reaction to changes to the borrowing rules at the last budget.Reeves has tweaked the rules already to allow more borrowing for capital investment –expected to equal £113bn. “When people say: why don’t you just change fiscal rules? Well, we did. We did make a choice to change fiscal rules, and that’s £113bn that wasn’t there,” the source said.There were currently “no plans” to change the number of forecasts by the OBR, though the prime minister is said to favour making the change.Starmer is one of several key figures in No 10 who would like to see forecasts reduced to once a year, as the IMF recommended – which would allow Reeves to meet her commitment of just one fiscal event a year.The OBR’s downgrading of growth forecasts, which wiped out Reeves’s headroom in the spring, meant the chancellor had tomake several cutsat the spring statement, including on welfare.Health and defence are expected to be the major winners when the spending review is published on 11 June, though there will be significant funding for energy infrastructure, including nuclear.Home Office sources say real-terms cuts to the department’s budget will make it nearly impossible to meet key pledges on increasing neighbourhood policing and halving violence against women and girls.The Home Office has been told that the Metropolitan police, the UK’s biggest police force, is already facing a £260m shortfall and having to cut 1,700 officers, community support officers and support staff.“Police forces are facing budget cuts already. To add to this will mean halting any progress made on some of the government’s key policies, including halving knife crime and halving violence against women and girls,” a police source said. “There has been some good progress on [violence against women and girls]. But, realistically, more deep cuts would put that progress in jeopardy.”Concern has been compounded by plans by the Ministry of Justice toshorten the sentences of violent offendersin an effort to free up prison places, though there will be more cash for probation services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves has previously said housing will be one of the key beneficiaries of the £113bn in capital spending, which the government will begin to set out at the spending review, but did not specify social homes.The Treasury hasput £2bn into affordable housingto bridge the gap between a new programme set to be announced at the spending review and the current affordable homes spending, which is due to expire in 2026.At the time the funding was announced, the £2bn was described as a “downpayment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review, which Reeves said would mark a generational shift in the building of council homes.However, Rayner is understood to be dissatisfied with the level of funding for the next phase of the programme.The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, is also understood to be still fighting to keep cash for a major programme of insulation, which was a key part of the government’s net zero strategy, though his department is expected to get significant capital investment in energy infrastructure including nuclear.Labour had previously doubled the previous government’s warm homes scheme from £6bn to £13.2bn over this parliament. But sources say this is likely to be cut in the spending review. At the October budget, Reeves announced £3.4bn over three years for household energy efficiency schemes, heat decarbonisation and fuel poverty schemes.The government responded to concerns expressed at the time calling the sum the “bare minimum” and promising a spending uplift at the review that now looks to have been cancelled.Charities have warned this will make it much harder to hit the UK’s climate targets. Lily-Rose Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:“Cutting policies like home insulation, which provide solutions to lower people’s bills for good, would be an absolutely terrible decision.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingEconomic policyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)LabourRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesDriver of car in Liverpool parade collision may have tailgated ambulance into pedestrian areaByMatthew Weaver,Bryony Moore,Lucy SwanandPaul ScrutonTue 27 May 2025 11.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 22.16 EDTShareThere were no official celebrations when Liverpool last won the Premier League. It was 2020 and the country was in the middle of a Covid lockdown. This time the streets were packed with up to a million fans eager to witness the club’s first victory parade in 35 years as it looped round the city on bank holiday Monday.Triumphant Liverpool players began the slow open-top bus journey at about 2.30pm on Queens Drive, south-east of the city centre. It was due to finish at about 7.30pm at Blundell Street near Royal Albert Dock. But the celebrations were brutally curtailed. This time not by a global pandemic but a lone driver in a people carrier.Parade route mapAt about 5.40pm the bus passed Water Street as it made its way along the Strand – the main road along the Mersey waterfront. Minutes later hundred of fans were filmed walking east along Water Street amid red flares after cheering the bus pass.Hundreds of fans filmed on Water Street after cheering the bus down the Strand – videoFurther up the road, where Water Street runs into Dale Street, tempers were rising. A grey Ford Galaxy had been allowed into an area closed to vehicles because of the parade. Police later said it entered by tailgating an ambulance attending an emergency into the pedestrian area.“What are you’s doing?” one man is heard shouting at the middle-aged driver, a video showed.Many others outside a William Hill bookmakers were angered by the car’s presence on a street thronged with hundreds of fans. The car lurched forward while sounding its horn. The car was heading west towards the Strand as most in the crowd were walking the other way.A video filmed from the opposite side of the street showed a man pounding on the Ford’s rear window. He was knocked back as the car reversed sharply.Fans run after the car after pulling open the driver’s doorBack on the other side of the street another video showed a man opening the driver’s door. At this point the car sped forward with the door open. Some fans ran after the car as the door was slammed shut. One man kicked the car, another threw a fold-up chair onto the vehicle’s roof.The car sped towards Liverpool town hall with its horn blaring as people packed in the street ran out of his way. Seconds later the car was then filmed outside 8 Water Street. By this stage it was surrounded by fans, many clad in red Liverpool colours.Some pounded on the roof, bonnet and windscreen of the car. A handful of police officers in high vis jackets could also be seen near the car with an ambulance just behind.For the next 10 seconds a scene of terrifying carnage unfolded.The car initially reversed and appeared to knock over people behind. It bolted forward at an alarming speed. A man wearing a red Liverpool top and rucksack was knocked onto the bonnet with such force that he spun round as he hit the windscreen before tumbling to the street.Satellite mapThe car then veered towards the side of the road where hundreds of people were tightly packed on the edge of the road. Several people were caught under the wheels others violently knocked to either side of the vehicle. A video filmed from above showed people knocked several metres in front of the vehicle by the speed of the impact.The car drives at speed down Water Street, hitting crowds of Liverpool fansAs the crowd dispersed in terror the car veered back into the middle of the street and was quickly set upon by many in the crowd. Some police officers were seen trying to hold back those attacking the car. Within seconds, a ring of police officers surrounded the vehicle. Its rear window had been smashed in.The cars windows are smashed while police try to hold off fansAfter the driver was taken away, paramedics attended those injured. Some were taken to hospital on stretchers, others on wheel chairs, while some managed to take themselves to A&E.Within an hour, at 6.54pm, Merseyside police announced that officers had detained a man at the scene.Police cordon off the area and treat the injuredSpeculation about the motives of the incident quickly spread online. Some accused Merseyside police of withholding information about the ethnicity of the driver. There were similar accusations last year following the Southport stabbing attack amid false reports that the attacker was an asylum seeker. The force was criticised for being too slow to release information that could have calmed the riots that followed.In apost on Xat 7.54pm, the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said: “The public deserve to know the full facts as quickly as possible.”My thoughts are with the victims, Liverpool fans and the people of that great City this eveningThe appalling footage depicts a car being driven into fans as they celebrated Liverpool’s Premier League winThe public deserve to know the full facts as quickly as possiblehttps://t.co/ie4IpiAH6b— Chris Philp MP (@CPhilpOfficial)May 26, 2025At 8.17pm Merseyside police announced that 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area had been arrested over the collision.

Range restrictions on both were lifted in May 2024.The Kremlin had said on Monday that any new decision to scrap range limits was “quite dangerous” and “contrary to our efforts to reach a political settlement”.Merz’s initial comments also drew criticism from leading Social Democrats.MP Ralf Stegner, an SPD foreign policy expert and frequent critic of arms shipments to Ukraine, called the remarks “not helpful” and “wrong” and demanded redoubled “diplomatic efforts”.Vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil of the Social Democrats insisted there was “no new agreement that goes beyond what the previous government did” on range restrictions.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, used the confusion over Merz’s initial remarks to question the calibre of people who had risen to power in leading European countries, Reuters reported.Merz “said yesterday with such pretentiousness that from now on and forever there are no restrictions on the range of strikes” before placing the policy in context, Lavrov told reporters at a meeting in Moscow with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan.Asked aboutDonald Trump’s commentthat Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely crazy” with the latest offensive, Lavrov said that the US president was showing “emotion” as he was watching his efforts for peace in Ukraine sabotaged by European politicians.In what Ukraine called a weekend of “terror”,Russia battered Kyivover three nights with massive air attacks, fuelling calls from western partners for an immediate ceasefire.However, Merz said on Tuesday that a halt to the fighting appeared far out of reach, despite Russian and Ukrainian officials holding direct talks for the first time in three years earlier this month.“Wars typically end because of economic or military exhaustion on one side or on both sides, and in this war we are obviously still far from reaching that,” Merz said at a joint news conference with the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, in Turku.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of thousands walked through Israeli military lines to reach the new distribution centre in Rafah on Tuesday.But the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was not prepared for them and staff at one point were forced to abandon their posts.“At one moment in the late afternoon, the volume of people at the SDS [secure distribution centre] was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Palestinians in Gaza to take aid safely and dissipate,” the foundation said in a statement.Israeli tank fire and gunfire was heard, and a military helicopter fired flares, the Associated Press reported. At least three injured Palestinians were taken from the scene, one of them bleeding from a leg wound.The Israeli military said it fired “warning shots” near the compound to restore control. It was not immediately clear if there had been any injuries among people trying to get food.In a speech on Tuesday night, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that there had been a “loss of control momentarily” during the food distribution, but added: “Happily, we brought it back under control.”Images shared on social media, which could not immediately be verified, appeared to show people waiting in queues between wire fences. These were later partly torn down as people rushed into an open field where boxes were waiting.Some reportedly managed to obtain aid boxes with basic items including sugar, flour, pasta and tahini but most left empty-handed.“There was no order, the people rushed to take, there was shooting, and we fled,” Hosni abu Amra, who had also been waiting for food, told AP. “We fled without taking anything that would help us get through this hunger.”Ahmed abu Taha, who said he heard gunfire and saw Israeli military aircraft overhead, said: “It was chaos. People were panicked.”On Sunday, Jake Wood, the founding director of the GHF, resigned, saying that it would not be possible for the group to deliver aid “while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles ofhumanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence”.The UN and other humanitarian organisations had already refused to work with the GHF on the grounds that doing so would compromise values that are key to reaching civilians in all conflict zones, and put at risk their teams and the recipients of aid in Gaza.They also warned that a newly formed group with no experience would not be able to handle the logistics of feeding more than 2 million people in a devastated combat zone.‘Our hearts ache’: the fight for survival in Gaza amid Israel’s new offensive and no aidRead moreUS state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the concerns were unfounded and the most important priority was getting aid into Gaza, no matter who was delivering it. She also blamed Hamas for trying to stop convoys organised by the GHF from getting to distribution centres.“They have attempted to stop the aid movement through Gaza to these distribution centres,” she said. “They have failed, but they certainly tried. The bottom line is the real story here is that the aid is moving through, and, in that kind of environment, it’s not surprising that there might be a few issues involved.”But the dangerous scenes on Tuesday appeared to confirm many of the fears raised by UN.Scenes of desperate crowds rushing to get aid were “heartbreaking”, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said, particularly when the UN and partners have a “detailed, principled, operationally sound plan” to get aid in.The trickle of food currently reaching Gaza was not enough to feed its people, he added. “We continue to stress that a meaningful scale-up of humanitarian operations is essential to stave off famine and meet the needs of all civilians, wherever they are.”Israel is trying to replace the humanitarian organisations that bring aid into Gaza. It has long claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas disrupts supply networks to profit from aid.The GHF uses armed security contractors to deliver food in compounds guarded by Israel’s military. It previously acknowledged that this method excludes some of the most vulnerable people in Gaza because only those able to walk long distances and carry heavy boxes of food will be able to feed their families this way.And despite pushing for control of food and other supplies coming into Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces had not properly prepared to distribute aid and “planned to direct the population using gunfire,” a security source told Haaretz.“They treated it like a routine situation involving suspects entering a combat zone, but you can’t direct a population of that scale with gunfire if you want them to feel safe reaching the areas you’ve opened,” he told the newspaper.The source said the military’s original idea to direct crowds using gunfire suggests “they didn’t think and didn’t plan” to use other means, such as fencing off the area.The GHF said its decision to abandon the distribution centre “was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties” and that by the end of Tuesday it had handed out 8,000 boxes of food: enough to feed 44,000 people for half a week according to its calculations. That is just 2% of Gaza’s population. The foundation said deliveries would be increased during the week.Pictures shared on social media that appeared to show the content of the boxes, but could not immediately be verified, suggested they would be meagre meals, mostly rice, pasta and flour with some cans of beans and vegetables sourced from Israel.The GHF has not revealed who is funding its work, although initial pictures showed boxes with the logos of three small aid organisations with experience working in Gaza. None responded to questions about their work with the GHF, but even if they have agreed to partner with the organisation long term, they do not have the capacity to meet overall needs.“Regardless of whether the GHF is operating or not, we know from decades of experience and the almost 600 days we have been responding to this catastrophe in Gaza that this shameful exercise in the militarisation of aid is not going to work,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory.“Even in the most optimal of conditions, there is no logistical company who can feed 2.1 million people overnight. Humanitarianism is not just about handing out food parcels to feed starving people; it is about ensuring that people have the means to survive.”Israeli forces have taken control of much of Gaza since the end of a ceasefire in March, launching heavy attacks that have killed nearly 4,000 Palestinians, health authorities there say.The total death toll from Israeli attacks inside Gaza has now passed 54,000, most of them civilians. Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed about 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, and saw 250 taken hostage.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuAidnewsShareReuse this content"

In Blackburn, average prices are up 5.8% over the past year, followed by Wigan (4.4%) and Birkenhead (4.1%).House pricesin Manchester are up 2.5%, and in Liverpool by 3%.The south of England is seeing slower price growth, with larger rises in the number of homes for sale helping to temper price inflation. The number of homes for sale is up 21% in the south-west, 17% in London, and 15% in the south-east compared with a year earlier.As a result, annual price growth across the south is now under 1%: ranging from 0.5% in the south-east to 0.9% in the south-west.In Scotland, prices have risen by an average of 2.9% year-on-year, while the number of homes for sale is up 5%. In north-west England, where supply has increased by just 3%, stronger sales activity is supporting faster price rises.Donnell said: “More homes for sale means more buyers looking to move. This, coupled with more attractive mortgage deals and changes to how lenders assess affordability, is supporting an increase in the number of sales being agreed.“We expect sales to keep rising over the second half of the year, with UK home values on track to be 2% higher by the end of 2025.”Explore more on these topicsHouse pricesPropertyShareReuse this content"

This figure was broadly the same as the previous year, but the number of confirmed cases rose by 12% to reach just over 3.3m.The vast majority of these cases involved remote purchase fraud, where criminals use stolen card details to buy items online. Incidents of this type of crime had been falling in recent years, but last year the total amount lost to this scam rose for the first time since 2018.Banks say they are increasingly seeing criminals use sophisticated techniques to get people to disclose one-time passcodes they are sent. These codes usually take the form of a unique set of numbers, a bit like a pin number, and banks typically send them to customers via text message when they use their card to make purchases online, log on to internet banking, or change their personal details.Once in possession of a passcode, a criminal can often use it to authenticate fraudulent online card transactions.These frauds often begin with the familiar methods criminals have developed to encourage people to share their bank details, including sending text messages with a promise of a payment, links to false websites, or offers on social media for cheap products.One variation of the scam involves fraudsters using the details they have obtained totransfer the bank cards of victimsto the digital wallets of their own phones and then buy goods online and in high street shops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It warned: “This perhaps points to an over-confidence in one-time passcodes and the protection they offer customers, which is now being exploited to a growing degree by criminals.”Data hacks at third parties, such as retailers, were another “major driver” of remote purchase fraud, with criminals using stolen card details to make purchases online, said the banking body.It added: “The data stolen from a breach can be used for months or even years after the incident. Criminals also use the publicity around data breaches as an opportunity to trick people into revealing financial information.”The warning comes after Marks & Spencer was hit by a cyber-attack, though the retailer said this month that the customer data accesseddid not include usable payment or card details.Victims of unauthorised fraud – which includes remote purchase scams – are legally protected against losses, and UK Finance said its research indicated that customers were fully refunded in more than 98% of cases.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsBanks and building societiesCrimeE-commerceOnline shoppingnewsShareReuse this content"

Nine were “associated with humans” while the rest were gathered from bat roosts. The analysis found that the ancestral populations behind both groups were in decline about 45,000 years ago, as the Earth cooled in the last glacial period.But while the estimated population of bat-related bedbugs continued to fall to the present day, the number of human-associated bedbugs levelled off about 12,000 years ago before a “dramatic” rise about 8,000 years ago, the researcherswrite in Biology Letters.The world’s first cities arose from settlements built after humans turned from a nomadic life to one dominated by agriculture.

She said she would be bringing in a movement coach “to try to get the actors to think past the fact they’re in period costume”.“The other thing with period costumes is you start speaking posh and not everybody spoke posh in those days, so you have to work with that as well,” said Tranter, in comments reported by the Times. “You have to try to get the actors to think past the fact they’re in period costume.”She also commented on the slow speed that extras walk in period dramas, adding: “It happens time and time again, and every time I think: ‘Oh my God, Jane, why didn’t you say something?’”The leading producer, who has worked on some of TV’s biggest shows including Industry and Succession, was at the book festival to discuss The Other Bennet Sister, a forthcoming BBC period drama she is producing, which focuses on Mary Bennet – the “ugly duckling” middle sister from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.Tranter also took aim at the stiff, sculpted hairstyles familiar in such productions and said she had “loosened the rules” to offer a “proper welcoming hand to a modern audience” in the upcoming spin on Austen’s novel, which is due to begin filming in Wales next week.She said: “If you dress the hair exactly like it is in all those oil paintings, or put the hats on, then actually an audience will not be able to take their eyes off these strange curls or weird hats.Olivia Colman to star in Netflix’s Pride and Prejudice written by Dolly AldertonRead more“You have to know what the rules are and then we look to see where we break them in order to build a bridge or offer a proper welcoming hand to a modern audience.“Because if you do a complete like-for-like, matchy-matchy, here are the exact buttons, here are the exact knickers you’re wearing beneath your dress, then it becomes such a fetishised approach that it becomes a barrier between the audience and what is going on.”The Other Bennet Sister is based on Janice Hadlow’s acclaimed 2020 novel, which the Guardiancalled“immersive and engaging”.“Janice has expanded the world of Austen,” she said. “The London is not that classic Regency London, it is nudging towards Dickens’s London. There is a tendency with Jane Austen to always make it super-Regency as opposed to a more grounded feel.“The other brilliant thing is that Janice brings in the Romantic poets and they go to the Lake District.”Explore more on these topicsHay festivalJane AustenTelevisionShareReuse this content"

We would like to thank all the tens of thousands of children who auditioned. It’s been a real pleasure to discover the plethora of young talent out there.”The three child actors round out the world first imagined byJK Rowlingin her smash seven-book series and played by a who’s who of British actors across eight feature films released between 2001 and 2011.Last month, HBOconfirmed, after much speculation, that John Lithgow would play Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry originally played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon, in the series designed to run for over a decade, with at least one season per book.Other confirmed cast include series regularsPaapa Essieduas Severus Snape, Janet McTeer as Minerva McGonagall and Nick Frost as Rubeus Hagrid, as well as Luke Thallon as Quirinus Quirrell andPaul Whitehouseas Argus Filch.“We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life,” Gardiner and Mylod said at the time.The series will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling, “full of the fantastic detail, much-loved characters and dramatic locations that Harry Potter fans have loved for over 25 years”, according to Max, the streaming service for HBO soon to be renamed HBO Max, in a statement upon theseries announcementin April 2023.“Each season will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch globally.”Rowling, who maintains ownership over key aspects of Harry Potter intellectual property, including the characters, will serve as an executive producer on the series. Her involvement has drawn controversy from some fans of the franchise for her numerous anti-trans statements, whichled to a riftwith the original films’ three stars. In March, Rowlingappeared to take a swipeat Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint on social media, five years after the actors publicly rebuked anessayin which she called arguments about “femaleness not residing in the sexed body … deeply misogynistic and regressive”.Asked by journalist Matthew Belloni if Rowling’s views on transgender people made him concerned for the show, HBO’s chief content officer, Casey Bloys, told The Town podcast in April: “We already have a show onHBOfrom her called CB Strike that we do with the BBC. It’s pretty clear that those are her personal, political views. She’s entitled to them. Harry Potter is not secretly being infused with anything. And if you want to debate her, you can go on Twitter.”The 59-year-old author’s expansive Harry Potter world – including the books, films, video games and theater – isworth an estimated £20bn($25bn).Gardiner, an executive producer, will also serve as showrunner for the new series. She was previously a writer and consulting producer for the HBO hit Succession, as well as a writer/producer on His Dark Materials and Killing Eve. Mylod, a regular director for Succession, will direct several episodes in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner BrosTelevision.The HBO series isexpected to debutin 2026, almost 30 years after the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (also known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), was published in 1997, and 15 years after the final film, The Deathly Hallows Part 2, hit theaters.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionHarry PotterJK RowlingHBOnewsShareReuse this content"

But last week, two sets of climbers turned heads with ascents that many had never thought possible: they went straight up from sea level to the world’s highest summit in less than a week.On Wednesday, a team of four UK climbers, all ex-special forces soldiers, summited Everest having landed from London just over four days earlier. The following day, US-Ukrainian climber Andrew Ushakov said he had gone from New York to the top of Everest in under four days.With Everest standing at a staggering 8,849 metres, scaling safely to the top usually requires spending several weeks acclimatising at a lower altitude, normally Everest base camp, so the body can adjust to the lower level of oxygen.Climate change to blame for up to 17 deaths on Mount Everest, experts sayRead moreWithout this acclimatisation, most climbers would sicken or die in the final stages of summiting due to the thin oxygen levels above 8,000 metres, known as the “death zone”. Altitude sickness accounts for almost as many deaths as falls and avalanches on Everest.But using new methods and technologies, both the UK team and Ushakov acclimatised before even arriving on the mountain inNepal, meaning they could skip base camp entirely.Some expedition leaders have claimed these pre-acclimatisation methods mark a new frontier in Everest mountaineering, increasing safety while reducing the two biggest blights on the mountain: rubbish and human waste.However, others – including the Nepalese sherpas whose culture and employment is hugely reliant on leading expeditions up to the highest peak of the Himalayas – have expressed concern that speedier ascents could heavily affect the local economy.There are also worries it will put even more pressure on the mountain, increasing the number of people ascending every season. Nepal typically issues about 400 permits for Everest each year, each valid for 90 days, with no rules for how long climbers spend on the mountain.Just because technology exists, does that mean we allow anything?Nima Nuru SherpaThere are concerns it could encourage more inexperienced climbers to go up by significantly cutting expedition times. Last year was one of the deadliest on record on Everest, which experts partly blamed on the numbers of novices attempting the climb.“Climbing in just four or five days goes against traditional values and norms that we sherpas have always held,” says Nima Nuru Sherpa, president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.“I believe the true significance of climbing Everest lies in the traditional way it has been approached, and acclimatising on the mountain is an important part of that. Just because technology exists, does that mean we allow anything?”The Nepal tourism ministry confirmed to the Guardian it had opened an investigation into the legality and ethics of the methods used by the climbers.“The use of new technology of acclimatisation, such as in the medical lab or in an artificial environment, is a new issue for Nepal,” says Himal Gautam, director of Nepal’s tourism industry. “We understand we have to cope with the emerging technologies and innovation and we are not necessarily against it, but it does raise some issues.“Our main concern is that there must be fair play and equal treatment to all the mountaineers.”‘Ahead of the science’Particularly controversial is the UK team’s use of xenon gas, a still experimental method of promoting oxygen-carrying red blood cells in the body, which is a core component of acclimatisation. Use of xenon – otherwise known as an anaesthetic – in high-altitude climbing does not have any recognised scientific backing. The gas is also on the list of substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency for its potential performance enhancing qualities, though that body has no jurisdiction over mountaineering.Its use by the British climbers last week was championed by their expedition guide Lukas Furtenbach, a renowned Austrian mountaineer who has been experimenting with xenon at high altitudes since 2020 after being approached by a German doctor and researcher.View image in fullscreenFour British climbers pose on the summit of Everest less than a week after leaving London in one of the fastest ascents on record of the world’s highest peak.Photograph: Sandro Gromen/APFurtenbach said that his own and others’ experiences of using xenon, including on Everest in three previous years, had demonstrated that it not only sped up acclimatisation but also lowered lung pressure and cardio pressure at altitude, making it much safer and more comfortable. “It’s been clear to me we are ahead of the science on this,” he said.The gas was given to the British climbers in a clinic in Germany two weeks before they flew to Nepal, in a 30-minute treatment not unlike going under anaesthetic.The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federationwarned in Januarythat, in the absence of clear evidence, xenon use on the mountains could be “dangerous”. However Furtenbach was adamant that last week’s Everest ascent proved it should be celebrated as a leap of progress.“A one-week climb puts so much less strain on the mountain; less oxygen, less human excretion, less food to be carried, less of a burden on the sherpas, less garbage left behind,” he said. “At a time when people are saying the environmental pressures on Everest are becoming unsustainable, this would reduce the carbon footprint dramatically.”He pushed back on allegations that climbers who used xenon would have an unfair competitive advantage over others. “Our goal here is not breaking speed records,” said Furtenbach. “I believe this is the next step in safe and responsible high-altitude mountaineering.”Time for an ethics code?Ushakov meanwhile says he did not use xenon gas for his four-day climb. Instead he says he relied solely on hypoxic tents to acclimatise over months in his New York apartment, a technology also used by the UK team alongside their gas treatment. Rented for use at home – and mostly used at night while sleeping – these tents create low oxygen environments in order to get the body to adapt to the same conditions as high on the mountain.It is neither a fast nor easy process. Ushakov spent more than 400 hours, over several months, sleeping and preparing inside the tent in order to fully and safely acclimatise for his Everest climb.Though not new, the hypoxic tent technology is still only used by roughly 10-15% of climbers scaling the world’s highest peaks. However, Brian Oestrike, CEO of Hypoxico which makes the tents, said their global popularity had significantly increased this year. “This whole Everest season has been pretty crazy for us,” he said. “Around 70 rentals just in North America alone.”Oestrike said he did not believe that use of the tents – which usually cost between $1,500 to $2,000 to rent – should be considered “cheating” when it came to climbing the world’s tallest peaks.“The majority of our clientele are not trying to climb faster, they’re just trying to have a safer expedition,” he said. “I’m of the view that a climb is each person’s own accomplishment and how they choose to use this technology is up to them.”But Khimlal Gautam, surveyor of the team that measured the new height of Everest in 2019, says there are bigger questions at play. “Tomorrow, there might be technology that allows helicopters to reach the very tip of Everest’s summit. If that happens, what will we do?” he said.“Now is finally the time to develop a firm code of ethics for mountaineering.”Explore more on these topicsMount EverestNepalIndiaChinaClimbing holidaysAsia PacificSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is Reform the change that’s needed?”It’s “time to give someone else a chance,” says Jamie, a service engineer from Hamilton even though he thinks Farage is an “arsehole”.The language is “shockingly familiar”, says Tryl, to what he’s heard from disillusioned voters in England and Wales. While Farage has historically struggled to gain a foothold in Scotland, Tryl suggests this “could be starting to change”.This dissatisfaction – the “scunner” factor – is reflected across a constituency made up of post-industrial towns, faded town centres and outlying housing estates and villages isolated by poor public transport.It is also an area of deeply embedded sectarian division, with enclaves of strident support for Rangers football club, the Protestant fraternity the Orange Order and the union. In Larkhall, the sandwich chain Subway once had to remove the colour green from their livery because of its association with Catholic-founded Celtic football club.View image in fullscreenFiona Dryburgh of the Machan Trust in Larkhall: ‘I’m hearing so much about immigration.’Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianWhile that century-old fissure has healed considerably in recent years, Fiona Dryburgh, CEO of Larkhall’s Machan Trust, a community group, is “scared” of how years of anti-sectarian work is being undone. She would like to see more action to counter Reform’s misinformation, “but it’s difficult for other parties because no one believes them”.Earlier this week, Swinney called on Meta to act on a particularly egregious example of misinformation – a Reform advert that claims the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said he would “prioritise the Pakistani community” with no evidence to support it.View image in fullscreenAnas Sarwar, centre right, at a karting race track in South Lanarkshire.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianSpeaking at an event in Westminster on Tuesday, Farage defended the video, saying Sarwar “introduced sectarianism into Scottish politics” and claimed his party only shared words used by the Scottish Labour leader. The words ascribed to Sarwar by Reform do not appear in the clips they shared.Dryburgh says: “I’m quite scared because we’ve done so much anti-sectarian work here very successfully but now I’m hearing so much about immigration.”She sees the impact at the breakfast and after-school clubs she runs. “Parents are having fights about it on Facebook, then their kids bring it into groups. We had to put one child out of a group for doing a Nazi salute and using the N-word. They were 10 years old.”Some Scottish Labour figures have expressed private dismay at the strength of support for Reform and voter dissatisfaction with Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. “Winter fuel payment comes up on every door,” says one – and even last week’s U-turn is dismissed as opportunism. Senior Westminster figures are expected to lend their support in person over the final week.View image in fullscreenKaty Loudon speaks with voters in Hamilton.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianOn a rainy bank holiday Monday, the SNP candidate Katy Loudon was flanked by Scottish government ministers, former MPs and Swinney himself, who described the contest as “too close to call”.SNP canvassers confirm they too have encountered voters “more comfortable saying they are voting Reform” as well as a general sense of “apathy and promises not delivered”.Meanwhile Reform anticipate a “tartan bounce” following their council election wins. “Nigel has proved his credibility with voters,” says a party source, agreeing that success in Hamilton “sets the tone for Holyrood 2026”.During a campaign visit on Tuesday, Sarwar admitted some voters were treating this byelection as an opportunity to show their “frustrations” with both the UK and Scottish governments.“I think, undoubtedly, that people are scunnered with politics … Many people are looking at the most reactive option.”Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsByelectionsScotlandScottish National party (SNP)Reform UKLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Part of the US administration’s peace plan,say recent reports, would involve Washington recognising annexed Crimea as legitimate Russian territory, among other concessions to the Kremlin that Trump hopes might stop Russia’s war on Ukraine.“The whole world knows what happened inCrimea… It would be such a damage to the reputation of the US that it will be hard for them to recover. It would be shameful,” said Dzhemilev, a Soviet-era dissident turned Crimean Tatar political leader, in an interview at his office in Kyiv.Back in March 2014, during the Russian annexation, Dzhemilev was asked for his public declaration of support for Moscow’s takeover byVladimir Putinhimself. The Russian president spoke by telephone to Dzhemilev, promising money and support for the Crimean Tatar community in exchange for his backing. “He explained how we’ll be so happy under Russian rule,” Dzhemilev said, recalling the conversation with disdain.Dzhemilev turned down the deal, saying that after centuries of oppressing the Crimean Tatars, the Russians were unlikely to change, and telling Putin the best thing he could do was remove his troops from the peninsula. A month later, when returning to Crimea from Kyiv, he was stopped at the new Russian frontier and told he was banned from entering. He has lived in exile in Kyiv ever since.Crimea mapUnlike government officials, who are required to moderate their opinions of the Trump administration for the sake of diplomatic nicety, the 81-year-old Dzhemilev pulls no punches. He talks quietly yet with a sharp turn of phrase and a dark sense of humour, pausing every few minutes to light a fresh cigarette or answer his mobile phone, set to a barking dog ringtone.“We are in a situation where the head of the US administration, the president, is now a person who feels no emotions, in whose head there is only deal-making … To say the things he says, to sayUkraineshouldn’t have started this war. Have they been keeping this man in the dark for the last years? Does he know anything? Has he read anything?”He recalled an interview with Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, who failed to remember the names of all the regions he believed Russia had a reasonable claim to. “That’s a diplomat from the United States of America? I’ve seen a lot of stupid diplomats in my life, but one like him, that’s a first,” he said.This is not Dzhemilev’s first exile. In May 1944, when he was six months old, Joseph Stalin had the entire Crimean Tatar population rounded up and deported to Soviet Central Asia on cattle wagons, accusing them of collaboration during the Nazi occupation. Tens of thousands died on the journey.The Crimean Tatars had been the majority of the population in Crimea until the first Russian annexation, under Catherine the Great in the 18th century. In the intervening years, Russians had begun to dominate, and after Stalin’s deportation every single Crimean Tatar was removed.View image in fullscreenPersonal details adorn Dzhemilev’s office, including a pillow with the inscription ‘Home’.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianFrom exile, Dzhemilev and other dissidents campaigned for a return. He received the first of many jail sentences in 1966 for refusing to do his military service, saying he could not fight in the army of the country that had stolen his homeland.It was not until 1989 that Crimean Tatars were officially allowed to return, where they found a very different Crimea and a local population that often viewed them as intruders. Many of their houses had been seized and their villages destroyed.Dzhemilev was elected chair of the Mejlis, the informal parliament of the Crimean Tatars, in 1991. During the early years of Ukrainian rule, Crimean Tatars were often accused of being separatists, wanting their own homeland in Crimea. In the end, they turned out to be some of Ukraine’s fiercest defenders in the region. Since the annexation, Russia has launched multiple waves of persecution and arrests against the community, which is estimated to number around 250,000, or about 10% of the population of Crimea.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He conceded, however, that 11 years of Russian rule had made an impact. Children who were in kindergarten at the time of the annexation will soon be old enough to be mobilised into the Russian army, having had a decade of schooling in the Russian curriculum. “Of course, this has an effect on some people’s consciousness,” he said.Still, he believes that many Crimean Tatar families will ensure their children do not lose sight of their history, and is heartened by one of his own earliest memories, as a young schoolboy in 1953, when it was announced on the radio that Stalin had died. “Everyone was crying, but not the Crimean Tatars. The first thing my dad said was, ‘Finally, the dog has kicked it’,” he remembered. A relative came by with some onions, in case crying on demand was required.Dzhemilev spent a total of 15 years in prisons and camps during the Soviet period, after seven different court cases. “The biggest single sentence I got was three years. By today’s Russian standards I guess they would have shot me 10 times. They are destroying the lives of people by giving them 17 or 20 years for some small thing that was overheard,” he said.There was a moment, in late 2022 and 2023, when Ukraine’s army was on the offensive against the Russians and anything seemed possible,including Kyiv winning back Crimea. Dzhemilev recalled how, at the end of 2023, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, came to visit him, suggesting he record a New Year’s Eve address that Ukrainian hackers could show on television channels in Crimea, replacing Putin’s. In the address, Dzhemilev announced that 2024 would be the final year of Russian rule and advised recent arrivals to return to Russia.That did not happen. “It seems the liberation of Crimea has been postponed,” he conceded. If the US does recognise Crimea, Dzhemilev hopes international leaders will put some kind of pressure on Russia to give guarantees to the Crimean Tatars.He has called on Turkey to push for the creation of an international monitoring group to work in Crimea, and for members of the Mejlis to be given the freedom to travel to Crimea with immunity from prosecution under Russian law. He was due to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at a diplomatic forum in Antalya in April to put the request to him in person.The pair have met several times before, but this time Erdoğan cancelled the meeting, citing a packed schedule, and sent a deputy instead, Dzhemilev said: “One of his aides said to me that it wasn’t really about time, it was because this is a person who likes to be able to fulfil people’s requests. And he knew more or less what I was going to ask, and he knows he won’t be able to fulfil it.”Dzhemilev’s biography has a sad symmetry to it: decades of exile culminating in a return home, only for another exile to begin. He dismissed any personal hardship, noting that his years in the gulag had made him accustomed to being far from home. “Personally, I am quite comfortable, I have no complaints. But the fact that our people fought to return home after the 1944 deportation for half a century and now are once again in a forced deportation, that is quite awful,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaCrimeaVladimir PutinEuropeDonald TrumpInternational land dealsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

High up in the atrium, at the centre of this huge open-access repository of 250,000 objects, hangs a chunk ofRobin Hood Gardens, a brutalist council estate in nearby Poplar that was recently bulldozed to make way for less affordable housing. Deftly suspended from the gantry, the poignant fragment now seems as much a relic of a bygone age as the 15th-centuryIslamic domefrom a Spanish palace that is displayed across the hall. The estate’s precast concrete panels have been reassembled with just the same care as the dome’s intricate wooden marquetry, with doorhandles and letterboxes neatly arranged alongside memories of former residents, as well as artwork made with local kids exploring the “ethics of care”.Fancy a masterpiece? Just pop one in your basket! V&A’s new open-access outpost will thrill art-loversRead moreSuch striking juxtapositions, and the often contentious stories behind them, lie at the heart of the new £65m facility, which provides a thrilling window into the sprawling stacks of our national museum of everything. But it is much more than just a window – it’s a total immersion. Unlike other open-access museum stores, which tend to offera furtive peek through glass, the Storehouse thrusts visitors right into the middle of the action. You can roam the gantries while forklift trucks trundle to and fro beneath your feet. You might see someone unloading a porcelain statue, or polishing a priceless collection of spoons, or gingerly packing poison darts. And you’re right in there with them, at the heady coalface of conservation.We want people to be breathing the same air as the artefacts. So we’ve removed the usual glass prophylactic“I love looking at stuff when I’m not supposed to,” saysLiz Diller, with a mischievous glint in her eye. Her New York architecture firm, Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R), won the project in an international competition in 2018, promising to take the public on a “curated transgression” through the stacks. “We wanted people to be breathing the same air as the artefacts,” she adds. “So we’ve removed the usual prophylactic between the visitor and the work.”It’s a brave move. Wandering the aisles, between gilded altarpieces and tribal masks, all within touching distance, it’s a wonder that you’re not forced to don white gloves and a lab coat. “It does slightly keep one awake at night,” says Tim Reeve, the V&A’s deputy director and chief operating officer. “But if we had glass everywhere, it wouldn’t be a storage facility to which you have been invited behind the scenes. We had to commit to that philosophy.”View image in fullscreenLooking up … this 15th-century gilded wooden dome is now on view.Photograph: David Parry/PAHoused in an 80 x 80-metre area of Here East, a gargantuan hangar originally built as the 2012 Olympic broadcasting centre, the collection’s new home is the happy byproduct of eviction. In 2015, the government announced plans to sellBlythe House, the Edwardian former headquarters of the Post Office Savings Bank in west London which was being used as storage for the V&A, British Museum and Science Museum. The sell-off prompted an ambitious rethink of how to better manage and provide more public access to these national collections, about 95% of which were never on display. A decade on, Blythe House remains unsold, after the preferred buyer pulled out, but the pre-emptive eviction has spawned a new generation of inventive, multimillion-pound sheds.The British Museum’s archaeology department now enjoys a sleek £64mcluster of black barnsnear Reading designed by John McAslan + Partners. The Science Museum builta vast £65m warehousein Wiltshire with an interior cleverly configured by Sam Jacob Studio, to show off its dazzling haul of vehicles. Both of those allow some level of public access, but the V&A, leasing a highly public spot on the Olympic park, has really gone to town, throwing open its back-of-house for all to see. That’s if you can find the way in.At the southern end of the 275-metre-long hangar, an innocuous front door (that, perhaps intentionally, has the nondescript look of a staff entrance) leads into a lobby, with a cafe to one side, education spaces to the other, and a staircase straight ahead. Ushered up the stairs and through an airlock, you suddenly find yourself surrounded by open crates. The busts of assembled worthies are lined up either side to greet you while a vista of infinite shelves extends in all directions, offering tantalising glimpses of the artefacts that await. It’s like an Amazon warehouse, only stuffed with all the world’s treasures.View image in fullscreenA symphony of cypress … the Kaufmann Office by Frank Lloyd Wright.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright“We wanted it to feel like an immersive cabinet of curiosities,” says Diller. “So you land right in the middle, at the very heart of the building, flipping the usual progression from public to private.” The central atrium is conceived as an airy void sliced through the three main floors, artificially top-lit (no natural light allowed), with the end of each storage rack displaying a cross-section of collection highlights, freshly unboxed. One features historic toys including an abacus and a painted tiger; another, the arts and crafts fixtures of a CR Ashbee house; a third, props from the stage. A big glass window in the steel deck provides views on to the busy shop floor below, the ballet of technicians framed by a 17th-century carved marblecolonnade from Agra, newly restored and on display for the first time since the 1950s.View image in fullscreenThe Storehouse exterior.Photograph: © Hufton+Crow“It gives us the space to show things that we simply don’t have room for in South Kensington,” says Reeve as we progress upstairs tothe Kaufmann office, a complete interior designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the 1930s for a Pittsburgh retail magnate. It is a honey-coloured symphony of cypress plywood, full of Wright-designed furniture, with carpet and textiles by Loja Saarinen – all so intact that you half expect to find Edgar J Kaufmann sitting behind his desk. It has the same theatrical stage-set quality as the 1920s Frankfurt kitchen nearby, a pistachio-painted dream of modernist domestic efficiency, designed byMargarete Schütte-Lihotzkyfor the city’s Municipal Building Department and installed in 10,000 flats.“It usually takes a year to get signoff for a museum display,” says Brendan Cormier, chief curator of V&A East, which also includes a purpose-built museum opening on the other side of the park next year. “But here we can be much more agile, reflecting the energy of the research and new discoveries happening in the collection.” He points out that the explanatory texts are credited, giving the usually anonymous museum workers a voice for a change. Elsewhere, QR codes allow a deeper dive, thankfully without having to download an app. A new “Order an Object” service also enables visitors to summon items to a study room for closer inspection. DS+R had fantasised about a robotic retrieval system, but it was ditched on grounds of budget and practicality. As demonstrated by their $500m (£369m)“movable” Shed arts venuein New York, which hasn’t moved much since it opened, these are architects for whom big budgets do not always mean happy outcomes. Restricted to relatively modest sums here – and playing to their strength of working with existing buildings – they have pulled off a light-touch, supremely elegant result.There are none of the firm’s usual flashy fireworks, but there are intelligent touches throughout. The walkways that ring the central space, says project lead Bryce Suite, are scaled to the width of Robin Hood Gardens’ famous “streets in the sky”, a section of which you walk across as you pass the concrete facade. Another space is designed like a projecting vitrine, providing tantalising views down into a conservation lab, where overhead cameras and headsets will enable conservators to talk visitors through what they are working on, as if they were watching a live surgical procedure. Other games are played with jumps of scale. One narrow corridor leads to a vast black box space wherea 1920s stage cloth by Picassofor a Ballet Russes production hangs atmospherically spotlit. You might find the immensely long storage crates, tucked behind, just as captivating as the curtain.View image in fullscreen‘We can be much more agile’ … a robotic item retrieval system was abandoned in favour of a manual one.Photograph: © Hufton+CrowWhether the pick-n-mix nature of the display strategy will chime with visitors remains to be seen. Walking the aisles, which are arranged by the sizes and weights of the objects rather than by department, can feel like restless channel-hopping, or flipping through a magazine. One minute you’re looking at pre-Raphaelite vases, the next, modernist doorhandles and Mamluk plaster casts.But there is hope that the sheer cacophony of stuff, and the whirr of activities around it all, will inspire young minds. “We’re peeling back the curtain, showing how museums actually function,” says Cormier. “From curation to conservation to technical services, this building is going to be training the next generation of museum workers.”The V&A East Storehouse,Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, opens on 31 MayExplore more on these topicsArchitectureV&AMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In response to George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in 2020, young white film-maker Rob Bliss released a YouTube video “Holding a Black Lives Matter Sign in America’s Most Racist Town” – a largely self-explanatory title, though the mayor and other officials of Harrison, Arkansas registered their objections to the accusation – which quickly went viral. White Man Walking, released to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Floyd’s death, takes things a step further. Or several hundred thousand steps, I suppose, given that it covers a 1,500-mile walk by Bliss from the civil rights museum in Mississippi, through the Deep South and on to Washington DC – arriving just before the 2020 election – while holding a Black Lives Matter sign and inviting people to walk with him.The premise, Bliss’s apparent delicacy and ignorance (the N-word is a frequent part of the responses his presence elicits and he reels. “They say it so quickly, so easily. It’s hard to believe there are still people who hold such extreme views”) and self-righteousness (“Steering some southerners away from that way of thinking won’t be easy”) are initially off-putting. The opening minutes of the film are suffused with a sense of white saviourism and the kind of sanctimonious liberalism that did for the Democrats in the last election.But. But. That first impression, that initial cringe soon disperses. Cometh the first hundred or so miles and an unrelieved tirade of abuse, cometh the man, and Bliss reveals himself to be a man of quiet courage and a literally walking definition of grace under pressure. “Why do you have to touch your gun while you talk to me?” he asks, in a spirit of apparently genuine inquiry, of a man who is recommending that the US “send them back to Africa”. He never rises to anyone’s bait – of which there is a virtually ceaseless supply, especially in the early stretches of his trek – or seeks to antagonise. He is clearly a gentle soul – but no pushover. He has a relatively long conversation with an older man who ensures Bliss that the BLM movement wants to bring white men down, advocate shooting children in the head and are using Bliss. They go back and forth. The man reveals that he is Jewish. Bliss says simply, “Then you should know better”, with so little heat that his interlocutor has little left to say, especially when Bliss likens what his opponents are doing to turning up at a breast cancer fundraiser to shout that other diseases matter too.View image in fullscreenWalking the line … Rob Bliss with a rural Trump supporter in his documentary White Man Walking.Photograph: BBC//Osun GroupThere are other times, in the heavily armed states through which he is passing, when he and his crew also rightly judge that discretion is the better part of valour and simply run. The whole film is, beneath its stated aim, a vivid demonstration of the profound difference between countries with gun control and those without. It changes everything. When Bliss goes a step further than simply carrying his BLM placard through Dalton, Georgia, and drapes a sash bearing a quote from the vice-president of the Confederacy stating that “the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man” around a statue to Confederate general Joseph E Johnston, then sits down next to it to await people’s reactions he notes (again, though it’s hard to convey it in print, with no ego or braggadocio), “I could die today. Technically. I feel sick.”On he goes, meeting some white and (more) black supporters of his undertaking, listening and learning good and bad things as he goes. This includes some pointed remarks from Chanelle Helm of the Louisville chapter of BLM (the town in which 26-year-old Black woman Breonna Taylor was killed in her own apartment by a white police officer). “I love this walking. [But] I don’t know what it’s going to do. What’s going to happen when you get to Washington? I’m hoping this walk gets you to understand that there is some bigger and more important work that’s going to hit you. I don’t know what that is for a white man.” It is Bliss’s silence thereafter, the lack of bluster or defensiveness, that marks him and the film out as worthy of note.There is an unadorned honesty to the film that makes it admirable and not uplifting. You can see there has been a temptation to give in to schmaltz from time to time, but it is largely avoided. Instead, we have a portrait of an extraordinarily divided country but also a limning of some of the nuances that are lost in the culture, headline and clickbait wars. For example, the genuine disfranchisement there has been of the American working class, which has then been wrongly blamed on Black people and immigrants – by them and by politicians who benefit from stoking that hatred. By the end you come away feeling that in 60 days Bliss has engaged more and on better terms with Americans than either party did in the run-up to the past two elections. And that that is a large part of the reason that no one feels safe in their country any more.Storyville: White Man Walking aired on BBC Four and is available on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryBlack Lives Matter movementFactual TVPolitics TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

There were no cameras on the sea floor and any pictures taken by Titan’s occupants were destroyed along with it, but there is film that contains what we now know to be audio of the craft’s last moment. Rush’s wife, Wendy, is aboard the mission’s support ship, in radio contact, when she hears a noise.At that point, Wendy Rush looks more confused than alarmed. A contributor to the film likens the sound to a door slamming, but it’s less dramatic than that: it’s more of a muffled thud, which was ambiguous enough for it not to be assumed immediately that Rush and his passengers were dead. Instead, the unknown fate of Titan topped global news reports for four days, until debris was finally found.That clip of Wendy Rush is eerily low-key but, as Implosion tells it, the story of Titan is one that suits an unspectacular, perversely almost anticlimactic ending, because it’s a tale of hubris and negligence that isn’t coloured with much complexity. It’s all the more sad and enraging that five people lost their lives in a tragedy that, in retrospect, was bound to happen. Implosion searches for a grander narrative, but it doesn’t seem to be there.Having sketched the life of Stockton Rush, a wealthy man who dreamed as a youth of going into space before he noticed more accessible “cool stuff” way down below the ocean, the programme documents some of the warning signs he ignored as he planned prestigious expeditions to view the wreckage of the Titanic. Rush, who felt the relevant regulation and certification processes were an unnecessary fuss, favoured carbon fibre as the material from which his tiny submarine’s hull would be made, an unusual choice because it is known to behave erratically under extreme pressure: its layers can separate, a process known as delamination.Numerous contributors who were involved in Titan’s test dives recall that those rehearsals were marred by passengers raising safety concerns. We are able to read extracts from one expert’s series of warning emails that were ignored; another alleges she spoke up in person, only to be told she lacked “an explorer mindset”. There is footage of Stockton Rush reassuring interested parties that it is normal for submarines to make scary noises as water pressure changes and metals contract; the programme’s interviewees disagree, and we see evidence that a cracking sound heard on one of the last missions should have been interpreted as a harbinger of delamination.So we have the how: a man took four others to the bottom of the sea in a submarine that was clearly unsafe. What Implosion struggles with is the why. It never quite gets to the bottom of how aware Rush was that Titan was a deathtrap. Did his self-image as an intrepid adventurer, the incentive of the six-figure sums he was charging his passengers, or the potential shame of abandoning the project actually stop him from seeing the obvious, or did he just not want to acknowledge it? One contributor asserts that Rush must have known that a dive would end in disaster before too long, which amounts to alleging that this was a criminal act by a man with a death wish. But a conclusively evidenced answer refuses to reveal itself.There is talk of “ego” and “arrogance”, and of a family who were “upper crust” with “access to uber-elites”. The history of boundary-pushing exploration is indeed strewn with fascinating stories of privileged men who were brought up to believe they couldn’t fail, or who had some desperate emptiness inside them that made them lose their fear of death. But, especially because the money Rush was earning muddies the picture, we don’t know if he fits this narrative. It seems unlikely that much clarity will be provided by the US Coast Guard’s ongoing inquiry: Implosion has acquired film from inside the hearings, but if the producers assumed this exclusive access would automatically make their documentary illuminating, they were mistaken.Nor does the programme give much insight into the people who willingly joined Rush on Titan’s final voyage. The only representative of the loved ones is Christine Dawood, whose husband, Shahzada, and 19-year-old son Suleman were both aboard. She speaks with noble dignity about a loss that seems to be deepened by the knowledge that she won’t ever be told why she had to suffer it. “We all know who the culprit is,” she says. “[It] does not change anything, does it?”Implosion:The TitanicSub Disaster aired on BBC Two and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVThe TitanicreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it doesn’t go far enough to address social prejudices around disabilityLucy WebsterTue 27 May 2025 17.00 EDTShareFor the makers of Ellie Simmonds’ new documentary, Should I Have Children?, the most powerful moment of the show is clearly supposed to be when she finds out why she was given up for adoption. It is emotional viewing: her birth mother speaks of her difficult circumstances (she had kept her pregnancy secret), the purely negative information she had been given about Ellie’s dwarfism, and, most poignantly, how she thought of Ellie every day in the decades before they met again. It is deeply moving, for Ellie and the viewer.For me, though, the most powerful moment is altogether less charged. It comes when Ellie visits David and Megan, whose pregnancy she follows after they are told their baby almost certainly has Down’s syndrome. We watch them grapple with the ramifications of the diagnosis including their fears for the child’s future and the decision about whether to terminate the pregnancy (90% of pregnancies involving a diagnosis of Down’s syndrome are now terminated). David talks movingly of struggling with the idea of his child being bullied. Yet when Ellie visits them at home, everything has changed: the baby is there, and the couple are clearly smitten. “All the worry completely evaporates the minute you see her for the first time,” David says, in an ordinary expression of fatherly love that is also a powerful statement about how the reality of disability is so often removed from the fear it provokes.While the documentary asks a lot of important questions, I wish it took a little more time to examine where that fear comes from, and how much it plays into people’s decisions to terminate a pregnancy or give a child up for adoption. It’s there briefly in David’s comment about bullying, and in another he makes about worrying over who will look after their child once they no longer can, but it’s not probed more deeply. The focus is on the medical, on the individual choice parents make about whether they can cope with a disabled child, but not on the question of whether, in a world that often provides little help to these parents and constantly devalues the life of their child, that is even a free choice at all. Ellie does mention the role stigma plays but the documentary would have been stronger and had a bigger effect on public attitudes if it had addressed this wider, social dimension.There are other important questions that don’t get attention, not least the law that means that, in the UK, abortion is generally allowed up until 24 weeks of pregnancy, but is legal up until term if there is a significant risk of foetal “abnormality”. Whether these laws are correct or not can never be fully answered in a one-hour documentary (or perhaps ever), but it does feel like an oversight not to even mention the disparity – or how it feeds into the issues thatareaddressed in the film.Ellie’s own, personal dilemmas are also not fully addressed. We see her find out about her chances of passing on her dwarfism to any children she may have, but, again, the conversation is entirely medical. The ethical concerns are left unspoken, perhaps allowing audiences to conclude that passing on a genetic condition is always bad – even though that isn’t necessarily true, and it’s not clear Ellie believes it is (she worries that genetic testing will mean no babies with dwarfism will be born to parents with the condition). There is no assertion of disabled people’s human right to a family life, or mention of how often disabled people’s reproductive rights are systematically abused (in many parts of the world, including the US, disabled people can still be sterilised without their consent). There is also no discussion of the prejudices disabled parents, especially those with genetic conditions, face or the lack of services to support them; both of these problems feel crucial if the central question – should Ellie have children? – is to be properly addressed. Once again, the social aspects of this decision seem to be overlooked.The documentary is thought-provoking, and Ellie’s genuine compassion for everyone she meets makes it a compelling and worthwhile watch. There is only so much she can cover in an hour and audiences will still learn an enormous amount. As she says, most people do not have to consider all these issues when they have a child, and it can only be a good thing to get the public to think about them too, especially in the judgment-free way Ellie approaches her work. But we must remember that for all the medical information, the decisions people make about having a disabled child or being a disabled parent are shaped by fear and stigma. We need to talk about that a whole lot more.Ellie Simmonds: Should I Have Children? aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsEllie SimmondsTV reviewTelevisionDocumentaryFactual TVSwimmingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But there are good bits too.TakeJackie and Shadow, a happy couple who live in a home with breathtaking views of Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino county,California. They currently havetwo children, Sunny and Gizmo, who are preparing to leave home and make their own way in the world. They are, in many ways, the purest embodiment of the modern American dream: reality stars, and also bald eagles.The family has been on camera since October 2015, when the environmental non-profit group Friends of Big Bear Valley (FOBBV) started alive streamof the nest. For years, fans have watched live as the eagles share meals (mostly fish), relax and tease each other. Sometimes Shadow nips at Jackie’s tail or wing “to get a response out of her”, says Sandy Steers, the executive director of FOBBV. “It’s hilarious.”The one change that worked: I started sketching – and stopped doomscrollingRead moreThe eagle cam was Steers’s idea. She started watching the nest years ago, though from the ground, back when it was still occupied by Jackie’s parents, Ricky and Lucy. “I got to watch Jackie grow up through a spotting scope, and it completely hooked me,” she says.Over the years, the feed’s numbers have soared like a majestic bird of prey. TheYouTube pagehas more than 638,000 subscribers, and as I write this, 46,000 people are watching with me.Multiplenewsoutletshave referred to the eagles as “celebrities”. And there’s merch: FOBBV sells Shadow and Jackieplushies($30),tote bags($20) andsweatshirts($45).“I think what draws people is that nature is fascinating, and most of us haven’t really had the chance to sit and study it,” Steers says. “It connects people with themselves and their emotions.”The emotions these eagles elicit seem to be pleasant. Besides the birds, the page includes another wonder of the natural world: a wholesome comment section.“Love you Jackie, Shadow, Sunny, and Gizmo, you’re in my heart forever!” one fan writes in the live chat.I think what draws people is that nature is fascinating, and most of us haven’t really had the chance to sit and study itSandy Steers, executive director of FOBBV“What gets me through the day is to watch this beautiful family thrive,” writes another.The eagles inspire such fervent adoration because of their personalities, says Steers. “Jackie is serious and she’s the boss, absolutely,” she explains. “Shadow knows all of Jackie’s rules, and at the same time, he’s independent.”Jackie and Shadow’s love is the stuff of romcoms. After Rick and Lucy left, Jackie occupied the nest with her first partner, Mr B. In 2018, they had two chicks, but only one survived. That summer another eagle appeared – a charming, impish and stubborn young man who began hanging around the nest and wouldn’t leave no matter how much Mr B snapped at him. Eventually, Mr B gave up and left.Don’t bald eagles mate for life? “For the most part, but apparently not always,” says Steers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheEagle Log, which is run by FOBBV members and posts regular updates on the nest, recently confirmed Gizmo is a girl, based on her overall size, behavior and “obsession with food”. The jury is still out on Sunny’s sex, but the group hopes to have more clarity in the next couple of days.At 11 weeks old, the eaglets are almost ready to fly, and a “fledge watch” isunder wayas fans eagerly wait to see them take to the skies.“They don’t look quite ready to me,” says Steers. “But maybe that’s just me hoping they stay longer.”text reading ‘well actually’ ad ‘read more on living a good life in a complex world’ with a pinkish pill shaped box saying ‘more from this section’I first heard about the eagle cam years ago from a friend, and ever since Gizmo and Sunny first hatched back in March (they’re both Pisces), I’ve kept the live stream open in a tab on my computer. Between work tasks, I click over to see how my feathered pals are doing. It’s become a happy break for me.I’ve watched Sunny and Gizmo grow from tiny balls of gray fuzz into big glorious raptors with razor sharp beaks and claws. I’ve seen Jackie feed the eaglets tiny bits of fish, and watched Gizmo hop in the air and practice flying (“We call that ‘wingercising’,” says Steers).Sometimes the feed is quiet – perhaps the kids are napping and Jackie and Shadow are out hunting. I enjoy the serenity of the trees swaying in the wind and the lake’s glitter too.

The war between the DRC’s army and the military faction known as M23 isoneofAfrica’s longest conflicts [apotential truce was announced last month]. The escalation of violence has meant Stephen now forgoes bylinesand a presence on social media.View image in fullscreenStephen has been targeted by the M23 rebels.I’ve covered pretty much all the conflicts in North Kivu [in the eastern part of the country] where I work as a reporter. The worst time was in 2013 [during the DRC’s offensive against M23]. The bombardment was intense. I saw so many people – civilians and soldiers – injured and killed. I remember looking at the government soldiers’ eyes: they were filled with death. Death was everywhere. I returned home after the fighting and I too had only death in my eyes.I’ve been embedded alongside the government forces in the main conflict zones and this is why I’ve been targeted by the M23 rebels. I was at home in Goma [a city in the North Kivu region in eastern DRC] when I received anonymous phone calls from members of M23 who told me that they knew I had been reporting alongside the government forces. They told me that they’d hunt me down. I spent five days without leaving the house. They were passing my house, they were so close, we [my family] were terrified they’d find us.The whole experience left us psychologically traumatised. It got to the point that my wife begged to be evacuated to a safe zone controlled by the government forces. I couldn’t leave my family, I’d rather die than be separated from them. But trying to leave came to nothing anyway.There is a war on journalists raging around the world: let their voices be heard | Annie KellyRead moreIn Goma, the media landscape has been decimated. Since the rebels took over the local radio and TV stations, there are no journalists working with them. I know journalists who stay in their homes because they are so terrified for their personal security. The M23 forces also have a digital army that disseminate propaganda and attack anyone who contradicts their view of the world.Journalism has become a clandestine activity. I’ve had to erase old articles that I published and hide my online presence. We cannot report publicly, post on social media or voice our opinion in public in any way. It’s against the nature of a journalist. It’s very, very frustrating.Even though this war has severely impacted my life, journalism is a real passion. After university it’s the only work I’ve ever done; I don’t know how to do anything else. It’s a vocation for me. I really hope for peace and the return of the rule of law and that we journalists can write about things other than war.As told to Elizia VolkmannMexico: ‘I had to hug my wife and children not knowing when I could go back’Daniel* has been a journalist for more than a decade in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa –home to an ongoing andbloodydrug war. The state is the heartland of one of the world’s most powerful drug trafficking organisations, the Sinaloa cartel.Mexico is already one of the world’smost dangerous countries for journalists, but it has got particularly awful in the last six months. Seven or eight people are being “disappeared” a day here, including women and children. I do my best to tell the honest story of the hundreds of people each year who are displaced, tortured or disappeared in the cartel wars.I have asked myself why I keep doing what I do despite the risk, but it’s complicated. I am still not entirely sure. It’s not some pride thing. I don’t think danger is cool. I actually find it really, really difficult and am still processing several incidents that have happened to me.View image in fullscreenAfter one threatening incident, Daniel spent three months in hiding.On one occasion, I was in Culiacán reporting onthe arrest of Ovidio Guzmán, the son of the Sinaloa cartel drug lord El Chapo in January 2023. Armed men stopped me in my car, threatened me and confiscated everything I had. Knowing I was a journalist, they took photos and videos of me while pointing a gun to my head. I never saw my laptop and car again. I suppose they burned them.After that last incident, I sought refuge in a hotel under the watch of the cartel until eventually a kind man helped me leave in the back of his truck. After a week at home, I decided to leave the state for the Yucatán peninsula under the advice of the national unit for the protection of journalists. They told me to lie low for a while.I had to hug my wife and children – now three and six years old – and walk out the door in tears not knowing when I could go back. I spent three months away from them. It was brutal. It is really painful being told you have to leave your life behind because someone doesn’t like what you are doing.My family and friends pleaded with me to do something safer and more economically stable and I reflected on it a lot while I was away. In recent years I have moved away from covering narcos to their victims instead, as it’s safer. The incident in Culiacán accelerated this change, but really the catalyst was the birth of my first child six years ago.I want to be around to spend time with my children, wife and parents and for us all to be together for my kids’ birthdays and to have BBQs and eat seafood together. At the same time I think it’s very important to keep telling the truth. I believe in the power of memory and although it doesn’t happen quickly, journalism helps bring about change.As told to Luke TaylorSudan: ‘If we did not take these risks, no one would hear about this war’Ammar Awad has been working as a fixer and reporter for international media outlets in Sudan sincefighting broke outbetween the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary in April 2023.View image in fullscreenFixer and reporter Ammar Awad.I was visiting a camp for displaced people in PortSudan[a city in eastern Sudan by the Red Sea] recently when a little girl clung to my leg and called me by my family name, Uncle Ammar. She brought me to her mother, who was a neighbour and a family friend from Omdurman, the city where I used to live. The camp was in a dreadful condition. She and her family had no housing or tent to protect them from the sun’s heat. I remembered their condition before the war; they were not rich, but they had enough to make them always smiling and kind.The life of the women and children I meet in the areas where we are allowed to work continues to convince my family, who now live in Egypt, that I should carry on returning to Sudan despite their fears and calls for me not to travel to war zones. If we did not take these risks, no one would hear about this war and the atrocities taking place in it. The free world would not move to save and aid the people of Sudan due to its preoccupation with the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.One of the most terrifying moments for me was when I entered the only hospital in Omdurman, which was crowded with wounded and sick people due to the random shelling carried out by the RSF on the city. I will never forget as long as I live how one of the wounded took his last breath in front of us while he was lying on the ground waiting to enter the operating room. We were trying to understand from his relatives how and where he was injured, but he left, and I don’t think I will ever forget this tragic departure.The gradual improvements in the conditions of my neighbour’s family in the Port Sudan camp make me feel that what we are doing has a value – especially when that little girl comes up to me to tell me happily they finally have a tent to live in, or got food rations from international organisations. But it pains me that I am unable to answer her constant question, “When will we return to our home and get our lives back?”By Ammar AwadMyanmar: ‘There is no safe place’Rar Ra* is a journalist working inMyanmar’s Kachinstate. The country hasbeen engulfed by a brutal civil war sinceits transition towards democracy was cut short when themilitary seized power in a coup in 2021.View image in fullscreenAs a known journalist, Rar Ra is monitored and his phone and laptop checked.After the coup, the military put our outlet – a TV channel based in Yangon – on a blacklist. Some of my colleagues went straight to the border to escape to other countries, but I returned to my birthplace in Kachin state. I wanted to continue to report the news as much as I could, writing about war crimes committed by the military, airstrikes that kill children and on conditions for displaced people. I am currently living in a military-controlled town.I have to keep a low profile when I’m out and cannot keep a record of any of my notes, deleting everything after I send my reports to my editor, because the military often check our phones and laptops. As I’m known as a journalist, I’m monitored and checked because they suspect me of reporting news against them. So I have to stay alert all the time.I have to always be thinking about how to escape and where to, if necessary. On one occasion recently I only narrowly escaped after the military were going house-to-house in my neighbourhood searching for a journalist. I fled as soon as I could.It is hard to get information about what is going on in Myanmar. There is no safe place, so often it can be hard to get to war-affected areas. For the past year, the military has cut the internet lines, which makes it difficult for us to talk to sources or get information from distant areas. Our job has also been made more difficult recently by the US aid cuts,which have affected media hereand forced many of my colleagues to quit being journalists.I continue with this job because of the news all around me. The war crimes being committed will not reach the world if I stop working. I am doing my best through all the challenges of danger and access to raise awareness of the people being killed every day.As told to Kaamil AhmedExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentUnder fireJournalist safetyPress freedomNewspapers & magazinesMyanmarDemocratic Republic of the CongoMexicofeaturesShareReuse this content"

But not everyone was convinced – and the bitter argument that followed has consumed the lives of scholars ever sinceByScott SayareTue 27 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 06.33 EDTShareOn a late-summer day in 2001, at the University of Poitiers in west-central France, the palaeontologist Michel Brunet summoned his colleagues into a classroom to examine an unusual skull. Brunet had just returned from Chad, and brought with him an extremely ancient cranium. It had been distorted by the aeons spent beneath what is now the Djurab desert; a crust of black mineral deposits left it looking charred and slightly malevolent. It sat on a table. “Whatisthis thing?” Brunet wondered aloud. He was behaving a bit theatrically, the professor Roberto Macchiarelli recalled not long ago. Brunet was a devoted teacher and scientist, then 61, but his competitive impulses were also known to be immoderate, and he seemed to take a ruthless pleasure in the jealousy of his peers. “Michel is a dominant male,” Macchiarelli told me. “He’s a silverback gorilla.”Inspecting the skull, one could make out a mosaic of features at once distinctly apelike and distinctly human: a small braincase and prominent brow ridge, but also what seemed to be a rather unprotruding jaw, smallish canines and a foramen magnum – the hole at the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects to the brain – that suggested the possibility of an upright bearing, a two-legged gait. Macchiarelli told Brunet he did not know what to make of it. “Right answer!” Brunet said.The discovery was announced to the world the following year on the cover of Nature, the leading scientific journal, and in a televised ceremony in the Chadian capital, N’Djamena. “A new hominid is born,” Brunet declared. “By virtue of his age, he is the ancestor of all Chadians. But also the ancestor of the whole of humankind!”The skull, which Brunet called “Toumaï” – a name from the Djurab, meaning “hope of life” – belonged to a two-legged animal of the Upper Miocene epoch, between 6 and 7m years old. Assuming it was indeed our distant forebear, it was the most ancient ever found, by a margin of as much as 1m years. The location of its discovery furthermore suggested that the human lineage might not have evolved in the savannas of the Great Rift valley of east Africa, as long understood, but rather about 1,500 miles west, in what were once the gallery forests of the greater Sahara. Toumaï stood to upend our very notions of how and why we came to be, to “fundamentally change the way we reconstruct the tree of life”, one prominent palaeontologist wrote. Brunet, to whom the honour of naming the new species fell, called itSahelanthropus tchadensis: “Sahel Man of Chad.”But immediately questions were raised about whether the species was correctly assigned to the human lineage. The authors of a sneering letter in Nature suggested renaming it “Sahelpithecus” (“Sahel Ape”), most notably because it did not, according to their counter-analysis of the skull, walk on two feet – bipedalism being one of the very few available criteria for identifying ancient members of our evolutionary branch. Yet it escaped the notice of no one in the field that some of the letter-writers were affiliated with another hominid species, which had, until the arrival ofSahelanthropus, held the record for the oldest known. And while the question ofSahelanthropus’s gait was acknowledged to be a crucial one, the skull alone was not going to provide a definitive answer. For that, “postcrania”would be required: remains from the neck down, especially the lower body – a pelvis, a femur. Unfortunately, Brunet reported in Nature, none had been recovered.Brunet became a celebrity scientist. In France, he shared caviar with President Jacques Chirac. In Chad, where he ran a programme of field research, he befriended the dictator Idriss Déby; the Chadian national airline was soon renamed after Toumaï. In 2003, Brunet received a $1m Dan David award for discoveries that “cast a new light on the history of human origins”. In Poitiers, grant money poured in.Fame made Brunet grandiose and, in the opinion of some colleagues, slightly paranoid. He seemed to assume that everyone everywhere was consumed with the idea of studying Toumaï, “as if it were the most precious thing on Earth”, said Olga Otero, a researcher who worked with him for years. Brunet’s relations with Macchiarelli, in particular, deteriorated. He had recruited Macchiarelli, who was 15 years his junior, from Rome, and he seemed to expect a certain deference. The palaeontology group in Poitiers was organised to an unusual degree around Brunet, its director; he had a tendency to treat the other scientists as if they were his vassals, as mere “service providers”, Otero said, expecting them to conduct research that furthered his own work, and refusing to sign off on projects that did not. Many members, especially the graduate students, put up with it in exchange for the resources and visibility he afforded them, I was told. But Macchiarelli had no interest in pledging loyalty. “Doubts, additional questions, argument and criticism contribute to the strength, not the weakness, of scientific thought,” he told Nature in 2003. Brunet referred to him derisively as “the Italian”, Macchiarelli told me.In early 2004, Brunet and much of his group were in the Chadian desert with a film crew, making a documentary about Toumaï. In Poitiers, however, a master’s student named Aude Bergeret was undertaking a study of numerous Chadian fossils, including some from the zone where Toumaï itself had been recovered. One of these fossils, listed as an “undetermined long bone”, was scheduled to be cut in half for examination of the sediments inside. Bergeret wanted to be sure to extract as much information as possible from it beforehand. “There came a point where I was making observations, but I frankly wasn’t sure what I was looking at,” she told me. She needed guidance. The adviser who could have provided it was in the desert with Brunet. Macchiarelli, however, who had been one of her instructors, was on hand.Initially, Macchiarelli declined to examine the bone. He did not want to get between Bergeret and her advisers, he told me, and he was cognisant of the ethical norms of the field, which dictate that one does not study fossils unearthed by someone else without their express authorisation. His relations with Brunet were already tense. And he also knew that Brunet had a special sensitivity about Chadian remains, the most important of which had been recovered under circumstances that were, from Brunet’s perspective, far from ideal.Brunet had not in fact been in Chad for the discovery of the cranium that made him famous, and had not even authorised, much less directed, the small expedition that found it in 2001. Rather, a geographer named Alain Beauvilain, who handled the logistics of the Chadian operations, had, with three Chadian colleagues, set out from N’Djamena on an impromptu prospecting mission in the desert. Beauvilain, who had already been feuding with Brunet in the years before the discovery, was not shy about sharing these details with the world. As director of the research programme, Brunet was, by convention, the ultimate discoverer, but as soon as the description of Toumaï was published in Nature, he had Beauvilain recalled to France. And since then he had tried, in essence, to write him out of the story.Examining the Chadian fossils without Brunet’s OK was unorthodox and a bit risky, Macchiarelli realised. But a student was seeking his help, he told me. “In the end,” he said, “I thought to myself,It’s my duty.”He saw immediately that Bergeret’s long bone was the shaft of a left-hand femur. He took note of its robust diameter, its pronounced posterior ridge, its forward curvature: it was evident to Macchiarelli that it had belonged to a primate. “Aude, where is this piece from?” he asked, attempting to mask his mounting agitation. The femur’s inventory number suggested it had been collected from the same site, on the same day, as theSahelanthropusskull. The crucial postcrania that Brunet said did not exist evidently did. “Don’t cut anything,” he said to Bergeret. “This appears to be the femur of Toumaï.”He gave Bergeret some reference papers, told her to spend the weekend making a close study of the femur, and left. “I went back to my office,” Macchiarelli said, “I closed the door, and I said to myself: Shit!”When he returned from Chad, Brunet was furious. According to Macchiarelli, he immediately spent several days studying the femur in the laboratory, behind closed doors. He soon asked to meet with Bergeret in his office. “Mademoiselle Bergeret, you were entrusted with study materials that were unidentified,” he told her, Bergeret recalled. “It was not your role to make an identification.” A laboratory meeting was convened in the presence of a university dean to discuss a “leak of scientific information”, as the minutes put it. One researcher alleged that there were “people who take advantage of our being away in the field to rifle through our collections”. Brunet spoke of “a Judas”. “A grave professional offence has been committed,” wrote the dean.In the meantime, Bergeret left for several days of fieldwork. When she returned, she found that her research materials had been confiscated; the fossils were being “renumbered”, she was told. At one point, however, Bergeret said, one of her advisers appeared with the femur in his hand. “This piece,” he warned, holding it before her: “You forget you ever saw it.”Palaeoanthropology is a notoriously disputatious, not to say vicious, field. In part, this is an effect of self-selection: given its prestige, and its philosophical, even metaphysical implications, the study of human prehistory attracts the most ambitious and, as one member of the discipline put it to me, “the most psychotic”, palaeontologists. There is, additionally, a cultural divide within the field between, speaking very broadly, field workers and laboratory specialists. The former disdain the latter as “armchair palaeontologists”; the latter disdain the former as “fossil hunters”.But most of the fighting in palaeoanthropology is simply a function of the wild imbalance between the number of palaeoanthropologists, which is large, and the number of objects available for them to study, which is very much not. Our direct knowledge of the first few million years of human evolution derives from a collection of bone fragments that could no more than halfway fill a large shoebox. “It’s a bit frustrating,” the researcher Jean-Jacques Jaeger told me, with some understatement, “but there really is a gap in the palaeontological record between, I’d say, 14m and 5m years ago in Africa.” Among other things, the tectonics of this period were not conducive to fossil formation. Unfortunately, this period is precisely when the human line began.Still, the greatest conflicts in the field tend not to be over access to fossils but over the sense one makes of them. Attempting to reconstruct the history of early humanity from the available evidence is, it has been said, akin to trying to divine the plot of War and Peace from just 13 of its pages, picked at random. Major disagreements of interpretation are inevitable, as are major errors, and the discovery of a single new “page” can change everything we thought we understood about the broader story. What we call our knowledge of the deep human past is in fact overwhelmingly provisional, contingent upon whatever fossil happens to turn up next.“Lucy”, the remarkably complete skeleton of a species that came to be known asAustralopithecus afarensis,is the most famous case in point. At about 3m years old, Lucy was, at the time of her discovery in Ethiopia, in 1974, by far the most ancient hominid ever unearthed. She looked like nothing anyone had ever seen, with “an unexpected combination of a small-brained, apelike head and a fully erect body”, as theNew York Times put it at the time. This strange morphology overturned a century-old presumption about what it was to be human. Until then, the human line was thought to be distinguished from the rest of nature largely by its superior intelligence. Lucy’s brain was tiny. And yet 3m years ago her species was already walking very much as we do. Though perhaps less flattering to our self-conception, uprightness turned out to be our deeper heritage. The smarts, such as they are, came later.View image in fullscreenMichel Brunet at his desk, holding a copy of the fossilised jaw fragment of the 3.5m-year-old Australopithecus Abel, in April 2025.Photograph: Jean Francois Fort/The GuardianIf logic were the only factor, the flimsiness of our understanding would inspire restraint, and new fossil discoveries would only rarely give rise to grand pronouncements about the nature of humanity. But the impulse to make such pronouncements, heightened by the prospect of fame, not to mention grant money, can be overwhelming. There is a large and receptive audience for stories about the origins of humankind, however conjectural the stories may actually be. We yearn to know how and why we came to be ourselves, how humanity emerged out of nature. Frequently we yearn, as any historian of the prehistoric sciences will tell you, to the point of unreason.The result is a corpus of palaeoanthropological knowledge that is forever being not only revised but effectively rewritten, and then rewritten again. “A so-called science in which every new piece of evidence is claimed to overthrow all previous ideas must either be in a very juvenile state of development,” the palaeontologist Martin Pickford once wrote, “or it can’t really be a science at all, just a string of temporary opinions.” Pickford, a co-discoverer of the 6m-year-old speciesOrrorin tugenensis, knew whereof he spoke. A few years after he wrote that line,Orrorinwas displaced by Brunet’sSahelanthropusas the oldest hominid, and Pickford was penning his “Sahelpithecus” letter in Nature.Even bipedality itself, which seemed so crucial after Lucy, is no longer taken as an obvious criterion for human-ness, at least not for the most ancient candidates. Our line evidently began walking upright at some point well before Lucy’s species emerged, but there is no agreement as to exactly when this habitual bipedalism began. It is entirely possible that our oldest ancestors walked not on two feet but four; it is entirely possible, conversely, that the most ancient panins – the ancestors of the chimpanzee and bonobo, our closest living relatives – walked on two legs just like their hominin contemporaries. The only trait that is in fact generally accepted as a reliable marker of our evolutionary branch alone is known as the “non-honing CP3 complex”. It has nothing to do with what most people would say if asked what makes us human. It describes the manner in which, when our jaws are closed, our canines and third lower premolars meet.Our uncertainty about the nature of humanity is compounded, too, by the realisation in recent decades that the deep past is a far messier place, biologically speaking, than had long been assumed. Most researchers now believe that, for most of the past several million years, numerous hominin species in fact lived simultaneously, much asHomo erectus, the Denisovans, theNeanderthals, and our own species once did. But, setting aside the interbreeding that almost certainly took place – another complication – only one of the hominin species from any given epoch is our actual forebear; the others are our forebear’s cousins, you might say. For purely statistical reasons, we are far more likely to dig up bones from these cousins, who did not give rise to us, than from the rare species that did. In communicating their findings to the lay public, palaeoanthropologists often speak of finding human “ancestors”, but, unless they are referring to the genusHomo, that is only shorthand. “In a pinch, it’s the sort of thing you can tell the media,” one researcher told me. But it isn’t, strictly speaking, true.Bergeret never saw the femur, or any of her other research materials, again. “In hindsight, I wonder why I didn’t go back and say, ‘What happened to my fossils, actually?’” Bergeret told me. “But I was just a student.” The laboratory seemed to close ranks against her, she said, and after her master’s she was made to understand there was no support for her to take a doctorate. (Several members of the laboratory denied any campaign of exclusion, while acknowledging that individual members probably did behave unfairly toward her.) Macchiarelli intervened, and eventually helped her to become a museum conservator; she currently directs a natural history museum in Burgundy. (She now goes by the name Bergeret-Medina.) To her mind, Macchiarelli rescued her from the worst consequences of stumbling on the femur. “And in a way,” she said, “it damaged his career more than mine.”In Poitiers, Macchiarelli made overtures of reconciliation to the colleagues who felt him a traitor, he said, including a letter hoping for “a return to serenity”. But it didn’t work. Brunet’s group behaved “like a tribe, like a closed-off family”, he told me, like a “cult”. Brunet ought to have thanked him for bringing an important fossil to his attention, Macchiarelli thought. Instead, he urged administrators not to renew Macchiarelli’s contract. Macchiarelli’s office was relocated; he was forced to clean and supply it on his own, he said, and to buy his own stamps, printer cartridges and toilet paper. Though he remained a professor of the University of Poitiers, he took a research position in Paris. “I was attacked, I was insulted, I was threatened,” he said, of his time in Brunet’s group. “Poitiers is the asshole of the world.”At the same time, Brunet’s star continued to rise. In 2005, in collaboration with the researcher Christoph Zollikofer, he published a three-dimensional digital reconstruction of the Toumaï cranium, correcting for the various distortions it had suffered beneath the earth. “Now it’s completely confirmed that Toumaï is not a chimp, or a gorilla, but a true hominid,” Brunet said at the time. The same year, the prominent palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey declared Toumaï “the most important event” in the field in the past quarter-century. In 2007, Brunet was elected to the Collège de France – a tremendous honour for a French scientist – and soon thereafter published a new dating of the cranium, to between 6.8 and 7.2m years.Sahelanthropus tchadensiswas, in Brunet’s view, unequivocally the most ancient hominid species ever known, thrillingly close, in all likelihood, to the very moment our line began.The femur still haunted Macchiarelli, though. At the start, he’d dreamed about it feverishly. “I didn’t sleep for days,” he told me. “I replayed the film in my mind – I’d held it in my hands!” None of Brunet’s papers contained any reference to a recently discoveredSahelanthropusfemur, however, and if one read closely, Macchiarelli realised, many of them seemed to implicitly deny its existence. A 2004 journal article reported an “absence of limb bone remains”. The following year, in Nature, Brunet wrote that “several lines of evidence” suggested thatSahelanthropuswas bipedal, with the proviso that, in order to be certain, “postcranial evidence will be necessary”; he declined to report that he was now in possession of precisely such evidence.Macchiarelli at one point sent a long letter to the president of the University of Poitiers and several top officials at the CNRS, France’s prestigious research network, in order to “formally accuse” Brunet of lying about what he called “the femur affair”; nothing came of it. “There’s been a selection, a choosing of which remains to publish, and which not,” Macchiarelli told me. “No one has the right to do that!”Macchiarelli is a compact, voluble man with a winning smile and an endearing minor lisp. He bears a passing resemblance to the actor Dustin Hoffman. He is also a man of considerable self-regard and, by broad consensus, of sometimes unbearable, even aggressive, fastidiousness. Since childhood, his nickname has been “precisini,” Italian for “anal-retentive”, he told me, not without pride. Typically it would be “precisino”, the singular, but just oneprecisinowas deemed insufficient; Macchiarelli was more punctilious than that. “If a comma was missing, I was definitely the one who added it back,” he told me. As a teacher, he added, he sometimes drove students to tears, “even the boys”.View image in fullscreenRoberto Macchiarelli in Toulouse.Photograph: Pierre-Selim HuardAs his concerns about the femur grew, Macchiarelli discovered further oddities. Beauvilain, the banished geographer, had his own fixation onSahelanthropus, and beginning shortly after the discovery of the femur, in 2004, he had written several articles, in journals of varying degrees of obscurity, attempting to undermine the discovery of the Toumaï cranium itself. In 2009, in a French-language regional geological newsletter, he published photographs of the skull as he alleged it was found, atop the sand, surrounded by various other fossils. Just next to it, no more than about a foot away, was what looked very much like a femur. It had been there, it seemed, from the very start.Macchiarelli had initially assumed that Brunet was keeping silent about the femur for essentially emotional reasons, out of shame for not having been there for its discovery in the desert in 2001, and for not having recognised it afterward. By now, however, he had come to suspect that Brunet was in fact hiding it “because it didn’t fit”, he said – because it seemed to show thatSahelanthropuswas not a biped, and presumably not a hominin at all, and because Brunet’s reputation would be shattered if anyone found out.Beauvilain’s photograph constituted the first public confirmation of the femur’s existence. It gave Macchiarelli an opening. In 2004, Bergeret had taken several laboratory photographs of the bone. Macchiarelli now brokered the publication of two of them on the widely read blog of John Hawks, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor and longtimeSahelanthropussceptic. In principle, to print images of someone else’s unpublished fossil was a clear breach of ethics. But then, Macchiarelli, Bergeret and Hawks reasoned, after Beauvilain’s article, the femur was no longer unpublished.The photographswent up on Hawks’s blog in the summer of 2009. They showed a small blackened shaft run through with fissures, ragged at the top and bottom, where the important end pieces had long since broken off. It resembled a length of burnt kindling. From the images alone it was impossible to say whether the bone had belonged to a biped, Hawks assessed. He called upon Brunet to make a formal description: measurements, scans, comparisons to other primates. It was “perfectly legitimate” for a scientist to delay addressing certain subjects “until you’re ready for the sun to shine on them”, Hawks wrote, but “some ideas need more sunshine than others”.Brunet likes to say, with only slight exaggeration, that it took him 30 years of digging before he found anything of consequence. Fieldwork is gruelling and slow, and always a gamble. In the 1970s he went to Afghanistan, prompted by the nearby discovery ofRamapithecus, a 14m-year-old creature then thought to be a direct human ancestor. He was effectively deported after the Soviet invasion, in 1979;Ramapithecusturned out to be an ancient orangutan. He went to Cameroon. No hominins had ever been found there. “It wouldn’t have been very innovative to try to follow the people who were already in east Africa,” he told me recently. A close friend came to help; he was killed by a drug-resistant strain of malaria. Brunet found nothing. Only then did he try Chad.The Djurab is a particularly difficult research environment. The zones of palaeontological interest typically require several full days of Jeep travel to reach; daytime temperatures can rise to about 50C. The winds whip stinging sand, and can sometimes cause a dune to migrate as much as 5 metres in a single night. Beneath the dunes lie compact sediments; when they are exposed, the winds erode them at a rate of a few centimetres per year. The fossils are left behind. Often they have been fully excavated by the wind, and come to rest gently upon the surface of the desert, strewn about and forgotten like the playthings of some primeval child. Eventually, inevitably, the winds cover them again with sand, if they do not destroy them first. In the Djurab, one must not only come to the right place, but arrive there at the right time.I visited Brunet last year in Poitiers, where he picked me up from the train. He’d suggested we meet at a parking garage attached to the station, the “Toumaï lot”; on the way there I passed the municipal conference centre, the “Espace Toumaï”. Brunet was waiting behind the wheel of an ageing Mercedes, looking over the reading glasses perched at the tip of his nose. He greeted me slowly, as if sceptical of my intentions, and then began to deplore the unsettled state of French society, and of science. “Sometimes I feel as if I come from another world,” he said. He is now 85. A white beard tapered to an elfin point beneath his chin, and bright cerulean eyes twinkled beneath the wisps of his eyebrows. When he emerged from the car, he took out a cane and began hobbling away. He’d lost 7cm of height to the Djurab, he said; several years ago, after a heart attack, he’d had a defibrillator implanted, such devices being rare in the desert. He asked that I follow him. “It won’t be hard!” he laughed. No one has ever questioned his commitment.Brunet was furious at the publication of the photographs of the femur. “When these little young people who have only ever worked with CT scanners or at the synchrotron come tell you how the world works, but they’ve never once found an actual fossil of their own – well!” he told me. Whatever the methodological conflicts within palaeoanthropology, it is a matter of near-universal agreement that, for having put in the time and effort, and for having made the initial gamble to dig wherever they dug, the discoverer has the sacred and inviolable right to be first to study their fossils, and first to publish them. In practice, Brunet noted, this often means a wait of many years.Brunet told me he’d never sought to keep the femur “hidden”, exactly, and that he’d in fact known of it from the very start, since its discovery in the desert in 2001. He did falsely deny its existence, including in print, but, contrary to Macchiarelli’s assumption, this had nothing to do with what it showed aboutSahelanthropus, he said. In Brunet’s opinion the femur obviously belonged to a bipedal hominin, but bipedalism inSahelanthropuswas already clear from the skull. “It only confirmed what you could prove without it,” he told me. He had attempted to keep the femur out of the public eye because it was quite a damaged, difficult specimen; he assumed, wrongly as it happened, that he would soon find other femora, and that these would make for a more conclusive publication. “I was too optimistic,” he said.As proof of this version of events, Brunet offered that in 2001 or 2002, well before the bone turned up in Poitiers, he’d in fact taken the fossil or a cast to the United States, where he showed it to four prominent palaeoanthropologists: C Owen Lovejoy of Kent State, David Pilbeam of Harvard, Tim White of Berkeley, and Bernard Wood of George Washington. “Ask them!” Brunet said. When I did, three of the men said they had no recollection of seeing a femur at the time in question, though two did recall seeing one a few years later; one man, noting that he was a “close friend” of Brunet, declined to comment. When, in a later conversation, I brought these details to Brunet’s attention, he said he’d made a mistake about the timing but maintained that he had absolutely known about the femur from the outset. If that is true, he seems not to have made anyone else aware of it. Nor does he seem to have made any particular effort to keep it safe. On the contrary, for Bergeret’s study, he’d authorised that it be cut in half.His former colleagues tend to believe that Brunet did in fact see the fossil in 2001, when he came to N’Djamena to collect the cranium, but that he failed to realise what it was. Beauvilain told me he’d pointed it out to Brunet specifically – “Wait, what about that thing? Isn’t that something curious?” – but that Brunet seemed uninterested. Jean-Renaud Boisserie, a CNRS senior researcher who worked with Brunet for many years, recalled that Brunet was “consumed by the skull” when it was found, “completely staggered”. “I don’t think he was in a state of mind to examine any other fossils,” Boisserie said.Brunet was almost certainly also preoccupied with shaping the story of how the skull had been found, his colleagues said. Franck Guy, a palaeoanthropologist at the CNRS and the University of Poitiers and, like Boisserie, a former disciple of Brunet, said Brunet would have had a “dual reaction” to the discovery of the cranium on an unauthorised, wildcat expedition. “The first reaction is, ‘This Beauvilain asshole has once again taken a shit in my boots! And now I’m going to have make sure the shit doesn’t get out of them.’” (Initially, Brunet agreed to speak with me only if I agreed never to speak with Beauvilain; the articulation of this demand was complicated by his refusal to speak Beauvilain’s name aloud.) The second reaction, according to Guy – no less consuming or obsessional than the first – would have been: “Holy shit, we’ve clearly got the oldest hominid. We licked all those other fucking bastards!”After Hawks’s 2009 blogpost, Brunet felt enormous pressure to make a formal description of the femur, and resented it. Toward the end of that year, during a presentation in London at the Royal Society, at a conference attended by many of the field’s biggest names, he addressed the audience angrily at one point. “My feeling is that you are thinking about postcrania!” Brunet said, his voice rising nearly to a shout. (In a recording of the talk, one can hear what sounds like a hand pounding on the dais.) Before his assembled peers, he declined to confirm or deny the existence of a femur. But he promised: “A description of postcrania is coming.”No description came. Brunet seemed to take the demands for publication as an attempt at a putsch, his colleagues told me, an intolerable effort to wrest away control of a fossil that, to his mind, would still be buried in the Djurab but for the research programme he founded. And though he was spending ever more time in Paris, at the Collège de France, Brunet still made chaos in Poitiers. Guy told me that two major studies onSahelanthropus– one on the geochemistry of the cranium, the other on theSahelanthropusbrain–were conducted at the time. The results of both were broadly in line with Brunet’s pre-existing ideas, but neither were ever published. In both cases, Brunet had gotten into disputes with his coauthors, including disputes about authorship credit, and no solution could be found. “Everything was always suffused with this extreme feeling of, ‘I’m the boss around here,’” Guy said.At the start, Guy and his colleagues had essentially aligned themselves with Brunet in the femur conflict. In their view, Macchiarelli had behaved with wild disregard to ethics at least twice: first in 2004, when he examined the Chadian fossils without authorisation, and then in 2009, when he helped arrange for the publication of the photos of the femur. But Brunet himself was becoming increasingly unbearable, they felt: the behaviour they might have accepted as subordinate graduate students was no longer tolerable as professional peers. And his continued refusal to publish a description of the femur was damaging the reputation of the research group in Poitiers.Guy and Boisserie, who rose to positions of leadership there in Brunet’s absence, began to insist that he publish the femur. He was unmoved.At the same time, Macchiarelli’s preoccupation with the unpublished femur seemed only to intensify. “For years, I thought about it every day,” he told me. He wrote repeatedly to university administrators to remind them of what he called the “damnatio memoriae” – the erasure from official history – to which the fossil had been condemned, to alert them to the “growing scepticism” of non-French researchers, and to warn that he might have no recourse but to go to the media. And he began to press Brunet’s former disciples, though they were, in his view, still in thrall to their mentor. “It was still him pulling the strings,” Macchiarelli told me. “I didn’t for one second believe in their good faith.” (Guy described this pressure – which took the form of long, rather pontifical emails with the university leadership copied in, or disparaging comments to outside colleagues at academic conferences – as “harassment.”)Eventually, Macchiarelli had had enough of waiting. “From 2004 to 2018, as one says in proper French,Je fermais ma gueule” – “I shut my trap” – Macchiarelli told me. “In 2018, I decided it wasn’t worth it any more.” The research group in Poitiers was hosting a major palaeontological conference that year. With Bergeret, Macchiarelli submitted an abstract for a presentation in which, using Bergeret’s photographs and measurements from 2004, they would finally describe the femur. It was, he acknowledged, a violation of the norms of his field. “Perhaps another researcher would not have done it,” Macchiarelli told me, lauding what he considered to be his “act of courage.” His was the role of the “white knight”, he said.The proposal was refused by the conference’s scientific committee. “Never in my life have I had another abstract rejected,” Macchiarelli told me. In a letter to the presidents of the University of Poitiers and the CNRS, among other recipients, he warned that the rejection threatened “the international credibility of French palaeoanthropological research.” He also spoke to the press.Two days before the conference opened, Nature published a news story that began, “When anthropologists meet in France at the end of January, one of the most provocative fossils in the study of human evolution will not feature on the agenda.” One conference participant told Le Figaro: “There hasn’t been a formal session on Toumaï. But it’s the only thing being talked about at all the coffee breaks!” The conference’s scientific committee insisted that Macchiarelli’s abstract had been rejected for ordinary reasons – other abstracts had been rejected, too – but there were, Le Monde reported, “suspicions of omertà”.For the researchers in Poitiers, the coverage was a catastrophe. “We were going to show that we’ve changed leadership, that we’re making a new start,” Guy told me. They were just beginning to emerge from what they considered to be the sinkhole around Brunet; Macchiarelli pulled them back in.For outsiders, the bitterness and intractability of the femur dispute was sometimes mystifying. The University of Poitiers attempted a mediated solution, and at one early meeting the university’s vice-president for research remarked that Macchiarelli “seems a bit frustrated not to be able to study this specimen”, Guy recalled; “Just give it to him,” the administrator suggested. Guy, a generous but brooding man with a shaved head and an air of unmistakable weariness – weariness with Macchiarelli, with Brunet, with being stuck between them, with how puerile science sometimes is – noted ruefully that the vice-president was a physicist by training. “We had to explain to all these people how things work within our discipline,” he told me. Eventually, however, an agreement was reached. The researchers in Poitiers would, with Brunet’s approval, finally publish a formal study of the femur. In the meantime, and until publication, Macchiarelli would stop talking about it in public.Macchiarelli broke the agreement. In November 2020, in the Journal of HumanEvolution, or JHE, one of the top publications in the field, he, Bergeret, and two co-authors published their own formal description of the femur, the first ever made. Based largely upon the bone’s apparent forward curvature – inHomo sapiens, the femur is effectively straight – and what little they could glean of its internal structure from Bergeret’s photos, the authors concluded that it had probably belonged to a quadrupedal, non-hominin ape.Without access to the fossil itself, the paper was “mediocre”, Macchiarelli acknowledged. But it was beyond time for a formal description: without one, he felt, the entire field was being misled, our vision of humanity itself distorted. The year before, a respected colleague in the US had published a paper in which he referred toSahelanthropus tchadensisin definitive terms as a “hominin” and the “earliest species known.” “If he’d seen the femur, he wouldn’t have written the things he wrote!” Macchiarelli said. And he assumed that, despite the agreement, Guy and his colleagues had no plans to publish.“I waited, I waited, I waited,” he told me.Even given Macchiarelli’s history, the researchers in Poitiers were astonished at what he had done. He had now, irrevocably, made the first formal description of a specimen that he had not himself discovered and to which he had never actually been granted access, including by the ultimate rights-holders, the authorities of Chad. Nor had Macchiarelli in fact been quite so unaware of any plans to publish. Two months before the appearance of the JHE article, the scientists in Poitiers had posted a preprint manuscript of their own study online; Macchiarelli had seen it, he acknowledged to me. He went ahead with his own article anyway.View image in fullscreenGuillaume Daver and Franck Guy at the University of Poitiers palaeontology department.Photograph: Jean Francois Fort/The GuardianThe researchers in Poitiers wrote to theJHE to warn that Macchiarelli’s paper was “presumably subject to scientific integrity issues”. They also filed a formal ethics complaint with the CNRS. Neither undertaking had much effect. “We understand how upsetting this is for you,” the editors of the JHE responded. After more than 70 hours of interviews, a CNRS investigatory committee determined that it would make no pronouncement on Macchiarelli’s behaviour. In their brief report, they offered no specific logic for sitting on their hands but did make note, with apparent apprehension, of “the potentially media-attracting character of this affair”.The researchers pressed on with the femur. Their finalised study was published in Naturein 2022, 20 years after the Toumaï cranium first appeared in the pages of the same journal. Brunet was not among the authors, and told me he had declined to participate out of lassitude with the “polemic” around the femur. According to Guy and Boisserie, he had in fact demanded to be credited as lead author, and had withdrawn his name when they refused.It was the end of cordial relations. Guy put the conflict in Oedipal terms. It had taken them many years, he said, but he and his colleagues were finally able to “kill the father”. Brunet now calls them “the young ones” – Guy and Boisserie are in their 50s – or the “little idiots”.For the Nature study, Guy and his co-authors had measured the femur and twoSahelanthropusulnae – bones of the forearm – across a total of 23 distinct parameters, working from high-resolution scans. The “most parsimonious hypothesis”, they concluded, was thatSahelanthropuswas indeed a habitual biped, albeit one that probably engaged in a good deal of “arboreal clambering”. It would have been a flat-faced, small-brained creature about the size of a human child or small chimpanzee, perhaps scampering into the trees when a saber-toothed cat came round, perhaps hanging on branches, perhaps sleeping in nests as modern apes do, and presumably moving about much of the rest of the time on the ground, where it walked on two feet. Brunet felt vindicated. Whatever his relations with the authors, “they did an excellent paper”, he said.More consequentially, ifSahelanthropuswas bipedal, then bipedality was in all likelihood a marker of the human lineage from the start. In combination with our distinctive “non-honing” dentition, it was a possible “synapomorphic signature of the hominin clade”, the authors wrote: a functional definition of what it is and always has been to be human. “I don’t want to say we’re categorical about that idea,” said the researcher Guillaume Daver, who shared lead authorship with Guy, but “we have no evidence to contradict it”. Humankind: small dull teeth, two legs.Macchiarelli called the paper out of Poitiers a “fairytale”. When I asked about its methodology, he chided me, “Please be serious.” (When I asked how such a ridiculous paper had been selected for publication in a top scientific journal, he alleged that, when it came toSahelanthropus, Nature could not be trusted. The magazine had published the Toumaï cranium 20 years before and otherSahelanthropuspapers since; it was now committed, he claimed, to showing that the species was bipedal.) Last year, in the JHE, Macchiarelli published a response, reaching conclusions that were precisely the inverse. When I spoke with his co-author Clément Zanolli, he offered a wry compromise with the findings of the Nature paper. “It’s not impossible thatSahelanthropuscould have used bipedalism,” Zanolli, a CNRS researcher and former student of Machiarelli, told me. “Just like chimpanzees do occasionally today.”In the view of other palaeoanthropologists, the interpretive approaches of both papers were in fact entirely reasonable. Yet by the laws of formal logic, at least one of them was wrong. We have grown accustomed to seeing this sort of scientific impasse resolved through improvements in technology: a new tool makes it possible to extract the pivotal data that had once been inaccessible. But it is hard to imagine pulling much more morphological information from theSahelanthropusfemur. For their study, the researchers in Poitiers scanned it via micro-CT a total of 5,984 times, resulting in 4,962 “slices”. Every feature of the bone as small as the width of a human hair was recorded in three dimensions.Such exquisite accuracy is of obvious value, but it is also deceptive in a way; in the palaeoanthropological context, it is perhaps even slightly absurd. The defining problem in palaeoanthropology is not one of precision; the problem is that, because we know so extraordinarily little of our deepest past, we can only guess at the meaning of the measurements we already have, however precise they may be. The Sahelanthropus femur is the only possibly hominin lower limb bone ever recovered from before 6m years ago. Without anything contemporaneous to compare it with, even the premise that the fossil being studied in such incredible detail belongs to Sahelanthropus, and not to some other animal, is itself no more than a hypothesis. The maddening irony is that the same scarcity of evidence that makes the femur so important and so tantalising also makes it all but impossible to interpret with any meaningful degree of certainty. “The basic need in this field,” the palaeoanthropologist Tim White told me, expressing a position of rare consensus in the discipline, “is the recovery of new fossils.”View image in fullscreenThe femur discovered near Toumaï’s skull.Photograph: Jean Francois Fort/The GuardianSlowly, as more remains come to light, certain questions will be answered. Others will not be, and cannot be. The question of the true nature ofSahelanthropus, and of its relation to us, may be of that latter, insoluble category. “Just because youwantto know something, it doesn’t mean youcanknow it,” said the palaeoanthropologist Bernard Wood. IfSahelanthropusis indeed a hominin, statistics all but rule out the possibility that it is an actual human ancestor. The most that can be said is that it “represents humanity as it might have been 7m years ago,” Guy said: that it came into being according to the same evolutionary pressures that made our ancestor, whoever it was.We will almost certainly never find fossils from that ancestor, and in truth we wouldn’t know it if we did. We could one day hold in our hands the remains of the literal ur-mother, the individual animal that birthed the whole of human history. There is no technology, extant or imaginable, that could extract that marvellous secret from her bones.Fossils promise untold knowledge; fossils promise worldly fame. Often they withhold both; sometimes they drive people mad. They do stir up “an irrational element”, Macchiarelli acknowledged. But as a responsible scientist, adding careful bricks to the great edifice of learned wisdom, he said he had never been swayed by such human passions. “I’m not on a crusade!” he told me, in regards toSahelanthropus. “I simply think the femur is not at all compatible with bipedality.” Brunet prefers to ascribe Macchiarelli’s two-decade preoccupation with the femur to jealousy. “And jealousy,” Brunet is fond of saying, “is a disease with no cure.” (“Impossible!” Macchiarelli retorted: “for inexplicable reasons”, jealousy “is not part” of his psychological repertoire.) The Toumaï fossils seem to cause a certain derangement, Brunet went on: “Everyone who’s come near Toumaï, who’s touched it – it’s gone to their head.” Like his antagonist, he seemed to imagine himself exempt.Solar storms, ice cores and nuns’ teeth: the new science of historyRead moreLately Brunet has turned his eye to chimps. For reasons no one entirely understands, the remains of ancient panins are much rarer even than the fossils of ancient hominins. “Three teeth, a femur –maybe,” Daver told me. They would be of tremendous use in identifying and understanding the species of our own line, a sort of Rosetta Stone. If we cannot know ourselves by what we were, we can know ourselves by what we were not. Brunet has been digging for them in Cameroon. He would like to return to the Djurab.His former disciples now control the research programme there, however, and they have prevented him: he has a habit of creating problems for them in Chad, as elsewhere. He also seems to have a plan to die in the desert, I was told repeatedly. His former students do not wish to take on the moral burden of allowing him to carry out this plan, or the logistical burden of the aftermath. Repatriating a cadaver is never straightforward, one researcher pointed out drily, but the desert can be especially capricious with human remains.Reporting for this project was supported by a Silvers Grant for Work in Progress from theRobert B Silvers FoundationListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readFossilsHistoryAcademicsEvolutionBiologyNeanderthalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But we can be sure about one thing: although no one took seriously Donald Trump’s boast that he would end the warwithin 24 hours– perhaps not even Trump himself – it’s now evident that his efforts to stitch together a political settlement have failed. Last weekend’s Russian drone and missile strikes against Ukraine, reportedly among the largestsince the full-scale invasion began, show us that the conflict isn’t likely to come to a sudden end.That’s becauseVladimir Putinremains committed to his goal of conquering Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces. So far, he controls virtually all of the first and most of the other three. A deal that gives him what he has now plus a guarantee that Ukraine will remain outside Nato won’t satisfy him. He has said repeatedly that he wants all four of these provinces and a neutral Ukraine, with caps on the number of soldiers and major armaments it can deploy.Trump’s mistake has been to assume that his self-proclaimed deal-making genius, supposed rapport with Putin and massive leverage over Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the US has provided Ukrainewith more weaponrythan the other allies combined, though less total aid when humanitarian and other support is included) would together yield a diplomatic success, perhapsone that would evenland him a Nobel peace prize.But with Russia targeting Ukraine, including Kyiv, with367drones and missilesover the past few days, this isn’t merely a display of disdain by Putin for any political settlement that falls short of his goals, and a demonstration that he is committed to continuing the fight until he achieves his objectives. It also makes Trump seem weak.Now Trump is outraged – Putin, hewrote on his social media platform, has “gone absolutely CRAZY” and is “needlessly killing a lot of people” – and, when asked whether he was thinking of tightening sanctions, replied: “Absolutely.” But this isn’t the first time Trump has warned Putin to cease targeting his missiles and drones on Ukraine (remember his “Vladimir, STOP!” post late last month?) or threatened additional sanctions.This is an obvious trend in the relationship. Putin is still committed to his publicly stated goals, and rebuffs Trump’s flattery and bullying in equal measure. Unsurprisingly, he showed no interest in Trump’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Zelenskyy promptly accepted. Nor was Putin unnerved byTrump’s threat, in late April, to impose secondary sanctions on Russia unless it stopped “shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns”. This warning came after Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy at Pope Francis’s funeral and may have given the Ukrainian president hope, but it didn’t rattle his Russian counterpart. Nor did Trump’sintimation in Marchthat Russia risked further sanctions unless it demonstrated its commitment to peace.As a gesture to convey that he wasn’t ignoring Trump’s diplomatic démarches, Putin did propose that Russia andUkrainemeet face-to-face. Zelenskyy, ever eager to convince Trump that he is doing his bit, sent a high-level delegation to the Istanbul talks and even went to Ankara himself. Putin sent second-tier panjandrums with no authority to offer anything substantial. And Trump offered to reorganise his trip to the Gulf monarchies and fly to Turkey if Putin did as well, claiming that only a meeting between him and Putin would produce a diplomatic breakthrough.The flattery didn’t entice Putin, who remained in Moscow. The two leaders did have a phone conversation, but nothing meaningful came of it. After that, Trump seemed resigned to failure, though he’d never call it that, andreverted to the narrativethat “this was not our war” and that Europe should assume responsibility for supporting Ukraine’s security and brokering an end to the conflict.However, even if Trump moves beyond social media posts and words and actually does impose additional economic penalties onRussiathis time round, the fighting won’t stop – for at least two reasons.First, Putin owns this war and has therefore staked his political standing on achieving his goals, no matter the costs, which have been enormous. There has been much debate about the number of Russian military casualties, but the estimates runas high as 900,000, includingwell over 100,000dead. And though the war has hardly brought Russia’s economy to the brink of collapse, it has been a significant burden. Military spendingincreased by 46%between 2022 and 2024 and accounted forabout 35%of total government spending in the latter year, with the proportion projected to reach 37% this year. Inflation reached10.23% last month, forcing the central bank to keep itsinterest rate at 21%. Putin’s job isn’t at risk, but he would be politically diminished if, after demanding sacrifices on this scale from Russians, he settled for half a loaf. So don’t expect that he will be forced to compromise because of blood and treasure being devoured by the war.Second, as Trumptold European leadersafter his phone call with Putin, the Russian leader seems convinced that his army is winning. Perhaps Putin doesn’t know the full extent of Russian losses – which, in addition to the casualties,include an estimated 14,000 tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and artillery systems – because his generals fear bringing bad news to the boss. Perhaps he’s well-briefed but confident nevertheless that Russia’s superiority in every material measure of military might will eventually ensure victory, that the west will tire of the war and that Trump will abandon his pursuit of a deal and even end US military support to Ukraine.No matter. The upshot is that no one should be surprised if, come February, this war enters its fifth year – and with no end in sight.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

It may seem as though everything is going their way now Donald Trump is back with a vengeance, but the poor things have run into a bit of a branding problem. For years, the anti-woke crowd positioned themselves as fearless free thinkers taking on the intolerant left. The journalist Bari Weiss wrote a fawningNew York Times piece in 2018describing rightwing voices such as Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens as “renegades of the intellectual dark web” (IDW).Now, however, the people who used to position themselves as oppressed truth-tellers operating in what Weiss’s article called an “era of That Which Cannot Be Said”, have a state-sanctioned microphone. They’ve won. But in winning they’ve made it difficult to continue the charade that they give a damn about “cancel culture”. Look around: some of these self-styled free speech warriors are doing everything they can to ruin the lives of everyone who doesn’t 100% agree with them.Most conservatives don’t seem to mind that their hypocrisy is now on full display. But, according to a recentpiece on the news site Semafor,a handful of people within the anti-woke media ecosystem are starting to have something of an identity crisis. “One didn’t have to be especially prescient to spot those ‘anti-woke’ types who would just slowly become Maga flunkies,” said the libertarian journalist Michael Moynihan, who had a short stint at Weiss’s publication the Free Press before becoming disillusioned.At this rate, pro-choice sentiment will be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deportedRemember when the right railed against people losing jobs for old comments they’d made? In 2018, for example, the Atlantic fired the conservative columnist Kevin Williamson after the backlash about a 2014 podcast appearance in which the 60-year-old had suggested women should face hanging forhaving an abortion. Cue a million furious tweets from the “renegades of the IDW” about how, as Ben Shapiro put it on X, “virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the Left’s interests”.Now, however, there’s no denying that virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the right’s interests. Semafor’s piece notes that “One [Free Press]investigationthat exposed two low-profile employees at PBS who had focused on diversity and got them fired rubbed even some of its allies the wrong way”.At least the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) employees at PBS “only” got fired.Canary Missionand Betar US, twopro-Israel groups, have been compiling “deportation” lists of pro-Palestinian activists on college campuses and sharing them with the Trump administration. Betar US has also warned that it is going toexpand its focusbeyond immigrants to naturalised US citizens.These organisations are just a couple of cogs in a massive dissent-crushing machine. The Christian nationalist Heritage Foundation, which spearheaded Project 2025, is behind a dystopian plan calledProject Estherthat cynically weaponises very real concerns about antisemitism to shut down criticism of Israel and quash pro-Palestinian activism. And you can bet these censorious projects won’t end with Palestinians: at the rate we’re going, pro-choice sentiment will soon be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deported. If that sounds far-fetched, let me remind you that last month theveterans affairs departmentordered staff to report their colleagues for “anti-Christian bias”.Drunk on their power to deport and defame, some on the right have officially lost the plot. For months a number of conservative voices have been engaged on a mission to cancelMs Rachel, a children’s entertainer whose real name is Rachel Accurso. If you have small children, Ms Rachel needs no introduction. For everyone else, she wears a pink headband and sings songs such as Icky Sticky Bubble Gum. Ms Rachel’s videos have always been gently inclusive: she incorporates sign language and she has frequently had Jules Hoffman, anon-binary musician, on her show. On herpersonal social mediashe has also advocated for issues such as paid family leave.The right tried to cancel Ms Rachel over Hoffman’sgender identity back in 2023.Now they’re trying to cancel the beloved star again; this time for the “crime” of speaking up about Palestinian kids and featuring athree-year-old double amputee from Gazain a video. The fact Accurso ishumanising Palestinianchildren is driving some rightwing voices so berserk that they’re smearingher as antisemitic, asking the US attorney general for an investigation, and spreading the ridiculous and completely baseless lie (which the New York Times bizarrelychose to amplify) that she is being funded by Hamas.Welcome to our “new era of That Which Cannot Be Said”: one that may make McCarthyism seem progressive. It would seem the new renegades of the intellectual dark web are those of us who think you shouldn’t bomb starving babies in their sleep just because they are Palestinian.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And of course in a modern society, why should anyone be elevated to positions of power or prestige solely by accident of birth? Add to this absurdity the notion of a “King of Canada” – a fully independent G7 nation – who lives an ocean away, and the silliness of our system of government compounds.In ordinary circumstances, a British monarch has little interest in a former far-flung colony, and our passport offices would run with or without his official portrait overseeing the grey walls of officialdom. Humans, however, are not rational. And our circumstances are not ordinary.At moments of closeness or crisis – for example, the visit byKing Charles IIIto deliver a speech from the throne at the opening of Canada’s parliament as our US neighbours are expressing expansionist tendencies – watch all that latent scepticism melt away. When a royal actually lands in Canada, the queues dutifully form as the more transcendent benefits of monarchy become apparent.Since his election last November, the US president,Donald Trump, has enacted punishing tariffs against Canada’s auto sector, an industry that is highly integrated with the US, undermining a crucial trade relationship that has been the bedrock of this country’s economy for decades. Further, Trump has mused publicly and privately about making Canada the “51st state”, even going so far as to threaten “economic force” to coerce Canadians into consent for the idea.Canadian voters took the US shift in course seriously, as evidenced by Mark Carney winning a near-majority in parliament – in part by noting that the relationship between the US and Canada, “based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over”. Carney was the“elbows-up”candidate, encouraging Canadians to think of the threat posed by the US in existential terms.So it is not only an incredible coup, but also a remarkably subtle bit of geopolitics for the new prime minister to open his parliament with a throne speech delivered by the king. The timing of this tour cannot be totally removed from the politics of the world around it.King Charles III is a potent symbol of Canada’s history and system of government; a system and government that stand in contrast to the flailing republicanism of the US.The monarchy is a distinctly Canadian symbol, free of partisan affiliation, and thus an institution all Canadians can celebrate after a rancorous election, regardless of which party they voted for.Even the Conservatives who proudly hung black “Fuck Trudeau” flags in their windows can show up with mini-Canada flags to welcome Charles. This gives the impression of a country united in its sense of self in the face of a leering US threat.The throne speech will also signal to Canadians that we still have friends in the world beyond the US; that there remains some whisper of a Commonwealth that can, at a minimum, demonstrate moral support. To this end, the king is stepping up at a time when many elected leaders of western nations have remained conspicuously silent at the prospect of a belligerent US threatening its closest friend and ally during late-night rambles on Truth Social.Crown questions to fore as king visits Canada amid tensions with TrumpRead moreGiven Trump’s penchant for trolling, it’s impossible to know how seriously to take his threats. It’s very unlikely that the Americans are capable, organised, or focused enough to revive long-discarded rhetoric about manifest destiny, or to dig up the decaying military books detailing War Plan Red –secret documentsproduced in the 1920s and 30s intended to prepare for a war with the British empire via Canada.Even if a military campaign is out of the question, Trump has scrambled Canada’s sense of place in the world. And here, the mere presence of the king must be taken as a reminder of the nation’s history and alliances.In his opening remarks, Charles alluded to the crown as “a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present”. Much of the following address – provided by the Canadian government, as it also is in Britain – was, as throne speeches tend to be, filled with the quotidian.However, it made clear that today, “Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear”.It noted the changing relationship between Canada and the US, nodding to the desire of their respective leaders to provide “transformational benefits for bothsovereignnations”, emphasis my own.And it could have an unintended effect on Trump himself, who has has shown a penchant for autocratic leaders and for pomp and ceremony. Though constitutional monarchy is entirely for show, this distinction may be mostly lost on Trump, who wasobviously flatteredby an invitation by King Charles to a state dinner. Trump described the king as a “beautiful man, a wonderful man”, upon receiving the letter two months ago.After all, is there anyone on earth better equipped to deliver flattery, pomp, ceremony and elaborate trim detail than a British king?If it works to soothe the ego of our neighbour to the south, I won’t begrudge the King of Canada’s portrait on everything, rational or not.Jen Gerson is a Canadian commentator and co-founder of The Line.

This unsettling behaviour leaves women – artists and audience alike – feeling surveilledTue 27 May 2025 10.14 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 10.16 EDTShareKylie Minogue’s currentTension tour is a glorious spectacle. Dancers prowl around geometric staircases in weird hats, which feels delightfully Pet Shop Boys. There is a disco ball big enough to permanently dazzle every audience member. One visual shows a noirish film of Ms Minogue as a sort of heartbreak-vanquishing detective; a billboard in her rainy street scene incorporates the location of each tour date to ask: “Feeling lonely in Sheffield? Call Kylie …” And there she is in the middle of it all, resplendent in blue PVC; a spangly red jumpsuit; a kaftan-ish thing sewn together from what looks like neon police tape, emblazoned with the classic jagged Kylie heartbeat monitor logo.Kylie is one of our most generous performers: not above adding The Loco-Motion to the setlist following audience demand, its youthful silliness contrasted with Dancing, a gorgeous disco-country song about mortality. The expansiveness of the show made it all the more galling to be forced to partially witness it through the digital camera of the man sitting next to me, who spentthe entire gig– and I meanevery single second of it– training his priapic lens on Kylie through wobbly 10x zoom.Everyone has their phone out at gigs now, particularly big pop shows: it’s an unavoidable fact of live music. To look down from our side-stalls seats at any point during the show was to see a glittering of little rectangles, and that’s fine. Teenagers often get the blame for this, but Kylie’s is a fairly middle-aged crowd. I’m not immune either – I usually limit myself to a single gig pic, just so the event lives in my camera roll, but I took maybe a dozen of all the exciting set pieces.View image in fullscreenA crowd at a festival.Photograph: Mafalda/AlamyBut there is something profoundly creepy about Digital Camera Guy, a fixture of most gigs that feature a female performer. I’ve stood next to this – always middle-aged or older – man dozens of times, watching him maintain a shakily tight focus on the women on stage with his ancient silver Olympus, and wondering what on earth he’s going to do with those photos and footage later. Whether his intentions are sleazy or simply trainspottery, his ceaseless scrutiny feels unsettling for female and gender-nonconforming audience members and musicians.Digital Camera Guy’s lack of self-awareness makes people profoundly uncomfortableAs performers in a paid-for, public setting, they’re obviously there to be looked at, but there’s a difference between a reciprocal exchange with an understanding and respectful audience, and feeling monitored. The inference is that women only exist here to be surveilled, perceived as visual stimuli at best, sex objects at worst. It’s bad enough realising that someone is staring at you creepily in public – behaviour that has been prohibited on London’s public transport network since 2022 – let alone, I imagine, noticing yourself being watched so intently when you’re trying to stage a show on your own terms. In this dynamic, it’s the performer who generally commands the room, but the perpetually invasive lens undermines that power, reminding them that they’re nothing but an object to be captured.Kylie Minogue review – house, techno … doom metal? This is a thrilling reinvention of a pop deityRead moreI’ve spoken to plenty of female performers, some of them distressingly young, who hate the sight of DCG but feel they can’t speak out about him for fear of alienating paying fans or being perceived as ungrateful, uppity bitches. I’ve also spoken to several of my own male friends in their 40s and 50s who worry about being tarred with the same brush, who fear going to gigs alone or standing anywhere near the front in case they’re perceived as pervs who haven’t come to listen to the music. In case you think I’m overstating this, one of those friends texted me saying he’d stood next to a DCG atWet Legin London this weekend, and watched in horror as the man kept unabashedly zooming in on the band’s legs and bums.I’m sure most DCGs are not taking photos to get off to later (you’d have a job, through all the pixels). But either way, the lack of self-awareness makes so many other people in the crowd profoundly uncomfortable, leading them to question their entirely equal place in this environment. I felt icky every time I accidentally brushed the guy sitting next to me on Friday. I’ve had Kylie’s rapturous encore closer Love at First Sight as an earworm since then, but that feeling of unease is the thing I really can’t get out of my head. DCG: I beg you, stop it.Explore more on these topicsMusicSocial etiquetteKylie MinoguePop and rockSocial trendsMenWomencommentShareReuse this content"

Obviously not – as any dog owner would knowZoe WilliamsTake it from me: far from being fungible objects of love, canines and kids are the opposite of each other in so many waysTue 27 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 13.14 EDTShareSometimes, when surprising new findings are published, you can’t help but wonder why they asked that particular question, even as your interest is piqued by the answers. Last week,European Psychologist publisheda review of recent advances in pet research, and wrote: “Given the two trends of more dogs being viewed as family members and a decline in the number of children, an important question arises: are people choosing dogs as a substitute for children?”The authors concluded: well, sometimes. One study found that 16% of dog owners actively thought of their dogs as children; another commented on the frequency with which owners referred to themselves as “pet parents”, their best friends as “fur babies”. However,they also cautioned that, “contrary to popular belief, only a small minority of dog owners actually treat their pets like human children. In most cases, dog parents choose dogs precisely because they are not like children.”The authors are based in Hungary, where low birthrates have been a hot-button issue for ages. This has led to policies that hit peak Handmaid’s Tale this year, when the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced thatmothers of two children or morewould be exempted from paying income taxfor life. So this intervention was rather cheering – in the first place, for being entirely factual and not prescriptive, and in the second, for talking about dogs. Generally speaking, and very noticeably when it comes from Orbán, the low-birthrate conversation is just hard-right world-building, an illogical mix of being fiercely anti-immigration while simultaneously hand-wringing that you’re one generation away from having not enough people.In a life of ups and downs, we have come to cherish our dog’s uncomplicated love | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreBring dogs into it, and everything feels calmer, kinder – or, at least, it does if you love dogs. And those who do will never quite get what non-dog lovers object to about them, which is a good thing, because if they did – or should I say, if we did – this is a hill we’d definitely die on.If you have a dog and a child, or just a dog, or neither but have had a dog in the past and have also met children, you’ll know that, far from being fungible objects of love, they’re actually the opposite of one another. While once people talked about the history of canine domestication via the wolf, it has since emerged that dogs and wolves are not that similar, and as much as we domesticated dogs,they also domesticated us. They taught us how to commune with another species, surrender to the unknowable, driven by nothing more or less complicated than love. Dogs can also sit and, often, give you their paw. Children, by contrast, are completely untrainable, and by the time they have trained themselves in ways that are very surprising (this could never be said about a dog), they’ll be on their way. Which, again, is not a thing that dogs do.Speaking for myself, if I wanted to unlock this conundrum, I’d look elsewhere. Are birthrates going down because of declining living standards? Or to put that more simply: can anybody afford a baby? If we wanted to create societies conducive to large families, would we need to rediscover ambition in public services, and generosity in state support? Is there a pressing global pessimism, rooted in real and observable catastrophes such as inaction on the climate crisis and impotence in the face of conflict? Could it be that the world increasingly looks like an unlovely place for an infinitely precious and fragile human?And if I were absolutely determined to bring dogs into it – for instance, if I were a specialist in dog-human relationships – I would still lean towards the social determinants of pet ownership over parenting. This could focus on the availability of family care, and economic and time constraints, which the paper mentions briefly, rather than individual behaviours, such as mistaking your dog for a baby.The real reason dog ownership can’t be seen as fulfilling “a nurturing drive similar to parenting, but with fewer demands” (as the authors put it), is that it’s not actually easier than having children. If there’s any parallel, it’s with the very earliest years of child rearing, when they have no independent universe of their own, look to you as their sun and moon, and will put literally anything in their mouth just to see what happens.As much joy as there is in this phase, it’s easily the hardest bit. Considering this post-pandemic world, in which dog ownership, in the UK at least, is through the roof –3.2m pets were bought during lockdownalone – you realise how much people relish having demands on their time and affection.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionParents and parentingPetsAnimalsFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Time for a co-ordinated strategy to support progressive parties committed to electoral reformTue 27 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 05.42 EDTShareThis feels terminal. The breaches of trust have been so frequent, so vast and so decisive that the votersLabourhas already lost are unlikely to return. In one forum after another, I hear the same sentiments: “I voted for change, not the same or worse.” “I’ve voted Labour all my life, but that’s it for me.” “I feel I’ve been had.”It’s not dissatisfaction. It’s not disillusionment. It’s revulsion: visceral fury, anger on a level I’ve seldom seen before, even towards Tory cruelties. Why? BecausetheseareTory cruelties, delivered by a party that claimed to be the only alternative, in our first-past-the-post electoral system.Everyone can name at least some of the betrayals:cutting disability benefits;supplying weaponsand, allegedly,intelligence to the Israeli governmentas it pursues genocide in Gaza;channelling Reform UK and Enoch Powellin maligning immigrants; slashinginternational aid;trashing wildlifeand habitats whileinsulting and abusingpeople who want to protect them; announcing yet anotherdraconian anti-protest law; leavingtrans people in legal limbo; rigidly adhering to outdated and socially destructive fiscal rules; imposingfurther austerityon government departments and public services. Once the great hope of the oppressed, Labour has become the oppressor.Like many people, I was wary of Keir Starmer.I had limited expectations, but I willed Labour to succeed. So I’ve watched aghast as he and his inner circle have squandered one of the greatest opportunities the party has ever been granted. They seem to despise people who voted for them, while courting and flattering those who didn’t and won’t.The results? Last week, the polling company Thinks Insight & Strategy found that 52% of those who voted Labour in the 2024 general election areconsidering switching to the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. That’s more than twice as many as might migrate to Reform UK. The research group Persuasion UK estimates thatLabour could lose 250 seatsas a result of this flight to more progressive parties (again, more than twice as many as it could lose through voters shifting to Reform). Figures compiled by the progressive thinktank Compass show that Labour would lose its majority on justa 6% swing. Already, while it won a massive majority on a measly 34% vote at the election,it now polls at just 22%.Labour’s strategy is incomprehensible. Experience from the rest of Europe shows that when centrist parties adopt far-right rhetoric and policies, theyempower the far right while shedding their own supporters.What explains this idiocy? Labour has succumbed, quickly and hard, to the defining sickness of ourundemocratic political system: the sofa cabinet system of close advisers. Opaque and unaccountable government favours opaque and unaccountable power. Ever receptive to the demands ofrentiers,oligarchs,non-domsandcorporations, Labour’s oh-so-clever strategists are moronically giftwrapping the country for Nigel Farage.Governments don’t start conservative and turn radical. The cruelty will set like concrete. The likely result is annihilation in 2029. On this trajectory, it might not be surprising if Labour were left with seats in only double figures.Perhaps it’s a blessing that Starmer has shown his hand so soon, as we now have four years in which to prepare. I’m not a party person: for me, it’s a question of what works. And now we can clearly see the shape of it.The Compass analysis, published in December, reveals extreme electoral volatility. This is caused by a combination of public fury towards austerity, exclusion,rip-off rentsand startlinglylow rates of wellbeing, and the “democratic mayhem” resulting from a first-past-the-post system in whichfive parties are now polling at 10% or more. Small vote shifts in this situation can cause wild fluctuations in the allocation of seats.The report points out that the UK is an overwhelmingly progressive nation: inall but one election since 1979most voters have supported left or centre-left parties. Of 15 nations surveyed, the UK has the extraordinary distinction of being both the furthest to the left and the most consistent elector of rightwing governments. Why? Because of our first-past-the-post system, which is grossly unfair not by accident but by design. Labour refuses to change it, as it wants to rule alone. The result is that most of the time it doesn’t rule at all.The thinktank was hoping to mobilise the progressive majority around a revitalised Labour party, but that moment has passed. What the figures show, however, is massive potential for more radical change. A YouGov survey reveals thatalmost twice as many people want proportional representationin this country as those who wish to preserve the current system. So let’s build a government of parties that will introduce it.Here’s the strategy. Join the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP or Plaid Cymru. As their numbers rise, other voters will see the tide turning. Encourage troubled Labour MPs to defect. Most importantly, begin the process in each constituency of bringing alienated voters together around a single candidate. This is what we did before the last election in South Devon, where polls had shown the anti-Tory vote evenly split between Labour and the Lib Dems. Throughthe People’s Primarydesigned by locals, the constituency decided to back the Lib Dems. The proof of the method can be seen less in the spectacular routing of the Conservatives (as similar upsets occurred elsewhere) than in the collapse in Labour’s numbers, which fell from17% in 2019, and26% in a pollbefore the primary began, to6% in the 2024election. The voters took back control, with startling results.Whether you fully support any of these parties is beside the point. This coalition would break for ever the lesser-of-two-evils choice that Starmer has so cruelly abused, and which has for so long poisoned politics in this country. Game the system once and we’ll never have to game it again.No longer will we beheld hostage, no longer represented by people who hate us. It will be a tragedy if, as seems likely, Keir Starmer has destroyed the Labour party as a major political force. But it will be a blessing if he has also destroyed the two-party system.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectoral reformOpinionKeir StarmerLabourHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

It could also be a terrible missed opportunityBenjamin WeilVaccines that work need systems that work. Britain’s starved services must be supported to reach those most at riskTue 27 May 2025 07.32 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 11.11 EDTShareLast week, the UK announced a world first in sexual health programming: a vaccine that can protect against infection by gonorrhoea bacteria is to bemade availablein sexual health clinics across England, Scotland and Wales. Now comes the rollout – which will require avoiding the mistakes of the past to make sure it reaches those most in need.The vaccine has offered hope for intervention in an otherwise concerning landscape of increasing numbers of cases of gonorrhoea infection demonstratingresistance to treatment by antibioticsand with infection rates at theirhighest since records began.Although it can occur without noticeable signs of infection, for most peoplegonorrhoeawill be experienced as a set of uncomfortable symptoms, such as pain or fluid discharge in the genitals, anus, throat or even eyes. If left untreated, gonorrhoea can result in serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to infertility in people with a womb and ovaries (who areless likely to experience telltale symptomsin the first place).When it is launched in August, the gonorrhoea vaccine will first be offered to gay men, bisexual men and men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who,according to the most recent data, are the individuals most likely to test positive in the UK. Especially where resources are limited (ie in the real world of healthcare delivery), vaccination programmes are most successful when they are targeted to the groups or individuals at the highest risk of infection. Indeed, amodel produced by researchersin 2022 has suggested that a successful programme of gonorrhoea vaccination among GBMSM in England at the highest risk of infection could prevent more than 100,000 cases of gonorrhoea over 10 years and, crucially, save the NHS an estimated £7.9m. The predicted cost-saving of a gonorrhoea vaccination programme is particularly welcome for sexual health services in the UK that have faced upwards of£1bn in cutssince 2015.However, this decade of cuts poses a risk to the success of a gonorrhoea vaccination programme. For one, widespread divestments from sexual health have not been experienced homogeneously. Access to sexual health services, where these vaccines are given, is increasingly apostcode lottery. Even in better-resourced areas such as London, where rates of gonorrhoea transmission are highest, appointments at overstretched and underfunded clinics can be hard to come by and inconveniently timed.Research showsus that a de facto “first come, first served” model of appointment provision disproportionately favours people who are older and better off – who typically have more flexible schedules – and creates particular barriers for immigrants to the UK, who are less likely to have the cultural and linguistic fluency to navigate convoluted processes for accessing appointments.That said, even when appointments are available, many people will continue to experience enormous barriers to accessing services. First- or secondhand experiences of clinical and medical racism, distrust, fears of judgment and stigma, shame and avoidance, and a lack of access to culturally competent care and information collude to distance historically marginalised groups – especially Black communities in the UK – from in-person clinical settings. It is these very barriers that contribute to the disproportionate infection rates amongBlack communities– especially Black GBMSM, who are therefore among those in most urgent need of access to effective vaccinations.‘World-first’ gonorrhoea vaccine to be rolled out in England and WalesRead moreRecent successes combatingmpox outbreaksamong GBMSM, however, demonstrate for those from marginalised backgrounds, there are effective avenues to deliver vaccines other than just sexual health clinics. Since 2022, theLove Tank– a London-based nonprofit that works to improve the health and wellbeing of underserved communities – has worked hand in hand with NHS partners to provide vaccinations against mpox (and, among other diseases, Covid) in community settings in an attempt to deliver services to people less likely to access them in clinics. With pop-ups at sex-on-premises venues, community centres, queer bars, clubs, parties, sex shops and Pride events (including three years running atUK Black Pride), theseunder the radar (UTR) eventshave been able to deliver hundreds of vaccinations to people – mostly queer people of colour and queer immigrants – who would probably not otherwise have received them.The development of suitable and effective vaccines is always the first stage of a multi-faceted project of inoculation. Vaccines that work, biomedically speaking, require systems that work. The next steps are more funding for starved bricks-and-mortar services, and continued investment in creative and effective methods for delivering services direct to the community, and for the partners that can help achieve this.Benjamin Weil is a writer and researcher.

Sonay Kartal, meanwhile, continued her steady rise by beating Erika Andreeva 6-0, 6-2 to win on her main-draw debut.After victories forKatie Boulter, Emma Raducanu and Jacob Fearnley on Monday, this is the first time in the open era that three British men and three women have won first-round matches at Roland Garros, and the most British players into the second round since 1973.“I think it’s great and it shows that we’re not afraid of playing well on the clay,” said Draper. “All of them, [I have] great respect for, they all work really hard and they’re all great players. I’m not surprised, either, to be honest.”Draper returned to Paris for his third career appearance in a ­curious position. He has continued his ­incredible rise this year by finally breaking through on clay and entered Court Suzanne-Lenglen as a top‑five player at a grand slam tournament for the first time but still seeking his first French Open victory.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie said he felt his win against Medvedev was one of the best of his career.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersUnder those circumstances, his early nerves were not surprising. He struggled with his serve from the start and was ­tentative behind his usually destructive ­forehand. An explosive, dynamic and wildly entertaining player with ample variety, Bellucci rolled to a 5-1 lead before taking the first set 6-3 with the help of a sweet ­underarm serve. Draper, however, remained calm and was completely dominant by the end of the match. He will next face Gaël Monfils, who came from two sets down to beat Hugo Dellien late on Tuesday night.“When I lost the first set, I wasn’t panicking at all because I obviously came out slow, but then I was building my way back into the match in that first set,” said Draper. “Yeah, he’s going to have to play another two sets to beat me.”Norrie’s victory against ­Medvedev is one of the best wins at a grand slam tournament in his career. It also marked a first win against his Russian opponent after losing all four of their previous meetings in straight sets. Norrie had started the match extremely well, pairing his ­typical discipline, durability and ­consistency with greater aggression on his forehand.As Medvedev forced himself inside the baseline and began to ­dictate, Norrie lost control and the match flipped dramatically. Down 3-5 in the fifth set, though, ­Norrie locked down his game and found his way to an incredible escape, reeling off the final four games of the match to close out an excellent win. In round two, Norrie will face Federico Gomez, a lucky loser.Afterwards, ­Norrie described the win as one of the top three of his career. “Outside of Alcaraz, Sinner and Novak, [Medvedev] would be probably the fourth toughest draw for me in terms of match-ups and ­players,” he said. “Extremely good win, ­especially [considering] my record with him. What’s his ­ranking, 12 or 11 in the world? In a slam, best‑of-five, beating him in five sets is impressive for me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two weeks ago, the 29-year-old fell to No 91 in the rankings, his lowest since 2018.Norrie is an ambitious individual but in order to find his way again, he had to take a step back and detach himself from his intense expectations and simply enjoy tennis again. A turning point came after another easy first-round loss at the Miami Open in March.“After Miami, I felt I was ­trying too hard and forcing things too much,” he said. “I took some time, thought about everything in my career and my personal life and I think I was setting expectations too high. I talked to my team, a long ­meeting, just to try to enjoy the tennis a bit more and look for good moments.“I started winning straight after that and started watching matches back. I looked a lot more like myself on the court. [I thought] why not go and enjoy it, go and play and compete?

However, in light of the incident in Liverpool city centre on Monday, when 65 people were injured when acar drove into a crowdon Water Street, Slot and a senior delegation of Liverpool officials decided they should not attend.Visual guide to how the Liverpool parade collision unfoldedRead moreLiverpool cancelled all internal events after the incident and Slot felt it would be inappropriate to celebrate his achievements at the dinner. He sent a letter of apology to the LMA and event organisers in which he expressed his sadness at the horrific scenes that followed Liverpool’s trophy parade through the city.Slot wrote: “As you will know, a shocking incident took place in Liverpool yesterday, one that left dozens of men, women and children who had attended our parade injured and as a result I have had to withdraw from the event out of solidarity with all affected. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is one that I feel is absolutely right given the seriousness of the situation. I hope that I have your understanding in this regard.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the wider football community, including the LMA itself, the Premier League and many clubs who will be represented tonight, for the support we have received over the last 24 hours. Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this.“If you would indulge me, I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened. Along with the supporters and bystanders who helped one another in an hour of need, I think everyone involved in the aftermath deserves the gratitude of all of us.”The Liverpool head coach said he was “humbled” to be named Premier League manager of the season and honoured to be awarded the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy for the LMA Manager of the Year, particularly as the latter was voted for by his managerial peers.Slot said: “Sir Alex, I look forward to meeting with you at a later date to receive my trophy from you. I also look forward to attending my first LMA Annual Awards dinner on a future occasion. Thank you once again for your understanding and support.

The goalkeeper thought it was a one‑off, that she would be back, but she was omitted from the next squad, then the next, and it was not until Sarina Wiegman arrived as head coach that things took an upward turn. In that year away from the international game she thought she would never pull on the shirt again, and that took an emotional and mental toll.No one, least of all Earps, could have predicted what would lie ahead. Injuries to Karen Bardsley and Ellie Roebuck opened the door for Earps to start under Wiegman and she grabbed the opportunity. She went from third-choice goalkeeper at the 2019 World Cup in France and out in the cold in 2020 tothe No 1for the Lionesses at the home Euros in 2022.Her rise to prominence during a phenomenal run to afirst major international titlefor the senior women’s side was staggering. Fun and personable, her iconic hip swinging on the table after the players crashed Wiegman’s post-match press conference following the Euro 2022 final thrust her personality to the fore.With the spotlight comes responsibility and Earps rose to it, becoming a vocal and passionate advocate for goalkeeping and goalkeeper coaching, speaking candidly about the lack of proper coaching available to her generation of keepers for much of their careers and supporting efforts to increase the popularity of the position.View image in fullscreenMary Earps has found her playing time with England reduced in the last year.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThen, there was the challenging of the England sponsors Nike on the eve of the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. When asked about the lack of availability of replica women’s goalkeeper kits, she paused, clearly emotional and weighing up whether it was the right time to speak out, before launching into an impassioned plea for the sportswear giant to make a U-turn on their decision to not sell the kits. She said: “I can’t really sugarcoat this in any way, so I am not going to try. It is hugely disappointing and very hurtful.”She forced changein the months that followed.At that World Cup Earps shone on the pitch, collecting the Golden Glove after England endured heartbreak, losing 1-0 against Spain in the final. She earned the nickname “queen of stops” and footage of her expletive‑laden reaction after saving a penalty to keep the deficit to a single goal went viral.She was named Fifa’s best women’s goalkeeper in 2022 and 2023 for those tournament heroics andwon BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, she became the first women’s football player to have a waxwork at Madame Tussauds having won a public vote. She also launched her own line of T-shirts inspired by her speech when she won her first Fifa award in 2022, dedicating the win to “anyone who’s ever been in a dark place” before saying: “You can achieve anything you set your mind to. Sometimes success looks like this – collecting trophies – sometimes it’s just waking up and putting one step in front of the other. There’s only one of you in the world, and that’s more than good enough. Be unapologetically yourself.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps saves a penalty from Jenni Hermoso in the Women’s World Cup final.Photograph: Damian Briggs/Speed Media/ShutterstockIn recent months Earps has found her playing time with England reduced, with Chelsea’s Hannah Hampton preferred to the goalkeeper capped 53 times. It is a widely held view that Hampton is better with the ball at her feet, which suits the way England want to play, building out from the back. However, whether the talented 24-year-old, who has performed exceptionally well for Chelsea this season, will be able to match the stage presence, confidence and output of Earps on the biggest international stages remains to be seen.Earps’s international retirement comes as a shock, but it is understood to be something she has been considering and discussing with Wiegman for some time. The timing of the announcement, so soon before the European Championship, is unusual, and many would have liked to see the senior stateswoman steer England’s young keepers through the tournament. The reasons for the decision and its timing will no doubt come out in the future; what we can take some time to do now is appreciate and reflect on Earps’s commitment, passion and energy in an England shirt.Explore more on these topicsMary EarpsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

We know they’re going to be a tough, tough opponent but we’re always ready to play anyone.”Roland Butcher, child of Barbados, once of England and more recently a West Indies selector, has a less optimistic outlook: “We’re struggling, and the struggle is not over. We haven’t hit rock bottom yet.” The concentration of power across all three formats in the hands of one coach and selector – Daren Sammy – is what Butcher fears “is going to finally push us to the bottom”.Jimmy Anderson: ‘I know my body has got a certain amount of deliveries left in it’Read moreButcher’s knowledge of Caribbean cricket is broad and deep, with 15 years as head coach of the University of the West Indies sports academy, one serving on the national team’s selection panel alongside another familiar name in Desmond Haynes, and many commentating on matches around the region. He was appointed as a selector in December 2022 but dismissed a year later, with full control of the team eventually handed to Sammy, who picks and also coaches the senior side across all formats as of April this year.“In Desmond and myself you’ve got over 100 years of experience at the highest level, still capable, still wanting to contribute,” Butcher says. “I’ve moved on and Desmond has moved on as well, but we’ve got this knowledge, we want to help and they’re struggling.“It was a very left-field change, and not a change that I agree with. Not because I’m no longer a selector, it’s just not suitable for somewhere like the West Indies. In 2023, they had the best run they’ve had for 25 years in terms of results and for some reason they decided to make Daren the only selector and coach. I mean, madness. And it’s going to be tested already because they’re over here and then in a couple of weeks Australia is arriving for a Test series. I mean, how can you coach three teams? How can you be the only selector for three teams? It’s just absolute madness.Quick GuideAtkinson out of England ODIs against West IndiesShowEngland and Surrey seamer Gus Atkinson has been ruled out of the upcoming Metro Bank One-Day Internationals against the West Indies due to a right hamstring strain.Atkinson sustained the injury during England’s Rothesay Test victory over Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge last week. He will now undergo a period of rehabilitation under the supervision of the England medical team. No replacement will be added to the ODI squad.England, led by captain Harry Brook, will contest three ODIs with the series getting underway with the opening match on Thursday 29 May at Edgbaston.ODI squad:Harry Brook (Yorkshire) – CaptainTom Banton (Somerset)Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire)Jos Buttler (Lancashire)Brydon Carse (Durham)Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire)Tom Hartley (Lancashire)Will Jacks (Surrey)Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire)Jamie Overton (Surrey)Matthew Potts (Durham)Adil Rashid (Yorkshire)Joe Root (Yorkshire)Jamie Smith (Surrey)Luke Wood (Lancashire)Metro Bank ODIs1st ODI: England v West Indies, Thursday 29 May 2025, Edgbaston, Birmingham2nd ODI: England v West Indies, Sunday 1 June 2025, Sophia Gardens, Cardiff3rd ODI: England v West Indies, Tuesday 3 June 2025, Kia Oval, LondonWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“What they’ve done is they’ve said the chairmen of selectors in the territories – so in Barbados or in Trinidad – now becomes a talent scout as well. But there’s no selection process for them. The selector in Barbados, he’s a man in a full-time job. When does Sammy watch regional cricket? Desmond Haynes and myself, that’s all we did, watch cricket, all over the place. I was a youth selector as well so I’d be at the regional tournaments, under‑15, under-17, under-19, and I got to see all the young talent coming through. The talent scouts can’t do that. And they didn’t just get rid of the senior men’s selectors. The youth selectors as well, they changed that.”In Butcher’s year as a selector, the West Indies men’s side won 51% of their games, the only time this century they have won the majority of their matches across all formats in a calendar year. “When I left, I said to Desmond: ‘We were a success.’ There’s no other West Indian selector that has left and can say they were a success, they were always let go because the team failed,” he says. “We were a success. So that will always stay with me. The powers that be, they wanted to move to a different situation. But we were a success and we were on the right path. There’s no question about that. They can’t take that away.”West Indies have been affected by the proliferation of lucrative franchise leagues and their habit of distracting – or just taking – international players. “But I think England have started to experience what West Indies have experienced for the last 10 years,” Butcher says.“I don’t think many countries looked at what was happening with West Indies and ever thought: ‘You know what, this’ll happen to us too.’ For the last 10 years, West Indies teams have been weakened by domestic leagues and everybody was sitting back saying: ‘Oh, West Indies, they’re mercenaries.’ They didn’t think it would come home to roost.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It certainly doesn’t want for interesting stories: being brought up in poverty by his grandmother on Barbados’s east coast, being uprooted to join his parents in Stevenage, hoovering up trophies in a wonderful Middlesex side, becoming England’s first black player before having his international ambitions crushed by a serious eye injury, and going into and swiftly giving up on cricket coaching. “I found the English system too rigid. It was all from a book. I didn’t feel confident enough that I would be allowed to do what I thought should happen.” He turned instead to football, met a then-unknown Brendan Rodgers while studying for his Uefa B licence and was recruited by him to join Reading’s academy, before being left behind when Rodgers was headhunted by Chelsea and from there launched on a stellar coaching career.“If he hadn’t gone I think I would have stuck it longer,” Butcher says. “What pushed me out eventually was the fact that I knew John Barnes very well and he was having it really tough. He couldn’t get interviews, couldn’t get shortlisted, couldn’t get nothing. So after Brendan left, it dawned on me if guys of that level are struggling to make it professionally, it’s gonna be tough for me.”Now 71, Butcher has no intention of drifting away from cricket. He is very active as the president of Barbados Royals girls cricket club, the region’s first all-female club, and a patron of the Ace Programme, the British charity trying to drive engagement in the sport among underrepresented communities. “While I’m still capable physically and mentally to do something, I think I’ve got a lot to offer. I’m a cricket man and cricket has been my life.”Explore more on these topicsWest Indies cricket teamCricketinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has been told many of them were paid as little as £11,000 a year by Blackburn as they were employed on part-time contracts, with the PFA stepping in to provide financial assistance despite not having any formal obligation to do so.The PFA has approximately 250 female members, with some of the funding the union receives from the Premier League, English ­Football League and Football Association diverted to provide them with some basic services. Players in the WSL 2 have been ineligible to join the PFA, however, as the union lacks the resources to support them.WSL Football, the company responsible for running the top two tiers of the women’s game, is understood to have reached an agreement in principle with the PFA to provide a funding package that is expected to be signed in the next few weeks. Both parties are confident that all WSL 2 players will be PFA members by the start of next season, the first in which all clubs in the top two divisions will be fully professional.The Premier League pays around £25m a year to fund the PFA, which has more than 5,000 male members, and the WSL deal will be far smaller. However, as well as expanding the membership the PFA will use the money to offer female-specific ­services for the first time, particularly in areas such as rehabilitation, strength and conditioning, and ­medical research.Funding comprehensive union representation for players in both tiers was one of the key recommendations of the Raising the Bar review, the government-commissioned independent review of women’s football chaired by Karen Carney,which was published in 2023.Carney’s review also called for an improvement in the minimum standards criteria demanded by the WSL of all clubs in the top two divisions, including increased training time, the introduction of a minimum salary and the provision of a “gold standard” in physical and mental health services to all players.View image in fullscreenKaren Carney’s 2023 review of women’s football called for funding of union representation for players in the top two tiers.Photograph: S Meddle/ITV/ShutterstockWSL Football has moved to implement these higher minimum standards from next season, although the increased costs involved have proved too much for some clubs, with Blackburn deciding to withdraw from WSL 2. However, a source at one WSL 2 club said the new standards “are not particularly onerous”, and most clubs at that level budget for losses of between £750,000 and £1m each year.Blackburn’s owner, Venkys London Ltd, decided the cost was too high 12 months afterReading also withdrewfrom the second tier on financial grounds. Wolves also angered their players by not formally applying for promotion from the third tier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club committed to ­staying full-time with fully professional players after relegation and plan to play all their home games at Bramall Lane regardless of which division they are in.While WSL Football will make recommendations the final decision rests with the FA Board, which in the past has opted to give clubs reprieves from relegation. Lewes were given the option to stay in the second tier after Reading’s late withdrawal last summer, but had already released players and gone part-time following relegation so the Championship was reduced to 11 clubs.WSL Football and the PFA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballPFAnewsShareReuse this content"

A precious yet highly elusive chance to test one’s mettle against unknown opposition amid unfamiliar surroundings. For players, coaches and their respective clubs alike, this is where many believe true growth occurs.And it wasn’tjust Lisbonthat played host to these virtues this past weekend as a new dawn for women’s football arose in Asia. The final of the inaugural AFC Women’s Champions League took place in China with host club, Wuhan Jiangda,edging out Melbourne Cityafter a nerve-racking penalty shootout following a tight, and often physical, 120 minutes of playing time with the score tied at 1-1.The Wuhan manager, Chang Weiwei, could not have been prouder, lauding his side’s efforts after the game: “I have to thank the whole team for believing in the coaching staff and for emerging victories after a difficult journey,” the 47-year-old said.In the opposing dugout Michael Matricciani was magnanimous in defeat: “We love football for exactly these moments, sometimes it goes your way and sometimes it doesn’t,” he said. “I think we played extremely well for 120 minutes, especially towards the end.”The decisive save from the Wuhan goalkeeper Chen Chen sparked joyous celebrations as the hosts, who enjoyed home advantage thanks to the AFC’s decision to select their stadium as the venue for the semi-finals and final, took to the podium to lift the trophy against a backdrop of confetti and jubilant faces.View image in fullscreenThe Wuhan Jiangda players race towards their goalkeeper Chen Chen after their penalty shootout victory.Photograph: Wang HE/Getty ImagesThe triumph, however, is much more than just a moment of glamour and glitter because the occasion signals a new and promising era for the women’s game in Asia.As continental champions Wuhan’s participation in next year’s Women’s Champions Cup is now confirmed. They are also expected to be assigned one of three AFC berths for theinaugural Women’s Club World Cupin 2028 that was announced by the global governing body this year. Until now, cross-confederation competitions have been in all too short supply with teams having little means of testing their strength against clubs of vastly different football cultures. Fifa’s efforts to enhance global interconnectivity will surely go some way in bridging this gap.The prize money offered by the Asian Football Confederation for the Asian Women’s Champions League is equally significant. An eye-watering $1.3m (£960,000) was awarded to the winners, Wuhan, with each group-stage participant receiving $100,000. Incremental amounts are added to the team’s total purse as they progress through the competition until elimination.This is at a similar level to the $1.36m Arsenal received for winning the European Champions League, so the ambition Asia’s governing body has for its shiny new women’s club football competition is clear.Putting this into further perspective, Japan’s WE League awarded its champions, Tokyo Verdy Beleza, $140,000 this season. In the Champions League this amount would be surpassed once a team secures group-stage qualification to go into the quarter-finals with the eventual winners taking home nearly 10 times that of the champions of one of Asia’s top leagues.However, it remains to be seen how these funds are used as it is discretional. The notion is that it is to aid the development and sustainability of women’s football at local level, but there is seemingly no framework in place to ensure the trickle-down effect runs its course.As a spectacle the event went some way in serving as a showcase tournament for women’s club football in Asia. A record crowd of 18,715 attended the final with 4,977 out for the host club’s semi against Ho Chi Minh City. The non-centralised quarter-finals also saw 3,243 fans turn out at the Kumagaya Athletic Stadium, just north of Tokyo, as Urawa Reds Ladies also fell victim to Wuhan’s penalty kick prowess. Naturally the numbers are not as impressive at the start of the tournament but overall they do stack up respectably when compared with other continental competitions.Meanwhile, the present reality of women’s football on the Asian continent must be viewed with a balanced lens. The majority of domestic competitions fall into the category of what many would class as “developing leagues” with issues such as player welfare and commercial viability paling in comparison to the top leagues of Europe and North America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He moved to Paris-based Racing 92, but it has proved a testing campaign for him in terms of injuries and Stuart Lancaster left as head coach in January.The Breakdown | Trash-talk and rough sleeping: following the 2001 Lions’ tour of AustraliaRead moreAsked about any possibleSaracensreturn, McCall said: “It’s just not worth answering, to be honest, because as far as I know he is under contract at Racing and has a year left. There are so many of these stories that come out. As you know from me down the years, there is no point talking about something that is so pie in the sky. It’s ­better for me not to comment.”McCall did say he would be surprised if the 33-year-old’s rugby future did not lie in coaching. Saracens are close to appointing a new attack specialist after Kevin Sorrell announced he would leave the club when this season finishes.While McCall said Farrell had not been interviewed for that post, he sees clear coaching credentials in the 112-cap former England captain. “I would be very surprised if he didn’t commit to coaching, to be honest,” McCall said. “Rugby is in his skin. He has got a great IQ and a passion and love for it, like his dad [Andy Farrell]. I would be absolutely amazed if that wasn’t what he wanted to do. But I can tell you it won’t be him who will be our next attack coach. He hasn’t been interviewed. He is a player for now, and has 14 months left on his contract with Racing.”Farrell’s former England teammate, theLeicesterprop Dan Cole, has announced he will retire at the end of this season. The 38-year-old, England’s second-most capped men’s player with 118, will hang up his boots at the conclusion of Leicester’s campaign.Cole featured in four World Cups, reaching the final in 2019, and has won four Premiership titles with Leicester. He also toured twice with the British & Irish Lions. The veteran said his decision was influenced partly by that of Ben Youngs, his longtime teammate for club and country, who is also retiring.Cole told Leicester’s website: “It has not been an easy decision at all. I have been to-ing and fro-ing – however, I think this is the best time for me to finish playing. I believe with Ben Youngs, Julián Montoya and others that are in and around my age ending their time at the club at the end of the season, plus the new chapter next season with Geoff Parling coming in as head coach, it’s time for the club to kick on and the right time for me to go.“As you get older, physically, it’s definitely harder to carry on and, looking around the changing room, I am 10 years older than most of the guys in there with me and that’s challenging as well. I don’t want to be the old guy, just sat around and hanging on to something for too long.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His speech is another wake-up call for Sir Keir Starmer’s governmentTue 27 May 2025 13.33 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 14.01 EDTShareLast July,concludinghis election victory speech after winning in Clacton, Nigel Farage announced that after inflicting grievous damage on the Conservative party that night, Reform UK would now “be coming for Labour”. Since then, on issues such as thenationalisationof Britain’s beleaguered steel industry, Mr Farage has carefully positioned his party as sympathetic to working-class concerns and fears. His heavily-trailedspeechon Tuesday, in Westminster, was the most direct attempt yet to present himself as a new spokesperson for Labour’s traditional blue-collar voters.The most talented and cynical political opportunist of his generation, Mr Farage knows where the openings lie. Labour has tied itself in unedifyingknotsover its deeply unpopular cuts to the winter fuel allowance, and agonised over reversing the Tories’ two-child benefit cap. Mr Farage simply marched his party into the vacant political space where a centre-left party should be. Even if the government belatedly U-turns on both issues, Reform will be able to claim to have blazed the trail.Understandably, Labour figures haveground their teethat airy promises of largesse to the less well-off, and pointed to the Reform leader’s track record. There was no serious effort on Tuesday to make any of the sums add up by addressing the fiscal implications of a huge tax overhaul. There are also, of course, compelling grounds to doubt that Mr Farage’s conversion to egalitarian politics is wholly sincere. Sinceenteringpolitics as a privately educated former stockbroker, he has been a Thatcherite advocate of low tax, low regulation and privatising the NHS. More Jacob Rees-Mogg than Aneurin Bevan, in short.But cries of cosplay, and allegations of “unserious” politics, will not suffice. Before partygate, the Eton-educated Boris Johnson did not do too badly by indulging in both. Mr Farage will not expect SirKeir Starmerto take up his invitation to pay a joint visit to a working men’s club. But he does spy a working-class route to power.As is increasingly clear, Reform’s leader views a form of rightwing communitarianism as the means to weld together the kind of shire and town coalition thatwon the Brexit referendum. This means performatively pivoting to the left on some economic issues, in the hope of attracting less well-off Labour voters into his authoritarian anti-immigrant project. It is the same kind of politicalrealignmentthat Marine Le Pen has pursued, with some success, in France.As Reformcontinuesto score significant polling leads, eclipsing the moribund Tories, Labour badly needs a progressive strategy that can adequately respond. At the next election, it will need the support of the blue-collar voters Mr Farage hopes to seduce, as well as public sector professionals and liberal graduates in university towns and cities. Yet for now an unattractive combination of economic timidity, cuts and courting the anti-migrant vote has seen it simultaneouslylosesupport to Mr Farage, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.There is another way. Policies such as the public ownership of utilities, and the introduction of wealth taxes in an ever more unequal society, enjoy broad support both among blue-collar voters and in Labour’s urban strongholds. That suggests a broadergroundswellof support for a more expansive social democratic approach – one that can deliver a more collectivist and equal society without embracing the xenophobia and extreme social conservatism that defines Mr Farage and his movement.Last week, Sir Keir told his party’s MPs to view Reform as their “main rivals for power”. A different, nastier Britain may await, if Mr Farage’s attempt to park his tanks on Labour’s working-class lawns is not taken by the party as a final warning.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But theaccountsgiven to the Guardian by three mothers of sons who are currently in HMP Swinfen Hall, in Staffordshire, offer a disturbing insight into the exceptionally high levels of violence that have become normalised.Their descriptions of “constant fear”, casual knifings and “drugs and knives everywhere” are chilling. Two of the women said that they agreed with the decision to jail their sons. But reading their testimony, which echoes the findings of a recent prison inspectoratesurvey, it is impossible to believe that any rehabilitative purpose is being served. The suggestion by one of the women that her son is becoming more violent rather than less due to the conditions rings alarmingly true, and is in line with the conclusion of David Gauke’s independent review of sentencing that prisons arefailing to reduce reoffending.Men’s prisons are often dangerous places, with last month’sattack on prison officersby Hashem Abedi at HMP Frankland just one example of the risks faced by staff as well as inmates. In parts of theyouth justice estate– which holds those aged up to 21 in young offender institutions (YOIs), secure training centres and council-run secure children’s homes – the problem is particularly acute.The state’s special responsibility towards children, and the importance of providing second chances to those convicted when young, means this failing system requires an action plan of its own. Of the current youth custody population, 53% are minority ethnic and 63% have spent time in care.Ministers agreed in Marchthat girls would no longer be held in YOIs, following another report. But as 97% of young people in jail are male, they are the bigger problem.Overcrowding is not an issue in youth prisons as it is in adult ones. But the lack of suitable educational provision for a group of young men who desperately need it, more than half of whom have special needs, is nothing short of tragic. So is the amount of time that many spend locked in their cells.Staff shortages are one reason why violence is so out of control that ministers recently agreed to theuse of pepper sprayin some circumstances. The rate of assaults on staff, which is 14 times higher than in men’s prisons, can partly be explained by the fact that more than two-thirds of those in YOIs are there for violent offences. But it is clear from recent inspection reports that the number of “keep-aparts”, who are not allowed to mix due to the risk of fights, is unsustainable.The youth custody population is less than a quarter of what it was 15 years ago, so there has been progress as well as decline. Since the threshold for custody has been significantly raised, these institutions are bound to be challenging places. But Mr Gauke’s review noted that young people’s impressionable natures mean that they have both a higher rate of reoffending than adults and also higher potential to desist. As ministers plan their sentencing reforms, boys in custody must not be written off.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A spokesperson for the White House said in a statement: “President Trump is confident in the secretary’s ability to ensure top leadership at the Department of Defense shares their focus on restoring a military that is focused on readiness, lethality, and excellence.”White House spurred by rumorsThe skepticism among the Trump advisers is widely seen as a product of several developments that started shortly after the suspensions of Caldwell and Selnick on 15 April, followed by the suspension of Carroll on 16 April, according to seven people familiar with the matter.After the aides were fired on 18 April and issued a joint statement denying wrongdoing, the White House received its first briefing on the firings.At that juncture, a handful of Trump advisers in the West Wing and elsewhere were told there was evidence that Caldwell had printed a document on US military plans for the Panama canal classified at the top secret level, took a photo, and sent it to a reporter using his personal phone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBut the advisers grew uneasy in the ensuing weeks after Caldwell appeared on the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s podcast, denouncing their firings as the product of internal office politics at the Pentagon and alleging that the investigation had become weaponized against them.They also then learned of a rumor at the Pentagon that the air force office of special investigations (OSI), which had been working the case for weeks beforehand, had possibly identified the leaked Panama canal document by virtue of the fact that it was a draft that lacked certain details that were in the final version of the document.As the rumor went, the document had led the air force OSI to focus its investigation on mid-level aides who worked in the US Southern or Central Command or for the joint chiefs of staff, and had not been told to focus on the activities of the three aides until the weekend after they had been fired.It was not immediately clear whether the the rumor was correct or even from where it emerged. But it appears to have spurred the White House to press Parlatore to disclose the evidence against Caldwell, including how the Pentagon knew what was on his phone.At first, Parlatore rebuffed the attempts to obtain the underlying evidence, noting it was inappropriate for the executive branch to insert itself into an ongoing criminal investigation that he said could still yield charges.But towards the end of April, according to what the Trump advisers shared inside the White House, Parlatore suggested that there had been a warrantless wiretap on Caldwell’s phone.Parlatore has denied making such a claim when confronted by associates, and has generally maintained during the investigation that he has only passed along information briefed to him by others. Reached by phone on Monday, Parlatore referred questions to the Pentagon press office.Still, the Trump advisers who reeled from the claim also eventually told Hegseth they were concerned by the optics of Parlatore, who had been close to the former chief of staff Kasper, running an investigation that targeted Kasper’s perceived enemies in the office.The warrantless wiretap episode was not formally resolved. The investigation was transferred to the office of the deputy defense secretary, Stephen Feinberg, around the time that Parlatore had planned to step away to prepare for the trial of another client, Adm Robert Burke, on federal bribery charges.Parlatore remains a close confidant of Hegseth and he retained his ability to make recommendations in the investigation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Commissioned by Hegseth as a commander in the navy reserve, he is subject to the uniform code of military justice and cannot be directly fired.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPete HegsethUS national securityUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The speech is written by the prime minister’s office in consultation with staff at the king’s office.1:38King Charles tells Canadian parliament that country will stay 'strong and free' – videoThe king made no direct reference to Trump but his language was closely watched for implicit criticisms of the US president and his dramatic recasting of the US relationship with Canada.“Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect,” said Charles, telling attenders, that by “staying true to Canadian values”, the country could “build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians”.The king alluded to efforts to ease tensions with the US. “The prime minister and the president of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the US, rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.”Sitting next to Queen Camilla, the king also alluded to the last time a monarch opened a new parliament nearly seven decades earlier, when his late mother visited Ottawa.Queen Elizabeth said during her 1957 speech that “against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself”. Charles said that he took great pride in the way in which “Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.”The symbolic visit came as Canadians remain uncertain of what role they want the monarchy to play in the future. In 2023, polling firm Ipsos polling found nearly 70% of Canadians said the royal family should not play a prominent role in Canadian society. But that figure has dropped to 56%in new polling released Tuesday, showing a warming towards the monarchy, in part due to a deteriorating relationship with the US.Crown questions to fore as king visits Canada amid tensions with TrumpRead moreStill, not every party in parliament supported the presence of Charles. The separatist Bloc Québécois was absent – as they typically are during the speech – in protest of the address by a “foreign king”.“To assert Canada’s sovereignty, we seek the symbol of the fact that Canada has the King of England as its sovereign,” said leader Yves-François Blanchet in the days leading up to the speech. “There is a complete inconsistency which seems to reflect [prime minister Mark]Carney’s personal sympathies rather than a relevant reading of Quebec’s sensibility.”Representatives of Inuit, Métis and First Nations peoples were present in the senate after welcoming the king to Ottawa on Monday. Indigenous leaders have described the visit as a meaningful reminder of the centuries-long bond between Canada’s first inhabitants and the British crown – the two signatories of the many treaties which created the foundations of what would later become Canada.“The King’s visit is an opportunity to highlight the nation-to-nation relationship between First Nations and the Crown. We are allies with a sacred perpetual relationship that cannot be broken,” Assembly of First Nations national Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak said in a statement. “The British Crown and First Nations are foundational to the creation of Canada. We also are distinct nations bound together by peace and friendship.”Woodhouse Nepinak said Charles, as King of Canada, “carries a responsibility to uphold the Treaties that protect our rights”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

The trial is also estimated to prevent up to 1,400 tonnes of CO2 being emitted, helping to save up to £14m in running costs.Alina Sartogo, one of the co-founders of Zest, which developed the tool, said all the food waste it identified was edible, but not sellable at a profit for the manufacturers. For example, the waste might include a broken KitKat bar, or a product with an expiry date that’s too short to sell on to retailers.The Zest software could be expanded across the food supply chain on a subscription basis by March next year, following a series of pilots with different manufacturers.A second pilot with Nestlé has recently been launched after receiving funding from the government agency Innovate UK’sBridgeAIscheme, which provides a £1.9m match-funded grant for AI projects.Esra Kasapoglu, director of AI and data economy at the agency, said the project represented a“solution that aims to transform food sourcing and distribution across the UK, cutting waste, reducing carbon emissions, and lowering costs”.About4.6m tonnesof edible food, equivalent to 10bn meals of food, is wasted in the UK each year.Simon Millard, director of food at the charity FareShare, said the technology would“make a huge difference” to its work to redistribute food to more than 8,000 charities and community groups across the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose by 31.3%. Total car registrations rose most for the Chinese state-owned manufacturer SAIC, owner of the British brand MG, and the Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi.This year sales at Tesla have fallen in some of its biggest markets and there have beenpolitical protests at some of its showrooms. In the UK, the company registered just 512 new vehicles in April, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, down 62% from a year earlier.1:28Global protests against Tesla CEO Elon Musk – videoSpeaking at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk told Bloomberg that while Europe was Tesla’s weakest market, it was “strong everywhere else”, and although it had “lost some sales paths on the [political] left”, it had “gained them on the right”.Tesla reported a 13% drop in vehicle sales in the first three months of this year, which made itthe worst quarter since 2022. However, shares in Tesla have rallied by about 25% in the past month, after reports that Musk will bereducing his time spent advising the Trump administration.

But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US – clean energy development.Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling hill country near Menard, west of Austin, and has seen the income provide opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is one of thepoorestcounties in Texas.But a barrage of bills working their way through the Republican-held Texas legislature threaten to reverse the state’s position as the US’sclean energy superpower, even curtailing cherished private property rights by limiting a landowner’s ability to host wind and solar farms.The bills come as Trump has ramped up anti-renewable rhetoric on the national stage,callingwind turbines “ugly” and “disgusting” andbarringmajor clean energy projects on federal lands and waters. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” Trump, who has enjoyed strongelectoral support from farmers, said shortly after being inaugurated as president.This backlash has left many conservatives, such as Davis, bewildered, withrecent polling showingthat most Republican voters in Texas oppose moves to squash the state’s booming renewable energy sector. While climate campaigners see renewables as a crucial replacement for thefossil fuels that are overheating the planet, places such as Menard county, Texas – where Trump won more than 80% of the vote in last year’s election – are more inclined to weigh other factors.Left: printed pictures showing a career in politics.

When you tell me what to do on my own property that sounds more like a Democrat,” Davis said. “Some of the bills they are trying to pass would kill renewables.”I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some pointHoppy Murchison, rancherDavis retired as state legislator in 2015 to spend more time on his ranch but has lately been donning a suit and traveling back to Austin to urge his former colleagues to reject the anti-renewables bills. “I testify as a conservative and say: ‘What are you guys doing? Have you lost your mind?’” he said. “Some of these bills are attacking battery storage of all things. How dumb is that? It’s sacrificing your core conservative value principles in order to protect the oil and gas industry.”Texas’s traditional image may be of cowboy hats, steers and nodding oil wells, but in reality, the state today could just as easily be associated with solar panels, windmills and Teslas. Texas’s combined wind and solar poweroutputisnearly doublethat of its closest rival, California, ittripledthe amount of new battery storage added last year compared with 2023 and is leading the way in emerging alternatives such as geothermal. This year, a third of all new renewable and storage projects in the USwill be built in the Lone Star state.“We are still firmly an oil and gas state and producing more than we ever have but that’s not the full picture,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University ofTexas. “We produce and consume more energy than any other state, we have more wind than the next four states combined and regularly have more than 50% of our grid running on renewables. We are an energy state.”View image in fullscreenA few of John Davis’s wind turbines spinning and generating energy on his ranch.The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, isgrowingfor the first time since the 1960s.

Rhodes’sresearch has foundexisting clean energy projects in Texas will pay more than $12bn in taxes to communities where they are located, funding schools, roads and hospitals, while paying out another $15bn to landowners to lease their properties.“It’s a hard life out here, there’s rocks, mesquite and coyotes and not a lot else – if there’s anything to make life easier, do it,” said Davis as he stood on his property under the whooshing blades of a wind turbine, one of a ragged line of turbines that make up the Cactus Flats wind project. “See any dead birds here? I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints,voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.Places such as Menard, located in central Texas between two large oil and gas regions, have limited options for new income. Davis has several hundred goats and sheep and raises cattle for wagyu beef on his 1,300-acre property, but 40% of his income now comes from the wind turbines, money he hopes he can push back into the sleepy Menard community.“I struck wind!” said the ebullient Davis, who likes to restyle Trump’s“drill, baby, drill” mantrainto “turn, baby, turn” in recognition of his wind turbines. “I done turned the money into my back ass pocket,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohn and his wife, Jayne Davis.Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them. “I think they look angelic now,” he said. Another nearby rancher, Hoppy Murchison, who has a drooping handlebar moustache, cowboy hat and checked shirt, is less enamored with their appearance and mostly subscribes to Trump’s worldview.“But for me it made too much sense to not do it,” said Murchison, who now has several wind turbines on his own property, providing him a stable income. “I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some point.”For leaders of poorer counties such as Menard, the aesthetics of wind turbines are beside the point. “I literally have hungry children in my community, so I’m not turning my nose up at any kind of financial windfall,” said Brandon Corbin, the local Republican county judge. Corbin estimates that a proposed battery facility in the county could add as much as 30% to Menard’s stretched annual budget of $5m.“It’s not productive or helpful when he spouts off like that,” Corbin said of Trump’s comments on wind and solar. “We are the ones on the ground here and he says and does things that puts fear and uncertainty out.”View image in fullscreenA home in Menard, Texas, has a propane tank connected in the front yard.But senior Republicans in Washington have sought to ape Trump, pushing forward a budget plan thatstrips awayincentives for clean energy and electric cars. Meanwhile, in Texas, there arethreestatebillsthat would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.One that has already passed the Texas senate,SB819, calls for the “police power of the state” to drastically limit new wind and solar projects by requiring permits not needed for gas, coal or nuclear plants. A wind turbine would have to be 3,000ft from a neighbor’s property line, compared with just 467ft for an oilwell.To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oilwells in Texas is just absurdDoug Lewin, energy industry expert“I’ve heard from many constituents with valid concerns regarding the reckless installation of these facilities,” said Lois Kolkhorst, a Texas state senator and one of the bill’s sponsors. Kolkhorst, a Republican who calls herself a “lifelong wildlife conservationist” said the legislation would provide “a reasonable approach to the recent proliferation of wind and solar facilities encroaching across Texas with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment”.While most Republicans don’t share such enmity towards renewables, Kolkhorst has some powerful and wealthy allies, including theTexas Public Policy Foundation thinktankand theStewards of Texasgroup, which opposes new clean energy development. The latter group hastiesto Dan Friedkin, a billionaire businessman whose interests include owning hotels and whose roles include being the executive producer of the Paramount showLandman(which includes anotable scenecritiquing clean energy) as well as being the owner of the soccer clubs Everton and Roma.left: two gas pumps, right: four large white propane tanksLeft: Vintage gas pumps at the Station, a 24/7 community store owned by the Davisies, offering free beverages operated by the honor system.

Should the bills pass, 15% of Texas’s wind fleetcould shutter, raising energy prices to the point that the typical household’s electricity bill would increase by $225 a year, according to one estimate.“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.“We desperately need new energy supply, and if we’re saying, ‘No, we don’t want the sources that can be deployed the fastest’ for ideological reasons, then the economy will stagnate.View image in fullscreenJohn Davis laying out feed for his herd of goats while his wind turbines work in the background.“Some people have just decided that renewables are bad and they will fight them. To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oilwells in Texas is just absurd.”While the fate of clean energy support in the federal budget will come down to how many moderate Republicans will fight to preserve theinvestment flowing to their districts, in Texas the main decider could be time itself. The Texas legislative session ends on 2 June and should the bills get gummed up enough in the system, Davis hopes they will be beaten by the clock, at least until next year’s session.“The system is set up to kill bills, to have less government,” he said. “So there’s a lot of advantages we have to kill these bills. We want to keep them bottled up. Delay, delay, delay.”"

While sunlight can reach a kilometre beneath the waves, in practice there is little below 200 metres.This upper band of water is where microscopic plant-like organisms called phytoplankton photosynthesise. The organisms underpin virtually all marine food webs and generate nearly half the planet’s oxygen. Many fish, marine mammals and other creatures hunt, feed and reproduce in the warmer waters of the photic zones where food is most abundant.Davies and his colleagues drew on satellite data and an algorithm used to measure light in sea water to calculate the depths of photic zones around the world. Darkening affected 21% of the global ocean in the 20 years to 2022. In 9% of the ocean, this led to photic zones being 50 metres shallower, while in 2.6% of the ocean, the zones were 100 metres shallower. Details of this study appear inGlobal Change Biology.The oceans darken when light finds it harder to penetrate the water. It is often seen along coastlines where upwellings of cold, nutrient rich water rise to the surface, and where rainfall sweeps nutrients and sediments from the land into the water.The drivers for darkening far offshore are less clear, but global heating and changes in ocean currents are thought to be involved. “The areas where there are major changes in ocean circulation, or ocean warming driven by climate change, seem to be darkening, such as the Southern Ocean and up through the Gulf Stream past Greenland,” Davies said.Scientists seek to save Florida’s dying reefs with hardy nursery-grown coralRead moreDespite an overall darkening, about 10% of the ocean, or 37 million sq km, became lighter over the past 20 years, the study found. Off the west coast of Ireland, for example, a very large area of ocean has brightened, but further out it has darkened.“Marine organisms use light for a whole variety of purposes. They use it for hunting, for mating, for timing reproductive events. They use it for basically every single part of their biology,” said Davies. “With ocean darkening, they have to move up the water column, and there is less space, they’re all being squished up towards the surface.”Prof Oliver Zielinski, the director of the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research in Germany, said the darkening of vast ocean areas was a “worrying trend”.“Such changes can disrupt marine food webs, alter species distributions, and weaken the ocean’s capacity to support biodiversity and regulate climate,” he said. “Coastal seas, being closest to human activity, are particularly vulnerable, and their resilience is crucial for both ecological health and human wellbeing.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeOceansWildlifeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Phillips had completed less than half of it at the time of his death.“Finishing it was important to show that Dom and Bruno’s voices were not silenced,” saidPhillips’ widow, Alessandra Sampaio, who oversaw the project.Meanwhile, a new Guardian podcast series,Missing in the Amazon, will be released on 5 June to mark the third anniversary oftheir murders in the remote Javari valley region.The podcast is the fruit of a three-year investigation by Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin American correspondent, who joined the 10-day search for Dom Phillips and Pereira after they vanished in June 2022.“When discussing the case, everybody talked about the British journalist and the Brazilian Indigenous expert, but I don’t know if we ever really found out so much about who these men were,” said Phillips.Bruno Pereira and Dom Phllips were killed in the Amazon. Their Indigenous allies risk death to carry on the workRead more“I don’t think we ever heard so much from the people who loved them, cared about them and respected them – about who they were, where they came from, why they were doing what they were doing. And that’s something that we’ve tried to make a big part of the podcast,” he added.“This podcast is about Dom and Bruno – told by the people who knew them best, many of whom are speaking for the first time,” said Nicole Jackson, the Guardian’s global head of audio.“It’s also the story of what Dom and Bruno cared so much about: the Amazon and the Indigenous people who are trying to protect it. It’s about their future and the future of the world’s biggest rainforest.”Pereira and Phillips wereambushed and killednear the Amazon town of Atalaia do Norte while returning from a reporting trip to the edge of theJavari valley, one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. Soon after the men’s remains were found, Sampaio and some of Phillips’s closest friends decided to complete his unfinished book.“Everybody deals with grief differently and, in this case, it was grief mixed with horror and anger,” said Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, who helped plan the project, alongside Sampaio, Phillips’ literary agent, Rebecca Carter, and the journalists Andrew Fishman, David Davies and Tom Hennigan.“Everyone knew that this book had to be finished,” said Fishman, a co-founder of the Intercept Brasil. “It would be completely unthinkable to let what happened to them be the end of Dom’s project.”The first step in the process was understanding how much Phillips had already written.Sampaio handed Fishman a black suitcase that had belonged to her husband, filled with reporter’s notebooks, laptops, old mobile phones and external hard drives.“Dom was extremely organised, but not the greatest at encryption. So it was relatively easy to get all his work together,” he said.Phillips’s notes, however, proved more challenging, due to his idiosyncratic handwriting; in the end they had to be “translated” by one of his sisters, Sian, and an old friend, John Mitchell.It was an extraordinarily healing and uplifting process to get to know these people ... We were suddenly very much united by his lossRebecca Carter, Phillips’s literary agentOnce they were able to review the material, the editorial team concluded that Phillips had completed the introduction and three and a half chapters – and left notes and outlines for another six.The team decided the work should be completed by reporters who had known Dom and were also experts in covering the Amazon, selecting Tom Phillips, the Brazilian reporter Eliane Brum, former Reuters reporter Stuart Grudgings and the New Yorker’s Jon Lee Anderson.The Indigenous leader Beto Marubo and activist Helena Palmquist wrote the afterword.“It was an extraordinarily healing and uplifting process to get to know these people – these friends of Dom’s who I had had no connection with before,” said Carter, to whom Phillips first pitched the book in 2020. “We were suddenly very much united by his loss – and also the determination to make this happen.”All of the contributors waived their fees, but to cover the costs of logistically complex reporting trips to the Amazon, the book relied on a fellowship from the Alicia Patterson Foundation (awarded to Phillips in 2021), grants from Whiting Creative and the Fund for Investigative Journalism, a donation from Teresa Bracher, and support from hundreds of crowdfunding backers.Other journalists volunteered to edit the manuscript, and photographers contributed their images to the book. Dozens more supported the project in other ways – from factchecking to helping with outreach and social media.Although it is Phillips’s book, Pereira is an essential character. The two men first met in 2018 during areporting trip to the Javari for the Guardian, and Dom deeply admired Bruno’s work.Investigations concluded thatthe killers had targeted Pereirain retaliation for his efforts to combat illegal fishing – often backed by organised crime – in the Javari valley.The murders took place during the environmentally catastrophic 2019-2023 administration of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who was widely criticized for his sluggish response to the disappearances of Phillips and Pereira and called their trip “an ill-advised adventure”.A deadly mission: how Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira tried to warn the world about the Amazon’s destructionRead moreSince defeating Bolsonaro in the 2022 election, the leftist presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvahas made the Indigenous cause and the Amazon priorities, launching major operations to evict illegal miners from areas such as the Yanomami and Kayapó territories and achieving a major reduction in deforestation.However, Marubo – who was close friends with Pereira and works for the Javari valley Indigenous association – said that despite noticeable improvements since Bolsonaro’s departure, Lula’s effortswere still falling short: “You can’t fight illegality and the spread of organised crime with two or three isolated operations … We need government action that is continuous and coordinated,” he said.“Unfortunately, if Dom and Bruno were working here today, they would be killed again,” he said.Three local men were later charged with their murders, while a fourth has been charged withordering the crime. All are in custody awaiting trial.“I strongly believe in justice,” said Sampaio, Phillips’s widow. “We hope for things to move more quickly, but my lawyers have told me that the case is progressing as it should,” she said.Sampaio, Marubo and other book contributors have travelled to the UK to take part in launch events at theHay festival (31 May), inLancaster (3 June)and inLondon (5 June).“It makes me very happy that the book has been completed,” said Sampaio. “We carry on with the sadness, but we carry on because we must.”How to Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answersis published in the UK, US and Brazil on 27 May.

They climb into Mexican fishing boats and race out into the windy blue bay, cameras at the ready. The fishers turned tour guides follow a couple of ocean safari yachts, which follow directions from pilots sent up in spotter planes. The goal of this 40-boat cavalcade? To enable swimming with orcas in the wild.Swimming with orcas in Mexico falls into a legal grey area as it exploitsloopholes in two Mexican lawsthat protect endangered marine wildlife. This has become particularly problematic in the past five years since selfies with the whales on social media have led to an increase in the number of people wanting to try the activity.View image in fullscreenEvans Baudin, the owner of Cabo Shark Experience, swims with an orca in Baja California Sur.Photograph: Steve Woods“We thought it was a great thing at the beginning but it has become kind of a nightmare,” says Evans Baudin, the owner of Cabo Shark Experience who estimates he has taken 1,500 people to swim with orcas over the past nine years. “It’s completely out of control. Since there are no authorities or rules, anyone can do whatever they want.”Local fishing boats, some without insurance or the proper licences, are competing with the bigger foreign-owned companies based in the nearby cities of Cabo San Lucas or La Paz. Some of these companies are guaranteeing tourists the chance to swim with orcas and are pulling out all the stops to keep that promise.Whoever tourists book with, the result is the same: increasing numbers of people are swimming or freediving with the whales, meaning dozens of boats are zooming around the animals. This is especially problematic in May and June, the busiest months for orca swimming trips.Georgina Saad, a marine biologist who studied at Autonomous University of Baja California Sur, is worried about where all this may lead. Although no wild orca has ever killed or attacked a human, she says:“They are wild animals. If we don’t give them distance and space, they may, like any animal, defend themselves.”The constant influx of boats and swimmers may also affect the orcas’ wellbeing. The pods in Baja are usually females with babies and are often feeding on mobula rays, sharks, dolphins, turtles or whales while people are in the water with them. They hunt using sonar to find their prey, and thenoise from the motors can disrupt the whales’ability to capture food.View image in fullscreenTourist boats chase after orcas. The noise and disturbance can negatively affect the animals and their ability to hunt food.Photograph: Daniel Aguirre/CICESE“Eventually, these animals may not want to come back,” says Juan Vasquez, owner of a La Paz-based sailing tour company and a captain for more than 20 years. “They have good memories and they will remember being harassed.”Erick Higuera, a marine biologist and documentary film-maker based in La Paz, says that no one is regulating the sudden increase in swimming with orcas, which took off in 2019 after a fewInstagram postswent viral. “It brings in a lot of money for communities and no one wants to stop.”View image in fullscreenGeorgina Saad, a marine biologist, is among the experts behind the management plan for orcas in La Ventana Bay.Photograph: Georgina SaadNow, however, a proposed plan aims to change all that.A group of experts, including Saad, Higuera and Baudin, have put forward recommendations for a species management plan for orcas in La Ventana Bay, where most of the swimming happens. To do that, they incorporated information from 44 people interviewed locally. Saad expects the plan to be approved by the Mexican government this summer.The proposed plan for orcas would be the first species management plan inMexicobased partly on the animals’ behaviour – if they exhibit distress they must be left alone – not just a quota on the number of people or boats in an area.Tourists have flocked to Baja for decades to swim with whale sharks and to watch grey and humpback whales. The difference is that these activities are strictly regulated with government-issued permits and firm guidelines – but the activity of swimming with orcas has slipped through the regulatory net. This is partly because existing laws do not specifically ban swimming with toothed whales and partly because they rely on having species management plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since each orca has a unique dorsal fin, captains or guides should be able to keep track of their interactions.Revenue from the permit fees would go towards training people from La Ventana and funding patrol boats to enforce the plan, Saad says. “The goal is to teach captains and guides how to read the whales’ behaviour so they know when to interact with the animals, how to do so safely, and when to give the orcas space.”Not everyone is confident that this orca management plan will succeed and some feel as if they were left out of the planning process. “Arbitrary, one-sided decisions could affect the future of so many families,” says Cristóbal Pérez, the owner of a tour company based in La Paz. “The community needs a voice.”View image in fullscreenThe hope is that tourists will be able to continue swimming with the orcas in a way that is safe for both parties.Photograph: James RD Scott/Getty ImagesJorge Armando Lucero González, a tour boat captain who lives in nearby Agua Amarga, says that no one asked his opinion about the plan, nor any of his cousins or brothers who hope to continue to earn a living from wildlife tourism. Many local captains are worried that permits for swimming with orcas will mainly go to established tour companies in Cabo San Lucas and La Paz. They also believe it is unfair that the proposed plan only targets La Ventana when orcas – and the tourists who want to see them – roam throughout the Baja peninsula.‘Access to food is not the problem’: new orca study deepens mystery behind endangermentRead moreSaad believes that ensuring tourists are allowed to swim with orcas only in La Ventana is the most important part of the management plan. “We can send the message that this is the only place to do it, and this is how it is going to be done, and the rest is illegal.”Regardless of when and how the management plan unfolds, most captains say they will keep taking tourists on trips to swim with orcas, and do their best to keep the people and animals safe.“I love these animals more than anything. I want to be able to protect them, and I still want to be able to offer people who are respectful the opportunity to see them,” Baudin says. “Doing it the right way is the most important thing.”This article was amended on 27 May 2025.

But Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the IfG, said the Reform leader had used a figure that included both public sector and private sector investment.“The bulk of spending on energy infrastructure is going to come from the private sector – but closing private sector projects won’t generate money for the government,” she said.Labour accused Reform of making “fantasy promises”, while the Liberal Democrats called his speech “Trussonomics on steroids”.The Climate Change Committee says net zero will require investment of £26bn a year, more than two-thirds of which will be provided by the private sector. That will be offset, however, by about £22bn a year of savings the policy will enable.Tim Montgomerie, a political commentator and Reform supporter, told the BBC: “I wouldn’t say the numbers do add up yet, I readily concede that.” He said it was too far away from the election to demand the party deliver a fully costed policy platform.Farage himself admitted his sums might not add up, but insisted they gave “an idea of direction, policy, of priorities, of what we think is important, of what we think it is going to cost”.The Reform leader set out his latest policy pledges during a speech in central London at which he made three main policy announcements: ending the two-child benefit cap, reversing the cuts to winter fuel payments and increasing tax breaks for married couples. He refused, however, to guarantee keeping the pensions triple lock, which ensures the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5% a year.The IFS calculated that when added to a separate promise to increase the threshold at which people start paying income taxes to £20,000, the policies could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year.Watch Labour’s flip-flopping on winter fuel and benefits, and you’ll see who’s really considered important | Frances RyanRead moreFarage said his policies were in part about fairness, but also designed to encourage families to have more children, a social policy frequently espoused on the right.“We believe lifting the two-child cap is the best thing to do, not because we support a benefits culture but because we believe for lower-paid workers this actually makes having children just a little bit easier for them,” he said.He also promised more generous tax breaks for married people should he win the next election, saying he would raise the amount of tax-free allowance that someone can transfer to their spouse from £1,260 to £5,000.He added that he wanted more stringent controls on abortion as well.“I think it’s ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous, that we can allow abortion up to 24 weeks, and yet, if a child is born prematurely at 22 weeks, your local hospital will move heaven and earth and probably succeed in that child surviving and going on and living a normal life,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKBenefitsPensionsOlder peopleLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

We’re leaving’.”Marcus Ryder, the chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, said the lack of representation behind the camera at the highest level had contributed to the stasis reported by many Black figures within TV and film.The regulator Ofcom’s latest report into equality, diversity and inclusion in broadcasting found 18% of people working in the industry are people of colour, but only11% of senior managers are. The UK benchmark is 16%.He said: “If we look at who still has fundamental control and say as to what we watch and how that’s made it is still disproportionately white people. So there has not been a fundamental shift in how television actually works.”All the people the Guardian spoke to accepted that the “abrupt and precipitous”shift in fortunes of the industry, which spent record amounts on new shows post-Covid but has since contracted rapidly after a collapse in advertising revenues, was partially to blame.A report published last year found 70% of indies faced the risk of closure if there was no improvement in market conditions. Peter Kosminsky, the Bafta-award winning director of Wolf Hall, said public service broadcasters couldno longer afford to makehigh-end drama such as Netflix’s Adolescence.That contraction and the rise of anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) politics in the US and UK has led to figures from the industry calling for TV bosses to not row back on promises to make the sector more equitable in the aftermath of BLM.“Inclusion isn’t some fashionable accessory you put on when it suits and take off when the political weather changes,” said the comedian Lenny Henryduring a speech at Birmingham City Universitylast week. “It’s a duty. It’s a responsibility.”The summer of 2020 was seen as a watershed moment for British TV and its attitudes towards race, and especially Black British talent. The historian and broadcaster David Olusoga usedhis MacTaggart lecture– the state-of-an-industry address at the Edinburgh TV festival – to insist he was not a“diversity success story”but someone who had survived in a hostile industry.In the aftermath of BLM there was a spate of Black British TV commissioned and produced. Steve McQueen’sSmall Axewas released in late 2020 by the BBC, which also producedBoarders,Mr Loverman,Noughts and Crosses,This Town,Dreaming Whilst Blackand the comedy thrillerBlack Ops.Candice Carty-Williams’sQueeniecame to Channel 4 and her show Champion was on the BBC; while Top Boy and Rapman’sSupacellwere ratings hits for Netflix.Channel 4 hosted“Black to Front”where shows such as Countdown were hosted by Black British talent, and new shows were developed and broadcast, although none were taken through to series. The Channel 4 News part of Black to Front was nominated for a Bafta.“It was a great opportunity,” said a person who worked on a Black to Front show. “But years down the line things have gone backwards.”Few of the shows that came after BLM have been developed beyond a single run;Richeslasted only one season on Amazon, as did Lenny Henry’sThree Little Birds at ITV. The broadcaster said the drama did not generate “the numbers that we’d hoped for” despite it debuting with nearly 3 million viewers in October 2023.Many feel 2020 was a false dawn when channels wanted to be seen doing the right thing but without a real plan to change structurally or support talent long term.A Black British writer who asked to remain anonymous said in 2021 they were asked to develop a show, shot a pilot and then were told in 2023 that the channel did not want to proceed. “They wanted to be seen as progressive and then when that time passed, they said: ‘Oh, like, we don’t need to make that effort any more’,” the writer said.A Black British director who also asked to remain anonymous said that some production companies engaged in a practice colloquially known as “organ harvesting”. Directors are invited to pitch for a job, are subsequently unsuccessful but their concepts and casting ideas are used by white-led companies.“We’ll take all your ideas, we’ll take all of your personal experiences growing up,” the director said. “We might even ask you to leave your mood boards, all of your suggestions of casting, and then … ‘Thanks, bye’.”A forthcoming report from the Film and TV Charity found that Black British TV workers were more likely to experience suicidal thoughts (38%), leave the industry (36%) and have worked less than three months in the last year (21%), compared with their white counterparts.Mundy-Castle said public broadcasters should protect a proportion of their commissioning budget (a figure in line with the black population of the UK, which is just over 4%) for shows made by black-focused production companies.“It should be something that is a given,” he said. “A ringfenced amount of money that needs to go to the people that are creating shows for that cohort.”Without change, he said, the current TV leaders would play out a “Jurassic Park” scenario where they were seen as dinosaurs in a shifting digital landscape they did not understand. He said: “You can benefit from our differences but if you want to close the gates to Jurassic Park, you’re going to be extinct very soon.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryThe race reportTelevisionRaceBlack Lives Matter movementnewsShareReuse this content"

However, sources said Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, was opposed to the move, arguing the public viewed it as an issue of fairness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another Labour backbencher warned ministers should be “big and bold”, warning they will not be forgiven if child poverty has increased over this parliament.It comes after the Labour grandee David Blunkett warned that the country was facing a “toxic mix” of insecure work, poor pay and a collapse in skills training that had left families trapped in hardship.Blunkett, who helped create the Sure Start programme under the last Labour government, said the dismantling of early years services had stripped vulnerable families of basic support. “It felt to communities like government wanted to come to them on their terms,” he said. “That’s what’s been lost.”Last week the Guardian reported the child poverty taskforce is likely to recommend the return of the early years service Sure Start, although there are questions over how it could possibly be funded.Explore more on these topicsPovertyGordon BrownnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the NASUWT’s rules, Wrack would have automatically filled the position if no other candidate received enough nominations from local branches.Butler’s initial attempt to gather nominations was ruled out by the national executive on the grounds that, as an employee, he was not a member of the union.But Butler started legal proceedings to challenge the executive’s decision, with the NASUWT backing down shortly before a hearing at the high court that cost the union at least £70,000 in legal fees. Wrack was then named acting general secretary and nominations were reopened.Now Butler’s supporters say he has gained well above the 25 branch nominations required to be a candidate, setting off the union’s first ballot for general secretary since 1990.The general secretary selection process has been fraught with difficulty after Patrick Roach’s decision last year to step down after only one term in office.Wrack impressed members of the national executive appointments committee when he was interviewed alongside Butler and other candidates, and the executive then announced Wrack as its preferred candidate.But the appointment proved controversial among many NASUWT members, in part because Wrack had been general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) for 20 years until losing his re-election bid in January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Combs wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.On Tuesday, the prosecution called Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Combs, to the witness stand.Clark, who started working for Combs as a personal assistant in 2004, said that on her first day on the job, Combs became enraged upon learning that she had once worked for his rival, the record producer Suge Knight. Clark testified that Combs told her that “if anything happened he would have to kill me”, she said.Clark also described another time where she was subjected to five days of lie-detector tests after three pieces of jewelry went missing.She said that she was taken by a bodyguard working for Combs to a locked vacant Manhattan office space each day where an unnamed man wouldadminister the tests and told her that if she failed, “they’re going to throw you in the East River”.Clark testified that she left the job in 2006, after she said Combs physically pushed her after he heard that she had told another employee that she was dissatisfied with her job. She later returned to work for Combs.The prosecutionasked Clark about what happened when Combs discovered in December 2011 that his on-again, off-again girlfriend – the singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura – was dating the rapper Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi.Clark testified that Combs showed up at her house, “furious” with a gun in his hand, and asked her why she hadn’t told him about the relationship between Ventura and Mescudi.Clark alleged that Combs, while holding the gun, then kidnapped her to go to Mescudi’s house with him, allegedly telling her: “Get dressed, we’re going to go kill” Mescudi, despite her protesting. (Combs’s lawyers have denied that Clark was kidnapped.)Clark claimed that she was then made to get into a car with Combs. One of his security guards was driving, and there was a gun in Combs’s lap, Clark said.When they got to Mescudi’s house, Mescudi was not home. Clark testified that Combs and his security guardentered while she stayed in the car and called Ventura on a disposable cellphone to tell her what was happening.When Combs returned, Clark says that he directed her to call Ventura and to say that he would not release Clark until Ventura came.Ventura was picked up, and they returned to Combs’s home, where Combs allegedly told them not to speak to the police. He also allegedly said that they needed to get Mescudi to not tell the police he was involved.Clark also testified that she witnessed Combs kick and beat Ventura when she arrived at his home that day.Clark told the court that she was fired in 2012. And she said that, after she was terminated, Combs allegedly told her that she would “never work again”. He also told her that “all these people weren’t my friends and he would make me kill myself”, Clark recalled.Clark said she laterreceived a settlement from Combs’s attorneys over allegations of wrongful termination.In 2016, Clark said she returned to work for Combs as Ventura’s creative director, explaining that she had struggled to find other employment. She testified that Combs had final approval over everything when it came to Ventura’s career.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer emphasized Clark’s repeated returns to work for Combs over the years, pointing out that even as recently last year, after federal investigators had already begun investigating Combs, Clark met with his legal team and expressed interest in working as his chief of staff.Combs’s lawyer also challenged the kidnapping allegations, suggesting that Clark voluntarily accompanied Combs to Mescudi’s home in December 2011 in an attempt to prevent her boss from doing “something stupid”. The defense lawyer claimed that Clark had told Combs’s lawyers this during the meeting with Combs’s attorneys last year.Clark responded that she did not recall making that comment and insisted that she did not want to accompany Combs that day.Clark’s testimony wrapped just after 3.30pm ET on Tuesday and the court adjourned for the day. Prosecutors plan to call four witnesses on Wednesday.Clark’s testimony came after Mescuditook the standlast week and alleged that Combs broke into his home in 2011 after learning about his brief relationship with Ventura.Kid Cudi testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs broke into his home at sex-trafficking trialRead moreMescudi told the court how, a few weeks after the apparent break-in, his car was set on fire with a molotov cocktail, and that he believed Combs was responsible. Combs and his lawyers have denied the allegation.To date, more than 15 witnesses have testified so far in this trial. In addition to Mescudi, witnesses have includedsinger Dawn Richard,two of Combs’s formerassistants,Ventura’s former best friend,Ventura’s mother, anexotic dancer, amale revue manager,a hotel security officer,a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations(HSI), aforensic psychologist, amakeup artist who worked with Combs and Ventura, thegeneral manager of a Beverly Hills hotel, and acomputer forensics agentfrom HSI.Ventura, the prosecution’s key witness, spent four days on the stand detailingyears of physical and emotional abuse she says she endured by Combsduring their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship.She testified that Combs orchestrated and directed drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers – encounters that he referred to as “freak-offs”. She also testified that hecoerced and blackmailedher into participating.Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and have sought to portray her as a willing and consenting participant in the freak-offs.The trial is expected to continue for about six more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

This is a positive event, and I hope that they will,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, saying the EU would be “very happy and successful” if it agreed a deal.However, the president also repeated criticism of Brussels’ negotiators and defended his decision on Fridayto threaten a 50% tariff on EU importsfrom 1 June, which hepostponed two days later until 9 July.“I was extremely satisfied with the 50% tariff allotment on theEuropean Union, especially since they were slow walking (to put it mildly!), our negotiations with them,” he wrote.In what appeared to be another veiled threat on potential further tariffs, he added that he was empowered to “set a deal” if the US was “unable to make a deal” or was “treated unfairly”.Nevertheless, the president’s comments and his weekend U-turn on 50% border taxes helped lift US markets, which had been closed on Monday. The S&P 500 rose 2%, while the Dow Jones added 1.7% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up by 2.4%.Brussels sources said the way had now been cleared for detailed negotiations, with an expectation that the EU commissioner for trade, Maroš Šefčovič, would meet the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting in Paris on Tuesday next week.A team of officials are also expected in Washington in the coming days for technical talks. However, sources said the EU’s approach had not changed, with the target being a deal in which both sides move to zero tariffs on industrial goods, and the EU buys more soya beans, arms and liquefied natural gas.Trump’s latest comments came asEmmanuel Macronwarned Vietnamese students about the consequences of impulsive superpowers in a swipe at Trump’s chaotic tariff policies.During a six-day south-east Asian tour, the French president said that “on the impulse of a superpower, everything can change”. On Trump’s policies in the US, he said tariffs were being imposed “according to the side of the bed on which he woke up”.After the weekend’s tariff flip-flopping, there is evidence that EU policymakers are scrambling to get a handle on the scale of European direct investment in the US with requests going out to industry leaders to share their investment plans.Members of the Confederation of European Business, also known as BusinessEurope, an alliance of 42 federations across the region, received a survey from the European Commission on Monday. It asked for information on upcoming US investments, with the instruction to respond as soon as possible, one source said.A similar note seeking information on investment plans for the next five years was sent to the 59-person European Round Table for Industry, which represents industry and the tech sector. The petition for information came with a note saying the request had came personally from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, Trump touted investments from US companies including the chip maker Nvidia and the pharma giant Johnson & Johnson – both of which have a large presence in Europe – as evidence that histariff strategywas paying off with the repatriation of jobs to the US.European and Asian stock markets also rose on Tuesday as investors continued to react positively to Trump’s decision to backtrack on Friday’s tariff threat.Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at London’s Zaye Capital Markets, told CNBC that the tariffs delay had sparked a “tentative risk-on rally”.“Looking ahead, the EU-US trade dance is a high-stakes tango, with July 9 as the next flashpoint,” he said. The EU was dangling phased tariff cuts and “mutual respect” talks, but he warned businesses to “buckle up; this ride’s far from over”.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeDonald TrumpEuropean UnionTrump tariffsTariffsEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They also unanimously backed a less contentious law establishing a right to palliative care in specialist end-of-life institutions.Both votes are the start of a long parliamentary process that will require the bills to move on to the Senate – the upper house – and then back to the lower house – the National Assembly – for a second reading, meaning they are unlikely to become law before next year.The government has describedthe right-to-die lawas “an ethical response to the need to support the sick and the suffering”, insisting it was “neither a new right nor a freedom … but a balance between respect and personal autonomy”.The legislation would allow a medical team to decide if a patient is eligible to “gain access to a lethal substance when they have expressed the wish”. Patients would be able to use it themselves or have it administered by a nurse or doctor “if they are in no condition physically to do so themselves”.Patients must meet a number of strict conditions: they must be over 18, hold French citizenship or residency and suffer from a “serious and incurable, life-threatening, advanced or terminal illness” that is “irreversible”.The disease must cause “constant, unbearable physical or psychological suffering” that cannot be addressed by medical treatment, and the patient must be capable of “expressing freely and in an informed manner” their wish to end their life.The bill – referred to in France as a law on “end of life” or “aid in dying” rather than “assisted dying” or “euthanasia” – was backed by most of Emmanuel Macron’s centrist MPs and their allies and by the left, with most right and far-right deputies voting against.All parliamentary groups were given a free vote to express their personal convictions. Euthanasia is a highly sensitive subject inFrance, a country with a longstanding Catholic tradition, and the bill is also opposed by many health workers.“The French people are ready for this, and we owe them this rendezvous with history,” said Stéphane Delautrette, a Socialist party MP during the session. The laws would be “the measure of this parliament, in the footsteps of major social advances” such as the right to abortion and the abolition of the death penalty, he said.But Patrick Hetzel, a deputy from the centre-right Les Républicains, said it was “illusory to and even dangerous to even think of debating a legalisation of euthanasia without having first fully deployed proper access to palliative care.”The prime minister, François Bayrou, a devout Catholic, had said he had “questions” and would abstain if he were an MP, but Macron said last year that France needed the legislation because “there are situations you cannot humanely accept”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hopefully France will steadily align itself with other European countries,” Gemmani said. “Forcing people to go to Belgium or Switzerland, pay €10,000 or €15,000 … The current situation is just wrong.”Opinion polls show most French people are in favour of assisted dying, but France has been slower than many European neighbours to legalise it. Others are actively debating the issue, including the UK, where an assisted dying billis before parliament.Active euthanasia, where a caregiver induces death at the request of the patient, and assisted suicide, where doctors provide the patient with the means to end their life themselves, have been legal in the Netherlands and Belgium since 2002.Both countries apply roughly similar conditions – a doctor and an independent expert must agree the patient is suffering unbearably and without hope of improvement – and have since extended the right to children under 12.Luxembourg also decriminalised active euthanasia and assisted dying in 2009. Active euthanasia is outlawed in Switzerland, but assisted dying has been legal since the 1940s and organisations such as Exit and Dignitas have helped thousands of Swiss nationals, residents and others to end their lives.UK membership of Dignitas soars by 24% as assisted dying in Scotland moves closerRead moreAustria legalised assisted dying in 2022, while Spain adopted a law in 2021 allowing euthanasia and medically assisted dying for people with a serious and incurable illness, providing they are capable and conscious, the request was made in writing, reconfirmed later, and approved by an evaluation committee.Portugal decriminalised euthanasia in 2023 but the measure has not yet come into force after certain articles were rejected by the constitutional court.In the UK, MPsapproved the legalisationof assisted dying in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of under six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves, in a first vote in November last year.MPs must now vote on whether the text, amended in May to allow medics to opt out, is sent to the upper chamber for further scrutiny. The Scottish parliament has alsopassed its first voteon a bill to legalise assisted dying.Explore more on these topicsFranceAssisted dyingEuropeEmmanuel MacronEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

In barely a minute, the characters gab in the way you’d imagine adult-adults imagine young-adults speak, breezing through exposition, getting high, being broke and not having enough hot water to shower.This being New York, there’s also a subway masturbator, which Issa (Amita Rao), the loudest and bawdiest of a loud and bawdy group, handles by over-engaging, attempting to out-masturbate the creep. “Is this the world you want?!” she shouts, to the horror of everyone else on the train.Overcompensating review – an exquisite frat bro orgy of shirt-ripping, chest-thumping … and self-loveRead moreTo my horror, as well – there’s a fine line between cringe comedy and just cringe, and Adults, created by ex-Tonight Show writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw and executive produced bycoming-of-age comedian extraordinaireNick Kroll, is often on the wrong side of it. The barnstormer of an entrance – cue a joke about the progress of feminism – succeeds in setting the tone for the rest of the series (or at least, the six of eight episodes made available to critics): aggressively profane, a little off-putting, onto something but overdone, altogether doing too much. The television equivalent of the friend champing at the bit for inside jokes –Overcompensating, one could say, to borrow the title of another recent twentysomething comedy, albeit one set at US college, that has a better handle on its tone of heightened hijinks and egocentrism during a formative time.Which is a shame, because the viewing public is starved for a good show about one’s miserable and magical 20s in post-pandemic New York – or, believably for a group of genuinely broke post-grads, an hour-plus train ride away from Manhattan in outer Queens (as played by Toronto). The archetypically messy group living for free-ish in Samir’s (Malik Elassal) childhood home inhabit a recognizable world of post-Covid precarity and interconnectedness. Samir is chronically unemployed and struggling to assert himself. (His parents are off on a post-retirement jaunt.) His childhood best friend Billie (Lucy Freyer), the go-getter of the group, works at a cartoonishly bad media company with no health insurance. Even Anton (Owen Thiele), the house’s resident charismatic gay and admitted “friend slut”, doesn’t know what his job is besides chiming in “uh-huh” on Zoom (an update on the Friends bit about Chandler’s job). Issa appears to have made a career on hijacking social justice protests for personal gain. Her boyfriend, Canadian transplant Paul Baker (Jack Innanen) – always Paul Baker, never just Paul — is the group’s resident softboy, the enthusiastic golden retriever to the over-contrived scheme of the day, such as air-tagging a man as a potential solution to Anton’s dry spell.Over 20-ish minute episodes – Adults at least keeps it short and snappy – the crew flail about in ways both relatable and obnoxious. The gags are always a notch or two above necessary, such as an over-emphasis on a lack of physical boundaries (don’t you remember letting your best friend pee through your legs?) or Issa and Anton convincing themselves that they annoyed their therapist to the point of suicide. (Issa, in particular, is a too-grating parody of narcissism, as if Marnie Michaels had negative shame and was also a socialist.)The show hits all the expected bases – a go-around on sex-positive app Feeld, an inadvertent and exorbitant hospital bill, the phrase “defund the police and all, but … ” – and some unexpected ones, including guest turns from an admirably game Charlie Cox as Billie’s former teacher/older paramour and Julia Fox as her bleached eyebrow self. From house rules to a disastrous attempt at a roast chicken dinner party, all of it tastes overcooked, invoking the classic paradox that the harder one tries to make things look natural, the more contrived it seems.It’s not that Adults doesn’t have its moments, particularly as the season goes on and distances itself from a turkey of an opener. The cast, a mix of stand-up comedians, internet personalities and screen actors, eventually settles into a more level-headed groove, with Elassal and Freyer in particular demonstrating some emotional texture to their characters. (Thiele gets the award for comic timing). The less the writers strain for ego-centric, no-boundaries twenty-something-ness, the better; the funniest long-running bit is a simple gag about the gang referencing movies they haven’t seen.But these are too few and far between, and likely too late after the overkill of the first episode to win over its target audience, though if Adults shares one thing with today’s young people, it’s a formless, ambient sense of anxiety. Perhaps that will diffuse if the show is given time to grow, and these young adults learn what most twentysomethings do: in the game of winning friends and influencing people, one needn’t try so hard.Adults starts on FX and Hulu in the US on 28 May and Disney+ elsewhere on 29 MayExplore more on these topicsTV comedyTV reviewTelevisionComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In oenological terms, you can really taste the terroir – the land on which it’s made – with notes of nostalgia and melancholy and a tangy, slightly humorous spice. But there’s also maybe a touch too much sweetness in the blend, given writer and director Antonio Sequeira’s script occasionally slips into a tannic, sentimental theatricality. If it weren’t for the fact that the stunning landscape plays such an integral part in the film’s atmosphere you’d assume that this must have started as a stage play given the tidy scene breaks, dividing the story into four consecutive seasons.In the first act, Otávio and his wife, Susana, (Elsa Valentim) are busy preparing to say goodbye to their eldest child Tomas (Salvador Gil), who is about to go off to university in London. As Tomas packs and Susana fusses trying to find the mislaid bongos he wants to bring with him, Otávio comforts himself by treading his grape harvest with his own feet – an old-school method that could be done in seconds, as Tomas says, if he hired in some equipment. Younger sister Belinha (Beatriz Frazao, who does the most convincing job of ageing over the course of the movie), worries about surviving the coming year with her annoying parents without Tomas around to take some of the heat. The act ends, like each of the subsequent segments, with the family seeing Tomas off on the train. By the spring, he’s back home with a new girlfriend (Krupa Narci Givane) whose Portuguese is not good enough to understand Otávio’s racist jokes, much to the younger characters’ relief.So this study in mild generational conflict goes on, in which no one is really a bad guy, not even Otávio for all his maladroit joshing. The dialogue is pretty conventional, although perhaps more expressive or interesting for native Portuguese speakers, while for the most part Sequeira doesn’t try anything too tricksy. That said, there’s one striking flashback to when Otávio and Susana were young (played by Ricardo de Sa and Sara Barradas), and we see them age up to the present over a series of deft edits in which every time Susana is carrying Tomas: first a baby, then as he grows older until poor Valentim is carrying the fully adult Gil piggyback, as an apt symbol of a mother’s self-imposed martyrdom. A few more expressive touches like this might not have gone amiss, but as it stands Autumn is a sturdy if not especially distinguished work.Autumn is on digital platforms in the UK from 2 June and in the US from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFamilyPortugalEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s not a romcom in the sense of adhering to the formulaic character types and well-worn plot beats that we’re used to seeing the likes of Jennifers Aniston, Lawrence and Lopez navigate with such aplomb. It is the story of twentysomething Liv (Johanne Milland) and her burgeoning attraction to Andrea (Josephine Park), and is a lovely, well-acted and sincere Danish independent film with plenty of humour; it wears its tender heart on its sleeve and hews closely to the form and style of a coming-of-age film.Nobody here is coming-of-age, though; they’re already-of-age, but in Liv’s discovery of her sexuality, perhaps it could be a coming-of-orientation film. The Venus Effect is strong on the things which matter in such stories: sizzling chemistry between the leads and likable characters you hope can work through their inevitable differences. It’s also good on rather more under-explored themes, such as the ripple effects of coming out in a modern family who aren’t going to disown you for homophobic reasons, but might nevertheless disappoint you in other ways.The film’s best line – “I just don’t think I’m gay enough to be gay” – brings humour to a well-handled exploration of Liz’s feeling that while she might fancy a woman (or even women), she still doesn’t fit in with Andrea and her friends in a broader subcultural way. Queer culture can feel exclusionary, and the extent to which this feeling is a product of Liv’s own anxieties versus something that it would be worth Andrea examining is left open. The perennial debate around whether queer cinema needs to focus less on pain and showcase joy, or whether in fact avoiding tragedy is dishonest considering what the real world is actually like is curiously moot: this is a film with pain and pleasure blended in a realistic and sweetly vulnerable way.The Venus Effect is on digital platforms from 2 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsDrama filmsLGBTQ+ rightsDenmarkComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Patrick Wintour reports“We must call this what it is. It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.”Last week, the words of British foreign secretary, David Lammy, in the House of Commons on Israeli cabinet ministers’ calls to “purify Gaza” marked a shift in the UK’s position on Israel’s offensive. Lammy announced that Britain would be suspending negotiations withIsraelover a new free trade deal.“It was remarkable for the language, I think, as much as for what he announced,” the Guardian’s diplomatic editor,Patrick Wintour, tellsMichael Safi.The language is changing, but what actions would apply enough pressure for Israel to change course?“The three tools I think that do have an impact are obviously arms, and that has not happened,” Wintour says. “The second is the recognition of the state of Palestine, and why that matters is more than a piece of diplomatic dance, because it’s a statement that this is an irreversible moment, that Palestine will exist.“And then there is the trade which the European Union has with Israel, and that is substantial. The EU’s the biggest trading partner for Israel, and it represents a third of all its trade in terms of export markets.”Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: ReutersExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warToday in FocusGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuKeir StarmerForeign policyMiddle East and north Africa"

In his new book he says he’s “most at home in the idiom of the ironic switchback, an educationally enhanced version of something that still [comes] under the broad conversational church-pub known as banter”. You can hear the banter in the title of his 2003 bookYoga for People Who Can’t Be Bothered to Do It.Banter’s trickier with a childhood memoir. If you were relatively happy growing up, as he was, in Cheltenham, the only child of parents who loved him, and you want to be honest about your upbringing, then you can’t muck about too much. Dyer’s humour has never precluded seriousness – about jazz, film, photographs, paintings, DH Lawrence and much besides. But as the title suggests, Homeworkis a duty in earnest, a task he’s compelled (if only by himself) to complete.As a book about beginnings, it’s also chronological, moving from infancy at the end of the 50s to his arrival at Oxford as an undergraduate. Straight-line narration isn’t Dyeresque: telling the story of the early years means breaking with the late style he used so winningly in his 2022 book about endings,The Last Days of Roger Federer, which was arranged in numbered sections. A nonfiction Bildungsroman is more of a challenge. It’s a while before he hits his stride.To outsiders Cheltenham sounds posh, but the end-of-terrace house he grew up in was a modest two-up, two-down. His father worked as an aircraft engineer; he’d been in India during the war but after that his only trip was on a coach to France in his 70s. He had no time for royals or religion and hated spending money: if petrol was needed for the car, a sky-blue Vauxhall Victor, he’d only half-fill the tank. Life meant the allotment and submission to his lot. “I was home-schooled in notions of acceptance I later found entirely unacceptable,” Dyer says, rejecting the “subsistence existentialism”, to which his mother also adhered. Born on a farm in Shropshire, she’d have liked to be a seamstress but worked in the school canteen and as a cleaner.Toy soldiers, conker fights, fizzy drinks, Wall’s ice-creams, chicken-in-a-basket pub lunches, swimming lessons (plus verrucas), trips in the family car to see relations, programmes on the black-and-white telly: his recall of period detail and brand names is exceptional. Perhaps it’s an only-child thing or that the re-discovery of two boxes of small, semi-educational cards (the kind that came with tea and cigarette packets) has helped him access his past. As a boy he was an avid collector and as a writer he’s the same: back then he’d be completing a card sequence or building an Airfix model, now it’s “the process of compiling and organising the work you are holding in your hand.”As he documents childhood minutiae, Dyer moves slowly. With half the book gone he’s still finishing primary school. Then comes the 11-plus, which he passes (“the most momentous event in my life, not simply up to that point but for its duration”) and embarks on the path that will separate him from his parents. The clash he describes, between a boy’s growing desire to be “with it” and his parents’ dour commitment to “go without”, is one all boomers will recognise, especially those of us brought up in the provinces. He quotes the poetTony Harrisonon how “books, books, books” create a chasm. His parents were tolerant of him as a “less than nice adolescent” but what he thought, felt and experienced became increasingly “incommunicable” to them. He is, he says, “a grammar‑school boy through and through to the core of my being”. He means it proudly.As a high achiever at school, he wasn’t much of a rebel and has few dramas or traumas to report. There’s a scary ride on his racing bike and the occasional near fight, but more often it’s the teenage boredom of having “nowhere to go” and the problem of how to meet girls. His collecting urge moves on to Athena posters and LPs. Then things pick up – and the humour does too. He has sex (in those days, for a boy, a matter of “resistance overcome by negotiation and sleight of hand”), becomes a boozer (“men with huge guts were almost role models”), and gets a Saturday job in a shop selling Airfix kits (“I became a born-again modeller”). More eventfully, he’s part of a crowd that goes on a post-pub rampage; through ill-fortune – his shoe-print is found on one of the cars they clambered over – he’s the only culprit charged and fined, an episode that leaves him feeling the shame of a loser who, on the verge of going to Oxford, has let his parents down.Here and there he holds stuff back, like the nickname he was given at school (“I hated mine so much that I won’t even repeat it here”) or the reason he was taken to the GP about problems with his “toy-oy”, his father’s name for the penis. But he doesn’t spare himself embarrassment, whether it’s failure to inherit his father’s craft skills (he describes himself as a “wildly impatient, cost-cutting, tantrum-prone bodger”) or the night he locks his parents out of the house after a heated row. “Presenting myself in a consistently poor light has been more than a source of pleasure over the last 30 years,” he says, but he takes care with others. Some of the names here have been changed.What does make him feel guilty of betrayal (“nothing has ever been more painful for me to write about”) is telling the story of his mother’s horrendous birthmark, which stretched from her left shoulder to her left hand; surgery in her 20s removed it up to the elbow but she couldn’t bear a second operation to remove the rest. Dyer leaves this revelation until late on in the book but as he says, sympathetically, it explains so much about his mother: her privacy, powerlessness and lack of self-worth. His portrayal of his father is no less affectionate: his feeling of being “hard done by” was wearisome and “yes, he was unbelievably tight but he was also and always, at the deepest level,honourable”.Dyer worries that the book will read “like the biography of someone who went on to become a minor British painter best known for seascapes’’ or “the memoir of a forgotten jazz man”. He wouldn’t want it to be just another Gloucestershire childhood memoir, either, in the shadow of Laurie Lee’sCider with Rosieor Dennis Potter’s Blue Remembered Hills. What lifts it beyond routine reminiscence (and makes the excess of cigarette cards and Airfix kits more bearable) is its evocation of a lost era, a postwar culture eager to embrace new freedoms while still recovering from the privations of the 1930s and 40s. The grown-up, cosmopolitan Dyer doesn’t miss the place yet he does, intensely: “England, my England: that has felt mine more than ever, since I’ve been living where I’ve always dreamed of being, in California, where I’ll never feel at home.”Homework by Geoff Dyer is published by Canongate (£20).

This trio of short, vivid works has also quietly established Moss as a revered chronicler of the political present. Though Ripeness bears many of the hallmarks of her recent fiction – evocative descriptions of the natural world abound, no speech marks used, chapter titles plucked suggestively out of the narrative – it also departs from it. It is longer, slower, European in setting, and its political critiques are ultimately muted.Ripeness is structured in alternating narrative strands, both following an English woman called Edith: one as a septuagenarian living comfortably in the west of Ireland in the post-pandemic present, and another as a bookish, Oxford-bound 17-year-old travelling to Italy in the late 60s. These strands are initially connected by stories of babies given up. In the present, Edith’s best friend Méabh is contacted by an unknown older brother who was adopted and raised in America and now wants to “see where he comes from”. In the historical strand, Edith is travelling to help her older sister, a professional ballerina, pregnant with a child she will almost immediately relinquish. Together, a textured and affecting story about place and identity emerges.Edith is sickened and wonders briefly if she can remain friends with ‘someone who thinks the problem is refugees’Early on we learn that Edith has four passports – English, Irish, French and Israeli – and that her French-Jewish mother was granted refuge in England in 1941 while her grandparents and aunt were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. Edith’s “Maman”, an artist and “iconoclast” to her friends in rural Derbyshire, advised her to always “leave before you’re certain, because if you wait until you know, there are boots coming up the stairs and blood on the walls”. While her mother’s migration was driven by genocide and trauma, and her grandparents before had fled Ukraine for France, she and her sister were able to travel freely around Europe, and the young Edith’s only real concern was that “the rising hemlines of the mid-60s had not reached the thigh of Italy”. But in the novel’s present, military aggression is again forcing migration. Edith reflects on the cyclical nature of conflict, noting that the “great grandparents of the people now fleeing Russian invasion and taking refuge here in the west of Ireland were the aggressors from whom her great-grandparents fled Ukraine”.A central tension is established when Edith discovers that while Méabh is sympathetic to their village’s Ukrainian refugees, she is actively protesting at the use of a local hotel as emergency housing for African refugees. Edith is sickened and wonders briefly if she can remain friends with “someone who thinks the problem is refugees”. Quickly she decides she can, though Méabh’s position continues to trouble her. She supports her plans to meet her brother, but stews over her own belief that “national identity isn’t genetic, that blood doesn’t give you rights of ownership”, that “Méabh’s brother can’t just come here and call it home, say he belongs, when nothing the Ukrainians do will ever entitle them to say such things, when the lads at the hotel aren’t even allowed the air they breathe”. These convictions are not unconsidered, and Edith gives much thought to various claims to and erasures of identity – including the Jewishness of her unknown nephew, adopted by nuns, and her Maman’s traumatic experiences of loss and migration. Yet, despite her personal connection to histories of genocide and displacement, her dismay at Méabh’s position fades.Edith’s convictions about “blood and soil” logic are betrayed by her lack of reproach to Méabh, and the novel’s shifts in narrative perspective allow us to view her critically. The chapters depicting the present are narrated in the third person, while those depicting Edith’s trip to Italy are in the first person. While the latter invite us to see the world through her eyes, the former allow some detachment between Edith and the reader and emphasise her privilege, biases and uncertainties. Edith is also increasingly reflexive and self-deprecating, eventually describing herself as having “remained more of narrator than a participant”.This evocative distinction between storytelling and action aligns with the novel’s dual narrative, which both connects us to and distances us from this compelling and at times frustrating character. However, because of her increasing self-deprecation and reflection, and at least partial awareness of her mistakes, Edith is ultimately presented as sympathetic. Her flaws are human and relatable and by its conclusion, the gap that has opened between the novel’s politics and its protagonist’s views has shrunk. Just as Edith’s dismay at Méabh’s comments fades, the anger of Ripeness wanes too. But while its critiques of contemporary attitudes towards migration, and failures in historical thinking, and the ways some refugees are accepted while others are not, do lose some force, it remains a powerful and beautifully written story of family, friendship and identity.Ripeness by Sarah Moss is published by Picador (£20).

Dressed in May abundance, the sandySomersetvillages radiate genteel nothing-doing respectability. Yet culture, of an invigorating and experimental kind, has penetrated these sun-slowed lanes. Where TS Eliot once meditated on ageing, death and modernisation, the south-west has its very own bite-sized biennale, the Od art festival.View image in fullscreenA new past … an exhibit at The Museum of Roadside Magic.Photograph: © Katy DockingOd isn’t really odd, at least by West Country standards (it’s the name of a crooked stream that runs through the villages). The theme of this fourth edition is Thinking in Circles, evoking seasons, migration and life cycles. There is a link, too, to the starts and failures, death and dung of Eliot’s 1940 poem East Coker (encircling lines from which are inscribed on village signage.) Cumulatively, the 24 artists in the festival raise timely questions about the intersection of the rural and the industrial, the invention of traditions, and the global networks of people and goods through which England is sustained.Star turn isLibby Bove’s Museum of Roadside Magic. Occupying a customised truck, it has toured the south-west off and on since Bove’s graduation from Bath Spa last summer. The peripatetic archive contains the invented ephemera of songs, dances and esoteric practices used in “vehicular maintenance, repair and journey making”. Artefacts include maypole-type figures whose coloured ribbons represent “the wiring arrangements of a seven-pin plug”, a photograph of the font of “St Dunlop” used for the immersion and retreading of rubber tyres, and costumes worn for the blessing of vehicles ahead of an MOT.Bove’s attention to the dowdy aesthetic of local museum displays, and the language of their signage is immaculate. From “historic” photographs of dancers in pearl-buttoned costumes that apparently prefigure motorway engineers’ hi-vis, to field recordings of “traditional” chants, the whole presentation is so thought through and deadpan that it is hard not to believe it’s real. This muddying of the waters is affectionate but pointed – in the world of folk custom, the distinction between ancient tradition and recent invention is seldom a sure one. The past for which nationalist politicians invite our nostalgia is as much a creation as the artefacts in Bove’s museum.View image in fullscreenRed Hot Haystacks by Simon Lee Dicker.Photograph: © Katy DockingThe Museum of Roadside Magic is parked beside a small industrial estate, but other locations are more picturesque. A glowing haystack occupies the 15th-century great hall of the manor house, perfectly echoing the arc of its gothic roof. Illuminated by ultraviolet light and smelling sweetly of the field,Simon Lee Dicker’s Red Hot Haystacksnod to the territorial intersection of agriculture and the military. In Orkney in the 1960s, cumulative contamination by atmospheric nuclear tests became evident once hay drying in the field was gathered in stacks.Beyond the wellies in the manor’s entrance hall playsAdam Chodzko’s The Pickers. Chodzko commissioned four Romanian migrant workers – then engaged in harvesting strawberries in Kent – to view and edit archival film of crop-picking. Images on screen flip between early 20th-century documentation of workers on stilts setting up twine frames for hops, jolly families pulling the flowerheads off the resulting vines, and groups of Londoners gathering Kent harvests on a working holiday. The Romanians, who were recorded while editing, are fascinated by these bygone visions of contented labour and liken them to the collective farms of the Ceaușescu era.Their own workplace more closely resembles a factory or laboratory than a picture-book farm. Within the tightly regulated climate of a plastic-roofed shed, strawberries grow in elevated beds from which stems full of fruit dangle for harvesting. “Imagine in the future that the British come to Romania to work in one of your companies because their economy has collapsed,” fantasises one of the pickers. “They would have nothing to do in their own country. It would be interesting if they came to us. I would like it.”View image in fullscreenWaypoints by Emii Alrai.Photograph: © Katy DockingInternational relations of a different kind are imagined byEmii Alrai, whose dioramas of ersatz archaeological fragments are arranged in a long loft first used for the fabrication of ropes. West Coker was once famous for its rope and sail-making, connecting the village to the fortunes of Britain’s imperial and merchant fleet. Alrai’s half-buried pots and shards imagine the cultural plunder that occurred along these voyages, linking distant soil back to the Somerset fields that grew the flax that made the rope.More esoteric works occupy the cemetery chapel. Arranged in an inward-pointing circle, the ceramic hands ofChantal Powell’s A Summoning, sprout ears of corn like tiny flames and carry engraved emblems of woven corn stalks. Its blend of ancient symbols suggests uncanny power. You might think twice before standing at this circle’s centre.Ella Yolande’s Find Us in the Slip Spacesis a gauzy suspended archway embroidered with pouches of fragrant herbs, leaves and seedheads. In this place of transition between life and death, it hangs as a symbolic (or perhaps hopeful) portal between realms.Explore more on these topicsInstallationArtFestivalsSomersetreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This is Smith’s first UK tour since 2018, when, at just 21, her raw, atmospheric debut album won Grammy and Mercury nominations, Brit awards and a host of celebrity fans. Glitzy features with Drake, Stormzy and Burna Boy followed, but otherwise Smith resisted the playbook for sudden fame. She left London for home town Walsall, spent five years on her follow-up album, 2023’s pointedly titled Falling or Flying, and only now, another two years later, is she touring those songs.Her searing, smoky voice is used sparingly to start, sometimes even drowned out by the power of the band’s two drummers. But by Feelings, a duet with rapper J Hus whose verses are covered well by a backing singer, Smith drops the wall. She beams mega-watt charisma through the track’s lyrically chilly push-and-pull, and slinks between risers, glamorously at ease.Falling or Flying expanded her sonic palette with serrated guitar, unusual textures, and a theatrical sense of scale. Tonight even her older tracks benefit from this new ambition. Backing singers bring lush, Solange-esque harmonies to a reimagined version of February 3rd, and there’s a rich, bassy funk to Where Did I Go? The double-drummers inject pure adrenaline into Go Go Go, a rock track with a new wave swing that seems to unlock something in Smith: the intensity suits her.By now, those belting vocals are bringing the room closer, rather than holding the audience at a distance, and when Smith’s singers join her centre stage for a closing run through her poppier, non-album singles such as flirty Be Honest and straight-talking bassline hit Little Things, it feels like a house party instead of a point to prove. Shining and loose, Smith coos to the front rows. “I won’t leave it so long next time,” she promises, with the confidence of a star who knows she can have this whenever she chooses.Jorja Smith plays Manchester Apollo, 29 and 30 May,then touring.Explore more on these topicsJorja SmithPop and rockSoulDance musicR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the German-French company’s clever and understated Shades of Shadows, performers Sarah Chaudon and Clara Palau y Herrero find themselves in a landscape where shadows refuse to behave.Staged in the Festival theatre studio, it starts out looking like a standard-issue piece of shadow puppetry as the two performers project the silhouette of a Dr Seuss-like city on to a screen. They focus in on a room in one of the buildings where a couple drink at a table, lit by an Anglepoise lamp. Mimicking this image, carefully positioning themselves around the table, mugs in hand, they upturn the normal order of things: the shadow comes first, real life second.From there, matters grow increasingly surreal. A sinewy black puppet emerges from a lightbulb, the mugs float into the air, a spoon morphs into a fish and again into an aeroplane, blobs of light swell, contract and ricochet across the screens. In a spectacular piece of choreography, Chaudon appears in triplicate and gives each of her three shadows its own distinct gestures.View image in fullscreenAdults’ antics … Grown Ups.Photograph: Franky VerdicktThe delightfully inventive show, co-created with director Tobias Tönjes, is not the only piece of surrealism in the opening weekend of the Edinburgh international children’s festival, the annual benchmark of quality theatre for young audiences. The wonderfully funny Grown Ups byCompagnie Barbarie, resident at Brussels’ Bronks theatre, begins on an empty Traverse stage where an assortment of random objects – a roll of tape, an unfurling cable, an arrow – cross in front of us to a soundtrack of tuneless whistling.Absorbed in an adult world of manual labour, Sarah Vangeel, Liesje De Backer, Amber Goethals and Lotte Vaes gradually appear, preoccupied by their mysterious tasks. They take a reckless approach to health and safety, wielding electric blades, scaling ladders and immersing live wires in water, but just as often busy themselves carrying large objects nowhere in particular.As water starts trickling perilously from the ceiling, Karolien De Bleser’s beautifully timed production takes a turn. Suddenly, this backstage crew notice the audience and realise they should be performing something called theatre. Their wayward attempts at Chekhov, ancient Greek ritual and classical dance are not just comically eccentric, they raise a fascinating conceptual question: if this is what counts as theatre in the adult world, what are we watching the rest of the time?View image in fullscreenGreg Sinclair’s Tongue Twister.Photograph: Laurence WinramStill more everyday surrealism in Tongue Twister at NorthEdinburgharts centre in which performer Greg Sinclair gets his mouth around the trickiest phrases from a dozen languages. Co-directed by Lu Kemp and Hannah Venet, the show keeps a stately pace, giving as much weight to the sensory pleasures of music, movement and design as to the tongue twisters themselves.Thanks to costume designer Alison Brown, these strange phrases find physical form in a multi-tiered skirt, a three-level cake, a brain/frog hybrid, a web of tin cans and an aunty in a tent. By the end, the stage is covered in colourful props, the visual wonder matching the playful possibilities of the spoken word.The festival runs at various venues, Edinburgh, until 1 June.Explore more on these topicsChildren's theatreEdinburgh festivalTheatreEdinburghFestivalsFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

All three films never deign to tell viewers much at all about Williams, who spends great chunks of the film doing almost nothing, like sleeping by a tree, taking a bath, or just pottering about at his home, Bogancloch in Aberdeenshire.However, there are oblique hints in plain sight if you look closely. In the bric-a-brac of Williams’ digs and the closeup shots Rivers inserts of some of Williams’ scratched and smudged photographs of places around the world he’s once visited, one of which shows the subject as a young man with a resplendent head of red hair. These days, his scalpline has much receded and both head hair and luxurious beard have turned white as a goblin, which at least makes him of a piece with the silvery black and white 16mm film stock Rivers shoots the film on. When he cuts away to those rumpled photographs, everything suddenly goes into colour. If that stab of pigment doesn’t shake you up, wait until Rivers breaks out the drone for a spectacular final shot.Not quite a documentary and not quite a work of fiction either, this is a contemplative curio that gets across that Williams himself leads a liminal life on the edge of society but not entirely separate from it. We see him meeting hikers in the wood and enjoying a visit from a choir around a campfire who sing a spectacular folk song in Scots dialect that’s about an argument between life and death. He even teaches some schoolkids about the solar system with an assist from a giant umbrella, although they all clear off as fleet as foxes when the bell rings.But Jake seems like a happy soul for all his solitude, happy to sing a song to himself and have a friendly conversation with his talkative cat, with whom in one early scene he shares a roadkill feast. It looks like a pretty mellow, content sort of life from where I’m standing, and not much different than that of your average self-employed home-based worker, but with more snow and silence.Bogancloch is in UK cinemas from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBen RiversScotlandRural affairsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fear of being disliked or forgotten, fear of the box office, of bad lighting, even fear of wire hangers. The prevailing view of Crawford was that of the scary lady: frightening and frightened.In 1943, after remaining under contract with MGM for 18 years, Crawford moved to Warner, the studio that would help her win her best actress Oscar for Mildred Pierce. But soon she became displeased with the roles available for a woman in her late 40s (her exact year of birth, even now, is still up for debate). Then came Sudden Fear, a film noir she took to competing studio RKO that once again won her Academy favour.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWith Sudden Fear, Crawford forged an unprecedented Hollywood archetype: the now prevalent actress-turned-executive producer. She presided over the entire project, hired director David Miller, chose the screenwriter and cinematographer and personally selected co-stars Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame.View image in fullscreen‘The prevailing view of Crawford was that of the scary lady.’Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyIn Sudden Fear, Crawford plays Myra Hudson, a successful playwright and wealthy heiress lovestruck by a younger man. Sitting in on a rehearsal of her latest play, Myra decides that leading man Lester Blaine (Palance) must be recast. He “just doesn’t look romantic”, she says, and we’re inclined to agree. Like Crawford, Palance is a singular beauty: a skull rather than a face, craterous in black and white.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In close quarters, Myra is disarmed by Lester’s charms. She absolves him of her early judgments, and casts Lester as her romantic lead off-stage.There’s a snag, however: Lester’s brassy lover Irene Neves, with whom he concocts a plot to murder Myra for her fortune. Mid-dinner party at Myra’s, Lester and Irene steal away to the host’s office voicing their plans – let slip only by the then-futuristic dictation machine accidentally recording them.Of course, Myra ends up hearing the recording, and under the web of intrigue, there’s a tragic confession. “Love you?” Lester declares on the dictation machine. “I never loved you. Never for one moment.” In perfect melodrama, the camera never leaves Crawford’s face as she stumbles around the room reacting – or overreacting. The film-maker François Truffaut called her performance “a question of taste” – one that, I feel, should be acquired rather than challenged.View image in fullscreenSudden Fear was Crawford (pictured with Jack Palance) in the driver’s seat of her own star vehicle.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyThe disembodied voice, played back by the recording device, lends Crawford the chance to reprise her silent film star status once more: by 1929 she was one of very few to survive the transition from silents to talkies. The conversation she hears takes on a paranoid quality.Is this how people speak about me when I’m not around?As a film-making tool, the voiceover typically serves as an internal monologue, but here it’s terrorising: both absent and presently threatening. The voices come from elsewhere, estranged by time, and now they are lodged in Myra’s head!Wide awake with conspiratorial voices keeping her up at night, Myra plans her counterattack, writing the rest of the script before it is written for her. She forges letters, breaks into Irene’s apartment, feigns sickness and dramatically falls down a flight of stairs to intercept her violent demise. It’s in these moments that Crawford’s own bias seeps into the text, and her attraction to Sudden Fear is exposed. Myra is a woman at the top of her game who chooses not to fold when she is undermined, instead taking back control and coming out the other side. Sounds like Joan Crawford to me.Ten years after Sudden Fear and, at her nadir, Crawford would campaign for the novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? to be adapted as a motion picture, starring herself alongside – nay, underneath – twin flame Bette Davis. The film cemented their conjoined cult status and spawned a whole new subgenre: hagsploitation. If What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? was the story of industry roadkill, then Sudden Fear was Crawford in the driver’s seat of her own star vehicle.No Way Out is streaming on Tubi in Australia and available to rent in the UK and the US.

Instead, look for recycling bins for used or old household batteries near the entrance or customer service desk of a supermarket. Most of the big ones have them including Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi. You will even find them in some libraries.Most standard types of batteries can be recycled. Rechargeable ones are usually accepted too, as long as they are not swollen or leaking. Disposable and rechargeable vapes can, and should, also go in these bins because of the hazardous lithium-ion batteries in them.Before dropping used batteries off at a recycling point, store them safely at home. Keep them in a lidded container, such as an empty jam jar or takeaway tub, and try to keep them away from metal objects such as keys and coins. For lithium batteries – the type often found in vapes, fitness trackers and digital thermometers – stick a small piece of masking tape over the terminals (the metal ends) to reduce the risk of fire.If you can take the batteries out of other electronics such as laptops, mobile phones, electric toys, Bluetooth devices, shavers, electric toothbrushes and power bank chargers before you dispose of them, you can usually also recycle these in store. If they are hard to remove, you may have to visit your local recycling bin or centre to dispose of the whole product.View image in fullscreenMost standard types of batteries can be recycled. Rechargeable ones are usually accepted too, as long as they are not swollen or leaking.Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPATake small electricals to recycling binsAll those no-longer-usable chargers and tangled cables can go in with small electronics at Bring Bank recycling points. That includes old phone chargers, remote controls, electric razors, earphones, vapes and even broken fairy lights. If the device has a plug, uses batteries, needs charging or has a circuit board, it counts. These are known as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE).These small drop-off points for electricals are popping up all over the country and are often run by local councils.They are often tucked into residential streets or near supermarkets. The slots are usually quite small, so anything bigger than a toaster will probably need to go to the tip instead. Look on your local council’s website to find your closest Bring Bank, or search onRecycle Your Electricals.Go to the tipYour local tip – also known as a household waste recycling centre (HWRC) – will take almost anything that has a plug or uses batteries. That includes toasters, electric toothbrushes, radios, hairdryers, and vapes. Some tips have separate areas or bins for different types of waste, so you may need to separate any screens, white goods (such as fridges and microwaves), and small gadgets.If you are not sure where to put things, ask one of the staff – they are usually keen to point you in the right direction.You can typically take LED lightbulbs to the tip for recycling but you may find that there is a retailer nearby that has a collection point. Checkthe Recycle Now locatoronline – it will give you details of your nearest locations.Check your council’s website for information about what will be accepted there, and whether there are any restrictions on how much you can drop off at a time. You can take large electrical appliances such as fridges for no charge, though it is worth checking with your local council or the specific HWRC to confirm their policies.Check for council collectionsIn some areas, councils offer kerbside collection for small electrical appliances. For example, in parts of London, Oxfordshire and the West Midlands, you can leave items such as mobile phones, hairdryers or handheld games consoles in a standard carrier bag on top of your bin on collection day. Search for your council’s recycling page online to see whether this is offered where you live.You should check whether you need to reserve a spot in advance. For instance, in Solihull you need to book a collection. It is best to look on your local council’s website to see whether it runs the service, and if you need to do anything beforehand.View image in fullscreenAO recycling plant in Telford, Shropshire, where fridges and large domestic appliances are either refurbished or shredded and recycled.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianLook for recycling schemesAO,John LewisandCurrysoperate collect and recycling schemes and will come and collect your items and dispose of them properly for a small fee. Typically this will be an add-on service if you are buying a new item from them and having it delivered.At John Lewis, you can add collection and recycling of an old product to your basket when buying its replacement. The fee is £25 for most appliances, including fridges, ovens, dishwashers, TVs and washing machines. There are some exclusions, such as American-style fridge-freezers, which it does not collect or recycle.With Currys, you can also add recycling to your basket when buying a new version of that product, which starts at £20, depending on what you want to recycle.At AO, you do not have to buy a new appliance to use its service, which costs £30. However, you may have to pay extra if you do not disconnect the appliance in advance of collection so be sure to check.Recycle for money offIf you have an old phone or tablet gathering dust in a drawer, you may be able to trade it in when buying a new one or you could resell it. Many households are holding on to more than £1,300 worth of unused but working tech, according to Material Focus, the organisation behind the Recycle Your Electricals campaign.Apple, Samsung and Currys will usually give you money off a new device if you hand in your old one – sometimes even if it has seen better days. How much you get depends on the condition. Mobile networks such as EE and Vodafone also run trade-in schemes online or in their shops.If your tech is too old to be worth anything, these companies should still take it off your hands for recycling if you are buying a new one from them.You can also send your phone toEnvirofone, where it will be recycled or refurbished and sold on depending on its condition. You’ll usually get some money for it too.View image in fullscreenIf you have an old phone or tablet gathering dust in a drawer, you may be able to trade it in or resell it.Photograph: Valery Voennyy/AlamyScott Butler, the executive director of Material Focus, says before you part with any tech you should wipe it clean by doing a factory reset and take out your SIM and memory card, as this will remove most personal data. “We understand that some people aren’t comfortable with selling or recycling their electricals – one in five adults in the UK are still holding on to unused electricals because they’re concerned about how to delete and transfer the data properly,” he says.You can find out how to delete your data online in a guide fromRecycle Your Electricals.Donate working gadgetsIf your electrical item still works and is in decent condition, you might be able to donate it instead of chucking it out. Broken or obviously unsafe items will not be accepted, so test things before donating.Charities including the British Heart Foundation, Emmaus UK and Age UK accept working electronics, as long as they are clean and safe. They will carry out portable appliance testing (Pat) and basic safety checks to make sure the item is safe to use before reselling. If the item cannot be safely repaired, it is usually broken down and the materials recycled properly, so it is not wasted either way.Some charities can collect larger items such as microwaves, ovens or vacuum cleaners for nothing, too. If you have cables, remote controls or instruction booklets, include them as well.Explore more on these topicsRecyclingMoney hacksConsumer affairsEthical and green livingWastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This gigantic hybrid bed-in-a-box would be the James Bond of mattresses, if Bond ever traded his 007 for life as a stacked gym bro. It’s too firm for me, but if you’ve struggled tofind a mattressthat offers enough support without feeling like an actual plank of wood, it could be your ideal match.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.At £680 for a double, the Hybrid Pro isn’t a bargain. However, its 31cm depth and beefy construction suggest to me that it will perform well for ages, potentially reducing aches, pains and night sweats, as well as providing years of comfortable sleep.My pipsqueak body needs more softness than the Hybrid Pro offers, so I asked my sister and her husband – avowed fans of a solid mattress – to sleep on it for two months and report back. They were almost unequivocally delighted, right up to the point where I told them the test was over and they had to give it to charity. Here, I’ll reveal the many reasons why they adored the Hybrid Pro, and a couple of reasons I didn’t.View at OriginHow I testedView image in fullscreenBesides sleeping on the mattress, lab-style tests were used to measure factors such as sinkage, edge support and heat retention.Photograph: Jane HoskynOrigin sent me a double of the Hybrid Pro for testing. I shared it with my husband for two nights before delegating sleep-testing responsibilities to my sister, Maeve, and brother-in-law, Ben. With other family members, we rated factors such as its firmness and overall comfort level side by side with several other mattresses, and I ran lab-style tests to measure factors such as sinkage, edge support and heat retention. You canread more about our mattress testing exploits here.What you need to know, from price to firmnessView image in fullscreenOur mattress testing panel scored the Hybrid Pro 8.2/10 for firmness.Photograph: Jane HoskynView at OriginMany mattress companies bamboozle you with choice, but Origin keeps things simple by selling just two mattresses: the mid-price Hybrid and the premium Hybrid Pro. The Hybrid Pro comes in five sizes, ranging from single to super king. When not on offer, it’s one of the most expensive mattresses I’ve tested, falling marginally cheaper than the £1,199Simba Hybrid Pro. However, Origin (and indeed Simba, and otherbest mattressbrands) runs regular sales with big discounts.As with all hybrid mattresses, the Hybrid Pro combines layers of springs and memory foam to provide a balance of support and comfort. There are two layers of titanium springs: more than 5,700 19cm springs for adaptive support, and a layer of microsprings whose jobs include reducing motion transfer to stop you being disturbed by a restless partner.The Hybrid Pro has three memory foam layers: a 5cm open-cell HexaGrid Plus layer to cushion the body and let the air circulate; breathable comfort foam, to absorb movement from the springs immediately below; and dense foam around the edges to fortify the mattress and support you when you get in and out of bed.View image in fullscreenA deep fitted sheet is a must to cover the Origin Hybrid Pro.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe Hybrid Pro’s cool, silky sleeping surface is made from Tencel, a breathable, cushioned material made from wood pulp. Then there’s a 1.1cm layer of natural latex infused with graphite, followed by an organic bamboo-infused wool layer, which helps to regulate temperature and keep you cool at night.With eight layers (nine, if you include the non-slip base), the Hybrid Pro stacks up to a whopping 31cm, making it the deepest mattress I’ve tested. My standard double fitted sheet wasn’t snug enough to stay in place all night, so I recommend investing ina deeper fitted sheet. It’s heavy at 43kg, but Origin says you don’t need to turn or rotate it to keep it consistently supportive.Origin describes the Hybrid Pro as medium-firm, but my mattress-testing panel – made up of my family – thinks it’s firm, and gave it an 8.2/10 firmness score. When I stacked 7.5kg of weights on to the sleeping surface of the Hybrid Pro, it sank a maximum of 18mm, less than any other mattress I’ve tested. For comparison, the Eve Wunderflip Hybrid sank 40mm – and that’s advertised as medium-firm, too.Origin’s 200-night free trial gives you several months to test the mattress for yourself before deciding whether to keep it, and you also get a 15-year warranty.SpecificationsType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium-firm, panel rated as 8.2/10Depth:31cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:15 yearsOld mattress recycling:£54Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPUR approved; returned mattresses go to the British Heart FoundationDeliveryView image in fullscreenRemoving the plastic that kept the mattress secure during transit was challenging.Photograph: Jane HoskynThe Hybrid Pro is a bed-in-a-box mattress, so it was vacuum-shrunk in the factory before being delivered to my hallway in a big cardboard box. Its next-day courier delivery was quicker than most rivals, and the early evening two-hour delivery window was convenient. The ArrowXL couriers left the boxed mattress in my hallway, and my husband and I hauled it upstairs for unpacking on our slatted bed base.The thick layers of tight plastic that kept the mattress from expanding en route were a pain to remove, although this is standard with bed-in-a-box mattresses. Scissors are essential to remove the plastic, as is a careful hand to avoid nicking the mattress. Once released from its cocoon, the Hybrid Pro inflated much faster than others I’ve tested, although the surface isn’t consistently supportive until it’s had at least a day to fully expand.Ferrying the huge mattress to my sister’s house for sleep testing wasn’t easy. Luckily, Ben has a van – but the van couldn’t help us get the Hybrid Pro up their narrow stairs. We managed between the four of us, and wouldn’t want to do it again. Get your mattress upstairs while it’s still boxed, or ask the couriers to do it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They disliked the spongy surface of theEve Wunderflip Hybrid, and found even the sumptuousSimba Hybrid Pro“too flat and soft”, with too little room for air to move around their skin. The Origin’s “silky surface with long dents” was more to their liking.The pillowy Tencel surface provided enough cushioning to stop the mattress from feeling too hard, according to Maeve and Ben, who sleep mainly on their sides and occasionally on their backs. Beneath the Tencel, the layers provided strong orthopaedic pushback, which they loved. Ben, in particular, reported that his sleep improved as a result. He uses a Garmin watch to track his sleep quality – drawing on factors such as how long he stayed asleep and how many times he woke in the night – and his average sleep score increased from 67 (fair) to 82 (good).My testers also reported excellent motion isolation and hailed the “life-changing” failure to notice each other’s tossing and turning. This could be because they were used to sleeping on a bouncy sprung mattress. In my tests with a glass of water, the Hybrid Pro was an average performer, absorbing movement less well than the Eve and Simba mattresses but better than theOtty Original Hybridand theIkea Valevåg.On breathability, the Origin is the best-performing hybrid mattress I’ve tested. No mattress can actively cool you down unless you put your sheets in the freezer, but the Hybrid Pro’s cool surface, open-cell foam and other cooling materials successfully averted night-time clamminess for my testers. It performed well in my heat-retention tests, too, cooling down faster than all rivals, other thanIkea’s budget pocket sprung Valevåg.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreen‘You need strong arms to lift the corners of this thing.’Photograph: Jane HoskynAs with all the mattresses I tested, I shared the Hybrid Pro with my husband for two nights before handing it over to our relatives. We liked the puffy surface but found the overall tension too firm for comfort. When lying on my side, my hips and shoulders didn’t feel cradled as with the Otty and the Simba. That’s worth bearing in mind if, like me, you’re small or a side sleeper and need some cushioning.Then there’s the size issue. Origin says you don’t have to turn or rotate the Hybrid Pro, but you still have to change your bedsheets, and you need strong arms to lift the corners of this thing. My standard sheets didn’t fit on it securely enough to avoid crumpling in the night, so you may need to buy special deep fitted sheets.The lack of a removable cover surprised me, especially given the price of this mattress. It’s become standard for premium hybrids to have a fabric cover that you can unzip and wash in the machine, but here it’s sewn into place. The surface damages easily, too, as we discovered when assaulting it with weights, thermometers, boots and cat claws for our tests. Add a specialdeep mattress protectorto that bedsheet shopping list.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenOrigin’s materials are Oeko-Tex- and CertiPUR-certified.Photograph: Jane HoskynMany of the materials used in the Hybrid Pro are easily and widely recycled. Metal springs, wool, fabric and natural latex are all recyclable, although you will need to take them to the appropriate sections of a waste facility.Memory foam (low-resistance polyurethane foam) presents a tougher environmental challenge. It’s made using energy-intensive processes, and isn’t biodegradable or easily recyclable, so it oftenends up in landfill. To have it recycled by specialists, you need to pay a mattress company to collect it.Origin, like rivals includingOttyandSimba, will recycle your old mattresses, whether or not they’re made by the brand. Origin doesn’t recycle all the unwanted mattresses it receives, though. If they’re in good enough shape to be reused, it deep-cleans them and donates them through its charity partner, the British Heart Foundation. This collection service isn’t free, and Origin’s £54 fee is higher than Simba’s £50 and Otty’s £40.All Origin’s materials are certified byOeko-TexandCertiPURto minimise the impact on health and the environment, and Origin says its products are made “without mercury, lead and heavy metals, ozone depleters, formaldehyde, VOCs [or] phthalates regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission”. The company also aims to be net zero by 2030.Origin Hybrid Pro: should I buy it?This is a fabulously well-made and luxurious mattress that should last more than a decade.

But the real secret is just practice, practice, practiceAnna BerrillTue 27 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the bestloaf tobake for sandwiches, and any filling ideas?“Obviously I’m biased, but soft and squishy sourdough makes the best sandwiches,” saysMartha de Lacey, sourdough teacher and writer. “The flavour is so much more complex and exciting than anything else you could use, and the crumb can have a slight moistness to it, which really contributes to the mouthwatering lushness that you want in a sandwich.”That’s not to say sourdough doesn’t come without some provisos, mind. First, you want a loaf that’s been baked that same day (“Several hours earlier, ideally,” De Lacey says), with a tender crumb and a nice, thin, crisp crust that “isn’t too teeth-pullingly chewy”. As is often the case, success comes down to the quality of your ingredients: “Use really good flours, not just supermarket basics,” says De Lacey, who favours an 80:20 mix of strong white and granary, and “a pretty high hydration for the requisite soft crumb”. Then, try and try again. “Really practise your preferred sourdough tekkers until you can do it in your sleep. Honestly, the main trick to excellent sourdough is practice – boring but true!”Phil King, executive chef ofPophamsin London, meanwhile, stands by his bakery’s tin loaf made from a mix of white and 20% rye flour. “It needs to be recognisable as a white sandwich tin loaf, while also giving that earthy, nutty flavour associated with rye bread, only without the denseness.” To achieve something similar, King suggests taking a white bread recipe, cutting the yeast by 80% and using a two-stage rising process: “One before you shape it, then knock it back, put it in the tin and let it have another rise.” This will produce a fluffy texture and even crumb structure, so “you’re not left with large gaping holes that the filling falls through”. Alternatively, try something with a crust on both sides, says Richard Snapes, author ofBread & Butter: “An Italian-style bread such as focaccia or ciabatta, say. People are often scared of them, because they require a wet dough, but they’re not hard to make at home.”Sandwich construction, meanwhile, should be carried out as close to eating as possible, King says, starting with a fat barrier (butter, mayo, cream cheese) to stop moisture getting into the crumb, and balancing the fillings with the same attention you would give to a main meal. Snapes combines ricotta, olive oil, lemon zest and parmesan to spread on focaccia, then tops with charred asparagus (“if you eat meat, put some speck in there, too”).And, as summer rolls in, tomatoes are always on De Lacey’s agenda, with a very good home for them being a BLT with plenty of mayo (“homemade orHellmann’s, and absolutely nothing in between”), a load of crisp smoked streaky bacon and crunchy iceberg lettuce. “Anything you put in a salad will also be excellent in a sandwich,” King says, adding that you won’t go far wrong with tomatoes, a good dressing, loads of fresh herbs, maybe a few capers and definitely seasoned “to the max, because the bread will temper those flavours”. Otherwise, cool things down with cucumber: “Big chunks with fresh coriander chutney and loads of cream cheese.”It’s also worth considering sweet and savoury combos – think rhubarb jam, peanut butter and pancetta, which, King says, “is every shade of wild”. But sarnie satisfaction ultimately comes down to one thing, De Lacey says: “Be liberal with the moistness. There’s nothing worse than forcing a dry sandwich down your gullet.” *Shudders*Got a culinary dilemma?

Sure, it’s a made-up meal, but on a bank holiday, when that extra day feels like the best gift ever, it’s a meal that I like to adhere to. A slow morning, hopefully featuring some sun and all the socialising. There also seems to be less pressure with a brunch, compared with, say, a roast dinner. Whatever time you serve it, your guests will be thrilled. Throw in a bit of drama with this Dutch baby.

I’m worried the lack of traditional gender roles is affecting our sex lifeI love my partner, but our intimacy has become a lot less regular recentlyPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 27 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 06.23 EDTShareMy partner and I arein our mid-20s and we have been together for just over a year. They are non-binary and all of my previous relationships have been with women (I am a woman). I love my partner so much, but our intimacy has become a lot less regular over the course of our relationship. I wonderif it’s becauseof the absence of a strong feminine/masculine dynamic,where one person is expected to have a specific role. Do you have any advice for overcoming this?Are specific roles important to you? Are they important to your partner? This would be an enlightening conversation to have with them.I would not necessarily assume that your lowered sexual frequency is related to gender roles. Perhaps you need to create some separateness from your partner – not necessarily related to erotic connection, but in your lives generally.A drop in libido can be due to many possible factors, including stress, fatigue, medication side effects, and underlying relationship issues such as unexpressed resentment. And paradoxically, even a high degree of closeness in a relationship can reduce the erotic spark. If you always know what the other is thinking, and tend to finish each other’s sentences, you may begin to experience each other as familial, which creates barriers to eroticism. The sexual dynamic is usually more exciting when each partner is viewed by the other as a true individual, so consider adding the element of surprise to your daily activities as well as to your intimacy.There are many ways to experience each other as objects of desire as well as loving partners, so seek to experience each other differently. How we view ourselves in the context of our partners is extremely important. Be more creative with your approach and initiating of sex, and more playful in the moment. Stop repeating the same moves and allow yourselves the joy of erotic experimentation.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Although choosing the right pot for your plants is about more than just aesthetics, I believe every plant deserves a great pot, the same way as a piece of art is enhanced by a great frame. A good pot can elevate your plant.PrescriptionIf your plants are thriving, you can keep them in nursery pots. But consider repotting if they show signs of being rootbound, growth is slowing or water isn’t draining properly. Terracotta pots are porous, promoting airflow and moisture evaporation. These work well for plants that don’t like overwatering, such as cacti. Plastic or glazed ceramic pots are good for plants that need more moisture retention, such as ferns. Make sure your pots have drainage holes.PreventionYou should never repot more than one pot size up. If the pot is too big for your plant, the soil will hold on to too much water, causing root rot.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHouseplant clinicHouseplantsInteriorsHomesGardening advicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, OpenAI bets billions on its next act, and Trump’s crypto fans lose millionsBlake MontgomeryTue 27 May 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 10.07 EDTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week in tech: Apple struggles on multiple fronts, OpenAI grows increasingly ambitious, and Trump helps some of his fans lose money on cryptocurrency.Apple finds itself in three binds – tariffs, AI, and FortniteLong dominant and unassailable, Apple is showing signs of weakness. The CEO, Tim Cook, can’t tame Donald Trump’s threats of tariffs that would spike the price of an iPhone; Apple’s AI offerings pale against its competitors; and the company can’t win a Fortnite match – or a single battle in its legal war with Epic Games – to save its life.On Friday, the president threatened to levy a 25% tariff on any iPhone not made in the US. Trump said in the post: “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”The majority of iPhones have been assembled in China, where Trump has imposed whopping 145% tariffs on exports. Cook had obtained an exemption from those tariffs, and he said in an earnings call this month that the majority of iPhones sold in the US in the next quarter will “have India as their country of origin”. The move seemed meant to skirt political tensions between China and the US. No such luck, it seems.Cook had declined to accompany Trump on his trip to the Middle East last week, which irked the president, according tothe New York Times. Trump said as much out loud: Flanked by tech executives during a speech in Riyadh, he noted that Cook was not among them. The failure of fealty may cost Apple dearly.On the home front, Apple is facing criticism that has been mounting for months of its flailing efforts to integrate generative artificial intelligence into the iPhone and other products. The iPhone dominates in the US today, boasting a market share of more than half. With far fewer artificial intelligence products than Google, for example, the shine of Apple’s future dims. Watching Siri fail to play the right song yet again is far less appealing than being able to tell Google Assistant tomake a podcastabout a Wikipedia page I find intriguing.Read more aboutTrump’s tariff threats.Apple promised a suite of features brandedApple Intelligenceat its annual developer conference in 2024 that has yet to make a splash beyondbotched notification summaries. Insiders areleaking details of internal chaos in Apple’s AI department to the press, a rarity for a company that prides itself on aggressive secrecy. Apple’s competitors are suffusing every aspect of their new flagship phones with AI that the iPhone maker can’t match. Siri remains nearly as incapable as when she made her debut fifteen years ago. The Vision Pro, though not in the realm of AI, has been a flop, blemishing Apple’s sheen.On the legal front, Apple keeps losing its battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games, and it keeps playing the part of sore loser. In late April, a US federal judge found that the company had violated her order to allow app developers to link to their own payment options, even ones that skirt Apple’s App Store. The judge said a top Apple executive “outright lied under oath”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersNow Fortnite is back in the App Store after five years of exile, and Epic is empowered to circumvent Apple’s 15% to 30% commissions. Fortnite may be a popular game, but it’s not a significant portion of Apple’s overall revenue from the App Store. The upshot of the legal fight is that Apple’s grip on its tightly controlled software ecosystem is loosening, which may lead to an avalanche of developers eschewing in-app purchases and payments. That is the greater threat to Apple’s revenue from digital services.Read more aboutFortnite’s return.Bloomberg published astoryMonday questioning whether Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has gotten what he wanted by sucking up to Trump in these early days of the administration. It’s a fair question, but, on the whole, Zuckerberg has largely governed his digital empire unmolested by the second-term president. Henixed his company’s vaunted diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and perhaps that toll was enough to buy Trump’s inattention. It’s Cook who should be asking what he got in return for his$1m donation to Trump’s inauguration. He’s been dancing like an outlaw with a sheriff shooting at his feet these past few weeks.OpenAI’s week of massive expansion beyond ChatGPTView image in fullscreenJony Ive and Sam Altman.Composite: Getty ImagesOpenAI struck two multibillion-dollar deals this week, one on its home turf and one on a new frontier. The company is doing its utmost to expand beyond ChatGPT. Compare that with a major rival, Anthropic, which spent the week preoccupied with releasing a new version of its flagship model Claude. That’s either a total snooze or a strong focus on a core business, but I’m inclined to think it’s a bore. In an era when Google is worth $2tn and Microsoft $3.3tn, these are the kind of moves necessary to compete with the biggest players in the game. If you’re not going to buy a startup that has released no products but was founded by the designer of the iPhone for billions, you’re not playing to win.On Wednesday, the ChatGPT maker announced it would acquire Sir Jony Ive’s untested hardware startup, io, for $6.4bn. Dara Kerr reports: in CEO Sam Altman and Ive’s blogpost on Wednesday, they wrote that the io team will merge with OpenAI to work “more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco”. Ive himself will not join OpenAI as an employee, but his company will “take over design for all of OpenAI, including its software”, according toBloomberg.The goal of the merger seems clear: hire Ive to create an AI-infused hardware device as popular and iconic as the iMac or the iPhone. Whether there is a market for devices whose sole purpose is to deliver AI to the masses is less clear. The nearest analogue to what Ive might produce, the Humane Pin, likewise backed by Altman and designed by Apple alumni, did not take off.Read more aboutthe mammoth acquisition.On Thursday, OpenAI announced plans for an enormous data center in Abu Dhabi likely to cost tens of billions. The project is a part of Stargate, a $500bn investment in AI by the likes of Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI and Softbank. Stargate at first seemed like a domestic project, but Donald Trump’s deal with the UAE on AI and OpenAI’s announcement have made it a global initiative.The spotlight of the public’s attention is shining brightly on OpenAI’s CEO this week as the startup makes these major moves. Two new books, one laudatory and one critical, chronicle how OpenAI came to be the company it is today. The Optimist by the Wall Street Journal’s Keach Hagey offers a biography of Altman. Empire of AI by The Atlantic’s Karen Hao details the time between the founding and the spectacular 2023 ouster and reinstatement of Altman. With their shared debut, the two accounts offer dueling descriptions of Sam Altman’s character. They ask: which is he to you, gifted scion of progress or ruthless tycoon?Either way, by spending billions and hiring Apple’s second-most famous employee, it seems Altman is gunning for the title of the next Steve Jobs.Read more about this week’s AI newsGoogle unveils ‘AI Mode’ in the next phase of its journey to change searchEstonia eschews phone bans in schools and takes leap into AIAlabama paid a law firm millions to defend its prisons.

Nearly half of the top holders of $TRUMP lost money on their investments, according to an analysis by the Guardian. Niamh Rowe reports:Of the 220 winners, 95 – some 43% – have suffered a net loss from purchasing $Trump since the coin’s January launch, a combined $8.95m, according to trading history and portfolios as of 21 May.A contestant under the username “GAnt” appears to have endured the biggest losses. Despite placing fourth on the leaderboard, buying the tokens has led to a $1.06m shortfall. Similarly, user “Meow” is down $621,000, despite achieving VIP status.$TRUMP is often included under the umbrella of “memecoins”, a term that describes cryptocurrencies which reference or were inspired by internet trends. Trump himself is a primary driver of online culture the world over, especially in the cryptocurrency world, but he isn’t a meme in the same way that the Shiba Inu mascot of Dogecoin is.The definition of a memecoinput forward by Coinbase, the US’s largest exchange, fits $TRUMP in other ways, though. Coinbase describes memecoins as “typically supported by enthusiastic online communities” and “associated with entertainment rather than usability”.

Now ... where was I?Tue 27 May 2025 12.39 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 13.14 EDTShareName:TedTalksAge:Ted started in 1984.And has Ted been talking ever since?Ted– short for Technology, Entertainment, Design – is an American-Canadian non-profit media organisation that has an annual conference …I know, and they do the inspirational online talks.Correct, under the slogan “Ideas change everything”.Anyway, what about them?They’re shorter.The talks? Than what?Than before.How much shorter?Six minutes.Says who?SaysElif Shafak.The Turkish-British novelist?Novelist, essayist, public speaker, activist. She was talking at the Hay festival, in Wales.What did she say?That when she first did a Ted Talk she was given a limit of 19 minutes, but a decade later she was told to keep it to a trim 13.Why?That’s what she asked Ted.AndTed said?According to Shafak, TED said: “Well, the world’s average attention span has shrunk.”How did that make her feel?“Really sad. We are incapable of listening to a talk for more than a few minutes.” She went on to say that it was because we are living “in an age of hyper-information”.Too much to take in?Exactly. “We cannot process this much information,” she continued. “And in the long run it makes us tired, demoralised, then numb because we stop caring.”My god, sounds terminal. Is it true, that our attention spans have shrunk?A lack of long-term studies means we don’t know for sure, but the public seems to think it has.Tell me more. But get on with it.A study byKing’s College London in 2022found that 49% of people believe their attention spans have become shorter, 50% say they can’t stop checking their phones …Young people probably.Nope. Also a struggle for the middle-aged. And 50% of people also believed – wrongly – that the average attention span for adults today is just eight seconds.Sorry, what were we talking about again?Short attention spans.Oh yes. I knew that. What about books though, are they getting shorter too?Well, interestingly, a2015 studysuggested the opposite, that they were 25% longer than they were 15 years earlier.I’m sensing there’s a but coming.But the longlist for this year’s International Booker includes eight books that are less than 200 pages.What about films, they’re definitely getting longer, right?The short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: again,we just think they are, probably because of marketing. Studios want to incentivise people to spend money on a ticket, which they do by telling you it’s big, epic and special.Hang on, so we think attention is going down but it might not be, and films are getting longer, but they’re not?Very perceptive. Someone should do a Ted Talk about it.Do say:“Can you even change everything in 13 minutes?”Don’t say:“Hurry up, you’re losing the room.”Explore more on these topicsTedPass notesElif ShafakfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Taxing assets above £10m sounds a nice way to restrict the pain to a very small number of people, hence its 78% support among the public. But the experience of other countries is that a wealth tax on the super-rich simply doesn’t work (the IFS has manyexcellent articleson the subject).Wealth does need to be taxed more fairly, andequalising capital gains tax with income taxwould be a good start – easy to administer and yielding significant revenues. Making council tax fairer would result in a massive redistribution of wealth. And middle-income earners – the biggest segment of taxpayers – will need to pay higher taxes.Only the first of these is politically straightforward – the other two would need a much greater consensus around solidarity and fair contribution than exists in Britain today, and politicians need to start laying the groundwork for that now if the tax system is to be made fairer.Duncan CraigLondonIt is inarguable that Britain’s economy has, as you say, become “a machine for the upward redistribution of wealth” – a dynamic surely fuelling the fear-driven rightward drift of our politics. Yet contemporary surface trends alone cannot explain this volcano of discontent. A surprising amount of inequality remains rooted deep in mercenary medieval violence, bequeathing us a land ownership pattern that never seems to change.So, of course, as long as our public realm is threadbare, target the newly income-wealthy, but do not forget to tax the hoarders of these unearned historical assets (eg through land value tax). And never permit the affluent and privileged to criticise our struggling public services while arguing for tax cuts for their ilk.Dr Brendan HillEdinburghWhat is the purpose of a majority of British people being in favour of a wealth tax when too many non-productive UK billionaires dictate and control our trickle-up economy to their advantage? Is it ignorance, fear and cowardice that diverts the minds of too many parliamentary leaders and economists away from fairness and decency?Tax Justice UK is correct. A relatively modest wealth tax would enable practical moves towards equality, not least for students and staff in further and higher education. The government needs to give moral leadership, and here are policies for meaningful ways forward.Barry JonesEmeritus professor, Brunel University of LondonYour editorial ignores three factors: wealth is reinvested (alienate it and there is less to sustain our economy); inheritance and wealth taxes amount to double taxation (they are major disincentives to the wealth creation on which high-spending economies depend); in terms of the first tranche of taxation, that on income and in terms of “who pays the bills”, thetop 1% pay 30% of income tax, the top 10%, 60% and the top 50%, 90%.Better public services depend on the encouragement of wealth creation, not its disincentivisation.David BiesterfieldEglingham, NorthumberlandThe reason we have so many billionaires (and such an egregiously skewed distribution of wealth) is simply that our political parties depend on, and are beholden to, their billionaire funders.Jon MarksTring, HertfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I’m a British woman raising my two young children in Portugal, which I would describe as family-oriented. Here, children are naturally integrated into everyday life, and the sense of solidarity that Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett refers to (19 May) is the norm.A cornerstone of this community-based approach is high-quality, accessible childcare. Nurseries are staffed by experienced professionals and are affordable, if not free. Here, it’s normal for babies to attend nursery full-time from the age of six months.By contrast, when I told peers in the UK that my children attended nursery full-time from 12 months, I was met with thinly veiled disapproval. The individualistic approach to parenting in the UK is ingrained. InPortugal, accessible childcare significantly eases the load on parents. Instead of debating parenting styles, perhaps we should focus on the social frameworks that support or strain families.Su WeeksLisbon, PortugalHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Thirty-two others were killed the following day in a separate attack in the nearby Ahume and Aondona villages.“It’s a pathetic situation,” Omnin told the press on Tuesday. “As we speak, we are still recovering corpses.”According to Reuters, a Catholic priest was also shot in the area by the assailants, and the office of the Benue governor, Hyacinth Iormem Alia, who is also a priest, said he had been wounded and was in a critical but stable condition.“They killed women and even children as young as two years old,” one resident of the area told the Daily Trust, which focuses on northernNigeria.Parts of central and north-western Nigeria have experienced waves of violent attacks as itinerant Fulani herders and Indigenous farmers clash when cows often left to graze openly sometimes stray on to farms.In some villages, farmers have accused herders of being initial perpetrators and then banded into vigilante groups and militia to embark on reprisal attacks. And while many analysts blame the climate crisis and overpopulation for the conflict as pastoral land diminishes across the country, the villagers allege land-grabbing and ethnic cleansing.According to Nextier’s Nigeria Violent Conflicts Database, at least 2,347 casualties were recorded in 359 incidents involving farmers and herders across Nigeria between 2020 and 2024. Some experts and locals say the numbers are conservative, as many of the incidents and fatalities are often undocumented.The situation is especially prevalent in central Nigeria, known as the middle belt, where the conflict has religious undertones as the herders are usually Muslim and the farmers Christian. In April, 56 people were reportedly killed by herders during the Easter period in Benue state.The conflict has also disrupted farming activities in Benue, an agrarian state known as the “Food Basket of the Nation” for producing significant amounts of Nigeria’s main food crops, such as yams, maize and soybeans.Last year, the Benue state government announced that it would begin full implementation of a law enacted in 2017 banning open grazing and establishing ranches. That is yet to happen, some residents of the state claim.“The relentless violence must end,” Asema Achado, a federal lawmaker, saidin a statementlast October. “Our farmers are the backbone of our economy, yet they live in constant fear.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It prescribes the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality”, drawing strong condemnation from human right campaigners.The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, called the legislation“shocking and discriminatory”.Researchers interviewed 59 people, including families, rights organisations, activists, journalists and parliamentarians between August 2022 and April 2025. The organisation wrote to several government offices and officials to request information, but none responded.Oryem Nyeko, a senior HRW researcher, said: “For the last two years, LGBT Ugandans have suffered a range of abuses because of the government’s wilful decision to legislate hate against them.“The Ugandan authorities need to urgently improve this environment, which enables a wide range of human rights violations and puts countless Ugandans at serious risk of abuse,” he said.The Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF) reported last July that 667 of the cases handled by its legal aid network in the previous 14 months involved human rights violations affecting 850 LGBTQ+ people. These included evictions, violence and arrests.Clare Byarugaba, a LGBTQ+ rights activist in the capital, Kampala, said: “The human cost of the draconian anti-homosexuality law is very high, and this new report by HRW provides further evidence of the consequences of Uganda’s state sponsored homophobia and transphobia.‘I can’t stop now’: Uganda’s anti-LGBTQ+ law forces climate activist into exileRead more“Continued enforcement legitimises discrimination, exclusion and violence. We need protection, not criminalisation,” she said, adding that the bill was unconstitutional and did not reflect the values of a democratic nation.“We want to live in Uganda as productive citizens without the threat of criminalisation and violence at every waking moment,” she said. “Our human rights are inherent and have never been up for debate.”View image in fullscreenA supreme court clerk in Kampala catalogues documents received after human rights advocates filed an appeal against a ruling on an anti-LGBTQ law.Photograph: Abubaker Lubowa/ReutersUganda’s human rights record continues to deteriorate under Museveni’s four-decade-long rule. HRW is calling on the authorities to stop their clampdown and put an end to hate speech.In April last year, Uganda’s constitutional courtrejected a petition to overturn the bill, upholding its most radical and abusive provisions.Nyeko said: “The state-sanctioned bigotry and discrimination that has only become more entrenched in Uganda over the past two years has no place in a society that upholds human rights and the rule of law.“Uganda should end its assault on LGBT people and choose a future of dignity, equality and freedom for all those who live there,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentYoweri MuseveniUgandaLGBTQ+ rightsAfricaHuman rights (Global development)Human rights (Law)newsShareReuse this content"

The 75 nations’ debt formed the bulk of the total $35bn calculated by Lowy for 2025.“Now, and for the rest of this decade,Chinawill be more debt collector than banker to the developing world,” the report said.The pressure to repay was putting strain on local funding for health and education as well as climate change mitigation.China spent $240bn on belt and road bailouts from 2008 to 2021, study findsRead more“China’s lending has collapsed exactly when it is needed most, instead creating large net financial outflows when countries are already under intense economic pressure,” it said.The loans were largely issued under President Xi Jinping’s signature belt and road initiative (BRI), a state-backed global infrastructure investment programme which has underwritten national projects from schools, bridges and hospitals to major roads and shipping and air ports.The lending spree turned China into thelargest supplier of bilateral loans, peaking with a total of more than $50bn in 2016 – more than all western creditors combined.The BRIfocused primarily in developing nations, where governments struggled to access private or other state-backed investment. But the practice has raised concerns aboutChinese influence and controland drawn accusations that Beijing was seeking to entrap recipient nations with unserviceable debt. Last month another analysis by the Lowy Institute found thatLaos was now trapped in a severe debt crisis, in part because of over-investment in the domestic energy sector, mostly financed by China.China’s government denies accusations it deliberately creates debt traps, and recipient nations have also pushed back, saying China was a more reliable partner and offered crucial loans when others refused.But the Lowy report said the record high debt now due to China could be used for “political leverage”, noting that it comes amid huge cuts to foreign aid by the Trump administration.The report also highlighted new large-scale loans given to Honduras, Nicaragua, Solomon Islands, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic, all within 18 months of those countries switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing.China also continues to finance some strategic partners, including Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Laos and Mongolia, as well as countries that produce critical minerals and metals, such as Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia.But the situation also put China in a bind, pulled between diplomatic pressure torestructure unsustainable debt in vulnerable nationsand domestic pressure to recall loans amid China’s own economic downturn.China publishes little data on its BRI scheme, and the Lowy Institute said its estimates – based on World Bank data – likely underestimated the full scale of China’s lending. In 2021 AidData estimatedChina was owed a “hidden debt”of about $385bn.Explore more on these topicsChinaAfricaAsia PacificGlobal economyDebt reliefEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The speech is written by the prime minister’s office in consultation with staff at the king’s office.1:38King Charles tells Canadian parliament that country will stay 'strong and free' – videoThe king made no direct reference to Trump but his language was closely watched for implicit criticisms of the US president and his dramatic recasting of the US relationship with Canada.“Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect,” said Charles, telling attenders, that by “staying true to Canadian values”, the country could “build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians”.The king alluded to efforts to ease tensions with the US. “The prime minister and the president of the United States, for example, have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the US, rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests, to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.”Sitting next to Queen Camilla, the king also alluded to the last time a monarch opened a new parliament nearly seven decades earlier, when his late mother visited Ottawa.Queen Elizabeth said during her 1957 speech that “against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself”. Charles said that he took great pride in the way in which “Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.”The symbolic visit came as Canadians remain uncertain of what role they want the monarchy to play in the future. In 2023, polling firm Ipsos polling found nearly 70% of Canadians said the royal family should not play a prominent role in Canadian society. But that figure has dropped to 56%in new polling released Tuesday, showing a warming towards the monarchy, in part due to a deteriorating relationship with the US.Crown questions to fore as king visits Canada amid tensions with TrumpRead moreStill, not every party in parliament supported the presence of Charles. The separatist Bloc Québécois was absent – as they typically are during the speech – in protest of the address by a “foreign king”.“To assert Canada’s sovereignty, we seek the symbol of the fact that Canada has the King of England as its sovereign,” said leader Yves-François Blanchet in the days leading up to the speech. “There is a complete inconsistency which seems to reflect [prime minister Mark]Carney’s personal sympathies rather than a relevant reading of Quebec’s sensibility.”Representatives of Inuit, Métis and First Nations peoples were present in the senate after welcoming the king to Ottawa on Monday. Indigenous leaders have described the visit as a meaningful reminder of the centuries-long bond between Canada’s first inhabitants and the British crown – the two signatories of the many treaties which created the foundations of what would later become Canada.“The King’s visit is an opportunity to highlight the nation-to-nation relationship between First Nations and the Crown. We are allies with a sacred perpetual relationship that cannot be broken,” Assembly of First Nations national Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak said in a statement. “The British Crown and First Nations are foundational to the creation of Canada. We also are distinct nations bound together by peace and friendship.”Woodhouse Nepinak said Charles, as King of Canada, “carries a responsibility to uphold the Treaties that protect our rights”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasKing Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

We have similar visions about the path forward,” Lugones said.Kennedy, a controversial Trump pick for health secretary given his vaccine skepticism, is also expected to meet with Milei during his visit.In a video broadcast at the WHO’s annual assembly last week, he urged other governments to withdraw from the agency and create other institutions.In his speech, Kennedy alleged that the UN health agency was under undue influence from China, gender ideology and the pharmaceutical industry.The Argentinian government also announced a “structural review” of national health agencies to “organize, update, and make transparent the structures and processes” of the health system “that for years operated with overlaps, outdated regulations and limited oversight”.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaWorld Health OrganizationRobert F Kennedy JrAmericasHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Phillips had completed less than half of it at the time of his death.“Finishing it was important to show that Dom and Bruno’s voices were not silenced,” saidPhillips’ widow, Alessandra Sampaio, who oversaw the project.Meanwhile, a new Guardian podcast series,Missing in the Amazon, will be released on 5 June to mark the third anniversary oftheir murders in the remote Javari valley region.The podcast is the fruit of a three-year investigation by Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin American correspondent, who joined the 10-day search for Dom Phillips and Pereira after they vanished in June 2022.“When discussing the case, everybody talked about the British journalist and the Brazilian Indigenous expert, but I don’t know if we ever really found out so much about who these men were,” said Phillips.Bruno Pereira and Dom Phllips were killed in the Amazon. Their Indigenous allies risk death to carry on the workRead more“I don’t think we ever heard so much from the people who loved them, cared about them and respected them – about who they were, where they came from, why they were doing what they were doing. And that’s something that we’ve tried to make a big part of the podcast,” he added.“This podcast is about Dom and Bruno – told by the people who knew them best, many of whom are speaking for the first time,” said Nicole Jackson, the Guardian’s global head of audio.“It’s also the story of what Dom and Bruno cared so much about: the Amazon and the Indigenous people who are trying to protect it. It’s about their future and the future of the world’s biggest rainforest.”Pereira and Phillips wereambushed and killednear the Amazon town of Atalaia do Norte while returning from a reporting trip to the edge of theJavari valley, one of Brazil’s largest Indigenous territories. Soon after the men’s remains were found, Sampaio and some of Phillips’s closest friends decided to complete his unfinished book.“Everybody deals with grief differently and, in this case, it was grief mixed with horror and anger,” said Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, who helped plan the project, alongside Sampaio, Phillips’ literary agent, Rebecca Carter, and the journalists Andrew Fishman, David Davies and Tom Hennigan.“Everyone knew that this book had to be finished,” said Fishman, a co-founder of the Intercept Brasil. “It would be completely unthinkable to let what happened to them be the end of Dom’s project.”The first step in the process was understanding how much Phillips had already written.Sampaio handed Fishman a black suitcase that had belonged to her husband, filled with reporter’s notebooks, laptops, old mobile phones and external hard drives.“Dom was extremely organised, but not the greatest at encryption. So it was relatively easy to get all his work together,” he said.Phillips’s notes, however, proved more challenging, due to his idiosyncratic handwriting; in the end they had to be “translated” by one of his sisters, Sian, and an old friend, John Mitchell.It was an extraordinarily healing and uplifting process to get to know these people ... We were suddenly very much united by his lossRebecca Carter, Phillips’s literary agentOnce they were able to review the material, the editorial team concluded that Phillips had completed the introduction and three and a half chapters – and left notes and outlines for another six.The team decided the work should be completed by reporters who had known Dom and were also experts in covering the Amazon, selecting Tom Phillips, the Brazilian reporter Eliane Brum, former Reuters reporter Stuart Grudgings and the New Yorker’s Jon Lee Anderson.The Indigenous leader Beto Marubo and activist Helena Palmquist wrote the afterword.“It was an extraordinarily healing and uplifting process to get to know these people – these friends of Dom’s who I had had no connection with before,” said Carter, to whom Phillips first pitched the book in 2020. “We were suddenly very much united by his loss – and also the determination to make this happen.”All of the contributors waived their fees, but to cover the costs of logistically complex reporting trips to the Amazon, the book relied on a fellowship from the Alicia Patterson Foundation (awarded to Phillips in 2021), grants from Whiting Creative and the Fund for Investigative Journalism, a donation from Teresa Bracher, and support from hundreds of crowdfunding backers.Other journalists volunteered to edit the manuscript, and photographers contributed their images to the book. Dozens more supported the project in other ways – from factchecking to helping with outreach and social media.Although it is Phillips’s book, Pereira is an essential character. The two men first met in 2018 during areporting trip to the Javari for the Guardian, and Dom deeply admired Bruno’s work.Investigations concluded thatthe killers had targeted Pereirain retaliation for his efforts to combat illegal fishing – often backed by organised crime – in the Javari valley.The murders took place during the environmentally catastrophic 2019-2023 administration of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who was widely criticized for his sluggish response to the disappearances of Phillips and Pereira and called their trip “an ill-advised adventure”.A deadly mission: how Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira tried to warn the world about the Amazon’s destructionRead moreSince defeating Bolsonaro in the 2022 election, the leftist presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvahas made the Indigenous cause and the Amazon priorities, launching major operations to evict illegal miners from areas such as the Yanomami and Kayapó territories and achieving a major reduction in deforestation.However, Marubo – who was close friends with Pereira and works for the Javari valley Indigenous association – said that despite noticeable improvements since Bolsonaro’s departure, Lula’s effortswere still falling short: “You can’t fight illegality and the spread of organised crime with two or three isolated operations … We need government action that is continuous and coordinated,” he said.“Unfortunately, if Dom and Bruno were working here today, they would be killed again,” he said.Three local men were later charged with their murders, while a fourth has been charged withordering the crime. All are in custody awaiting trial.“I strongly believe in justice,” said Sampaio, Phillips’s widow. “We hope for things to move more quickly, but my lawyers have told me that the case is progressing as it should,” she said.Sampaio, Marubo and other book contributors have travelled to the UK to take part in launch events at theHay festival (31 May), inLancaster (3 June)and inLondon (5 June).“It makes me very happy that the book has been completed,” said Sampaio. “We carry on with the sadness, but we carry on because we must.”How to Save the Amazon: A Journalist’s Deadly Quest for Answersis published in the UK, US and Brazil on 27 May.

This is a positive event, and I hope that they will,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday, saying the EU would be “very happy and successful” if it agreed a deal.However, the president also repeated criticism of Brussels’ negotiators and defended his decision on Fridayto threaten a 50% tariff on EU importsfrom 1 June, which hepostponed two days later until 9 July.“I was extremely satisfied with the 50% tariff allotment on theEuropean Union, especially since they were slow walking (to put it mildly!), our negotiations with them,” he wrote.In what appeared to be another veiled threat on potential further tariffs, he added that he was empowered to “set a deal” if the US was “unable to make a deal” or was “treated unfairly”.Nevertheless, the president’s comments and his weekend U-turn on 50% border taxes helped lift US markets, which had been closed on Monday. The S&P 500 rose 2%, while the Dow Jones added 1.7% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was up by 2.4%.Brussels sources said the way had now been cleared for detailed negotiations, with an expectation that the EU commissioner for trade, Maroš Šefčovič, would meet the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meeting in Paris on Tuesday next week.A team of officials are also expected in Washington in the coming days for technical talks. However, sources said the EU’s approach had not changed, with the target being a deal in which both sides move to zero tariffs on industrial goods, and the EU buys more soya beans, arms and liquefied natural gas.Trump’s latest comments came asEmmanuel Macronwarned Vietnamese students about the consequences of impulsive superpowers in a swipe at Trump’s chaotic tariff policies.During a six-day south-east Asian tour, the French president said that “on the impulse of a superpower, everything can change”. On Trump’s policies in the US, he said tariffs were being imposed “according to the side of the bed on which he woke up”.After the weekend’s tariff flip-flopping, there is evidence that EU policymakers are scrambling to get a handle on the scale of European direct investment in the US with requests going out to industry leaders to share their investment plans.Members of the Confederation of European Business, also known as BusinessEurope, an alliance of 42 federations across the region, received a survey from the European Commission on Monday. It asked for information on upcoming US investments, with the instruction to respond as soon as possible, one source said.A similar note seeking information on investment plans for the next five years was sent to the 59-person European Round Table for Industry, which represents industry and the tech sector. The petition for information came with a note saying the request had came personally from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, Trump touted investments from US companies including the chip maker Nvidia and the pharma giant Johnson & Johnson – both of which have a large presence in Europe – as evidence that histariff strategywas paying off with the repatriation of jobs to the US.European and Asian stock markets also rose on Tuesday as investors continued to react positively to Trump’s decision to backtrack on Friday’s tariff threat.Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer at London’s Zaye Capital Markets, told CNBC that the tariffs delay had sparked a “tentative risk-on rally”.“Looking ahead, the EU-US trade dance is a high-stakes tango, with July 9 as the next flashpoint,” he said. The EU was dangling phased tariff cuts and “mutual respect” talks, but he warned businesses to “buckle up; this ride’s far from over”.Explore more on these topicsInternational tradeDonald TrumpEuropean UnionTrump tariffsTariffsEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The challenge has been gaining traction on social media over recent weeks, with videos on TikTok and Instagram of mostly men running at full-speed into one another clocking up tens of millions of views.“While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity,” Grantham said.The tragedy follows a championship Run It Straight event hosted in Auckland last week, which resulted in two men retiring due to head injuries. One of the menappeared to have a seizure, RNZ reported.The event’s organisers, RUNIT promotes the sport on its website as “the world’s fiercest new collision sport” which rewards “strength and grit”.More than 1000 people turned up to watch eight men compete for $20,000 prize money, with the winners heading to a final competition next month, to compete for $250,000.In a statement to the Guardian, RUNIT said the teenager’s death was tragic.“Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments, which include professional medical supervision and support,” it said.It said its events screen participants, have strict guidelines around how and where to tackle, conduct medical assessments before and after the competition and have medical staff on hand.“We do not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions”.Melanie Bussey, a professor in the school of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at University of Otago said Run It-style tackles can increase the likelihood of serious brain trauma.Sports associations and governing bodies were working hard to improve the welfare of players and reduce preventable injuries, and the introduction of a high-risk sport seem “not only counterproductive but deeply concerning”, she said.Patria Hume, a Human Performance professor at AUT warned the public about the risk of injury and death from playing the sport.“[The] death was preventable,” she said. “We need people to stop participating in activities where the intention is to hurt someone.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It claimed contamination had been limited and thatFrancealways behaved transparently and with respect for local inhabitants’ health.The publication of Toxique – based on the investigation by Disclose, Princeton University’s science and global security programme and Interprt, an environmental justice research collective – caused a furore in France, prompting visits to French Polynesia by a minister and the president, Emmanuel Macron, who acknowledged France’s “debt” to the region.In one 1974 test alone, thescientific researchfound, 110,000 people – the population of Tahiti and its nearby islands – could have received a radiation dose high enough to qualify them for compensation if they later developed one of 23 different cancers.Toxique alleged the CEA has long underestimated the radiation levels involved, significantly limiting the numbers eligible for compensation: by 2023, fewer than half the 2,846 compensation claims submitted had even been judged admissible.‘Never forget’: Pacific countries remember nuclear test legacy as weapons ban treaty debatedRead moreThe parliamentary inquiry, which has so far called more than 40 politicians, military personnel, scientists and victims, is due to report before the end of May on the social, economic and environmental impact of the tests – and whether France knowingly concealed the extent of contamination.The CEA’s military division, CEA/DAM, the inventor of France’s atomic bomb, has repeatedly called this a “false assertion”. But France’s nuclear safety body, the ASNR, has since acknowledged “uncertainties associated with [the CEA’s] calculations” and confirmed to the parliamentary inquiry that it was impossible to prove people received radiation doses lower than the compensation threshold.The CEA said in a statement that the aim of its booklet “was to provide Polynesians in particular with the elements to understand” the tests and their impact. It said the booklet applied “the necessary scientific rigour” to explain “the health and environmental consequences of the tests” in a “factual and transparent manner”.Endless fallout: the Pacific idyll still facing nuclear blight 77 years onRead moreVincenzo Salvetti, a former head of the CEA/DAM and a member of the 2022 mission to French Polynesia, denied the booklet was intended as the CEA’s official version of events or a response to Toxique.He said previous CEA publications – particularly a 2006 report that the Toxique researchers calculate underestimated the actual radioactive contamination levels of one nuclear test by a factor of three – had been “much too technical”.Salvetti confirmed, however, that the booklet stated that the health of Polynesia’s inhabitants had been a “constant concern” of the French state and that France had behaved throughout “with a transparency without precedent or international equivalent”.Nonetheless, the inquiry has heard that the CEA/DAM has so far declassified only 380 documents in the four years since Macron demanded “greater transparency” around the tests and their consequences – compared with 173,000 declassified by the army.Jérôme Demoment, the director of CEA/DAM, told the parliamentary inquiry earlier this year that it was “highly likely, if we were to have to manage [nuclear tests] today, that the system put in place would respond to a different logic”.Forty-six of France’s nuclear tests were atmospheric, exposing the local population, site workers and French soldiers who were stationed in Polynesia at the time to high levels of radiation before the testing programme was moved underground in 1974.Radiation-related thyroid, breast and lung cancers, as well as leukaemia and lymphoma, are prevalent across the islands. For its part, the French army has said up to 2,000 military personnel could have been exposed to enough radiation to cause cancer.“The notion of a ‘clean bomb’ has generated controversy, which I fully understand,” Demoment told the parliamentary inquiry. “No nuclear test generating radioactive fallout can be considered clean.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsFrench PolynesiaAsia PacificPacific islandsFranceSouth PacificCancernewsShareReuse this content"

Others have made headlines for their supposed impudence – Ōjisama (Prince) and Akuma (Devil).Seiko Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater and track cyclist who later headed theTokyo 2020 organising committee, caused a stir when she named her sons Girishia (Greece) and Torino (Turin), because they were born the year the summer and winter Olympics were held in those locations. Having selected the kanji herself, Hashimoto knew how to pronounce them, but others would have been left scratching their heads.Parents have defended their choices as a show of individual flair in a society where the pressure to conform can be overwhelming, particularly when it comes to raising children.While most of the 3,000 or so kanji permitted by the revised law have multiple conventional readings, some characters have the linguistic flexibility to accommodate more bizarre phonetics. Shock factor aside, officials have complained that – at first sight – many are simply unpronounceable.Now, parents who have selected pronunciations that clearly deviate from convention will be asked to explain their choice of name in writing and, if necessary, come up with an acceptable alternative.While media reports suggest only the most egregious examples will be rejected, the phonetic requirement is a rare change to Japan’s family register, orkoseki– a legal record that lists the names and dates of birth of the head of the household, their spouse and their children.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificBaby namesParents and parentingFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

Range restrictions on both were lifted in May 2024.The Kremlin had said on Monday that any new decision to scrap range limits was “quite dangerous” and “contrary to our efforts to reach a political settlement”.Merz’s initial comments also drew criticism from leading Social Democrats.MP Ralf Stegner, an SPD foreign policy expert and frequent critic of arms shipments to Ukraine, called the remarks “not helpful” and “wrong” and demanded redoubled “diplomatic efforts”.Vice-chancellor Lars Klingbeil of the Social Democrats insisted there was “no new agreement that goes beyond what the previous government did” on range restrictions.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, used the confusion over Merz’s initial remarks to question the calibre of people who had risen to power in leading European countries, Reuters reported.Merz “said yesterday with such pretentiousness that from now on and forever there are no restrictions on the range of strikes” before placing the policy in context, Lavrov told reporters at a meeting in Moscow with the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan.Asked aboutDonald Trump’s commentthat Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely crazy” with the latest offensive, Lavrov said that the US president was showing “emotion” as he was watching his efforts for peace in Ukraine sabotaged by European politicians.In what Ukraine called a weekend of “terror”,Russia battered Kyivover three nights with massive air attacks, fuelling calls from western partners for an immediate ceasefire.However, Merz said on Tuesday that a halt to the fighting appeared far out of reach, despite Russian and Ukrainian officials holding direct talks for the first time in three years earlier this month.“Wars typically end because of economic or military exhaustion on one side or on both sides, and in this war we are obviously still far from reaching that,” Merz said at a joint news conference with the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, in Turku.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table,” the White House’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told AFP in a statement.Biden imposed sweeping sanctions after Russia’s invasion. Trump has so far avoided what he says could be “devastating” sanctions on Russian banks.But Trump’s recent rebukes mark a major change from his previous attitude towards Putin, whom he often speaks of with admiration and has previouslyheld off criticizing.Trump has, however, expressed increasing frustration with Moscow’s position in deadlocked truce negotiations with Kyiv.That frustration boiled over at the weekend when Russia launched a record drone barrage atUkraine, killing at least 13 people.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also unanimously backed a less contentious law establishing a right to palliative care in specialist end-of-life institutions.Both votes are the start of a long parliamentary process that will require the bills to move on to the Senate – the upper house – and then back to the lower house – the National Assembly – for a second reading, meaning they are unlikely to become law before next year.The government has describedthe right-to-die lawas “an ethical response to the need to support the sick and the suffering”, insisting it was “neither a new right nor a freedom … but a balance between respect and personal autonomy”.The legislation would allow a medical team to decide if a patient is eligible to “gain access to a lethal substance when they have expressed the wish”. Patients would be able to use it themselves or have it administered by a nurse or doctor “if they are in no condition physically to do so themselves”.Patients must meet a number of strict conditions: they must be over 18, hold French citizenship or residency and suffer from a “serious and incurable, life-threatening, advanced or terminal illness” that is “irreversible”.The disease must cause “constant, unbearable physical or psychological suffering” that cannot be addressed by medical treatment, and the patient must be capable of “expressing freely and in an informed manner” their wish to end their life.The bill – referred to in France as a law on “end of life” or “aid in dying” rather than “assisted dying” or “euthanasia” – was backed by most of Emmanuel Macron’s centrist MPs and their allies and by the left, with most right and far-right deputies voting against.All parliamentary groups were given a free vote to express their personal convictions. Euthanasia is a highly sensitive subject inFrance, a country with a longstanding Catholic tradition, and the bill is also opposed by many health workers.“The French people are ready for this, and we owe them this rendezvous with history,” said Stéphane Delautrette, a Socialist party MP during the session. The laws would be “the measure of this parliament, in the footsteps of major social advances” such as the right to abortion and the abolition of the death penalty, he said.But Patrick Hetzel, a deputy from the centre-right Les Républicains, said it was “illusory to and even dangerous to even think of debating a legalisation of euthanasia without having first fully deployed proper access to palliative care.”The prime minister, François Bayrou, a devout Catholic, had said he had “questions” and would abstain if he were an MP, but Macron said last year that France needed the legislation because “there are situations you cannot humanely accept”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hopefully France will steadily align itself with other European countries,” Gemmani said. “Forcing people to go to Belgium or Switzerland, pay €10,000 or €15,000 … The current situation is just wrong.”Opinion polls show most French people are in favour of assisted dying, but France has been slower than many European neighbours to legalise it. Others are actively debating the issue, including the UK, where an assisted dying billis before parliament.Active euthanasia, where a caregiver induces death at the request of the patient, and assisted suicide, where doctors provide the patient with the means to end their life themselves, have been legal in the Netherlands and Belgium since 2002.Both countries apply roughly similar conditions – a doctor and an independent expert must agree the patient is suffering unbearably and without hope of improvement – and have since extended the right to children under 12.Luxembourg also decriminalised active euthanasia and assisted dying in 2009. Active euthanasia is outlawed in Switzerland, but assisted dying has been legal since the 1940s and organisations such as Exit and Dignitas have helped thousands of Swiss nationals, residents and others to end their lives.UK membership of Dignitas soars by 24% as assisted dying in Scotland moves closerRead moreAustria legalised assisted dying in 2022, while Spain adopted a law in 2021 allowing euthanasia and medically assisted dying for people with a serious and incurable illness, providing they are capable and conscious, the request was made in writing, reconfirmed later, and approved by an evaluation committee.Portugal decriminalised euthanasia in 2023 but the measure has not yet come into force after certain articles were rejected by the constitutional court.In the UK, MPsapproved the legalisationof assisted dying in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of under six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves, in a first vote in November last year.MPs must now vote on whether the text, amended in May to allow medics to opt out, is sent to the upper chamber for further scrutiny. The Scottish parliament has alsopassed its first voteon a bill to legalise assisted dying.Explore more on these topicsFranceAssisted dyingEuropeEmmanuel MacronEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose by 31.3%. Total car registrations rose most for the Chinese state-owned manufacturer SAIC, owner of the British brand MG, and the Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi.This year sales at Tesla have fallen in some of its biggest markets and there have beenpolitical protests at some of its showrooms. In the UK, the company registered just 512 new vehicles in April, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, down 62% from a year earlier.1:28Global protests against Tesla CEO Elon Musk – videoSpeaking at the Qatar Economic Forum last week, Musk told Bloomberg that while Europe was Tesla’s weakest market, it was “strong everywhere else”, and although it had “lost some sales paths on the [political] left”, it had “gained them on the right”.Tesla reported a 13% drop in vehicle sales in the first three months of this year, which made itthe worst quarter since 2022. However, shares in Tesla have rallied by about 25% in the past month, after reports that Musk will bereducing his time spent advising the Trump administration. Tesla shares are still down 6% in the year to date.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The act also includes tough provisions to protect children online, including preventing damage to mental health caused by seeing adult content.According to the commission, all four platforms had one-click self-declarations to verify age, which it deemed ineffective to prevent under-18s from viewing adult content.“Today is a good day for minor protection online in the EU, because with the enforcement actions that we are launching … against four very large online platforms with pornographic, adult content, we are clearly showing that we mean it when it comes to the effective protection of minors under the DSA,” an EU official told reporters.There was no fixed timetable to complete the investigation, the official said, while stressing “a commitment to act relatively fast on potential next steps, depending on what the reaction of the platforms will be”.The platforms could resolve the investigation by producing forms of age verification deemed effective by EU regulators. But if the complaint is upheld they could be fined up to 6% of global annual turnover.Under the DSA, the commission regulates platforms with more than 45 million users, such as Google, Meta and X, while national authorities in the 27 member states are responsible for those below this threshold.The commission said on Tuesday that Stripchat was no longer designated a “very large online platform”, after an appeal by the company, meaning its activities would in future be regulated by Cyprus, where its parent company, Technius Ltd, is based, rather than Brussels.The investigation into age verification tools will continue, however, as the new designation does not apply until September.Stripchat’s child protection obligations remain the same.The parent company of Pornhub, Aylo Freesites, said it was aware of the commission’s investigation and “fully committed” to ensuring the safety of minors online.“We will always comply with the law,” the company said. “We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users’ ages at the point of access – the users’ devices – and for websites to deny or permit access to age-restricted materials based on that verification.”Technius was approached for comment. A Brussels-based lawyer who has recently represented the parent companies of XVideos (WebGroup Czech Republic) and XNXX (NKL Associates) in EU legal proceedings was also contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeChildrenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of thousands walked through Israeli military lines to reach the new distribution centre in Rafah on Tuesday.But the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was not prepared for them and staff at one point were forced to abandon their posts.“At one moment in the late afternoon, the volume of people at the SDS [secure distribution centre] was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Palestinians in Gaza to take aid safely and dissipate,” the foundation said in a statement.Israeli tank fire and gunfire was heard, and a military helicopter fired flares, the Associated Press reported. At least three injured Palestinians were taken from the scene, one of them bleeding from a leg wound.The Israeli military said it fired “warning shots” near the compound to restore control. It was not immediately clear if there had been any injuries among people trying to get food.In a speech on Tuesday night, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that there had been a “loss of control momentarily” during the food distribution, but added: “Happily, we brought it back under control.”Images shared on social media, which could not immediately be verified, appeared to show people waiting in queues between wire fences. These were later partly torn down as people rushed into an open field where boxes were waiting.Some reportedly managed to obtain aid boxes with basic items including sugar, flour, pasta and tahini but most left empty-handed.“There was no order, the people rushed to take, there was shooting, and we fled,” Hosni abu Amra, who had also been waiting for food, told AP. “We fled without taking anything that would help us get through this hunger.”Ahmed abu Taha, who said he heard gunfire and saw Israeli military aircraft overhead, said: “It was chaos. People were panicked.”On Sunday, Jake Wood, the founding director of the GHF, resigned, saying that it would not be possible for the group to deliver aid “while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles ofhumanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence”.The UN and other humanitarian organisations had already refused to work with the GHF on the grounds that doing so would compromise values that are key to reaching civilians in all conflict zones, and put at risk their teams and the recipients of aid in Gaza.They also warned that a newly formed group with no experience would not be able to handle the logistics of feeding more than 2 million people in a devastated combat zone.‘Our hearts ache’: the fight for survival in Gaza amid Israel’s new offensive and no aidRead moreUS state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the concerns were unfounded and the most important priority was getting aid into Gaza, no matter who was delivering it. She also blamed Hamas for trying to stop convoys organised by the GHF from getting to distribution centres.“They have attempted to stop the aid movement through Gaza to these distribution centres,” she said. “They have failed, but they certainly tried. The bottom line is the real story here is that the aid is moving through, and, in that kind of environment, it’s not surprising that there might be a few issues involved.”But the dangerous scenes on Tuesday appeared to confirm many of the fears raised by UN.Scenes of desperate crowds rushing to get aid were “heartbreaking”, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said, particularly when the UN and partners have a “detailed, principled, operationally sound plan” to get aid in.The trickle of food currently reaching Gaza was not enough to feed its people, he added. “We continue to stress that a meaningful scale-up of humanitarian operations is essential to stave off famine and meet the needs of all civilians, wherever they are.”Israel is trying to replace the humanitarian organisations that bring aid into Gaza. It has long claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas disrupts supply networks to profit from aid.The GHF uses armed security contractors to deliver food in compounds guarded by Israel’s military. It previously acknowledged that this method excludes some of the most vulnerable people in Gaza because only those able to walk long distances and carry heavy boxes of food will be able to feed their families this way.And despite pushing for control of food and other supplies coming into Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces had not properly prepared to distribute aid and “planned to direct the population using gunfire,” a security source told Haaretz.“They treated it like a routine situation involving suspects entering a combat zone, but you can’t direct a population of that scale with gunfire if you want them to feel safe reaching the areas you’ve opened,” he told the newspaper.The source said the military’s original idea to direct crowds using gunfire suggests “they didn’t think and didn’t plan” to use other means, such as fencing off the area.The GHF said its decision to abandon the distribution centre “was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties” and that by the end of Tuesday it had handed out 8,000 boxes of food: enough to feed 44,000 people for half a week according to its calculations. That is just 2% of Gaza’s population. The foundation said deliveries would be increased during the week.Pictures shared on social media that appeared to show the content of the boxes, but could not immediately be verified, suggested they would be meagre meals, mostly rice, pasta and flour with some cans of beans and vegetables sourced from Israel.The GHF has not revealed who is funding its work, although initial pictures showed boxes with the logos of three small aid organisations with experience working in Gaza. None responded to questions about their work with the GHF, but even if they have agreed to partner with the organisation long term, they do not have the capacity to meet overall needs.“Regardless of whether the GHF is operating or not, we know from decades of experience and the almost 600 days we have been responding to this catastrophe in Gaza that this shameful exercise in the militarisation of aid is not going to work,” said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in the occupied Palestinian territory.“Even in the most optimal of conditions, there is no logistical company who can feed 2.1 million people overnight. Humanitarianism is not just about handing out food parcels to feed starving people; it is about ensuring that people have the means to survive.”Israeli forces have taken control of much of Gaza since the end of a ceasefire in March, launching heavy attacks that have killed nearly 4,000 Palestinians, health authorities there say.The total death toll from Israeli attacks inside Gaza has now passed 54,000, most of them civilians. Israel launched the war after cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed about 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, and saw 250 taken hostage.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesBenjamin NetanyahuAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The 11-year-old was Gaza’s youngest influencer, whose bright smile reached tens of thousands, including other children, while she offered practical survival tips for daily life under bombardment, such as advice on how to cook with improvised methods when there was no gas.In one social media post, Yaqeen wrote: “I try to bring a bit of joy to the other children so that they can forget the war.”On Friday night, she was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes hit the house where she lived with her family, in Al-Baraka area of Deir al-Bala, in central Gaza. Her body, torn apart by the bombing, was recovered from beneath the rubble.When news of Yaqeen’s death spread online on Monday, there was an outpouring of messages of grief and tributes from activists, followers and journalists.“Instead of being at school and enjoying her childhood,” one of her followers wrote on X, “she was active on Instagram and participating in campaigns to help others in Gaza. No words. Absolutely no words.”Mahmoud Bassam, a photojournalist in Gaza, said: “Her body may be gone, but her impact remains a beacon of humanity.”Yaqeen and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, Al Jazeera has reported. She played an active role in the Ouena collective, a Gaza-based non-profit organisation dedicated to humanitarian relief.Yaqeen and Mohamed, a humanitarian worker, often visited camps and makeshift shelters for displaced families. In each place they went, she tried to spread cheer and comfort to the children.Hani Abu Rizq, a journalist and colleague of Yaqeen’s in the Ouena collective, described her work as “truly beautiful”.“She had an entrepreneurial spirit and was always the first to do good. She loved helping others and bringing joy to children in displacement camps. She had a special touch, spreading hope and optimism among people despite the difficult circumstances,” he said.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

We made gas. We put wood here and a stove to let air in and make the fire burn more. We cook everything on it. Gaza: no to the impossible,” she wrote.On 15 March, holding a bouquet of flowers,Yaqeen stepped into the tent where her brother was livingand sang him Happy Birthday.“Despite the pain and shock of Yaqeen’s killing, this is the true face of the occupation,” Rizq said. “Israel has killed a very large number of children during this genocide.”The Palestinian photojournalist Amr Tabash wrote on Instagram, alongside a clip featuring glimpses of Yaqeen working on humanitarian projects: “Yaqeen was martyred, yet certainty remains in our hearts that the children of Gaza are the heartbeat of humanity and a reflection of global silence.”Mohamad al-Kadri, a volunteer with Muslim Doctors for Humanity, said: “She was a child who carried in her heart a love for doing good, a spirit of initiative, and dedicated her young energy to planting hope in the hearts of those around her.”The Israeli military has been contacted for comment.1:19Dozens killed after Israeli attack on school used as shelter in Gaza – video reportIsrael has intensified its air campaign in Gaza in recent days. Its airstrikes killed at least 52 people on Monday, including 31 in a school turned shelter that was struck as people slept, igniting their belongings, according to local health officials.On Sunday, Israeli attackskilled at least 38 people, health officials said, bringing the death toll to more than 100 over the weekend.Yaqeen died during the same series of strikes across the territory thatkilled nine of a paediatrician’s 10 children, sparking international outrage.The Gaza health ministry says nearly 54,000 Palestinians, including 16,503 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks across the territory.On Thursday, health officials in the territory released a detailed breakdown of the numbers of children killed since Israel began its offensive in 2023 after the 7 October attacks by Hamas.

Its immediate result is the transformation of Gaza into a humanitarian disaster area.”Olmert said he had often asserted that Israel was not committing war crimes in Gaza and claimed with conviction that “in no case did a government official give orders to hit Gazan civilians indiscriminately”.However, in recent weeks, “I’ve been no longer able to do so,” he said. “What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians. It’s the result of government policy – knowingly, evilly, maliciously, irresponsibly dictated.”“Yes, Israel is committing war crimes,” he concluded.In an interview with the BBC last week, Olmert described the continuing conflict as “a war without a purpose – a war without a chance of achieving anything that can save the lives of the hostages.”His comments to the British broadcaster caused a row in Israel. The far-right parties condemned his words, which followed the Democrats party head, Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army, whotold the Kan national broadcasterthat “a sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not give itself the aim of expelling populations”.The Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, accused Olmert and Golan of “taking an active part in a diplomatic campaign, in a propaganda war and in legal warfare against the state of Israel and the IDF”.The education minister, Yoav Kisch, said that Olmert and Golan had joined a “radical leftist chorus defaming Israel in the international arena”.“While IDF troops are risking their lives against murderous terrorists seeking our annihilation, he decides to incite and stick a knife in their backs,” Kisch said.The social equality minister, May Golan, accused Olmert of “spitting in the face” of Israeli soldiers. “To be exact, there are innocents in Gaza – 58 of them,” she said, referring to the Israeli hostages held captive in the territory.Some Israeli media outlets have framed Olmert’s remarks as a response to far-right outrage over the resumption of aid into Gaza, and to the inflammatory rhetoric of several Israeli politicians.The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Israel is “destroying everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and that “the army is leaving no stone unturned”. He declared: “We are conquering, cleansing and remaining in Gaza untilHamasis destroyed.”Smotrich said the IDF was “finally” targeting Hamas’s civilian infrastructure. “We’re eliminating ministers, bureaucrats, money handlers – everyone who holds up Hamas’s civilian rule.”On 22 May, the Israeli politician Moshe Feiglin told TV Channel 14: “The enemy is not Hamas, nor is it the military wing of Hamas.” Feiglin is a former member of the Israeli parliament.“Every child in Gaza is the enemy. We need to occupy Gaza and settle it, and not a single Gazan child will be left there. There is no other victory.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuHamasPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He said he had last week told Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, of Australia’s deep concern.Labor MP and former cabinet minister Ed Husictold ABC radioon Tuesday Australia must “progress from talk to action”, including ramping up aid into Gaza, as well as call in Israel’s ambassador. He also praised the “strength” of Albanese’s comments.Husic said the government should be “actively considering” targeted sanctions against Israel, a step he said was “probably under consideration”, and join international efforts from allied countries to “exert maximum international pressure to stop this blockade”.Australialast week joined 22 other nations in condemning Israelover its decision to allow only limited aid into Gaza, adding voice to a joint statement also signed by the UK, Canada and New Zealand. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, alsocondemned recent “abhorrent and outrageous” commentsmade by Netanyahu government members and said the Israeli government “cannot allow the suffering” in Gaza to continue.But Australia had not foreshadowed further targeted sanctions, as the UK, France and Canada didin a joint statement threatening to step up “concrete actions”.Australia has a proud history of standing up against human catastrophe. Gaza should be no exception | Ed HusicRead moreAt an event at Parliament House on Tuesday night withBritish Australian doctor Mohammed Mustafawho has recently returned from a medical mission in Gaza, independent senator David Pocock urged the government to do more.“If the horror unfolding inGazais not our country’s red line for stronger action, then I don’t know what is,” Pocock told the event.Mustafa also called for more action. “You don’t have to be a major player to feed children. You don’t have to be a major player to heal children,” Mustafa said, referencing quotes from government ministers that Australia was “not a major player” in the Middle East.“We need healers in the Middle East, and Australia can be the healer. It can lead the world,” he told the event.Alex Ryvchin, CEO of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, was critical of Husic’s comments, calling for more attention to the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood the government is awaiting further information before settling on whether Wong or another representative attends.The government would not speculate on further sanctions. But government sources noted Albanese’s conversation with Herzog, and Wong’s meeting with Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar, where concerns were raised.The UK has spoken out against the ‘monstrous’ human catastrophe in Gaza. Why won’t Australia do more? | Donald RothwellRead moreMoss welcomed Albanese’s statement on Monday, but also called for more tangible responses, including supporting a humanitarian aid convoy into Gaza.“At a minimum, Australia should immediately support the statement from the United Kingdom, France and Canada and prepare sanctions targeted at Israeli officials responsible for using starvation as a weapon of war,” he said.A motion to be debated at numerous Labor branches, drafted by Labor Friends of Palestine, notes the government’s endorsement of joint statements but says members are “disappointed” the government did not join France, Canada and the UK in proposing stronger action.The motion, which has not yet been passed by any branches, also calls for Labor to “redouble” efforts to bring about a ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsLabor partyGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

As a reminder, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed logistics group, has said lorry loads of food have been delivered to secure sites in Gaza and that supplies had begun to be given to those in need.However, the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, and Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, both told a press briefing in Geneva earlier today that they were unaware of whether any aid had actually been distributed.“We don’t have any information,” said Unrwa spokesperson Juliette Touma.“We know what’s needed, we know what’s missing, and we are very, very far from that daily target.“The needs are 500-600 trucks at a minimum that should go intoGaza, loaded with supplies. Not only food but also medicine, medical supplies, vaccines for children, fuel, water and other basics for people’s survival.”Before the devastating Israeli blockade on aid was imposed in early March, the UN brought lifesaving humanitarian supplies to people in multiple locations around the territory.Now the blockade has been eased (to an extremely inadequate level) due to political pressure on the Netanyahu government, UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF amid concerns it violates “fundamental humanitarian principles” and breaches international law.ShareUpdated at07.34 EDT"

This figure was broadly the same as the previous year, but the number of confirmed cases rose by 12% to reach just over 3.3m.The vast majority of these cases involved remote purchase fraud, where criminals use stolen card details to buy items online. Incidents of this type of crime had been falling in recent years, but last year the total amount lost to this scam rose for the first time since 2018.Banks say they are increasingly seeing criminals use sophisticated techniques to get people to disclose one-time passcodes they are sent. These codes usually take the form of a unique set of numbers, a bit like a pin number, and banks typically send them to customers via text message when they use their card to make purchases online, log on to internet banking, or change their personal details.Once in possession of a passcode, a criminal can often use it to authenticate fraudulent online card transactions.These frauds often begin with the familiar methods criminals have developed to encourage people to share their bank details, including sending text messages with a promise of a payment, links to false websites, or offers on social media for cheap products.One variation of the scam involves fraudsters using the details they have obtained totransfer the bank cards of victimsto the digital wallets of their own phones and then buy goods online and in high street shops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It warned: “This perhaps points to an over-confidence in one-time passcodes and the protection they offer customers, which is now being exploited to a growing degree by criminals.”Data hacks at third parties, such as retailers, were another “major driver” of remote purchase fraud, with criminals using stolen card details to make purchases online, said the banking body.It added: “The data stolen from a breach can be used for months or even years after the incident. Criminals also use the publicity around data breaches as an opportunity to trick people into revealing financial information.”The warning comes after Marks & Spencer was hit by a cyber-attack, though the retailer said this month that the customer data accesseddid not include usable payment or card details.Victims of unauthorised fraud – which includes remote purchase scams – are legally protected against losses, and UK Finance said its research indicated that customers were fully refunded in more than 98% of cases.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsBanks and building societiesCrimeE-commerceOnline shoppingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, in light of the incident in Liverpool city centre on Monday, when 65 people were injured when acar drove into a crowdon Water Street, Slot and a senior delegation of Liverpool officials decided they should not attend.Visual guide to how the Liverpool parade collision unfoldedRead moreLiverpool cancelled all internal events after the incident and Slot felt it would be inappropriate to celebrate his achievements at the dinner. He sent a letter of apology to the LMA and event organisers in which he expressed his sadness at the horrific scenes that followed Liverpool’s trophy parade through the city.Slot wrote: “As you will know, a shocking incident took place in Liverpool yesterday, one that left dozens of men, women and children who had attended our parade injured and as a result I have had to withdraw from the event out of solidarity with all affected. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is one that I feel is absolutely right given the seriousness of the situation. I hope that I have your understanding in this regard.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the wider football community, including the LMA itself, the Premier League and many clubs who will be represented tonight, for the support we have received over the last 24 hours. Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this.“If you would indulge me, I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened. Along with the supporters and bystanders who helped one another in an hour of need, I think everyone involved in the aftermath deserves the gratitude of all of us.”The Liverpool head coach said he was “humbled” to be named Premier League manager of the season and honoured to be awarded the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy for the LMA Manager of the Year, particularly as the latter was voted for by his managerial peers.Slot said: “Sir Alex, I look forward to meeting with you at a later date to receive my trophy from you. I also look forward to attending my first LMA Annual Awards dinner on a future occasion. Thank you once again for your understanding and support. Enjoy your evening and if you could join me in keeping those affected by yesterday’s events in your thoughts and prayers it would be very much appreciated.”Explore more on these topicsArne SlotLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)newsShareReuse this content"

The trial is also estimated to prevent up to 1,400 tonnes of CO2 being emitted, helping to save up to £14m in running costs.Alina Sartogo, one of the co-founders of Zest, which developed the tool, said all the food waste it identified was edible, but not sellable at a profit for the manufacturers. For example, the waste might include a broken KitKat bar, or a product with an expiry date that’s too short to sell on to retailers.The Zest software could be expanded across the food supply chain on a subscription basis by March next year, following a series of pilots with different manufacturers.A second pilot with Nestlé has recently been launched after receiving funding from the government agency Innovate UK’sBridgeAIscheme, which provides a £1.9m match-funded grant for AI projects.Esra Kasapoglu, director of AI and data economy at the agency, said the project represented a“solution that aims to transform food sourcing and distribution across the UK, cutting waste, reducing carbon emissions, and lowering costs”.About4.6m tonnesof edible food, equivalent to 10bn meals of food, is wasted in the UK each year.Simon Millard, director of food at the charity FareShare, said the technology would“make a huge difference” to its work to redistribute food to more than 8,000 charities and community groups across the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chief officers from some of England and Wales’ biggest forces argue they cannot take further budget cuts.Several key departments are yet to agree their budgets with the Treasury, including the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.The IMFsuggested on Thursday that Reeves could refine her fiscal framework, potentially giving the chancellor some political cover to ease her spending cuts in response to changes in growth forecasts.It said the current system, inherited from the previous Conservative government, of twice-yearly assessments of the public finances by theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) was ripe for an overhaul. It said the chancellor should examine ways to avoid having to make short-term savings when there is a downturn in economic forecasts.But government sources said there were definitively no plans to change the government’s “ironclad” fiscal rules, pointing to the already high borrowing figures. One source said there were clear costs to any further changes to the rules, shown by the market’s reaction to changes to the borrowing rules at the last budget.Reeves has tweaked the rules already to allow more borrowing for capital investment –expected to equal £113bn. “When people say: why don’t you just change fiscal rules? Well, we did. We did make a choice to change fiscal rules, and that’s £113bn that wasn’t there,” the source said.There were currently “no plans” to change the number of forecasts by the OBR, though the prime minister is said to favour making the change.Starmer is one of several key figures in No 10 who would like to see forecasts reduced to once a year, as the IMF recommended – which would allow Reeves to meet her commitment of just one fiscal event a year.The OBR’s downgrading of growth forecasts, which wiped out Reeves’s headroom in the spring, meant the chancellor had tomake several cutsat the spring statement, including on welfare.Health and defence are expected to be the major winners when the spending review is published on 11 June, though there will be significant funding for energy infrastructure, including nuclear.Home Office sources say real-terms cuts to the department’s budget will make it nearly impossible to meet key pledges on increasing neighbourhood policing and halving violence against women and girls.The Home Office has been told that the Metropolitan police, the UK’s biggest police force, is already facing a £260m shortfall and having to cut 1,700 officers, community support officers and support staff.“Police forces are facing budget cuts already. To add to this will mean halting any progress made on some of the government’s key policies, including halving knife crime and halving violence against women and girls,” a police source said. “There has been some good progress on [violence against women and girls]. But, realistically, more deep cuts would put that progress in jeopardy.”Concern has been compounded by plans by the Ministry of Justice toshorten the sentences of violent offendersin an effort to free up prison places, though there will be more cash for probation services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThere are also clashes between the Reeves and the housing secretary, Angela Rayner, over funding for social housing. Reeves has previously said housing will be one of the key beneficiaries of the £113bn in capital spending, which the government will begin to set out at the spending review, but did not specify social homes.The Treasury hasput £2bn into affordable housingto bridge the gap between a new programme set to be announced at the spending review and the current affordable homes spending, which is due to expire in 2026.At the time the funding was announced, the £2bn was described as a “downpayment” on further funding to be announced at the spending review, which Reeves said would mark a generational shift in the building of council homes.However, Rayner is understood to be dissatisfied with the level of funding for the next phase of the programme.The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, is also understood to be still fighting to keep cash for a major programme of insulation, which was a key part of the government’s net zero strategy, though his department is expected to get significant capital investment in energy infrastructure including nuclear.Labour had previously doubled the previous government’s warm homes scheme from £6bn to £13.2bn over this parliament. But sources say this is likely to be cut in the spending review. At the October budget, Reeves announced £3.4bn over three years for household energy efficiency schemes, heat decarbonisation and fuel poverty schemes.The government responded to concerns expressed at the time calling the sum the “bare minimum” and promising a spending uplift at the review that now looks to have been cancelled.Charities have warned this will make it much harder to hit the UK’s climate targets. Lily-Rose Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said:“Cutting policies like home insulation, which provide solutions to lower people’s bills for good, would be an absolutely terrible decision.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingEconomic policyInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)LabourRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

But Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the IfG, said the Reform leader had used a figure that included both public sector and private sector investment.“The bulk of spending on energy infrastructure is going to come from the private sector – but closing private sector projects won’t generate money for the government,” she said.Labour accused Reform of making “fantasy promises”, while the Liberal Democrats called his speech “Trussonomics on steroids”.The Climate Change Committee says net zero will require investment of £26bn a year, more than two-thirds of which will be provided by the private sector. That will be offset, however, by about £22bn a year of savings the policy will enable.Tim Montgomerie, a political commentator and Reform supporter, told the BBC: “I wouldn’t say the numbers do add up yet, I readily concede that.” He said it was too far away from the election to demand the party deliver a fully costed policy platform.Farage himself admitted his sums might not add up, but insisted they gave “an idea of direction, policy, of priorities, of what we think is important, of what we think it is going to cost”.The Reform leader set out his latest policy pledges during a speech in central London at which he made three main policy announcements: ending the two-child benefit cap, reversing the cuts to winter fuel payments and increasing tax breaks for married couples. He refused, however, to guarantee keeping the pensions triple lock, which ensures the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5% a year.The IFS calculated that when added to a separate promise to increase the threshold at which people start paying income taxes to £20,000, the policies could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year.Watch Labour’s flip-flopping on winter fuel and benefits, and you’ll see who’s really considered important | Frances RyanRead moreFarage said his policies were in part about fairness, but also designed to encourage families to have more children, a social policy frequently espoused on the right.“We believe lifting the two-child cap is the best thing to do, not because we support a benefits culture but because we believe for lower-paid workers this actually makes having children just a little bit easier for them,” he said.He also promised more generous tax breaks for married people should he win the next election, saying he would raise the amount of tax-free allowance that someone can transfer to their spouse from £1,260 to £5,000.He added that he wanted more stringent controls on abortion as well.“I think it’s ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous, that we can allow abortion up to 24 weeks, and yet, if a child is born prematurely at 22 weeks, your local hospital will move heaven and earth and probably succeed in that child surviving and going on and living a normal life,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKBenefitsPensionsOlder peopleLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

But the suspect died last week after crashing during a high-speed car chase involving the Utah highway patrol, police said.The car chase was unrelated to the investigation into Kelemen’s death, police said, but the department did not give further details. It also has not identified the type of business where Kelemen’s body was found or a possible motive.Kelemen’s sister, Mikki Zaferatos, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that her brother had been planning to move out of the room he was renting in a house also occupied by the suspect.Zaferatos said her brother “was really uneasy living there” and that he had described his roommate as “strange”.For two decades, Kelemen contributed film reviews, profiles, feature stories and more to local publications, including Las Vegas Weekly. A short story he wrote about Donny Osmond’s Strip residency published over the weekend in Las Vegas Magazine.Kelemen moved to Las Vegas in 2003 and had been a staff writer for several years at the now-defunct 944 and City Life magazines, the Review-Journal reported.Explore more on these topicsLas VegasnewsShareReuse this content"

Two others were arrested in Walker county, Texas, Louisiana state police said on the Twitter/X.Louisiana authorities named the latest inmates who were recaptured as Lenton Vanburen, Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald. Jail escapees Dkenan Dennis, Corey Boyd, Gary C Price, Kendell Myles and Robert Moody were previously taken into custody by authorities.Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves remained at large Tuesday. At least 11 people have been arrested on allegations of helping the group of 10 inmates either before or after the breakout.Authorities had been scouring the New Orleans area for the escapees after they audaciouslybroke outof the Orleans Justice Center (OJC). The men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the coverage of darkness – all while the lone staffer supervising them had temporary left to get food.The inmates’ absence wasn’t discovered until a headcount hours later, after they bolted for freedom. Graffiti left on the wall included the message “To Easy LoL” with an arrow pointing to the gap.City and state officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail. Among those arrested on allegations of aiding the escapees was a jail maintenance worker accused of turning off the water to the toilet, an act authorities said helped the men get out. The worker said one of those incarcerated at the jail had threatened to stab him if he refused.Many of the men were originally in the OJC awaiting sentences or trials for alleged violent crimes including murder.Groves’s escape in particular has drawn attention. He has been convicted of a double murder and has pleaded guilty to two other killings.In an unrelated case that occurred about three years before he was born, Groves’s grandmother, Kim Groves, was slain after filing a brutality complaint against a New Orleans police officer – before the cop then hired a hitman to shoot her to death in 1994 in what was one of the city’s most notorious murders.Conditions had been deteriorating in New Orleans’s jail in the months before the escape, with unsupervised prisoners smoking marijuana “without fear of consequences” and fashioning weapons out of brooms, mops and buckets, according to a new report released on Tuesday by an independent watchdog monitoring a 2013 agreement with the federal government that was intended to reform the lockup.The monitor urged the official in charge of the jail – New Orleans sheriff Susan Hutson – to re-establish a high-security unit in the jail, noting the unrelenting violence among prisoners that’s made the facility “not reasonably safe and secure”.Hutson, a progressive reformer, had abandoned the practice of housing certain inmates in a high-security setting after taking office in 2022.“Many of the inmate-on-inmate assaults occur because staff allow inmates out of their cells and leave them unsupervised, or inmates are able to manipulate the locks on their cells to open them,” the monitors wrote in the report, which was written before the 10-man escape.The New Orleans jailbreak wasn’t the only one to make national news headlines recently. On Sunday, Grant Hardin – a former Gateway, Arkansas, police chief who is serving decades-long sentences for murder and rape – escaped from prison after disguising himself in “a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement”, authoritiessaid.Officials’ search for Hardin was entering its third day on Tuesday.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsNew OrleansUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The Chrisleys were also found guilty of tax evasion.In a social media post on Tuesday, the White House said the US president called the Chrisley family and said “he will be granting full pardons”, adding: “Trump Knows Best!”The Chrisleys were found guilty of tax evasion by hiding their earnings while showcasing an extravagant lifestyle that prosecutors said included luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.Prosecutors said Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20m in unpaid loans.Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years in federal prison, and Todd Chrisley got 12 years behind bars. The couple was also ordered to pay $17.8m in restitution.A three-judge panel of the 11th US circuit court of appeals last summer upheld the Chrisleys’ convictions but found a legal error in how the trial judge had calculated Julie Chrisley’s sentence by holding her accountable for the entire bank fraud scheme. The appellate panel sent her case back to the lower court for resentencing.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpReality TVTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Those are jobs that really rely on Niosh work.”Jennica Bellanca, for example, worked to train emergency responders in mining in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her role was terminated.“It’s such a hard thing. Everyone here works so hard to help support the health and safety of mine workers and other workers,” she said, noting that small companies do not have the resources to invest in alternative safety programs. “I’m just concerned that nobody else is going to fill this gap. There’s a reason that the government provides this safety net.“In our case, the safety net is to help workers go home to their families every day and make sure that nothing bad happens.”Bellanca questioned a central argument for the cuts – efficiency in federal government spending – by noting that long-term research projects may now go unreleased.When we’re gone, there’s going to be nobody to get this information outJennica Bellanca, former trainer for emergency responders“When we’re gone, there’s going to be nobody to get this information out,” she said. “And because we were so abruptly, sort of cut off in the middle of projects, all of this work that we’ve done, we’re not able to get this out, released, as a full public product. In my mind, that’s a waste of government money.”Niemeier-Walsh, the vice-president of American Federal of Government Employees Local 3840, said the reduction in force was the “final, massive blow to our work” after earlier limitations on travel, communications and remote work imposed sinceDonald Trumptook office in January.“Our ability to be as successful as we have been as an institute relies on the rest of the Niosh employees coming back because our work is so interconnected,” said Niemeier-Walsh. “I’m very, very concerned what this means for every single American worker if we’re not able to fully restore Niosh. These cuts are not based in science. They’re not based on the public health need. They’re based on politics, and that’s bad for the health of the American people.”Mass resignations at labor department threaten workers in US and overseas, warn staff – as more cuts loomRead moreShe cited as an example the employees in thehealth hazard evaluation program, which was established to reduce workplace risks and recommend ways to mitigate dangers, who were reinstated after earlier cuts. But they rely on chemists to develop analytical methods to measure chemicals in the workplace, and engineers to design solutions; these chemists and engineers have not been reinstated, she said.Since the agency was founded in 1970, recordable workplace illnesses and injuries and fatalities have been drastically reduced in the US. The rate of non-fatal workplace injuries and illnessesdeclinedfrom 10.9 cases per 100 full-time workers in 1972 to 2.4 in 2023.The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, and several other labor unionsfiled a lawsuitthis month to restore the cut programs at Niosh, arguing the cuts “directly threaten the lives of workers whose safety and health depend on Niosh” services that are congressionally mandated.Even though some of the initial cuts have been reversed,“we have deep concerns that the whole reason Niosh was started to begin with is still eliminated,” said Rebecca Reindel, the director of occupational safety and health at the AFL-CIO, who noted that the agency’s founding mandate was to assure every man and woman in the US has safe and healthful working conditions.Reindel expressed particular concern about disruption to long-term research projects.US workers feel effects of Trump cuts: ‘I am seeing my work dry up’Read more“All of this research work that they do, where they have these big cohorts, they’ve been following people for 40 years,” she said. “And now they’re just cut off for these occupational prospective cohorts, where they follow them over years to see what kind of diseases are developing.“If we’re just staffing those cohorts now, we’re really losing 40 years worth of work. Even if they restart them, we’re going to have lost so many people to follow up.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services did not comment on the record. Its secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, was working to ensure Niosh critical services remain intact and continue as the agency streamlines its operations, they claimed.Explore more on these topicsBusinessTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpWorkers' rightsUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The US also came to an agreement with the UK earlier in May.Over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, Trump and European Union leaders announced that the president’s 50% tariff on imports from the EU, which he announced on Friday, were on hold until 9 July. That announcement would not have affected the board’s survey, which closed on 19 May.The Conference Board said the rebound in confidence this month was broad-based across all ages and income groups.Consumers’ assessments of the present economic situation also improved, with the exception of their view on job availability, which weakened for the fifth straight month despite another strong US jobs report.The labor department earlier this month reported that US employersadded a surprising 177,000 jobsin April and the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2% as the job market showed resilience amid Trump’s trade wars.Explore more on these topicsBusinessTariffsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

His bookHow Countries Go Broke: The Big Cycleaddresses thenational debtand Trump’s attacks on democratic norms. The Guardian obtained a copy.Hedge fund billionaire says US may face ‘worse than a recession’ from Trump tariffsRead moreInvoking a decade when fascists such as Adolf Hitler of Germany and Benito Mussolini of Italy were in power, Dalio writes: “When I say that the policies President Trump is using to ‘make America great again’ are remarkably like the policies that those of the hard-right countries in the 1930s used, that should not be controversial.”He continues: “It would be fair to argue that his attempts to maximise the power of the presidency by bypassing the other branches of government are analogous to the ways that Andrew Jackson (of the right) and Franklin D Roosevelt (of the left) did, though he is even more aggressive than they were. We will see how far he will take it.”In times of conflict, Dalio notes, aggressive leaders work to eliminate the opposition, make changes to the law to assume special powers and seize control of the media to produce pro-government propaganda. If conflicts become severe, new laws and punishments target the opposition.Since returning to office in January, Trump has signed a record 152executive orders,concentrating powerand sidelining Congress. He hasdefied court ordersanddetained or deportedimmigrants withoutdue process. He has sought to rewardlaw firms,media companiesanduniversitiesthat bend to his will and punish those that defy him.“IsDonald Trumpa demagogue?” Dalio asks, describing a demagogue as a political leader who gains power by appealing to people’s emotions, fears, prejudices and desires, typically stirring up populist sentiment and promising easy solutions to complex problems.Is Donald Trump a demagogue? The question is what will the controls be and how far will Trump push things?Ray Dalio“The question is what will the controls be and how far will Trump push things? Unlike for a CEO, there is no board for the US president. Are there effective regulators in place? If so, it is not clear to me who they are.”Trump’sstrongman styleis a symptom of America’s polarised politics, the author argues. “Donald Trump wants to dictate policies rather than have a classic ‘let’s work together across party lines’ approach to governing. This confrontational approach is an extension of how great internal political conflict has become in recent decades.”Dalio grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on New York’s Long Island. He began investing at the age of 12 when caddying at a local golf course. He went to Harvard Business School, had short stints at two Wall Street firms andstarted Bridgewater in 1975from a two-bedroom apartment in New York. It went on to become the largest hedge fund in the world.In How Countries Go Broke, Dalio identifies the government’s debt – currently more than $36tn – as the US’s most serious problem, outlines what he calls the “Big Debt Cycle” and offers advice on how people can protect themselves from the fallout.‘An autoimmune disorder’: how Trump is turning American democracy against itselfRead moreThe businessman, who correctly predicted the2008 financial crisis, condemns theTrump administration’s cost-cutting measures as likely to have negative consequences because “many people who will be hurt by them will fight back and valuable support systems will be weakened or eliminated”.He adds that his own wife works to help low-income students in deprived neighbourhoods who suffer from inadequate nutrition. The cancellation ofschool lunch programmeson which they depend “will have terrible second-order consequences”.Trump’s policies are aimed at moving more money, power and freedom into the hands of the most productive people, Dalio adds. “It’s not easy to manage and improve a country that has been mismanaged and in such a mess while also keeping people happy at a time when democracy is fracturing. I recommend regularly checking on how those in the bottom 60% are doing and feeling.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsFar right (US)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

It has done so with the UK Intellectual Property Office, but has requested more time to file in the EU.“As a general rule, any initial unilateral request for an extension that is received in time will be considered appropriate and will be granted,” said the EU Intellectual Property Office in a filing extending the deadline. However, it added that it was highly unlikely to grant a further extension beyond mid-June “unless there are exceptional circumstances”.Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing James Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which wasacquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges, it emerged that Amazon hadpaid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”of theJames Bondfranchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime stewards of the Bond films.With creative control, Amazon now has the power to move forward with new films and potentially TV spin-offs too, without approval from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming.In March, Amazon confirmed thatAmy Pascal and David Heymanwould steer the next Bond film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named.Pascal has experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series.Heyman is best known as the producer of all Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise and is now in pre-production onthe much-anticipated HBO TV series adaptation of the stories. He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.Explore more on these topicsJames BondIntellectual propertyFilm industryEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "TexasTrump hates wind power. But these Texas Republicans are embracing itWind turbines have become a financial lifeline in rural areas, but state legislators are now targeting themOliver Milmanin Menard, Texas, with photographs by Harmon LiTue 27 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 15.07 EDTShareView image in fullscreenJohn Davis amid his herd of goats while his wind turbines generate energy, in Menard, Texas, on 3 May.As aRepublicanstate lawmaker for 16 years, aTexasrancher and a staunch supporter ofDonald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US – clean energy development.Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling hill country near Menard, west of Austin, and has seen the income provide opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is one of thepoorestcounties in Texas.But a barrage of bills working their way through the Republican-held Texas legislature threaten to reverse the state’s position as the US’sclean energy superpower, even curtailing cherished private property rights by limiting a landowner’s ability to host wind and solar farms.The bills come as Trump has ramped up anti-renewable rhetoric on the national stage,callingwind turbines “ugly” and “disgusting” andbarringmajor clean energy projects on federal lands and waters. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” Trump, who has enjoyed strongelectoral support from farmers, said shortly after being inaugurated as president.This backlash has left many conservatives, such as Davis, bewildered, withrecent polling showingthat most Republican voters in Texas oppose moves to squash the state’s booming renewable energy sector. While climate campaigners see renewables as a crucial replacement for thefossil fuels that are overheating the planet, places such as Menard county, Texas – where Trump won more than 80% of the vote in last year’s election – are more inclined to weigh other factors.Left: printed pictures showing a career in politics.

Right: Street signs commemorating John Davis’s work as a state legislator are hung outside the shed at his ranch.“We’re supposed to be the party of common sense but we’ve shifted to be like the Democrats and that is what makes me mad. When you tell me what to do on my own property that sounds more like a Democrat,” Davis said. “Some of the bills they are trying to pass would kill renewables.”I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some pointHoppy Murchison, rancherDavis retired as state legislator in 2015 to spend more time on his ranch but has lately been donning a suit and traveling back to Austin to urge his former colleagues to reject the anti-renewables bills. “I testify as a conservative and say: ‘What are you guys doing? Have you lost your mind?’” he said. “Some of these bills are attacking battery storage of all things. How dumb is that? It’s sacrificing your core conservative value principles in order to protect the oil and gas industry.”Texas’s traditional image may be of cowboy hats, steers and nodding oil wells, but in reality, the state today could just as easily be associated with solar panels, windmills and Teslas. Texas’s combined wind and solar poweroutputisnearly doublethat of its closest rival, California, ittripledthe amount of new battery storage added last year compared with 2023 and is leading the way in emerging alternatives such as geothermal. This year, a third of all new renewable and storage projects in the USwill be built in the Lone Star state.“We are still firmly an oil and gas state and producing more than we ever have but that’s not the full picture,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University ofTexas. “We produce and consume more energy than any other state, we have more wind than the next four states combined and regularly have more than 50% of our grid running on renewables. We are an energy state.”View image in fullscreenA few of John Davis’s wind turbines spinning and generating energy on his ranch.The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, isgrowingfor the first time since the 1960s. It has also generated cash for struggling rural areas. Rhodes’sresearch has foundexisting clean energy projects in Texas will pay more than $12bn in taxes to communities where they are located, funding schools, roads and hospitals, while paying out another $15bn to landowners to lease their properties.“It’s a hard life out here, there’s rocks, mesquite and coyotes and not a lot else – if there’s anything to make life easier, do it,” said Davis as he stood on his property under the whooshing blades of a wind turbine, one of a ragged line of turbines that make up the Cactus Flats wind project. “See any dead birds here? I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints,voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.Places such as Menard, located in central Texas between two large oil and gas regions, have limited options for new income. Davis has several hundred goats and sheep and raises cattle for wagyu beef on his 1,300-acre property, but 40% of his income now comes from the wind turbines, money he hopes he can push back into the sleepy Menard community.“I struck wind!” said the ebullient Davis, who likes to restyle Trump’s“drill, baby, drill” mantrainto “turn, baby, turn” in recognition of his wind turbines. “I done turned the money into my back ass pocket,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohn and his wife, Jayne Davis.Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them. “I think they look angelic now,” he said. Another nearby rancher, Hoppy Murchison, who has a drooping handlebar moustache, cowboy hat and checked shirt, is less enamored with their appearance and mostly subscribes to Trump’s worldview.“But for me it made too much sense to not do it,” said Murchison, who now has several wind turbines on his own property, providing him a stable income. “I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some point.”For leaders of poorer counties such as Menard, the aesthetics of wind turbines are beside the point. “I literally have hungry children in my community, so I’m not turning my nose up at any kind of financial windfall,” said Brandon Corbin, the local Republican county judge. Corbin estimates that a proposed battery facility in the county could add as much as 30% to Menard’s stretched annual budget of $5m.“It’s not productive or helpful when he spouts off like that,” Corbin said of Trump’s comments on wind and solar. “We are the ones on the ground here and he says and does things that puts fear and uncertainty out.”View image in fullscreenA home in Menard, Texas, has a propane tank connected in the front yard.But senior Republicans in Washington have sought to ape Trump, pushing forward a budget plan thatstrips awayincentives for clean energy and electric cars. Meanwhile, in Texas, there arethreestatebillsthat would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.One that has already passed the Texas senate,SB819, calls for the “police power of the state” to drastically limit new wind and solar projects by requiring permits not needed for gas, coal or nuclear plants. A wind turbine would have to be 3,000ft from a neighbor’s property line, compared with just 467ft for an oilwell.To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oilwells in Texas is just absurdDoug Lewin, energy industry expert“I’ve heard from many constituents with valid concerns regarding the reckless installation of these facilities,” said Lois Kolkhorst, a Texas state senator and one of the bill’s sponsors. Kolkhorst, a Republican who calls herself a “lifelong wildlife conservationist” said the legislation would provide “a reasonable approach to the recent proliferation of wind and solar facilities encroaching across Texas with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment”.While most Republicans don’t share such enmity towards renewables, Kolkhorst has some powerful and wealthy allies, including theTexas Public Policy Foundation thinktankand theStewards of Texasgroup, which opposes new clean energy development. The latter group hastiesto Dan Friedkin, a billionaire businessman whose interests include owning hotels and whose roles include being the executive producer of the Paramount showLandman(which includes anotable scenecritiquing clean energy) as well as being the owner of the soccer clubs Everton and Roma.left: two gas pumps, right: four large white propane tanksLeft: Vintage gas pumps at the Station, a 24/7 community store owned by the Davisies, offering free beverages operated by the honor system. Right: Large propane tanks found near the town of Menard, Texas.“Renewable energy has a role in Texas’s energy landscape, but it must be managed responsibly to ensure that our state’s most cherished outdoor spaces are not adversely affected,” a spokesperson for the Friedkin Group, on behalf of Friedkin, said.Critics of the bills, though, argue that they are counterproductive political posturing designed to aid an oil and gas industry that feels threatened by the rise of renewables. Should the bills pass, 15% of Texas’s wind fleetcould shutter, raising energy prices to the point that the typical household’s electricity bill would increase by $225 a year, according to one estimate.“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.“We desperately need new energy supply, and if we’re saying, ‘No, we don’t want the sources that can be deployed the fastest’ for ideological reasons, then the economy will stagnate.View image in fullscreenJohn Davis laying out feed for his herd of goats while his wind turbines work in the background.“Some people have just decided that renewables are bad and they will fight them. To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oilwells in Texas is just absurd.”While the fate of clean energy support in the federal budget will come down to how many moderate Republicans will fight to preserve theinvestment flowing to their districts, in Texas the main decider could be time itself. The Texas legislative session ends on 2 June and should the bills get gummed up enough in the system, Davis hopes they will be beaten by the clock, at least until next year’s session.“The system is set up to kill bills, to have less government,” he said. “So there’s a lot of advantages we have to kill these bills. We want to keep them bottled up. Delay, delay, delay.”"

The act also includes tough provisions to protect children online, including preventing damage to mental health caused by seeing adult content.According to the commission, all four platforms had one-click self-declarations to verify age, which it deemed ineffective to prevent under-18s from viewing adult content.“Today is a good day for minor protection online in the EU, because with the enforcement actions that we are launching … against four very large online platforms with pornographic, adult content, we are clearly showing that we mean it when it comes to the effective protection of minors under the DSA,” an EU official told reporters.There was no fixed timetable to complete the investigation, the official said, while stressing “a commitment to act relatively fast on potential next steps, depending on what the reaction of the platforms will be”.The platforms could resolve the investigation by producing forms of age verification deemed effective by EU regulators. But if the complaint is upheld they could be fined up to 6% of global annual turnover.Under the DSA, the commission regulates platforms with more than 45 million users, such as Google, Meta and X, while national authorities in the 27 member states are responsible for those below this threshold.The commission said on Tuesday that Stripchat was no longer designated a “very large online platform”, after an appeal by the company, meaning its activities would in future be regulated by Cyprus, where its parent company, Technius Ltd, is based, rather than Brussels.The investigation into age verification tools will continue, however, as the new designation does not apply until September.Stripchat’s child protection obligations remain the same.The parent company of Pornhub, Aylo Freesites, said it was aware of the commission’s investigation and “fully committed” to ensuring the safety of minors online.“We will always comply with the law,” the company said. “We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users’ ages at the point of access – the users’ devices – and for websites to deny or permit access to age-restricted materials based on that verification.”Technius was approached for comment. A Brussels-based lawyer who has recently represented the parent companies of XVideos (WebGroup Czech Republic) and XNXX (NKL Associates) in EU legal proceedings was also contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeChildrenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

They may be impossible to fill in terms of rapport with supporters, force of personality and authority. But, in the more important fields of winning and developing this Liverpool team, Slot will back himself to make his mark. There is space for improvement.What actually happened: Liverpool improved considerably, winning the title with a few weeks to spare. Slot made managing and winning in thePremier Leaguelook easy.Arsenal:predicted 1st, finished 2ndWhat we predicted:The new campaign brings fresh hope that a young yet experienced squad can finally get over the line. Mikel Arteta often speaks about the “fine margins” involved in winning trophies at the highest level and will hope his players can use their disappointment as motivation to win a first Premier League title since the Invincibles in 2004. Having taken four points off City last season, he knows his team have the ability to go one better.What actually happened: Arsenal overcame Manchester City, even hammering them 5-1 at the Emirates in February, but they did not come any closer to winning the title. For the third season in a row they had to settle for second place. This season felt like a missed opportunity for them – in the league and in Europe.Predictions v realityManchester City:predicted 2nd, finished 3rdWhat we predicted:Like a wager on rain blighting the English summer, predicting that Manchester City will (again) retain the title has become a near-gimme of an exercise, as sure a sure thing as can be. The caveat, though, is that they failed to repeat the grandeur of their magnificent best last season.What actually happened: They fell well short of their magnificent best. At point one – after a run of four straight defeats in the autumn – it looked like they might not even qualify for the Champions League. They rallied towards the end of the season, with the January signing of Omar Marmoush helping, but it was a terribly disappointing campaign for Pep Guardiola and his ageing team. They need to keep rebuilding in the summer.Chelsea:predicted 7th, finished 4thWhat we predicted:To suggest that Chelsea are enigmatic hugely underplays it. They have embraced chaos and confusion in recent years. The turnover of players continues to be dizzying, like the ownership’s lack of patience with managers. Such are the volume of questions, nobody knows what to expect.What actually happened: They were very unpredictable. After a strong start, Chelsea fell away and looked like falling out of the Champions League positions. Third is a decent return on a strange season. The fans do not seem keen on Enzo Maresca (and he has not always seemed keen on them), so stability does not look likely any time soon.Newcastle:predicted 8th, finished 5thWhat we predicted:The Premier League’s old top six has morphed into a top eight, with Newcastle and Aston Villa joining the hunt for Champions League qualification. After finishing seventh and fourth in the last two seasons, Newcastle harbour real ambitions of a return to the top four and will be helped by the lack of fixture congestion that comes with not playing in Europe.What actually happened: They qualified for Europe in style. They won the League Cup – their first trophy in decades – in March to secure a place in the Conference League and then they upgraded to the Champions League on the final day of the season. Newcastle fans have rarely enjoyed a season as successful as this one.View image in fullscreenIt has been a spectacular season for Newcastle fans.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAAston Villa:predicted 6th, finished 6thWhat we predicted:AstonVilla have no desire to rest on their laurels and Emery did not sign a five-year contract extension to tread water. The obvious concern is how they will cope with at least eight high-powered midweek games being added to the calendar. Emery, who has transformed Villa into a dynamic force, will relish the challenge. After reaching the Conference League semi-finals last season, he also has his eyes set on winning a trophy.What actually happened: Villa did not win a trophy and they did not qualify for the Champions League, but they had some brilliant nights in the competition, going all the way to the quarter-finals and a narrow defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, giving their fans a day out at Wembley. They were unlucky to finish sixth and miss out on the Champions League on goal difference, but they will be a real threat in the Europa League – a competition Emery won three times with Sevilla and once with Villarreal.Nottingham Forest:predicted 16th, finished 7thWhat we predicted:Forest face Bournemouth, Southampton and Wolves in their first three games. They should not fear any of those opponents and will hope to build a platform for a better campaign after finishing 16th and 17th in the past two seasons.What actually happened: Never mind 17th; they were disappointed to finish seventh this season. Forest were by far the most improved team in the league, picking up 33 more points than in the previous campaign. They were unlucky to miss out on a place in the Champions League, having been in the top three for so long, but they will be a real force in the Conference League. Perhaps a first European trophy since the days of Brian Clough could be on the cards.Brighton:predicted 11th, finished 8thWhat we predicted:There is a renewed sense of optimism in the seaside air after Roberto De Zerbi was replaced by Fabian Hürzeler, the Premier League’s youngest-ever permanent manager. Having led St Pauli to promotion to the Bundesliga last season, the 31-year-old appears to be a smart choice to step into the enigmatic Italian’s shoes.What actually happened: Hürzeler has indeed proven a smart appointment. Brighton narrowly missed out on Europe but they played some entertaining football, beat Liverpool and Manchester United (twice), and did it all with a young squad who will only improve.View image in fullscreenBrighton enjoyed a few big wins this season.Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPABournemouth:predicted 12th, finished 9thWhat we predicted:The appointment of Andoni Iraola shows Bournemouth have lofty goals. A lack of fresh faces may concern fans but the manager, whose complicated doctrine takes time to set in, may argue there is more to come from the current squad.What actually happened: There was a lot more to come from the squad. Bournemouth finished in the top half of the table with a record points total, even beating Arsenal home and away. On top of that, they did it while playing an aggressive, high-energy style that excited their fans.Brentford:predicted 17th, finished 10thWhat we predicted:After a challenging campaign, Brentford fans will hope to not be the worst Premier League team in London. Survival, maybe alongside a cup run, would constitute a successful campaign.What actually happened: Brentford weren’t the worst Premier League team in London – not by a long way – and they stayed well clear of the relegation battle, finishing in the top half of the table. Despite a few injuries, and the exit of Ivan Toney, they thrived, especially up front. They scored 66 goals – more than Chelsea and just three fewer than Arsenal – which made the Gtech one of the most entertaining places to watch football in the country.Fulham:predicted 15th, finished 11thWhat we predicted:Marco Silva’s goal is to “sustain this club in the Premier League”. The manager provides a comfortable environment for talented players to revive their careers, having improved the lot of Willian, Andreas Pereira, Raúl Jiménez and Tom Cairney. He will hope to do the same this season with Emile Smith Rowe.What actually happened: Fulham continued to go from strength to strength under Silva, taking a record points haul in the Premier League while spending most of the campaign in the top half. Their fans enjoyed memorable wins against Liverpool and Chelsea. The challenge for next season if to become more consistent and not drop so many points from winning positions.Crystal Palace:predicted 10th, finished 12thWhat we predicted:Success has made Palace vulnerable. Michael Olise has gone to Bayern Munich for £50m, and Oliver Glasner faces the prospect of losing at least one other key player. Newcastle are increasingly optimistic of signing Marc Guéhi and Eberechi Eze has attracted interest from Manchester City and Tottenham. If Palace can keep hold of either, Glasner will have the opportunity to build on last season’s finish with a squad that should be well suited to his innovative 3-4-2-1 formationWhat actually happened: Palace continued to be remarkably consistent in the league; they have finished between 15th and 10th in each of the last 12 seasons. The big story, of course, was that they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final to win the first trophy of their history and qualify for Europe.View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner has become a hero in south London.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEverton:predicted 14th, finished 13thWhat we predicted:An emotional season awaits as Everton say a long goodbye to Goodison Park, their cherished home for 132 years, but the club will hope for a fresh start before relocating to a stunning new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock. That hope centres on Sean Dyche’s ability to withstand a host of off-field curveballs while hauling his team in the right direction.What actually happened: They had a fresh start – in the form of David Moyes, who returned to the club and dragged them up the table and away from the relegation hubbub. The club found some peace under Moyes, giving fans a chance to enjoy the Goodison sendoff.West Ham:predicted 9th, finished 14thWhat we predicted:Perhaps no team in the Premier League has undergone a bigger overhaul than West Ham, both in terms of personnel, playing style and ambition. David Moyes has been replaced by Julen Lopetegui, who has been sold to fans as a more attacking, exciting head coach. There is still work to be done but this summer has been a good start, even if it may take a few months for the players to gel and for Lopetegui’s style to come to fruition. A top-half finish and a strong cup run are realistic aims.What actually happened: A hugely disappointing season. Lopetegui did not last for long and his replacement, Graham Potter, has not really improved results. If the bottom three weren’t so bad, West Ham could have gone down. Two wins in their last three games took them up to 14th, giving an air of respectability to a drab campaign. Some stability is needed next season.Manchester United:predicted 5th, finished 15thWhat we predicted:Erik ten Hag and Sir Jim Ratcliffe say time is required for Manchester United to enjoy serial days of glory again and, after the team finished a record Premier League low of eighth place last season, you can understand their logic. But, privately, each may fancy their chances of being dark horse contenders, at least for a respectable chunk of the championship race.What actually happened: They were closer to the Championship than the championship. The season started badly and only got worse, the indignities piling up as the weeks passed. They did not win two games in a row in the league all season. Even their run to the Europa League final ended in embarrassment as they conceded a terrible goal to lose a terrible game to a terrible team, capping off a terrible season.View image in fullscreenManchester United’s season has been shambolic from start to finish.Photograph: Phil Duncan/Every Second Media/ShutterstockWolves:predicted 13th, finished 16thWhat we predicted:Wolves have sold their captain as well as their best player this summer but, rather than getting the excuses in early, there is a determination to kick on. The first few weeks will prove pivotal for Gary O’Neil and his team, with early games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester City. By November, will they be battle-hardened or worn down?What actually happened: Those early games proved decisive for O’Neil. Wolves did not win any of their first 10 matches and the manager was sacked before Christmas. An incredible run of six wins in a row under new manager Vítor Pereira took the team away from the relegation zone.Tottenham:predicted 4th, finished 17thWhat we predicted:Is there a club that spark greater existential debate than Spurs? What is their purpose? It doesn’t appear to be winning trophies given they’ve now gone more than 6,000 days without doing so. Perhaps it’s purely to entertain. Their primary objective for the new season is securing a top-four finish for the first time in three years, thereby reestablishing their place among Europe’s elite.What actually happened: Twenty-two league defeats and a place in the Champions League. Work that out. Even Spurs fans can’t agree about their season. Was it an embarrassment or, given their victory in the Europa League final, their most memorable in decades? Ange Postecoglou has spent the last week telling everyone it has been a triumph and that he is a “serial winner” but Daniel Levy may disagree.Leicester:predicted 19th, finished 18thWhat we predicted:The Championship was won at a canter but, as Burnley will testify, that means nothing in the top flight. It has not helped that their star man, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and manager, Enzo Maresca, have left for Chelsea, forcing them to spend the early part of the summer finding someone to lead the side. Steve Cooper is very different to Maresca and it will be interesting to see how quickly the players adapt.What actually happened: The players did not adapt and Cooper did not last. His replacement, Ruud van Nistelrooy, might not be sticking around for too long either. Leicester lost 25 games and conceded 80 goals yet, amazingly, they were the best of the three promoted teams.Ipswich:predicted 18th, finished 19thWhat we predicted:A generation of football followers had forgotten about Ipswich Town but one of the country’s famous old clubs are back after 22 years away, throbbing with life and confidence after a stunning rise through the divisions. What an occasion it will be when they host Liverpool, regular rivals for major honours during Town’s heyday in the 1970s and early 1980s, to open the season and the hope in Suffolk is that the glory years do not come to appear so distant.What actually happened: That hope was extinguished pretty quickly. Ipswich went into the season with some momentum after two successive promotions but they simply could not compete. It wasn’t a huge surprise to see them struggle given their budget, but winning just four games all season was still a big disappointment.View image in fullscreenIt was all a bit much for Ipswich this season.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersSouthampton:predicted 20th, finished 20thWhat we predicted:RussellMartin has not managed at this level and pragmatism could be key in the fight for survival, but he is unlikely to move too far from his ideals. Alphabetical order means Southampton start the season in 17th and it would be an achievement if they end the campaign in the same position come May.What actually happened: By the end, 17 points would have been an achievement. Southampton were abysmal. The only upside – if it can be called that – was that they weren’t as bad as the Derby County team of 2007-08. Not a high bar.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeaguePremier League 2024-25 review of the seasonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Authoritarianism and fascismthreaten the United States. The conspiracy thinking, paranoia and manufactured outrage so characteristic of QAnon and the big lie about the 2020 election have colonized our political discourse like a fungus. Even the National Spelling Bee, a cultural institution which will be celebrating its centennial this year and which is generally exempted from the far right’s paranoid vitriol, hasn’t been immune. Earlier this year, a foofaraw erupted when right-wing outletsreportedon the acceptance of “womyn” as an alternate spelling of “women” in the regional-level wordlist which the National Spelling Bee issues each year.The reason “womyn” was included in the wordlist wasn’t some shadowy feminist plot by the Bee’s organizers. The competition simply allows any word in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged dictionary, unless it is obsolete. “Womyn” is in the dictionary, along with tens of thousands of other words, such as “pointless”, “culture” and “war”.With zero self-awareness, an anti-trans podcast hostragedthat the Bee’s uncontroversial decision to allow “womyn” was a manifestation of “fabricated issues” and “totally manufactured outrage.” On Fox News, shesnarled, “How lucky are we to live in the United States of America, where the spelling of women, never mind the definition, has become a national debate.” Samantha Poetter-Parshall, a Kansas state representative, joined in the criticism,callingthe inclusion of womyn an instance of “crazy indoctrination of our children.” A parent quoted inreportageon the faux scandal shared Poetter-Parshall’s concern, asserting, “This is supposed to be about spelling and language, not ideology.”George Orwell, the author of Animal Farm, 1984, and the essay Politics and the English Language, would be startled to hear such a complaint. Orwell deeply understood the intimate relationship between language, thought, and politics. He keenly observed how “in our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible ... Political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is calledpacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is calledtransfer of populationorrectification of frontiers.People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is calledelimination of unreliable elements.”In our time,imprisoning and attemptingto deport legal residents of the US for their political views and sendinglegal residentsandgay people fleeing persecutionin Venezuela – andpotentially US citizens– to prisons in El Salvador where torture is widespread based onflimsy evidence from disgraced police officersis called “securing our homeland”. The announcement of economically ruinous tariffs which have wiped trillions off the stock market is called “liberation day.” Orwell believed that “to think clearly is a necessary first step towards political regeneration.” To combat the creep of Orwellian language, he argued that we should “recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end,” aiming to always use “language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought”.In its emphasis on linguistic precision and its heartfelt delight in words, the National Spelling Bee is already political in Orwell’s sense. The Bee also has an implicit politics of appreciation for cultural and linguistic diversity. Though most spellers are American, the competition hasan international flavor: it regularly features participants from Ghana, Canada, Jamaica, South Korea, China, and Nigeria, and spelling bees have sprung up in countries like Zimbabwe too. The welcome which the Bee extends to logophiles from all over the world inculcates in kids an appreciation of other cultures and promotes a cosmopolitan worldview. Spellers study words from Latin, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and German; this cultivates their love of linguistic variety. What’s more, the fact that the South Asian community regularly dominates the upper echelons of the competition reaffirms the importance of immigration to our society.These days, even if many Americans reject the Trump regime’s ugly attitudes and practices, xenophobia and racism are rampant, hearkening back to the bad old days of the Know-Nothing Party and the Chinese Exclusion Act. The US government has become increasingly hostile to international travelers: there have been a spate of horrific stories of tourists, visitors, and legal residents fromGermany,Canada,France, theUnited Kingdom,Australia, and elsewhere who have done nothing wrong being arrested, detained, and held for weeks by Ice, or being refused entry to the US and deported. In such a context, the National Spelling Bee’s steadfast commitment to multiculturalism is all the more essential.Despite itsunfortunate Covid-induced cancellationin 2020 and some turbulence fromrule changesandregional sponsor attritionin 2021 and 2022, the National Spelling Bee has been a relative constant for students in an age of extreme dislocation and upheaval. In these politically polarized times, it offers Americans an opportunity for joy and collective uplift. It celebrates education, attention, focus, dedication, andquiet, patient effort. It teaches students grit, discipline, and linguistics. It reminds us ofthe importance of the humanin an age of AI. It reinforces the importance of good sportsmanship and fair play. It promotesrespect and friendshiptowards humanity at large. It invites us to honor and remember the values that ought to unite us all. The National Spelling Bee is a reminder of what America has been – and what it must continue to be.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to the records, Retton was slurring her words when police stopped her, and officers saw a container of wine on the passenger seat of her car. She refused to take a breath test, and was released after posting a $1,500 bond.Mary Lou Retton says she ‘faced death in the eyes’ in battle with pneumoniaRead moreRetton became a household name in the US after she won five medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, including a gold in the all-around competition – the first individual Olympic gymnastics medal ever won by an American – scoringa perfect 10 on the vaultin the final rotation. The West Virginia native’s performance landed her on the front of Wheaties boxes and keyed the sport’s explosion in popularity in the United States.After her gymnastics career, Retton remained active in the media, appearing in a number of films and TV shows. She was inducted into the InternationalGymnasticsHall of Fame in 1997 and was the first woman to be selected into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020.Retton also served on the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under US president George W Bush.In 2023,she fell seriously illwith pneumonia and was in ICU for a number of weeks. At the time her daughter Kelley said her mother was “fighting for her life” and started a fundraiser to cover medical costs for Retton, who did not have medical insurance. Donations to the fundraiser ended up totaling nearly $500,000.

However, in light of the incident in Liverpool city centre on Monday, when 65 people were injured when acar drove into a crowdon Water Street, Slot and a senior delegation of Liverpool officials decided they should not attend.Visual guide to how the Liverpool parade collision unfoldedRead moreLiverpool cancelled all internal events after the incident and Slot felt it would be inappropriate to celebrate his achievements at the dinner. He sent a letter of apology to the LMA and event organisers in which he expressed his sadness at the horrific scenes that followed Liverpool’s trophy parade through the city.Slot wrote: “As you will know, a shocking incident took place in Liverpool yesterday, one that left dozens of men, women and children who had attended our parade injured and as a result I have had to withdraw from the event out of solidarity with all affected. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is one that I feel is absolutely right given the seriousness of the situation. I hope that I have your understanding in this regard.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the wider football community, including the LMA itself, the Premier League and many clubs who will be represented tonight, for the support we have received over the last 24 hours. Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this.“If you would indulge me, I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened. Along with the supporters and bystanders who helped one another in an hour of need, I think everyone involved in the aftermath deserves the gratitude of all of us.”The Liverpool head coach said he was “humbled” to be named Premier League manager of the season and honoured to be awarded the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy for the LMA Manager of the Year, particularly as the latter was voted for by his managerial peers.Slot said: “Sir Alex, I look forward to meeting with you at a later date to receive my trophy from you. I also look forward to attending my first LMA Annual Awards dinner on a future occasion. Thank you once again for your understanding and support. Enjoy your evening and if you could join me in keeping those affected by yesterday’s events in your thoughts and prayers it would be very much appreciated.”Explore more on these topicsArne SlotLiverpool (Football)Liverpool (UK news)newsShareReuse this content"

It was suggested that Jackson has a debt to repay.

At Real Betis’s Luis del Sol training ground in the south of a city that smells of orange blossom, swallows swoop through the sunshine to mud nests wedged into the wall of the white storehouse where the lawnmowers go. Rainbows appear in the sprinkler spray on the pitch where the session has just finished, last preparations before flying to Poland for theConference League final against Chelsea. There’s a line they are proud of here, a design for life:Viva el Betis, manque pierda.Long live Betis, even if they lose. And if they win? If they win, this may just be the biggest thing that has ever happened to them.On Lo Celso’s right calf is a football tattoo – old school and cartoonish with black and white hexagons – and the date of his debut, for Rosario Central in 2015. On his left is the Copa América, wrapped in an Argentina flag. He has won it twice, in 2021 and 2024. He also won a treble in France. Oh, and played aLeague Cup final with Tottenham– and, yes, he did watch them in Bilbao. “But I put this right up there, on the same level as those finals,” he says, settling on to a bench in the shade.Lego fan Levi Colwill becomes key building block for Maresca’s Chelsea projectRead more“As a player you dream of playing games like this, and all the more so for a club like this, which is very passionate,” Lo Celso says. “Every final is special, and this is lovely for the club. It’s a long time since we got here, to a moment like this.” A long time … or never. Betis have won one league title, led there by the Irish coach Patrick O’Connell in 1935. In the 50s, they fell as far as the third division, which is wheremanque pierdacame in, and often they did lose. They have won three cups: in 1997, 2005and 2022. They have never been in a European final before. Now here they are. For some clubs, the Conference League may not be a competition that moves them much, but this means everything to them.These are the best days they have had. A club that were in the second division 10 years ago – this is their longest consecutive run in the top flight – have qualified for Europe every year for the past five seasons. “If I had said that would happen when I came, they would have sent me home on the grounds that I was mad,”says Manuel Pellegrini, the coach who has taken them there, changing everything. “We found a way to bring an ambition and mentality that wasn’t there before.”View image in fullscreenLo Celso and the on-loan Antony have been rejuvenated in Seville under the management of Manuel Pellegrini.Photograph: Fran Santiago/Uefa/Getty Images“Within football everyone respects Manuel, appreciates him, especially here in the city,” Lo Celso says. “There’s an authority about him, leadership. He brings us a real calm, and that’s very important for a player. He gives you freedom as a player, but also the structure and the tools you need to be your best. He’s done well at every club, this is just another example and we’re grateful.”Gratitude is a good word. For Pellegrini, but also for something beyond the 71-year-old’s guidance, his commitment to nurturing talent, the ecosystem he has built. It’s about the club, the place: this is somewhere players come to be revived. “Betis changed my life,” their captain, Marc Bartra, says. Isco had been out of work for six months, forgotten and seemingly finished, and is now back in the Spain squad at 33: he described Betis as“my light in the darkness”. The Manchester United winger Antony insists: “I always say I found myself here.” Extraordinary since his arrival,he wants to stay.There’s something about Betis. “Its people,” Lo Celso says. They’re different, funny, warm. Only three clubs in Spain have more members and few fans are louder or more loyal. They are also everywhere, the Andalusian diaspora depositing them all over the peninsula. A remarkable 30,500 of them turned out to watch their teamtrainthe day before the derbythis season. “Betis are big because of its people,” Lo Celso says. “That makes the climate very special for a player. It’s about the way football is lived in this city and the club has been able to make the most of that. When you go on to the pitch, there’s a feeling there, like you want to give them something back for all the support, all the care.”Lo Celso had been at Betis in 2018-19 and wanted to go back, the decision to do so immediately vindicated. “It was five years earlier, but when I returned it felt like it was just last week,” he says. “It’s a club that makes you feel like you’re family.”View image in fullscreenGiovani Lo Celso during his time at Spurs in 2020.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty ImagesHe arrived having provided the assist for the only goal in the final at the Copa América. He had missed the World Cup through injury, leaving him in tears, although it had also allowed him to be there for the birth of his daughter: watching on television, his wife’s waters broke in the exact moment thatLeo Messi scored against Mexico. Which is why after he provided the pass to Lautaro Martínez, his teammate and room mate Rodrigo de Paul wrote: “[This is] the assist of your life and all of ours. You chewed poison, you suffered in silence and today you rubbed the lamp so that we could bring the cup home.”There’s a moment’s silence, then Lo Celso says, quietly: “There’s a lot people don’t see.”A lot. Lo Celso had left home at 19, a kid playing alongside Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappé at Paris Saint-Germain. When Thomas Tuchel took over from Unai Emery, he found opportunities limited. Heading to Betis, though, he also found a home, and at Villarreal. At Tottenham, there were injuries and, in truth, a sense that he never entirely integrated nor felt that this was his place. The glimpses of quality that are constant in Spain were few in north London. Glimpses of him were too: he missed 65 games.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Having been left out of the Spurs squad for the opening two games of the Premier League season, Betis offered him a way out. “He did a lot to make this deal possible,” the club’s president said.He was Gio again, a gamechanger, a step above. He scored twice in his first start and found the net again in his second, third and fourth. Five goals in four matches – every goal that Betis scored. Three brief muscle injuries have affected his season, but there have been eight goals and three assists, a level above, everything elevated when he is there. The only debate has been whether there is a place for he and Isco, not least as Isco’s return to fitness and Betis’s revival coincided with Lo Celso being injured in February and March.“Choosing between Isco and Gio is like choosing between your mum and dad,” as Bartra put it. When Lo Celso recently scored a gorgeous goal against Espanyol, assisted by Isco, Pellegrini seized on it. “This ends the debate about Isco and Gio. Good players can always play together,” he said. They started the semi-final second leg together. The only small doubt over the XI for the final as Betis landed in Poland was Lo Celso, but that’s about fitness not form. Pellegrini wants him on the pitch, if he can. He wants to be there too. “Lots of things happened there [at Spurs] but I’m in the place where I want to be and I’m very happy, enjoying this moment,” he says. “Players go through ups and downs; people don’t realise what’s happening sometimes. But we’ve overcome the difficulties we had and now we have a lovely opportunity to make history.”Lo Celso has faced Chelsea six times and never won. There is a single draw among those games:0-0 in November 2020. “I didn’t know that,” he says. “Well, now’s a good moment to change that. I’ve watched Chelsea a lot. They have a clear idea of how to play, very good players. But we have our qualities too. It doesn’t matter what form you’re in, who it is, whether they have rotated a lot. It would be nice to please Spurs fans too. I have a lot of affection for them, and great friends playing there.”Yet it’s not about them. It’s about Betis, their people, a lifetime waiting for this. Or, more accurately,not evenwaiting for this. “We know how big this is. How important: it’s a European final, for the first time in our whole history. ”Does that weigh on you? “No”. Why not? “Because although it’s a final, it’s a football match. We know what it means. But it’s two teams, one game. We’re not thinking about what happens next, about what would happen if we win. We know the fans are excited. We’re just focused on the game, we want to try to enjoy it. These are the moments you dream of. It won’t be easy but we know that this is a chance to make a lot of people very happy.”Explore more on these topicsReal BetisLa LigaEuropa Conference LeagueEuropean club footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian has been told many of them were paid as little as £11,000 a year by Blackburn as they were employed on part-time contracts, with the PFA stepping in to provide financial assistance despite not having any formal obligation to do so.The PFA has approximately 250 female members, with some of the funding the union receives from the Premier League, English ­Football League and Football Association diverted to provide them with some basic services. Players in the WSL 2 have been ineligible to join the PFA, however, as the union lacks the resources to support them.WSL Football, the company responsible for running the top two tiers of the women’s game, is understood to have reached an agreement in principle with the PFA to provide a funding package that is expected to be signed in the next few weeks. Both parties are confident that all WSL 2 players will be PFA members by the start of next season, the first in which all clubs in the top two divisions will be fully professional.The Premier League pays around £25m a year to fund the PFA, which has more than 5,000 male members, and the WSL deal will be far smaller. However, as well as expanding the membership the PFA will use the money to offer female-specific ­services for the first time, particularly in areas such as rehabilitation, strength and conditioning, and ­medical research.Funding comprehensive union representation for players in both tiers was one of the key recommendations of the Raising the Bar review, the government-commissioned independent review of women’s football chaired by Karen Carney,which was published in 2023.Carney’s review also called for an improvement in the minimum standards criteria demanded by the WSL of all clubs in the top two divisions, including increased training time, the introduction of a minimum salary and the provision of a “gold standard” in physical and mental health services to all players.View image in fullscreenKaren Carney’s 2023 review of women’s football called for funding of union representation for players in the top two tiers.Photograph: S Meddle/ITV/ShutterstockWSL Football has moved to implement these higher minimum standards from next season, although the increased costs involved have proved too much for some clubs, with Blackburn deciding to withdraw from WSL 2. However, a source at one WSL 2 club said the new standards “are not particularly onerous”, and most clubs at that level budget for losses of between £750,000 and £1m each year.Blackburn’s owner, Venkys London Ltd, decided the cost was too high 12 months afterReading also withdrewfrom the second tier on financial grounds. Wolves also angered their players by not formally applying for promotion from the third tier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club committed to ­staying full-time with fully professional players after relegation and plan to play all their home games at Bramall Lane regardless of which division they are in.While WSL Football will make recommendations the final decision rests with the FA Board, which in the past has opted to give clubs reprieves from relegation. Lewes were given the option to stay in the second tier after Reading’s late withdrawal last summer, but had already released players and gone part-time following relegation so the Championship was reduced to 11 clubs.WSL Football and the PFA declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballPFAnewsShareReuse this content"

The goalkeeper thought it was a one‑off, that she would be back, but she was omitted from the next squad, then the next, and it was not until Sarina Wiegman arrived as head coach that things took an upward turn. In that year away from the international game she thought she would never pull on the shirt again, and that took an emotional and mental toll.No one, least of all Earps, could have predicted what would lie ahead. Injuries to Karen Bardsley and Ellie Roebuck opened the door for Earps to start under Wiegman and she grabbed the opportunity. She went from third-choice goalkeeper at the 2019 World Cup in France and out in the cold in 2020 tothe No 1for the Lionesses at the home Euros in 2022.Her rise to prominence during a phenomenal run to afirst major international titlefor the senior women’s side was staggering. Fun and personable, her iconic hip swinging on the table after the players crashed Wiegman’s post-match press conference following the Euro 2022 final thrust her personality to the fore.With the spotlight comes responsibility and Earps rose to it, becoming a vocal and passionate advocate for goalkeeping and goalkeeper coaching, speaking candidly about the lack of proper coaching available to her generation of keepers for much of their careers and supporting efforts to increase the popularity of the position.View image in fullscreenMary Earps has found her playing time with England reduced in the last year.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThen, there was the challenging of the England sponsors Nike on the eve of the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. When asked about the lack of availability of replica women’s goalkeeper kits, she paused, clearly emotional and weighing up whether it was the right time to speak out, before launching into an impassioned plea for the sportswear giant to make a U-turn on their decision to not sell the kits. She said: “I can’t really sugarcoat this in any way, so I am not going to try. It is hugely disappointing and very hurtful.”She forced changein the months that followed.At that World Cup Earps shone on the pitch, collecting the Golden Glove after England endured heartbreak, losing 1-0 against Spain in the final. She earned the nickname “queen of stops” and footage of her expletive‑laden reaction after saving a penalty to keep the deficit to a single goal went viral.She was named Fifa’s best women’s goalkeeper in 2022 and 2023 for those tournament heroics andwon BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, she became the first women’s football player to have a waxwork at Madame Tussauds having won a public vote. She also launched her own line of T-shirts inspired by her speech when she won her first Fifa award in 2022, dedicating the win to “anyone who’s ever been in a dark place” before saying: “You can achieve anything you set your mind to. Sometimes success looks like this – collecting trophies – sometimes it’s just waking up and putting one step in front of the other. There’s only one of you in the world, and that’s more than good enough. Be unapologetically yourself.”View image in fullscreenMary Earps saves a penalty from Jenni Hermoso in the Women’s World Cup final.Photograph: Damian Briggs/Speed Media/ShutterstockIn recent months Earps has found her playing time with England reduced, with Chelsea’s Hannah Hampton preferred to the goalkeeper capped 53 times. It is a widely held view that Hampton is better with the ball at her feet, which suits the way England want to play, building out from the back. However, whether the talented 24-year-old, who has performed exceptionally well for Chelsea this season, will be able to match the stage presence, confidence and output of Earps on the biggest international stages remains to be seen.Earps’s international retirement comes as a shock, but it is understood to be something she has been considering and discussing with Wiegman for some time. The timing of the announcement, so soon before the European Championship, is unusual, and many would have liked to see the senior stateswoman steer England’s young keepers through the tournament. The reasons for the decision and its timing will no doubt come out in the future; what we can take some time to do now is appreciate and reflect on Earps’s commitment, passion and energy in an England shirt.Explore more on these topicsMary EarpsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

This is howCarlo Ancelottiwas introduced as the new head coach of the Brazil national team. Despite having worked for the biggest clubs in the world, the Italian did not hide his joy at the new challenge of leading the Seleção in their hunt for a sixth World Cup title.“It is an honour to lead the best national team in the world. I have a great mission, so thatBrazilcan be champions again. I have always had a very special connection with Brazil. The reception yesterday was incredible,” Ancelotti said.Carlo Ancelotti bows out at Real Madrid: ‘I don’t regret a thing. I’ve had a good time’Read moreMore than 250 journalists attended the presentation. In addition to the first press conference, he also announced the 23 players who will represent the Seleção in the games against Ecuador and Paraguay in the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches. The headline was the absence of Neymar and the return of the experienced Casemiro and Richarlison.Important names in Brazilian football were present. Luiz Felipe Scolari, head coach of Brazil’s 2002 World Cup winners, wished him luck and presented Ancelotti with a coach’s jacket from the national team. In addition to Scolari, the presentation was attended by Júnior, 1982 and 1986 World Cup player, and Denílson, a 2002 World Cup winner, and featured videos of national idols who have worked with Ancelotti, such as Zico, Kaká and Falcão.“My connection with Brazil began in the 1980s, with Falcão and Cerezo. Then with Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Pato, Kaká, Marcelo, Cafu and currently with Vini [Vinícius Júnior], Rodrygo, Militão and Endrick. But this will be the first time I will work in Rio. I have lived in big cities around the world, but I’ve never lived in Rio. I want to enjoy this city,”Ancelotti said.His good humour contrasts with the situation that greets him, one of the worst in the history of the team. Not only will the squad head to the United States in 2026 after a 24-year drought since their last World Cup win, equalling the period without any titles from 1970 to 1994, but the head coach arrives to find a Brazilian Football Confederation mired in political instability.Since 2012, no elected president of the CBF has managed to complete his term, with all either being removed or resigning over various scandals. However, the CBF was not a topic at Ancelotti’s press conference, with more focus on the failed attempts to hire him as coach in 2023. “Our negotiations began two years ago. But it ended because I had a contract with Real Madrid. That’s why I come just now,” he said.View image in fullscreenCarlo Ancelotti, left, receives a Brazil jersey from CBF president, Samir Xaud.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APAncelotti promised upon landing to learn Portuguese but not everything will be work in his new life. “Today you can watch all the matches anywhere in the world. You can watch Flamengo, Palmeiras, Botafogo …” he said. “But now I need to spend some time in Brazil to get to know the structure of Brazilian football, the players. But I also want to have a holiday to enjoy the country. I’ve never been to Corcovado. I’m not going to work 365 days a year. I also want to have a holiday to enjoy Brazil.”Brazilian culture was a topic discussed by the new coach. In his autobiography The Beautiful Games of an Ordinary Genius, Ancelotti had already reported a little about the particularities of Brazilian players. One of them is the patriarchal relationship between athletes and coaches.“The personal relation is very important. I always pay special attention to this. It’s not just a professional issue. Each player has a different character. Brazil has spectacular players. But what sets Brazilians apart is that they can do serious things and also fun things. I like that and I also care about having a great work environment,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Within this quality, there is also experience and leadership. Estêvão [the 18-year-old Palmeiras winger] has also been called up because of his quality. I like this connection between young and experienced players,” Ancelotti said. “Young players bring joy and enthusiasm. Experienced players bring knowledge, reading and experience. Estêvão can help Casemiro. Casemiro can help Estêvão.”Ancelotti also used humour to explain Vinícius Júnior’s situation. With only six goals for Brazil, the forward is a target of criticism in the country for not repeating his good performances at Real Madrid. But Ancelotti suggested that this situation will end.“Brazilian players have a lot of affection for their national team and this affects their natural thinking a little. I’m going to try to get the best version of Vini. He’s a sensational, fantastic player. Will Brazil play like Real Madrid? I hope. But like last year. Not this year,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCarlo AncelottiBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than celebrating another significant milestone, the 38-year-old’s focus had to shift immediately towards recovering physically and adjusting to the conditions at Roland Garros.Draper and Norrie help British players set best first-round return in 52 years at French OpenRead moreAfter handling the first challenge well, Djokovic reflected on the decision to take a wildcard at Geneva and his hopes that it will help him as he tries to produce his best form at Roland Garros. “Geneva was not in the plans, it was not in the schedule,” said Djokovic. “But I was talking with my team and decided to have that, because I didn’t have any practically, only two matches on clay. I’m the type of player that is required to play a bit more in order to find the right game for clay. It doesn’t come very natural to me as maybe for some other guys.“I rarely started really well on clay, if you analyse all of my seasons in my career. So it takes a little bit of time for me to get accustomed with the surface and movement and striking the ball. I think it was a good move to go to Geneva because I was also struggling a little bit with my confidence level, doubting my game a bit. So it was good that I got four matches under my belt, won a title. Coming into Roland Garros, it feels different than I had compared to the feeling I had three weeks ago. Let’s see how far I can go here, but I have a good feeling for now.”While Djokovic advanced without any problems, Hurkacz did not fare as well. As has been the case in most of his matches this year, the 18-year-old Brazilian João Fonseca drew a large crowd for his match against Hurkacz, with hundreds of spectators queueing outside the entrances to Court seven for a glimpse of a possible future star. “I knew there is going to be a lot of Brazilians here in Paris, a lot of Brazilians living here and they come a lot,” said Fonseca. “I think because of Guga [Gustavo Kuerten], because of the tradition, and there is a lot of Brazilians.”Those who managed to get in were treated to a remarkable result as Fonseca dismantled Hurkacz, the 30th seed, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the second round at Roland Garros on his tournament debut. Fonseca’s first grand slam win had been a straight-sets defeat of Andrey Rublev, the ninth seed, at the Australian Open.One year on from her breakthrough run to the semi-finals at theFrench Openaged 17, Mirra Andreeva opened up her campaign with a calm 6-4, 6-3 win against Cristina Bucșa of Spain.

Sonay Kartal, meanwhile, continued her steady rise by beating Erika Andreeva 6-0, 6-2 to win on her main-draw debut.After victories forKatie Boulter, Emma Raducanu and Jacob Fearnley on Monday, this is the first time in the open era that three British men and three women have won first-round matches at Roland Garros, and the most British players into the second round since 1973.“I think it’s great and it shows that we’re not afraid of playing well on the clay,” said Draper. “All of them, [I have] great respect for, they all work really hard and they’re all great players. I’m not surprised, either, to be honest.”Draper returned to Paris for his third career appearance in a ­curious position. He has continued his ­incredible rise this year by finally breaking through on clay and entered Court Suzanne-Lenglen as a top‑five player at a grand slam tournament for the first time but still seeking his first French Open victory.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie said he felt his win against Medvedev was one of the best of his career.Photograph: Lisi Niesner/ReutersUnder those circumstances, his early nerves were not surprising. He struggled with his serve from the start and was ­tentative behind his usually destructive ­forehand. An explosive, dynamic and wildly entertaining player with ample variety, Bellucci rolled to a 5-1 lead before taking the first set 6-3 with the help of a sweet ­underarm serve. Draper, however, remained calm and was completely dominant by the end of the match. He will next face Gaël Monfils, who came from two sets down to beat Hugo Dellien late on Tuesday night.“When I lost the first set, I wasn’t panicking at all because I obviously came out slow, but then I was building my way back into the match in that first set,” said Draper. “Yeah, he’s going to have to play another two sets to beat me.”Norrie’s victory against ­Medvedev is one of the best wins at a grand slam tournament in his career. It also marked a first win against his Russian opponent after losing all four of their previous meetings in straight sets. Norrie had started the match extremely well, pairing his ­typical discipline, durability and ­consistency with greater aggression on his forehand.As Medvedev forced himself inside the baseline and began to ­dictate, Norrie lost control and the match flipped dramatically. Down 3-5 in the fifth set, though, ­Norrie locked down his game and found his way to an incredible escape, reeling off the final four games of the match to close out an excellent win. In round two, Norrie will face Federico Gomez, a lucky loser.Afterwards, ­Norrie described the win as one of the top three of his career. “Outside of Alcaraz, Sinner and Novak, [Medvedev] would be probably the fourth toughest draw for me in terms of match-ups and ­players,” he said. “Extremely good win, ­especially [considering] my record with him. What’s his ­ranking, 12 or 11 in the world? In a slam, best‑of-five, beating him in five sets is impressive for me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two weeks ago, the 29-year-old fell to No 91 in the rankings, his lowest since 2018.Norrie is an ambitious individual but in order to find his way again, he had to take a step back and detach himself from his intense expectations and simply enjoy tennis again. A turning point came after another easy first-round loss at the Miami Open in March.“After Miami, I felt I was ­trying too hard and forcing things too much,” he said. “I took some time, thought about everything in my career and my personal life and I think I was setting expectations too high. I talked to my team, a long ­meeting, just to try to enjoy the tennis a bit more and look for good moments.“I started winning straight after that and started watching matches back. I looked a lot more like myself on the court. [I thought] why not go and enjoy it, go and play and compete? Looking back after my career, you’re gonna miss competing and miss the tough moments, and I don’t want to regret that.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Jack DraperFrench OpenTennisEmma RaducanuKatie BoulternewsShareReuse this content"

He moved to Paris-based Racing 92, but it has proved a testing campaign for him in terms of injuries and Stuart Lancaster left as head coach in January.The Breakdown | Trash-talk and rough sleeping: following the 2001 Lions’ tour of AustraliaRead moreAsked about any possibleSaracensreturn, McCall said: “It’s just not worth answering, to be honest, because as far as I know he is under contract at Racing and has a year left. There are so many of these stories that come out. As you know from me down the years, there is no point talking about something that is so pie in the sky. It’s ­better for me not to comment.”McCall did say he would be surprised if the 33-year-old’s rugby future did not lie in coaching. Saracens are close to appointing a new attack specialist after Kevin Sorrell announced he would leave the club when this season finishes.While McCall said Farrell had not been interviewed for that post, he sees clear coaching credentials in the 112-cap former England captain. “I would be very surprised if he didn’t commit to coaching, to be honest,” McCall said. “Rugby is in his skin. He has got a great IQ and a passion and love for it, like his dad [Andy Farrell]. I would be absolutely amazed if that wasn’t what he wanted to do. But I can tell you it won’t be him who will be our next attack coach. He hasn’t been interviewed. He is a player for now, and has 14 months left on his contract with Racing.”Farrell’s former England teammate, theLeicesterprop Dan Cole, has announced he will retire at the end of this season. The 38-year-old, England’s second-most capped men’s player with 118, will hang up his boots at the conclusion of Leicester’s campaign.Cole featured in four World Cups, reaching the final in 2019, and has won four Premiership titles with Leicester. He also toured twice with the British & Irish Lions. The veteran said his decision was influenced partly by that of Ben Youngs, his longtime teammate for club and country, who is also retiring.Cole told Leicester’s website: “It has not been an easy decision at all. I have been to-ing and fro-ing – however, I think this is the best time for me to finish playing. I believe with Ben Youngs, Julián Montoya and others that are in and around my age ending their time at the club at the end of the season, plus the new chapter next season with Geoff Parling coming in as head coach, it’s time for the club to kick on and the right time for me to go.“As you get older, physically, it’s definitely harder to carry on and, looking around the changing room, I am 10 years older than most of the guys in there with me and that’s challenging as well. I don’t want to be the old guy, just sat around and hanging on to something for too long.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A host of young talents have developed on Liam Rosenior’s watch, including Emegha, who played a key role in the side’s rise by scoring 14 goals in 27 league games this season.Chelsea have been watching the 22-year-old’s progress and want to keep him under their umbrella. It is likely that any other club hoping to sign the Dutchman this summer will be given short shrift.The idea is for Emegha to maintain his progress under Rosenior next season and leave a pathway open for him to move to the next level by joining Chelsea before the 2026-27 campaign. Such an agreement would demonstrate to other young players that there is value in playing for Strasbourg. Andrey Santos, the highly promising Brazilian midfielder, is expected to be part of Chelsea’s squad after a successful year on loan at Strasbourg.An agreement for Emegha at this stage is expected to be independent of Chelsea’s attempts to add at least one new forward to their squad for next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To say the 43-year-old and Howe initially failed to hit it off would be an understatement but, after the manager threatened to leave Tyneside last July if the ­newcomer challenged his autonomy too dramatically, the relationship gradually improved.Premier League 2024-25 fans’ verdicts: stars, flops, and the most loved refereesRead moreThere was a further setback last autumn when Mitchell offered journalists a car crash of a group ­interview including an assertion that ­Newcastle’s scouting system wasunfit for purpose.Yet while that went down very badly with Howe, the pair, once again, eventually brokered an ­apparently enduring peace deal. That truce seemed to be holding as the mana­ger, Mitchell and the outgoing chief executive, Darren Eales, met Yasir al‑Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chair, and a delegation from the club’s Saudi Arabian owners – the kingdom’s ­Public Investment Fund – on Tyneside on Sunday night after theteam’s 1-0 defeat against Evertonat St James’ Park.Despite that result Newcastle qualified for the Champions League and Howe was keen to line up a ­transfer strategy with the contingent that had flow in from Riyadh.Instead the meeting ended with the unexpected decision to part company with Mitchell. There are suggestions he could be replaced by the promotion of two key ­figures already present in the recruitment department, the ­long‑serving Steve Nickson and Howe’s nephew, Andy Howe.Many Premier League managers no longer have the final word on player signings but Eddie Howe has always insisted upon it and now his hand looks to have been strengthened appreciably.Newcastle have failed to sign a single regular first-team player during the past three transfer windows but their worries about meeting ­Premier League profit and ­sustainability regula­tions are now believed to be behind them and this promises to be a big-spending ­summer for the ­Carabao Cup holders.Howe is ­anxious to sign ready-made Champions League players rather than the less-expensive rough diamonds Mitchell was confident could be improved beyond recognition by the manager’s coaching skills.Eales, who recruited Mitchell to Newcastle and previously worked with him at Tottenham, announced last year that he would be stepping down once the Saudis identified a successor. Eales has been diagnosed with a chronic form of blood cancer and needs to concentrate on his ­treatment but has said he will remain in post until a replacement is installed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Funke was removed from the premises, he is said to have returned and confronted the two alleged victims. One of the men who was stabbed said he showed a knife to Funke but did not intend to use it and put it back in his pocket. An altercation ensued during which Funke allegedly stabbed the two Knicks fans. Court documents said one of the fans had a wound to his back, and the other a laceration on one of his legs.Funke claims the Knicks fans were “talking shit” and punched and shoved him, before he swung his knife in self-defence. According to court documents, several witnesses say Funke was the aggressor in the situation.Funke was scheduled to appear at a hearing in Hamilton county on Tuesday afternoon.The incident is not the first involving friction between Pacers and Knicks fans during the playoffs. A Pacers fan was pelted with garbage near Madison Square Garden after the Knicks’ victory over the Boston Celtics in the previous round.Explore more on these topicsNBAIndiana PacersNew York KnicksIndianaUS sportsBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

He can claim to be one of the best all-around attacking players in Serie A, leading the league in chances created, according to Opta. If his Gold Cup absence helps him stay fit and in form for the World Cup, it’s doubtful anyone will care about missing this summer’s tournament come next June.Johnny Cardoso:Johnny has been a minor revelation over the course of Real Betis’ season, which could end in silverware with Wednesday’s Europa Conference League final against Chelsea. The Brazilian-born defensive midfielder ranks among the elite at his position in interceptions, clearances, aerials won, and take-ons (all according to FBRef), showing his importance as a defensive shield and press-breaker. He could be in line for a step up: Atlético Madrid are reportedly interested in prying him from Betis.Brenden Aaronson:Aaronson appeared in all 46 of Leeds’s league games and started the vast majority of them, racking up a little over 3,500 minutes – by far the most he’s played in a season. He had 11 goal contributions (nine goals, two assists) for the best attack in the Championship, and helped his team off the ball with relentless pressing. There’s no guarantee Aaronson will get as much time in the Premier League next season, but his 2024-25 campaign was still important to establish himself at a decent level.Malik Tillman:Tillman had a breakout season for PSV in 2023-24, and he topped that this season as PSV once again captured the Dutch title while he earned Player of the Season nods from multiple outlets. Tillman set a career high in goals and came close to doing the same in total minutes – especially impressive considering he missed two months with an ankle injury. The question now for Tillman is whether PSV will get an offer they can’t refuse for him from a bigger league.Antonee Robinson:When the season started, Robinson was among the best left-backs in the Premier League. Now that the season is done, he’s still in that conversation. Robinson was a consistent threat down the left for Fulham, only taking a step back towards the end of the year due to a case of tendinopathy (which will also keep him from the US squad this summer). There continue to be rumors of an incoming move for Robinson from one of the Premier League’s Big Six, and they continue to be justified.View image in fullscreenAntonee Robinson in action for Fulham against Manchester United.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHelped a littleRicardo Pepi:The only thing keeping Pepi from the top category was January’s knee injury that ruled him out for the rest of PSV’s season. Before that point, Pepi had scored 17 times in 27 appearances, including twice in the Champions League. He seemed to be forcing a genuine competition between himself and grizzled vet Luuk de Jong. If he can keep this up next season, he’ll continue to be relevant in the US’s striker debate.Tanner Tessmann:Tessmann struggled to establish himself early on at Lyon, but gradually got more time at defensive midfield and looked more comfortable after jumping from Serie B, where he spent last season with Venezia. In all, it was a season of growth for Tessmann, who got an extended look with the US at the Nations League but missed the cut for the Gold Cup.Chris Richards:His numbers with Crystal Palace are similar this season as last, but playing all 90 minutes of every game of the team’scaptivating run to FA Cup glorycounts for a lot. The center back is starting to look the part of the US’s first-choice central defender, though his ideal partner is still very much an open debate. Speaking of which …Mark McKenzie:McKenzie was a consistent starter for Toulouse in Ligue 1, and there’s much to be said for establishing oneself as that in a top European league. His individual performances have not always stood out, but this season certainly improved his standing. One wrinkle: at Toulouse he has usually played as the left side of a three-man backline – not a formation that the US plays often.Damion Downs:A surprise inclusion on the Gold Cup training camp roster, Downs scored 11 times in all competitions for Köln in the 2.Bundesliga this season, helping the club top the table and get back into the top flight. The Germany/US dual national has speed, size and an eye for goal, but it’s hard to know how where he ranks in the rest of the striker pool right now. We’ll find out more this summer.Kept on keeping onJosh Sargent:The Norwich City striker continued to bang in the goals – 15 this year after 16 last year in the Championship, with five assists this season. Also like last season, Sargent missed significant time in the middle of the campaign due to injury (in 2024-25 it was groin surgery, in 2023-24 it was an ankle injury). Sargent is still looking for a season in which he a) stays healthy for a full season, b) maintains his scoring record in a top division, and c) carries at least some of that form over to the national team. As it is, he remains in the Championship for now and was left off the Gold Cup squad in what Pochettino called a “football decision.”View image in fullscreenJosh Sargent continues to be a consistent scorer in the Championship.Photograph: John Walton/PAAlejandro Zendejas:Zendejas was a key contributor to a strong Club América side that may yet compete in the Club World Cup. His numbers are in line with where they’ve been for the previous two seasons, and his direct style on the wing provides a different look than many USMNT players at the position.Haji Wright:Wright scored 12 goals while helping Coventry reach the Championship play-offs, where they fell to Sunderland. He missed about three months with an ankle injury and split time between left wing and center forward. The same versatility and finishing instincts that brought him to the national team are still there, which is why he’ll re-join the US this summer.Weston McKennie:To see McKennie’s value to Juventus this year, just look at the positions they had him play. Central midfield, right-back, left-back, attacking midfield, second striker … McKennie did just about everything forLa Vecchia Signorathis season. And this after he was once again shopped very openly by the club in the off-season. That probably won’t be happening this time around, with McKennie signing a deserved contract extension earlier this month. He’s a lock in a first-choice US squad, and seems as if he’ll be in the picture for Juve for at least another year.Cameron Carter-Vickers:Another season, another consistent role in the heart of the Celtic defense, another Scottish Premiership title. That’s four straight domestic league trophies now for CCV with Celtic. Those consistent minutes and trophies didn’t lead to a spot with the US for this summer’s Gold Cup, though.Gianluca Busio:Busio enjoyed a consistent role in central midfield for Venezia and enjoyed some bright moments, but the season ends with a bitter taste due to Venezia’s relegation to Serie B. Busio is 22 and just completed his fourth season with Venezia, with this being the club’s second relegation in that time. Busio has been solid enough in Serie A to merit a move to stay at that level, and his contract expires in 2026 – the time is right for Venezia to make a move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adams finished with just over 2,000 minutes played for the second time in three years, and ranked in the top quarter among his positional peers in the Big 5 leagues in tackles, interceptions, blocks, clearances, and aerial duels won. His case to stay on the national team doesn’t need to be made now that he’s fully healthy.Joe Scally:Scally was a dependable, every-game starter for Borussia Mönchengladbach, just as he was for the previous three seasons. His role on the national team is also well-established – primarily depth at full-back. He hasn’t made a leap into the next category yet, but he’s still just 22 – that’s more than OK.Questions remainTim Weah:What’s his best position? Weah started off as a center forward, rose through the ranks at PSG and the US as a winger, but has been playing a fair amount of wingback for Juventus over the past season. Versatility is no bad thing, but Weah has yet to establish a consistent role and much depends onwhether Juventus manager Igor Tudor sticks around, and what system he or his successor will deploy next season.Sergiño Dest:For Dest, this season was all about one thing: getting healthy. He has done so, recovering from an offseason ACL tear in time to make appearances in PSV’s last handful of league games before capturing the Eredivisie title. He will make his return to the national team this summer, and it remains to be seen to what degree he’ll mesh with Pochettino.John Tolkin:Tolkin had a rough introduction to the German Bundesliga after making the move from his hometown New York Red Bulls, playing 11 games and notching two assists as Holstein Kiel finished in the relegation zone. The question, then, is whether Tolkin will be able to stand out in the 2.Bundesliga, which is what might be needed for him to get another call to the national team before the World Cup.Marlon Fossey:For the second straight season Fossey was a consistent starter at right-back for Standard Liège. They are usually traditionally a power in Belgium but finished seventh this season. Fossey was a part of the United States squad at the most recent Nations League, but did not impress enough to make the cut for the Gold Cup training camp.Matko Miljevic:Miljevic moved from Newell’s to Huracán in Argentina, reportedly after somedisciplinary issues. He has seemingly done alright so far this season, but wasn’t part of the Gold Cup training camp and seems a longshot to be a consistent fixture in the US team.Falling down the pecking orderGiovanni Reyna:There is no questioning Reyna’s raw talent, but it’s clearly long past time for him to get a fresh start. Reyna amassed just over 600 minutes for Borussia Dortmund this season, the vast majority of which were late appearances off the bench in which he usually failed to make much of an impact. Even if it means dropping to a less-fancied team or league,Reyna needs time on the field.View image in fullscreenGiovanni Reyna may need to move on from Dortmund.Photograph: Ralf Treese/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockYunus Musah:Musah requested to be excluded from the US national team this summer with what the federation called a “personal issue”. We don’t know if that issue is part of what led to Musah’s funk at Milan this season, where he was in and out of the lineup, tried in many different positions, and generally failed to impress much at any of them. It seems like Musah needs a reset, and that’s what he’ll get this summer.Matt Turner:Turner is still locked in a competition to be the US No 1 goalkeeper, but every day he spends on the bench for his club side weakens his case a little bit more. Turner either needs to find a way to beat out Dean Henderson at Crystal Palace (unlikely), or move somewhere he’ll get consistent time as a starter.Auston Trusty:Trusty traded long periods as Carter-Vickers’ first-choice central defensive partner with multi-week stints on the bench for Celtic. He impressed at various points in the Champions League, but overall didn’t do much to increase his standing internationally.Folarin Balogun:It’s fair to say at this point that the move to Monaco after a 21-goal season with Stade de Reims has not worked out. Balogun has only scored 12 times in the two seasons since, and in 2024-25 he spent long periods out with shoulder and ankle injuries. In the meantime, his competition at striker for the national team has only gotten more intense. When healthy and in form, Balogun is an easy pick for the US. He hasn’t been either of those things for a while now.Explore more on these topicsUSAChristian PulisicUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Thunder fouled Anthony Edwards with 3.5 seconds to go, and his intentional miss of the second one to try to keep possession was tracked down in the corner by Gilgeous-Alexander and flung out of bounds in attempt to drain the clock.The Wolves had one more inbounds pass with 0.3 seconds remaining that Williams grabbed to send the Thunder back to Oklahoma City for Game 5 on Wednesday with the chance to advance to theNBAfinals.Edwards was limited to 16 points by Thunder’s relentless defense, and Julius Randle (five points on 1-for-7 shooting) was also bottled up by OKC.“I don’t look at it like I struggled, or [Randle] struggled,” Edwards said. “They just, they had a good game plan, making us get off the ball. Especially for me, man. They were super in the gaps, I made the right play all night.”According to ESPN, Edwards is averaging 17.3 shots per game against the Thunder, significantly lower than in the first round of this year’s playoffs (22.4) and the second round (19.8).“It’s an urge that I want to get the ball in the rim, put it up there,” Edwards said. “But you don’t want to take bad shots and get your team out of rhythm.

The act also includes tough provisions to protect children online, including preventing damage to mental health caused by seeing adult content.According to the commission, all four platforms had one-click self-declarations to verify age, which it deemed ineffective to prevent under-18s from viewing adult content.“Today is a good day for minor protection online in the EU, because with the enforcement actions that we are launching … against four very large online platforms with pornographic, adult content, we are clearly showing that we mean it when it comes to the effective protection of minors under the DSA,” an EU official told reporters.There was no fixed timetable to complete the investigation, the official said, while stressing “a commitment to act relatively fast on potential next steps, depending on what the reaction of the platforms will be”.The platforms could resolve the investigation by producing forms of age verification deemed effective by EU regulators. But if the complaint is upheld they could be fined up to 6% of global annual turnover.Under the DSA, the commission regulates platforms with more than 45 million users, such as Google, Meta and X, while national authorities in the 27 member states are responsible for those below this threshold.The commission said on Tuesday that Stripchat was no longer designated a “very large online platform”, after an appeal by the company, meaning its activities would in future be regulated by Cyprus, where its parent company, Technius Ltd, is based, rather than Brussels.The investigation into age verification tools will continue, however, as the new designation does not apply until September.Stripchat’s child protection obligations remain the same.The parent company of Pornhub, Aylo Freesites, said it was aware of the commission’s investigation and “fully committed” to ensuring the safety of minors online.“We will always comply with the law,” the company said. “We believe that the real solution for protecting minors and adults alike is to verify users’ ages at the point of access – the users’ devices – and for websites to deny or permit access to age-restricted materials based on that verification.”Technius was approached for comment. A Brussels-based lawyer who has recently represented the parent companies of XVideos (WebGroup Czech Republic) and XNXX (NKL Associates) in EU legal proceedings was also contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyPornographyEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionEuropeChildrenInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

But why would they? As cases of voyeurism against women soar in the UK, victims say it’s too easy for men to get away with itAnna MooreTue 27 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 07.13 EDTShareThe first time Heidi Marney took a bath in her new, temporary home, she felt she was being watched. “I had this overwhelming sense that there were eyes on me,” she says. She remembers scanning the room. “It was a big, double bath and above, on the wall, there was a TV with a device hanging down with a flashing red light.” Marney sent a photo of it to a friend who assured her that it was a dongle and said he had one too so that he could get Sky in every room.“Logic told me that, if someone was filming me, there’d be a camera in my bedroom,” Marney continues, “so I went to my room and looked everywhere – the wardrobe, the lights; I was meticulous. There was nothing, so I told myself I was being ridiculous. My landlord was the kindest human you could ever meet. He would never do that.” She pauses for a second then sighs. “I’ll never ever ignore my instincts again.”This happened in December 2019, when Marney had moved into Robert Holden’s rural home, a former farmhouse in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire. Marney had known Holden for a decade – he was her half-sister’s uncle, so she had long viewed him as a family member. Holden was also well known in the area, a councillor who had won awards for his services to the community. “He coordinated flood relief, he fed elderly people on Christmas Day, he mowed little old ladies’ lawns,” says Marney. And now that she was at a low point, temporarily homeless after leaving a difficult relationship, Holden had offered Marney and her 16-month-old daughter a room in his spacious house while she got back on her feet. (It was something he had done many times for many others, taking vulnerable people into his home.)Aside from that first, fleeting discomfort, the arrangement seemed to proceed well. “He’d make me a cup of tea of an evening and I opened up to him about my struggles,” says Marney. “He was intelligent and compassionate. I couldn’t praise him enough.”View image in fullscreen‘Knowing that he had been watching me felt awful – I felt shameful, I felt disgusting’ – Marney.Photograph: Posed by model. Giselleflissak/Getty ImagesShe stayed for 11 months and towards the end, as Marney began to think about moving on and dating again, she felt Holden’s behaviour change. “He didn’t like it. He was acting like a weird, jealous boyfriend,” she says. When she discovered that he was tracking her through the Find My app, she called her aunt, a police officer, who advised Marney to check the home for cameras. “I sent her a video of the bathroom and she screen-shotted a sensor attached to the wall and asked: ‘What on earth is that? Why is there a sensor in the bathroom?’”Marney took a kitchen knife and, balancing on a stool and two paint pots, reached up and prised the sensor apart. Inside, she saw the words “camera” and “microphone”. “I just completely and utterly froze,” says Marney. “It was like holding your breath. What on earth happens now?”When she Googled the device’s serial number, she saw that the “sensor” was a camera, specially designed to avoid alerting the subject that they were being filmed. It had gone out of production two years previously, so had clearly been there a while. In fact, it later emerged that Holden had been filming women through hidden cameras for almost 15 years, creating an extensive digital library neatly organised under their names. Last September,he was jailedfor six years and two months.Holden’s voyeurism conviction is one of the few to make national headlines – but local news reports offer an alarming insight into the possible scale of this behaviour. Just this month, adoctor was jailedfor filming guests at his Glasgow Airbnb for more than three years, through cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms disguised as air fresheners (one pointed at the loo, the other at the shower) and a smoke alarm. Other UK cases includephotographer David Glover, who filmed more than 100 women using covert cameras in his studio changing rooms;Adam Devaney, who used a camera disguised as a pen to film colleagues in the toilet of his North Yorkshire workplace, andAdam Dennis and Robert Morgan, who used hidden cameras to film more than 5,000 people in swimming pool changing rooms and toilets in London and Surrey, then shared and traded the images online.View image in fullscreenSpy cameras are widely available online.Photograph: Posed by model. Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesJanuary to December of last year saw a 24% rise in reported cases of voyeurism and exhibitionism (crime statistics unhelpfully combine the two) in the UK. This is partly why the government is attempting to tighten legislation around hidden cameras, which are easily available in specialist spy stores, as well as on sites such as Amazon and eBay, and often made to look like clocks, adapters, photo frames, humidifiers, even disposable coffee cups.At present, UK law defines voyeurism as nonconsensually observing or recording someone during a private activity for sexual gratification or to cause distress. Under proposals in theCrimeand Policing bill, it would become a criminal offence to install equipment intended to take intimate images without someone’s consent. Motive wouldn’t be a factor – and even if no images were taken, installing a camera for this purpose would become a crime. For Marney though, this isn’t nearly enough. “How are those cameras even legal?” she asks. “The potential for abuse is so huge and obvious. It’s far more common than people would think.”Dr Vicky Lister, a research fellow in the School of Psychology at the University of Kent, confirms that the cases we hear about represent the tip of an iceberg. Many that come to light have gone undetected for years – and few result in prosecution. In 2020, out of more than 10,000 reported cases, fewer than 600 reached court. As part of her PhD,Lister interviewed men in UK prisons for voyeurism offences(there are no women serving time for this crime). Many had used covert cameras, including one disguised as a shampoo bottle in a public shower. “It’s scary, isn’t it?” she says. “As soon as you start digging, you start to realise. The men I interviewed were saying: ‘Everyone’s probably been a victim at some point.’”Research on prevalence of voyeuristic behaviour is patchy. “A population study in Sweden suggests a lifetime prevalence of voyeurism of 11.5%,” says Lister, “but smaller non-population studies across lots of different countries, including the UK, generally estimate higher Even [such estimates] are likely to be an underrepresentation, as there’ll be people who won’t admit it to a researcher.” There’s every reason to believe that the technology now available to facilitate this will lead more to do it.One study in Canadafound that 79% of participants would engage in voyeuristic behaviours if there was assurance they would not be caught.Lister is hoping that her next research focus will be voyeurism as a “gateway crime”. Does it lead to physical sexual assault? Some studies of rapists and sexual murderers have revealed a history of voyeurism – up to 45% – but that doesn’t necessarily mean one has caused the other. “We do know that voyeurism is addictive and compulsive,” says Lister, “so people who’ve done it once will generally keep doing it until they’re caught. Unfortunately, there’s a stark lack of literature on this whole topic. I think it’s because it’s ‘noncontact’ and seen as a victimless crime – until you’re the victim.”If I’m in a toilet, I will check plug sockets, mirrors, cracks in tiles. It has made me so paranoidFionaFor Fiona*, learning that someone filmed her while she was in her bedroom, having sex with her girlfriend, has had a lasting impact. In December 2023, she was contacted by police in Aberdeen who informed her that they had uncovered indecent images of her, taken by an electrician, James Denholm. He hadused hidden cameras to film women(some of them his customers) in their bedrooms, bathrooms and pub toilets for over a decade. “By the time it came to light, I hadn’t lived in the flat where the images were taken for five years and I wasn’t dating the same person any more,” she says. “It was so long ago and I have absolutely no idea if he did some work for us or where the cameras were or how it happened. I know that he lived a five-minute walk from our house.“It’s so grotesque and inhuman,” she continues. “It makes me feel so angry, so embarrassed and mortified and so, so exposed. It has really made me distrust men I don’t know. I’d feel very uncomfortable letting anyone come and carry out work inside my home. I’d need to watch them constantly. My blinds are closed 100% of the time. I never open them now.”View image in fullscreenA camera can be disguised as many things, such as an air freshener.Photograph: Tolola/Getty Images/iStockphotoFiona also checks for cameras in public toilets. “I avoid using them if I can but if I am in one, I will check everywhere – plug sockets, mirrors, cracks in tiles. It has made me so paranoid and anxious.”Marney experienced similar emotions. “Knowing that he had been watching me felt awful – I felt shameful, I felt disgusting,” she says. “I remember staying at my new partner’s after this had all happened and taking a shower,” she says. “He had all these fancy water gadgets on the ceiling. My brain was saying, ‘Are they cameras? Is he watching me?’ I just fell to the floor, crying my eyes out.”Although UK laws around voyeurism – and the proposed changes to the Crime and Policing bill – focus on the taking of intimate images, this doesn’t cover all the harms caused by hidden cameras. They can also be weapons of control. Emma Pickering, the head of technology-facilitated abuse and economic empowerment at the domestic abuse charity Refuge, says that many women they support have been spied on by current or former partners.Labour to make taking intimate images without consent a criminal offenceRead more“Most cases we see involve hidden devices – listening, tracking, filming or sometimes all three,” she says. “It’s really difficult to help someone conduct sweeps of their home as [cameras] are designed to blend into a domestic setting. They look like everyday items. We’ll be asking if all the plug adapters work and if the remote control is really connected to the TV.” One survivor uncovered 80 spycams in her home.An abusive partner can use the footage in various ways, says Pickering. “In one case, he was gathering intimate images and putting them online, profiting financially. Others use it to monitor everything someone is doing, who they are seeing, how they’re spending their time. With that information, they can gaslight and control and stay one step ahead.”This is what happened to Linda*, who was in an eight-year relationship with an abusive man. “At first, he was charming and attentive but the control started subtly,” she says. “First, he convinced me to delete my social media because it was ‘bad for my mental health’. Eventually, I stopped going out with my friends as it caused so many arguments, it was easier not to.” Isolated, home alone, she would sit down to watch TV and have a cup of tea and he would text to ask, “Enjoying your cup of tea?” If she went to answer the doorbell, he would message, “Who was at the door?”“I was so confused,” says Linda. “It was like living in a television show – like it wasn’t actually my life. I tried sitting down at different times in case he was just guessing my routine but he always knew. He seemed to know my every move.”They are marketed as harmless gadgets, but they’re used by stalkers and abusersLinda uncovered the two tiny wireless cameras by accident while deep-cleaning. One was on the mantelpiece, the other in a light fitting. “I just felt sick and disbelief,” she says. “Why? In our home?” When she confronted her partner, he insisted that they weren’t cameras, then they quickly disappeared. “A couple of months later, I found them hidden in a different place,” she says.Although Linda escaped the relationship when it escalated into physical abuse, her former partner continued to stalk her, threaten her online and drive past her place of work. He also left some of her clothes on her doorstep – since Linda had escaped in a hurry – and it was only later that she found the same tiny camera sewn into the lining of her returned coat.View image in fullscreenPicture frames can conceal spying devices.Photograph: Strauss/Curtis/Getty ImagesIt’s very hard to secure convictions for these cases. “There are usually no consequences for the perpetrators,” says Pickering. “Someone can claim that the cameras were in the house as a security measure, and that their partner consented to them being there. The threshold to removing evidence stored on a perpetrator’s phone or hard drive is very high and there’s also a huge backlog. Even when [material] is seized by police, there has usually been plenty of time to remove any incriminating evidence.” Attempts by Refuge to engage with manufacturers and suppliers of surveillance technology have not enjoyed much success. “It’s completely lawless,” says Pickering. “We need to be looking at why these things are available when they are causing so much harm.”Linda agrees. “They are marketed as harmless gadgets, but in reality they’re used by stalkers and abusers,” she says. “There’s no regulation, no safeguarding. Why do they need to be hidden? Why can anyone buy them? I don’t ever feel safe now. I’m hypervigilant, it’s with me the whole time. The government should listen to women like us. It’s not that we’re paranoid – it’s just that we know what’s possible.”* Fiona and Linda’s names have been changed.In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

Meanwhile, OpenAI bets billions on its next act, and Trump’s crypto fans lose millionsBlake MontgomeryTue 27 May 2025 10.05 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 10.07 EDTShareHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week in tech: Apple struggles on multiple fronts, OpenAI grows increasingly ambitious, and Trump helps some of his fans lose money on cryptocurrency.Apple finds itself in three binds – tariffs, AI, and FortniteLong dominant and unassailable, Apple is showing signs of weakness. The CEO, Tim Cook, can’t tame Donald Trump’s threats of tariffs that would spike the price of an iPhone; Apple’s AI offerings pale against its competitors; and the company can’t win a Fortnite match – or a single battle in its legal war with Epic Games – to save its life.On Friday, the president threatened to levy a 25% tariff on any iPhone not made in the US. Trump said in the post: “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”The majority of iPhones have been assembled in China, where Trump has imposed whopping 145% tariffs on exports. Cook had obtained an exemption from those tariffs, and he said in an earnings call this month that the majority of iPhones sold in the US in the next quarter will “have India as their country of origin”. The move seemed meant to skirt political tensions between China and the US. No such luck, it seems.Cook had declined to accompany Trump on his trip to the Middle East last week, which irked the president, according tothe New York Times. Trump said as much out loud: Flanked by tech executives during a speech in Riyadh, he noted that Cook was not among them. The failure of fealty may cost Apple dearly.On the home front, Apple is facing criticism that has been mounting for months of its flailing efforts to integrate generative artificial intelligence into the iPhone and other products. The iPhone dominates in the US today, boasting a market share of more than half. With far fewer artificial intelligence products than Google, for example, the shine of Apple’s future dims. Watching Siri fail to play the right song yet again is far less appealing than being able to tell Google Assistant tomake a podcastabout a Wikipedia page I find intriguing.Read more aboutTrump’s tariff threats.Apple promised a suite of features brandedApple Intelligenceat its annual developer conference in 2024 that has yet to make a splash beyondbotched notification summaries. Insiders areleaking details of internal chaos in Apple’s AI department to the press, a rarity for a company that prides itself on aggressive secrecy. Apple’s competitors are suffusing every aspect of their new flagship phones with AI that the iPhone maker can’t match. Siri remains nearly as incapable as when she made her debut fifteen years ago. The Vision Pro, though not in the realm of AI, has been a flop, blemishing Apple’s sheen.On the legal front, Apple keeps losing its battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games, and it keeps playing the part of sore loser. In late April, a US federal judge found that the company had violated her order to allow app developers to link to their own payment options, even ones that skirt Apple’s App Store. The judge said a top Apple executive “outright lied under oath”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersNow Fortnite is back in the App Store after five years of exile, and Epic is empowered to circumvent Apple’s 15% to 30% commissions. Fortnite may be a popular game, but it’s not a significant portion of Apple’s overall revenue from the App Store. The upshot of the legal fight is that Apple’s grip on its tightly controlled software ecosystem is loosening, which may lead to an avalanche of developers eschewing in-app purchases and payments. That is the greater threat to Apple’s revenue from digital services.Read more aboutFortnite’s return.Bloomberg published astoryMonday questioning whether Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has gotten what he wanted by sucking up to Trump in these early days of the administration. It’s a fair question, but, on the whole, Zuckerberg has largely governed his digital empire unmolested by the second-term president. Henixed his company’s vaunted diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and perhaps that toll was enough to buy Trump’s inattention. It’s Cook who should be asking what he got in return for his$1m donation to Trump’s inauguration. He’s been dancing like an outlaw with a sheriff shooting at his feet these past few weeks.OpenAI’s week of massive expansion beyond ChatGPTView image in fullscreenJony Ive and Sam Altman.Composite: Getty ImagesOpenAI struck two multibillion-dollar deals this week, one on its home turf and one on a new frontier. The company is doing its utmost to expand beyond ChatGPT. Compare that with a major rival, Anthropic, which spent the week preoccupied with releasing a new version of its flagship model Claude. That’s either a total snooze or a strong focus on a core business, but I’m inclined to think it’s a bore. In an era when Google is worth $2tn and Microsoft $3.3tn, these are the kind of moves necessary to compete with the biggest players in the game. If you’re not going to buy a startup that has released no products but was founded by the designer of the iPhone for billions, you’re not playing to win.On Wednesday, the ChatGPT maker announced it would acquire Sir Jony Ive’s untested hardware startup, io, for $6.4bn. Dara Kerr reports: in CEO Sam Altman and Ive’s blogpost on Wednesday, they wrote that the io team will merge with OpenAI to work “more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco”. Ive himself will not join OpenAI as an employee, but his company will “take over design for all of OpenAI, including its software”, according toBloomberg.The goal of the merger seems clear: hire Ive to create an AI-infused hardware device as popular and iconic as the iMac or the iPhone. Whether there is a market for devices whose sole purpose is to deliver AI to the masses is less clear. The nearest analogue to what Ive might produce, the Humane Pin, likewise backed by Altman and designed by Apple alumni, did not take off.Read more aboutthe mammoth acquisition.On Thursday, OpenAI announced plans for an enormous data center in Abu Dhabi likely to cost tens of billions. The project is a part of Stargate, a $500bn investment in AI by the likes of Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI and Softbank. Stargate at first seemed like a domestic project, but Donald Trump’s deal with the UAE on AI and OpenAI’s announcement have made it a global initiative.The spotlight of the public’s attention is shining brightly on OpenAI’s CEO this week as the startup makes these major moves. Two new books, one laudatory and one critical, chronicle how OpenAI came to be the company it is today. The Optimist by the Wall Street Journal’s Keach Hagey offers a biography of Altman. Empire of AI by The Atlantic’s Karen Hao details the time between the founding and the spectacular 2023 ouster and reinstatement of Altman. With their shared debut, the two accounts offer dueling descriptions of Sam Altman’s character. They ask: which is he to you, gifted scion of progress or ruthless tycoon?Either way, by spending billions and hiring Apple’s second-most famous employee, it seems Altman is gunning for the title of the next Steve Jobs.Read more about this week’s AI newsGoogle unveils ‘AI Mode’ in the next phase of its journey to change searchEstonia eschews phone bans in schools and takes leap into AIAlabama paid a law firm millions to defend its prisons.

Nearly half of the top holders of $TRUMP lost money on their investments, according to an analysis by the Guardian. Niamh Rowe reports:Of the 220 winners, 95 – some 43% – have suffered a net loss from purchasing $Trump since the coin’s January launch, a combined $8.95m, according to trading history and portfolios as of 21 May.A contestant under the username “GAnt” appears to have endured the biggest losses. Despite placing fourth on the leaderboard, buying the tokens has led to a $1.06m shortfall. Similarly, user “Meow” is down $621,000, despite achieving VIP status.$TRUMP is often included under the umbrella of “memecoins”, a term that describes cryptocurrencies which reference or were inspired by internet trends. Trump himself is a primary driver of online culture the world over, especially in the cryptocurrency world, but he isn’t a meme in the same way that the Shiba Inu mascot of Dogecoin is.The definition of a memecoinput forward by Coinbase, the US’s largest exchange, fits $TRUMP in other ways, though. Coinbase describes memecoins as “typically supported by enthusiastic online communities” and “associated with entertainment rather than usability”. The president’s coin is not aligned with any tangible financial or physical asset. It is a flimsy speculative asset, and a poor one at that.Read more aboutTrump’s crypto sweepstakes.The wider TechScapeElon Musk says Doge didn’t cut HIV programs.

While a further submission argued the site was not right for Musk: “Destroying trees to build a factory for a company owned by a [redacted] would be a vile choice.”“We should not support and put money in the pockets of a [redacted] who openly [redacted] salutes, is [redacted] human,” was another’s take on Tesla moving into Marion.Another had a more prosaic concern: “Please dear God”, they wrote. “It’s not going to be good for anyone … [and] it would majorly interrupt my roller skating route”.More than half of the 948 community submissions came from outside the council area, but submissions from those in the immediate area of the site overwhelmingly opposed the development at 121 against and 11 for.Those who voted in favour welcomed the jobs that would be created by Telsa, the skills that would be taught, and the “visionary approach” of the world’s richest person.Musk has faced an ongoing backlash thanks to his role in the Trump administration, where he created the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), that has seen cripplingcuts to government programs.Tesla profits have dived recently, with analysts pinning the blame on a branding crisis thanks to Musk’s role in the White House.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla sales have been plummetting [sic] … this is likely to attract protests and negative attention that the neighbourhood does not need or want.”Tesla and South Australian government agencies emphasised the economic benefits to the region in their letters of support, while a handful of residents said the land should be put to productive use.Staff at the City of Marion officially recommended the council sell the land to Tesla, with the proposal to be discussed at a council meeting on Tuesday night.Explore more on these topicsAdelaideElectric vehiclesElon MuskTeslaSouth AustralianewsShareReuse this content"

Than what?Than before.How much shorter?Six minutes.Says who?SaysElif Shafak.The Turkish-British novelist?Novelist, essayist, public speaker, activist. She was talking at the Hay festival, in Wales.What did she say?That when she first did a Ted Talk she was given a limit of 19 minutes, but a decade later she was told to keep it to a trim 13.Why?That’s what she asked Ted.AndTed said?According to Shafak, TED said: “Well, the world’s average attention span has shrunk.”How did that make her feel?“Really sad. We are incapable of listening to a talk for more than a few minutes.” She went on to say that it was because we are living “in an age of hyper-information”.Too much to take in?Exactly. “We cannot process this much information,” she continued. “And in the long run it makes us tired, demoralised, then numb because we stop caring.”My god, sounds terminal. Is it true, that our attention spans have shrunk?A lack of long-term studies means we don’t know for sure, but the public seems to think it has.Tell me more. But get on with it.A study byKing’s College London in 2022found that 49% of people believe their attention spans have become shorter, 50% say they can’t stop checking their phones …Young people probably.Nope. Also a struggle for the middle-aged. And 50% of people also believed – wrongly – that the average attention span for adults today is just eight seconds.Sorry, what were we talking about again?Short attention spans.Oh yes. I knew that. What about books though, are they getting shorter too?Well, interestingly, a2015 studysuggested the opposite, that they were 25% longer than they were 15 years earlier.I’m sensing there’s a but coming.But the longlist for this year’s International Booker includes eight books that are less than 200 pages.What about films, they’re definitely getting longer, right?The short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: again,we just think they are, probably because of marketing. Studios want to incentivise people to spend money on a ticket, which they do by telling you it’s big, epic and special.Hang on, so we think attention is going down but it might not be, and films are getting longer, but they’re not?Very perceptive. Someone should do a Ted Talk about it.Do say:“Can you even change everything in 13 minutes?”Don’t say:“Hurry up, you’re losing the room.”Explore more on these topicsTedPass notesElif ShafakfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But there are good bits too.TakeJackie and Shadow, a happy couple who live in a home with breathtaking views of Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino county,California. They currently havetwo children, Sunny and Gizmo, who are preparing to leave home and make their own way in the world. They are, in many ways, the purest embodiment of the modern American dream: reality stars, and also bald eagles.The family has been on camera since October 2015, when the environmental non-profit group Friends of Big Bear Valley (FOBBV) started alive streamof the nest. For years, fans have watched live as the eagles share meals (mostly fish), relax and tease each other. Sometimes Shadow nips at Jackie’s tail or wing “to get a response out of her”, says Sandy Steers, the executive director of FOBBV. “It’s hilarious.”The one change that worked: I started sketching – and stopped doomscrollingRead moreThe eagle cam was Steers’s idea. She started watching the nest years ago, though from the ground, back when it was still occupied by Jackie’s parents, Ricky and Lucy. “I got to watch Jackie grow up through a spotting scope, and it completely hooked me,” she says.Over the years, the feed’s numbers have soared like a majestic bird of prey. TheYouTube pagehas more than 638,000 subscribers, and as I write this, 46,000 people are watching with me.Multiplenewsoutletshave referred to the eagles as “celebrities”. And there’s merch: FOBBV sells Shadow and Jackieplushies($30),tote bags($20) andsweatshirts($45).“I think what draws people is that nature is fascinating, and most of us haven’t really had the chance to sit and study it,” Steers says. “It connects people with themselves and their emotions.”The emotions these eagles elicit seem to be pleasant. Besides the birds, the page includes another wonder of the natural world: a wholesome comment section.“Love you Jackie, Shadow, Sunny, and Gizmo, you’re in my heart forever!” one fan writes in the live chat.I think what draws people is that nature is fascinating, and most of us haven’t really had the chance to sit and study itSandy Steers, executive director of FOBBV“What gets me through the day is to watch this beautiful family thrive,” writes another.The eagles inspire such fervent adoration because of their personalities, says Steers. “Jackie is serious and she’s the boss, absolutely,” she explains. “Shadow knows all of Jackie’s rules, and at the same time, he’s independent.”Jackie and Shadow’s love is the stuff of romcoms. After Rick and Lucy left, Jackie occupied the nest with her first partner, Mr B. In 2018, they had two chicks, but only one survived. That summer another eagle appeared – a charming, impish and stubborn young man who began hanging around the nest and wouldn’t leave no matter how much Mr B snapped at him. Eventually, Mr B gave up and left.Don’t bald eagles mate for life? “For the most part, but apparently not always,” says Steers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sunny and Gizmo are the couple’s fifth and sixth offspring. TheEagle Log, which is run by FOBBV members and posts regular updates on the nest, recently confirmed Gizmo is a girl, based on her overall size, behavior and “obsession with food”. The jury is still out on Sunny’s sex, but the group hopes to have more clarity in the next couple of days.At 11 weeks old, the eaglets are almost ready to fly, and a “fledge watch” isunder wayas fans eagerly wait to see them take to the skies.“They don’t look quite ready to me,” says Steers. “But maybe that’s just me hoping they stay longer.”text reading ‘well actually’ ad ‘read more on living a good life in a complex world’ with a pinkish pill shaped box saying ‘more from this section’I first heard about the eagle cam years ago from a friend, and ever since Gizmo and Sunny first hatched back in March (they’re both Pisces), I’ve kept the live stream open in a tab on my computer. Between work tasks, I click over to see how my feathered pals are doing. It’s become a happy break for me.I’ve watched Sunny and Gizmo grow from tiny balls of gray fuzz into big glorious raptors with razor sharp beaks and claws. I’ve seen Jackie feed the eaglets tiny bits of fish, and watched Gizmo hop in the air and practice flying (“We call that ‘wingercising’,” says Steers).Sometimes the feed is quiet – perhaps the kids are napping and Jackie and Shadow are out hunting. I enjoy the serenity of the trees swaying in the wind and the lake’s glitter too. As Steers wrote in a recent post in the Eagle Log: “Sometimes a quiet, observant, appreciative loving day is simply essential to the joy of living for all beings.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAnimalsWildlifeCaliforniaWest CoastInternetYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And of course in a modern society, why should anyone be elevated to positions of power or prestige solely by accident of birth? Add to this absurdity the notion of a “King of Canada” – a fully independent G7 nation – who lives an ocean away, and the silliness of our system of government compounds.In ordinary circumstances, a British monarch has little interest in a former far-flung colony, and our passport offices would run with or without his official portrait overseeing the grey walls of officialdom. Humans, however, are not rational. And our circumstances are not ordinary.At moments of closeness or crisis – for example, the visit byKing Charles IIIto deliver a speech from the throne at the opening of Canada’s parliament as our US neighbours are expressing expansionist tendencies – watch all that latent scepticism melt away. When a royal actually lands in Canada, the queues dutifully form as the more transcendent benefits of monarchy become apparent.Since his election last November, the US president,Donald Trump, has enacted punishing tariffs against Canada’s auto sector, an industry that is highly integrated with the US, undermining a crucial trade relationship that has been the bedrock of this country’s economy for decades. Further, Trump has mused publicly and privately about making Canada the “51st state”, even going so far as to threaten “economic force” to coerce Canadians into consent for the idea.Canadian voters took the US shift in course seriously, as evidenced by Mark Carney winning a near-majority in parliament – in part by noting that the relationship between the US and Canada, “based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over”. Carney was the“elbows-up”candidate, encouraging Canadians to think of the threat posed by the US in existential terms.So it is not only an incredible coup, but also a remarkably subtle bit of geopolitics for the new prime minister to open his parliament with a throne speech delivered by the king. The timing of this tour cannot be totally removed from the politics of the world around it.King Charles III is a potent symbol of Canada’s history and system of government; a system and government that stand in contrast to the flailing republicanism of the US.The monarchy is a distinctly Canadian symbol, free of partisan affiliation, and thus an institution all Canadians can celebrate after a rancorous election, regardless of which party they voted for.Even the Conservatives who proudly hung black “Fuck Trudeau” flags in their windows can show up with mini-Canada flags to welcome Charles. This gives the impression of a country united in its sense of self in the face of a leering US threat.The throne speech will also signal to Canadians that we still have friends in the world beyond the US; that there remains some whisper of a Commonwealth that can, at a minimum, demonstrate moral support. To this end, the king is stepping up at a time when many elected leaders of western nations have remained conspicuously silent at the prospect of a belligerent US threatening its closest friend and ally during late-night rambles on Truth Social.Crown questions to fore as king visits Canada amid tensions with TrumpRead moreGiven Trump’s penchant for trolling, it’s impossible to know how seriously to take his threats. It’s very unlikely that the Americans are capable, organised, or focused enough to revive long-discarded rhetoric about manifest destiny, or to dig up the decaying military books detailing War Plan Red –secret documentsproduced in the 1920s and 30s intended to prepare for a war with the British empire via Canada.Even if a military campaign is out of the question, Trump has scrambled Canada’s sense of place in the world. And here, the mere presence of the king must be taken as a reminder of the nation’s history and alliances.In his opening remarks, Charles alluded to the crown as “a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present”. Much of the following address – provided by the Canadian government, as it also is in Britain – was, as throne speeches tend to be, filled with the quotidian.However, it made clear that today, “Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear”.It noted the changing relationship between Canada and the US, nodding to the desire of their respective leaders to provide “transformational benefits for bothsovereignnations”, emphasis my own.And it could have an unintended effect on Trump himself, who has has shown a penchant for autocratic leaders and for pomp and ceremony. Though constitutional monarchy is entirely for show, this distinction may be mostly lost on Trump, who wasobviously flatteredby an invitation by King Charles to a state dinner. Trump described the king as a “beautiful man, a wonderful man”, upon receiving the letter two months ago.After all, is there anyone on earth better equipped to deliver flattery, pomp, ceremony and elaborate trim detail than a British king?If it works to soothe the ego of our neighbour to the south, I won’t begrudge the King of Canada’s portrait on everything, rational or not.Jen Gerson is a Canadian commentator and co-founder of The Line.

It may seem as though everything is going their way now Donald Trump is back with a vengeance, but the poor things have run into a bit of a branding problem. For years, the anti-woke crowd positioned themselves as fearless free thinkers taking on the intolerant left. The journalist Bari Weiss wrote a fawningNew York Times piece in 2018describing rightwing voices such as Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens as “renegades of the intellectual dark web” (IDW).Now, however, the people who used to position themselves as oppressed truth-tellers operating in what Weiss’s article called an “era of That Which Cannot Be Said”, have a state-sanctioned microphone. They’ve won. But in winning they’ve made it difficult to continue the charade that they give a damn about “cancel culture”. Look around: some of these self-styled free speech warriors are doing everything they can to ruin the lives of everyone who doesn’t 100% agree with them.Most conservatives don’t seem to mind that their hypocrisy is now on full display. But, according to a recentpiece on the news site Semafor,a handful of people within the anti-woke media ecosystem are starting to have something of an identity crisis. “One didn’t have to be especially prescient to spot those ‘anti-woke’ types who would just slowly become Maga flunkies,” said the libertarian journalist Michael Moynihan, who had a short stint at Weiss’s publication the Free Press before becoming disillusioned.At this rate, pro-choice sentiment will be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deportedRemember when the right railed against people losing jobs for old comments they’d made? In 2018, for example, the Atlantic fired the conservative columnist Kevin Williamson after the backlash about a 2014 podcast appearance in which the 60-year-old had suggested women should face hanging forhaving an abortion. Cue a million furious tweets from the “renegades of the IDW” about how, as Ben Shapiro put it on X, “virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the Left’s interests”.Now, however, there’s no denying that virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the right’s interests. Semafor’s piece notes that “One [Free Press]investigationthat exposed two low-profile employees at PBS who had focused on diversity and got them fired rubbed even some of its allies the wrong way”.At least the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) employees at PBS “only” got fired.Canary Missionand Betar US, twopro-Israel groups, have been compiling “deportation” lists of pro-Palestinian activists on college campuses and sharing them with the Trump administration. Betar US has also warned that it is going toexpand its focusbeyond immigrants to naturalised US citizens.These organisations are just a couple of cogs in a massive dissent-crushing machine. The Christian nationalist Heritage Foundation, which spearheaded Project 2025, is behind a dystopian plan calledProject Estherthat cynically weaponises very real concerns about antisemitism to shut down criticism of Israel and quash pro-Palestinian activism. And you can bet these censorious projects won’t end with Palestinians: at the rate we’re going, pro-choice sentiment will soon be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deported. If that sounds far-fetched, let me remind you that last month theveterans affairs departmentordered staff to report their colleagues for “anti-Christian bias”.Drunk on their power to deport and defame, some on the right have officially lost the plot. For months a number of conservative voices have been engaged on a mission to cancelMs Rachel, a children’s entertainer whose real name is Rachel Accurso. If you have small children, Ms Rachel needs no introduction. For everyone else, she wears a pink headband and sings songs such as Icky Sticky Bubble Gum. Ms Rachel’s videos have always been gently inclusive: she incorporates sign language and she has frequently had Jules Hoffman, anon-binary musician, on her show. On herpersonal social mediashe has also advocated for issues such as paid family leave.The right tried to cancel Ms Rachel over Hoffman’sgender identity back in 2023.Now they’re trying to cancel the beloved star again; this time for the “crime” of speaking up about Palestinian kids and featuring athree-year-old double amputee from Gazain a video. The fact Accurso ishumanising Palestinianchildren is driving some rightwing voices so berserk that they’re smearingher as antisemitic, asking the US attorney general for an investigation, and spreading the ridiculous and completely baseless lie (which the New York Times bizarrelychose to amplify) that she is being funded by Hamas.Welcome to our “new era of That Which Cannot Be Said”: one that may make McCarthyism seem progressive. It would seem the new renegades of the intellectual dark web are those of us who think you shouldn’t bomb starving babies in their sleep just because they are Palestinian.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But we can be sure about one thing: although no one took seriously Donald Trump’s boast that he would end the warwithin 24 hours– perhaps not even Trump himself – it’s now evident that his efforts to stitch together a political settlement have failed. Last weekend’s Russian drone and missile strikes against Ukraine, reportedly among the largestsince the full-scale invasion began, show us that the conflict isn’t likely to come to a sudden end.That’s becauseVladimir Putinremains committed to his goal of conquering Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces. So far, he controls virtually all of the first and most of the other three. A deal that gives him what he has now plus a guarantee that Ukraine will remain outside Nato won’t satisfy him. He has said repeatedly that he wants all four of these provinces and a neutral Ukraine, with caps on the number of soldiers and major armaments it can deploy.Trump’s mistake has been to assume that his self-proclaimed deal-making genius, supposed rapport with Putin and massive leverage over Volodymyr Zelenskyy (the US has provided Ukrainewith more weaponrythan the other allies combined, though less total aid when humanitarian and other support is included) would together yield a diplomatic success, perhapsone that would evenland him a Nobel peace prize.But with Russia targeting Ukraine, including Kyiv, with367drones and missilesover the past few days, this isn’t merely a display of disdain by Putin for any political settlement that falls short of his goals, and a demonstration that he is committed to continuing the fight until he achieves his objectives. It also makes Trump seem weak.Now Trump is outraged – Putin, hewrote on his social media platform, has “gone absolutely CRAZY” and is “needlessly killing a lot of people” – and, when asked whether he was thinking of tightening sanctions, replied: “Absolutely.” But this isn’t the first time Trump has warned Putin to cease targeting his missiles and drones on Ukraine (remember his “Vladimir, STOP!” post late last month?) or threatened additional sanctions.This is an obvious trend in the relationship. Putin is still committed to his publicly stated goals, and rebuffs Trump’s flattery and bullying in equal measure. Unsurprisingly, he showed no interest in Trump’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, which Zelenskyy promptly accepted. Nor was Putin unnerved byTrump’s threat, in late April, to impose secondary sanctions on Russia unless it stopped “shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns”. This warning came after Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy at Pope Francis’s funeral and may have given the Ukrainian president hope, but it didn’t rattle his Russian counterpart. Nor did Trump’sintimation in Marchthat Russia risked further sanctions unless it demonstrated its commitment to peace.As a gesture to convey that he wasn’t ignoring Trump’s diplomatic démarches, Putin did propose that Russia andUkrainemeet face-to-face. Zelenskyy, ever eager to convince Trump that he is doing his bit, sent a high-level delegation to the Istanbul talks and even went to Ankara himself. Putin sent second-tier panjandrums with no authority to offer anything substantial. And Trump offered to reorganise his trip to the Gulf monarchies and fly to Turkey if Putin did as well, claiming that only a meeting between him and Putin would produce a diplomatic breakthrough.The flattery didn’t entice Putin, who remained in Moscow. The two leaders did have a phone conversation, but nothing meaningful came of it. After that, Trump seemed resigned to failure, though he’d never call it that, andreverted to the narrativethat “this was not our war” and that Europe should assume responsibility for supporting Ukraine’s security and brokering an end to the conflict.However, even if Trump moves beyond social media posts and words and actually does impose additional economic penalties onRussiathis time round, the fighting won’t stop – for at least two reasons.First, Putin owns this war and has therefore staked his political standing on achieving his goals, no matter the costs, which have been enormous. There has been much debate about the number of Russian military casualties, but the estimates runas high as 900,000, includingwell over 100,000dead. And though the war has hardly brought Russia’s economy to the brink of collapse, it has been a significant burden. Military spendingincreased by 46%between 2022 and 2024 and accounted forabout 35%of total government spending in the latter year, with the proportion projected to reach 37% this year. Inflation reached10.23% last month, forcing the central bank to keep itsinterest rate at 21%. Putin’s job isn’t at risk, but he would be politically diminished if, after demanding sacrifices on this scale from Russians, he settled for half a loaf. So don’t expect that he will be forced to compromise because of blood and treasure being devoured by the war.Second, as Trumptold European leadersafter his phone call with Putin, the Russian leader seems convinced that his army is winning. Perhaps Putin doesn’t know the full extent of Russian losses – which, in addition to the casualties,include an estimated 14,000 tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and artillery systems – because his generals fear bringing bad news to the boss. Perhaps he’s well-briefed but confident nevertheless that Russia’s superiority in every material measure of military might will eventually ensure victory, that the west will tire of the war and that Trump will abandon his pursuit of a deal and even end US military support to Ukraine.No matter. The upshot is that no one should be surprised if, come February, this war enters its fifth year – and with no end in sight.Rajan Menon is a professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York and a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Saltzman Institute of War and Peace StudiesExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussiaEuropeUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

They can hold federal officials in contempt, and enforce such contempt citations by fining or jailing them.It’s a radical remedy, rarely used. But several federal judges are at their wits’ end.Boasberg said that if Trump’s legal team does not give the dozens of Venezuelan men sent to the Sallvadorian prison a chance to legally challenge their removal, he’ll begin contempt proceedings against the administration.In a separate case, the US district court judge Paula Xinis has demanded that theTrump administrationexplain why it is not complying with the supreme court order to “facilitate” the release of Ábrego García.Xinis has even questioned whether the administration intends to comply with the order at all, citing a statement from the. homeland security chief, Kristi Noem, that Ábrego García “will never be allowed to return to the United States”.According to Xinis, “That sounds to me like an admission. That’s about as clear as it can get.”So what’s the next step? Will the supreme court and lower courts hold the administration in contempt and enforce the contempt citations?Trump and his Republican stooges in Congress apparently anticipated this. Hidden inside their Big Ugly Bill is a provision intended to block the courts from using contempt to enforce its orders.

There is no way to understand this except as a way to keep the Trump administration from being restrained when it violates the Constitution or otherwise breaks the law …“This would be a stunning restriction on the power of the federal courts. The Supreme Court has long recognized that the contempt power is integral to the authority of the federal courts. Without the ability to enforce judicial orders, they are rendered mere advisory opinions which parties are free to disregard.”In other words, with this single measure, Trump will have crowned himself king.If it is enacted, no Congress and no court could stop him. Even if a future Congress were to try, it could not do so without the power of the courts to enforce their hearings, investigations, subpoenas and laws.The gross unfairness of Trump’s Big Ugly Bill is bad enough. It would worsen the nation’s already near-record inequalities of income and wealth.But the provision inside the bill that neuters the federal courts is even worse.

But Starmer and Reeves must not waste their chanceGordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Tue 27 May 2025 12.08 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 13.14 EDTShareAs Labour continues its inquest into the reasons for its local election losses, attention has focused on thepensioners’ winter fuel allowanceand the changes in incapacity benefit. And in the past few days, there have been internal criticisms of the decision todelay the publicationof its child poverty review.But Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have made the right call in delaying until the autumn. This new timetable means that the government is not only consulting widely, determined that Labour must never lose its reputation for fairness, but also considering how to fund the changes the child poverty review will propose – something only the budget can address. I know from my 10 years as chancellor that the public spending statement Reeves will deliver next month (which is not like a budget where tax and spending announcements are made together) will not be able to undo the scale of the damage done to the4.5 million childrenin poverty – the ever-increasing victims of the long tail of Tory austerity.Only a budget in which, for example, agambling or a banking levycan be announced, can generatethe more than £3bn that would cover the estimated cost of abolishing the two-child cap and take nearly half a million children out of poverty to meet theelection promise“to end mass dependence on emergency food parcels”, and honour themandategiven to the child poverty taskforcein this parliament to ensure a “reduction in child poverty”. By investing in children,we will affirm our moral purpose and deliver the promised “decade of national renewal”.The Conservative years of austerity may now feel distant in our minds. But from their political grave, David Cameron and George Osborne’s pre-determined, post-dated decisions are still casting a dark shadow, making Labour’s task difficult. The two-child limit was announced in 2017, but applied only to children born after that time. This timebomb set by the Conservatives means that about50,000 more childreneach year experience its poverty-making effects – this will continue until 2035, when the policy will finally apply to every family with a third child under 18.Already nearly one in two children inBirmingham (46%) and Manchester (44%)are living in poverty, and in some local communities the figure rises to85%. By the time the Tory policy agenda has run its course, more than five million children will have been cast into poverty. Shakespeare was right: “The evil that men do lives after them.”For a time, the bogus self-serving Tory claim seemed acceptable to the public: that middle-class parents were unable to afford to have more children because they were paying taxes to subsidise work-shy, feckless parents having additional children just to game the benefit system.But this allegation was never accurate. About70% of childrenin poverty – more than 3 million – are in working families, and most of the rest are in families hit by sickness, redundancy or a shortage of childcare. Indeed, we know that most of the half a million children who have been thrust into poverty in the past few years are not part of a permanent class of families trapped in dependency culture: instead,60% of familiescaught by the two-child benefit rule have at least one adult in work. If the Conservatives had listened to parents, they would have discovered that it is invariably family crises, like a bereavement, cancer, or time out of work between jobs, that caused them to fall temporarily below the poverty line.To her credit, in her spending review, Reeves will announceradical measuresto prevent homelessness and destitution especially in 75 of the UK’s most deprived areas, including introducing more breakfast clubs and newfamily hubs, along the lines of Sure Start, which helped a previous generation of children from low-income families realise their talents. And she will be able to show from the success ofSure Startthat savings from early interventions are twice as big as the costs.But child poverty cannot be eradicated by breakfast clubs or family hubs alone. Breakfasts are worth about £9 a week off the family budget, and cannot compensate for the harm caused by Osborne’s cut in benefits of £66 a week for a family with three children, and £132 from a family of four. Indeed,evidence showsthat the most cost-effective way to take 350,000 children out of poverty immediately and rescue 700,000 from deep poverty is replacing the two-child rule. If this is the case, the public say they will support the change.According tonew opinion pollingthat I commissioned, Seventy-five percent 75% alsobelieve poverty is “morally wrong” and almost as many are acutely embarrassed that Britain has fallen far behind Ireland, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries in the way we treat our most vulnerable children.There are a number of ways in which we can remedy this injustice. Frame new spending around an education premium or special financial support to help children be properly fed and equipped to succeed at school. If only 65% of children are poverty-free at the age of five, it is impossible to achieve the government’s most recently stated objective of75% of childrenbeing ready for school by 2028. The government could also place conditions on its receipt, from requiring children to attend school or parents to attend parenting classes. What matters is that children should not suffer and have their potential destroyed because of poverty.According to the new poll, the public not only agrees that we must invest in the next generation, but also that all of us benefit if children grow up to be healthy, educated and productive members of society. Once “don’t knows” are eliminated from the sample, 85% favour a £3bn tax on gambling, and 75% favour a tax on the banks – most also agreeing to earmark the money for poverty reduction.That isone reason why changing the two-child rule will have support from the Lib Dems, the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and Reform UK. But do note the Farage promise to restore tax credits to children in low-income families has to be set against his“Contract with you”, which would hit the very same children with £150bn of spending cuts, andthe effective privatisation of the NHS.Fairness has always been a watchword of the British public. A fairness guarantee would mean that no one is condemned to poverty as a result of changes in pensioners’ allowances or incapacity benefit. This funding for an anti-poverty lock would also mean that every child is prepared for school and supported during their schooling. For the first time in 15 years, we can ensure for that all children get the finest possible start in life.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsPovertyOpinionChildrenBenefitsLabourKeir StarmerRachel ReevesGordon BrowncommentShareReuse this content"

Given research that suggests just two nights of broken sleep are enough to makepeople feel years older, we are positively decrepit.New parents face up tosix years of sleep deprivation– a depressing statistic to consider when your infant has woken up for the millionth time overnight. No wonder we look, asChappell Roan has put it, like we don’t have light in our eyes. Bone-tired parents can get desperate enough to try anything: $2,000 app-controlled self-rocking bassinets,sleep courses sold by influencers with questionable credentials– even, as a disconcerting number of TikToks suggest, spoon-feeding babies chunks of butter.Why are people feeding their babies butter?TikTok and Instagram abound with videos of chipper mothers giving their obliging children globs of the stuff before bed, with some touting butter as the trick that finally put an end to night waking.Sleepmaxxing: from red light to mouth taping and nasal dilators, do any of the viral trends work? | AntiviralRead more“I can totally see why parents would be taken in by it,” says Dr Nina Jane Chad, a research fellow at the University of Sydney and an infant and young child feeding consultant for the WorldHealthOrganization. But butter is unlikely to make a baby sleep through the night, “and there could be some harms involved” for young infants, she says.“There certainly isn’t any scientific evidence that a big dose of butter or fats or calories is likely to help with night-time sleep,” agrees Dr Fallon Cook, a paediatric sleep practitioner and director of InfantSleepAustralia. “If sleep happens to be better that night, it’s probably a coincidence.”Research suggests that what an infant eats during the daydoes not affecthow likely they are to wake overnight. Other foods that were once touted as beneficial to baby sleep, likerice cereal, have also been found not to have any effect on sleeping through.Feeding butter to babies six months and under – for whom exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by the WHO – is “going to change their gut flora and make them much more susceptible to whatever infectious diseases are doing the rounds”, Chad says.From six months, infants require an iron-rich, nutritious solid diet in addition to milk. “They need to have some animal-source foods, they need to have fruit and veg daily. They need to have wholegrains and they need to have calcium-rich foods as well,” Chad says.“Saturated fats is not such a huge issue for kids – we recommend that they have full cream dairy products,” she says. But she describes butter as “an energy-dense but nutrient-poor food. There are better choices in terms of your child’s whole diet.”What is ‘normal’ baby sleep?“In the first six months, it’s very normal for babies to be waking multiple times overnight. They’re often needing to feed to meet calorie needs, and it just takes time for sleep to consolidate into longer stretches overnight,” Cook says. “As we move past six months … we start to see some longer stretches of sleep emerging.”According to Chad, “Most babies will be waking at least once and usually up to three times up until their first birthday, and about a third of children are still waking at least once by the time they turn three.”Thoughnight wakes naturally declinewith age, “we have this idea that babies and young children, should sleep for eight or 10 hours a night [in one stretch],” Chad says. “They don’t.”Though sleep “regressions”, such as the so-called four-month regression, are dreaded by parents, there isn’t much evidence to support their existence. “There aren’t predictable times where sleep always goes bad,” Cook says. “What we know is that for every baby, there will be natural ups and downs with their sleep, and it’s not time-locked.”Just regular bad sleep, or a sleep problem?“From about six months of age, children can develop sleep disorders,” Cook says. Some are physiological, such as snoring and breathing difficulties. Others, known as behavioural sleep problems, occur where a baby or toddler has “rather specific conditions that they need met in order to fall asleep” – for example, being bounced on a fit ball, driven around in a car, or a very strong feed-to-sleep association.“Some of these things every now and then are completely normal. But if it’s at a point where it’s exhausting parents and an older baby or toddler is needing these unusual conditions, six, seven, 10 times per night, that’s when … it could be impacting sleep health, and probably impacting parent mental health.”While Cook encourages parents not to ignore serious difficulties, she says that “when it comes to baby sleep, we will always say that parents know best”.“If a baby’s waking up a lot at night, but a parent feels fine about that … and they’re managing, then there’s not a problem.”I am desperate for my baby to sleep better. What do I do?Parents in the trenches wish for nothing more than a quick fix for better sleep. Unfortunately, Cook says, “There’s no magical combination of things that you can do … it really comes down to consistency.”A regular bedtime routine “gives your child’s brain a cue that sleep is coming”, while she advises parents having issues with settling their child to “break it down into really little, manageable steps”, such as introducing cues such as gentle pats or humming which can be done whether the child is rocked to sleep or settled in their cot.Whether or not to sleep train a baby is – like Donald Trump and Vegemite – a topic that seems to invite polarised opinions. Sleep training encompasses various behavioural strategies ranging from implementing a night-time routine to “crying it out”. One study, which looked at theeffect of controlled crying, found that sleep training didn’t reduce the frequency of waking but did seem to decrease parents’ perceptions of how often waking occurred.Research shows that “there are multiple ways of settling a baby in a cot, and they are safe”, Cook says. “We don’t want parents using an approach that they feel devastated about or traumatised by.”Donna Lu is an assistant news editor at Guardian Australia and the sleep-deprived mother of a one-year-oldAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It could also be a terrible missed opportunityBenjamin WeilVaccines that work need systems that work. Britain’s starved services must be supported to reach those most at riskTue 27 May 2025 07.32 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 11.11 EDTShareLast week, the UK announced a world first in sexual health programming: a vaccine that can protect against infection by gonorrhoea bacteria is to bemade availablein sexual health clinics across England, Scotland and Wales. Now comes the rollout – which will require avoiding the mistakes of the past to make sure it reaches those most in need.The vaccine has offered hope for intervention in an otherwise concerning landscape of increasing numbers of cases of gonorrhoea infection demonstratingresistance to treatment by antibioticsand with infection rates at theirhighest since records began.Although it can occur without noticeable signs of infection, for most peoplegonorrhoeawill be experienced as a set of uncomfortable symptoms, such as pain or fluid discharge in the genitals, anus, throat or even eyes. If left untreated, gonorrhoea can result in serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to infertility in people with a womb and ovaries (who areless likely to experience telltale symptomsin the first place).When it is launched in August, the gonorrhoea vaccine will first be offered to gay men, bisexual men and men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who,according to the most recent data, are the individuals most likely to test positive in the UK. Especially where resources are limited (ie in the real world of healthcare delivery), vaccination programmes are most successful when they are targeted to the groups or individuals at the highest risk of infection. Indeed, amodel produced by researchersin 2022 has suggested that a successful programme of gonorrhoea vaccination among GBMSM in England at the highest risk of infection could prevent more than 100,000 cases of gonorrhoea over 10 years and, crucially, save the NHS an estimated £7.9m. The predicted cost-saving of a gonorrhoea vaccination programme is particularly welcome for sexual health services in the UK that have faced upwards of£1bn in cutssince 2015.However, this decade of cuts poses a risk to the success of a gonorrhoea vaccination programme. For one, widespread divestments from sexual health have not been experienced homogeneously. Access to sexual health services, where these vaccines are given, is increasingly apostcode lottery. Even in better-resourced areas such as London, where rates of gonorrhoea transmission are highest, appointments at overstretched and underfunded clinics can be hard to come by and inconveniently timed.Research showsus that a de facto “first come, first served” model of appointment provision disproportionately favours people who are older and better off – who typically have more flexible schedules – and creates particular barriers for immigrants to the UK, who are less likely to have the cultural and linguistic fluency to navigate convoluted processes for accessing appointments.That said, even when appointments are available, many people will continue to experience enormous barriers to accessing services. First- or secondhand experiences of clinical and medical racism, distrust, fears of judgment and stigma, shame and avoidance, and a lack of access to culturally competent care and information collude to distance historically marginalised groups – especially Black communities in the UK – from in-person clinical settings. It is these very barriers that contribute to the disproportionate infection rates amongBlack communities– especially Black GBMSM, who are therefore among those in most urgent need of access to effective vaccinations.‘World-first’ gonorrhoea vaccine to be rolled out in England and WalesRead moreRecent successes combatingmpox outbreaksamong GBMSM, however, demonstrate for those from marginalised backgrounds, there are effective avenues to deliver vaccines other than just sexual health clinics. Since 2022, theLove Tank– a London-based nonprofit that works to improve the health and wellbeing of underserved communities – has worked hand in hand with NHS partners to provide vaccinations against mpox (and, among other diseases, Covid) in community settings in an attempt to deliver services to people less likely to access them in clinics. With pop-ups at sex-on-premises venues, community centres, queer bars, clubs, parties, sex shops and Pride events (including three years running atUK Black Pride), theseunder the radar (UTR) eventshave been able to deliver hundreds of vaccinations to people – mostly queer people of colour and queer immigrants – who would probably not otherwise have received them.The development of suitable and effective vaccines is always the first stage of a multi-faceted project of inoculation. Vaccines that work, biomedically speaking, require systems that work. The next steps are more funding for starved bricks-and-mortar services, and continued investment in creative and effective methods for delivering services direct to the community, and for the partners that can help achieve this.Benjamin Weil is a writer and researcher.

Last week,European Psychologist publisheda review of recent advances in pet research, and wrote: “Given the two trends of more dogs being viewed as family members and a decline in the number of children, an important question arises: are people choosing dogs as a substitute for children?”The authors concluded: well, sometimes. One study found that 16% of dog owners actively thought of their dogs as children; another commented on the frequency with which owners referred to themselves as “pet parents”, their best friends as “fur babies”. However,they also cautioned that, “contrary to popular belief, only a small minority of dog owners actually treat their pets like human children. In most cases, dog parents choose dogs precisely because they are not like children.”The authors are based in Hungary, where low birthrates have been a hot-button issue for ages. This has led to policies that hit peak Handmaid’s Tale this year, when the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, announced thatmothers of two children or morewould be exempted from paying income taxfor life. So this intervention was rather cheering – in the first place, for being entirely factual and not prescriptive, and in the second, for talking about dogs. Generally speaking, and very noticeably when it comes from Orbán, the low-birthrate conversation is just hard-right world-building, an illogical mix of being fiercely anti-immigration while simultaneously hand-wringing that you’re one generation away from having not enough people.In a life of ups and downs, we have come to cherish our dog’s uncomplicated love | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreBring dogs into it, and everything feels calmer, kinder – or, at least, it does if you love dogs. And those who do will never quite get what non-dog lovers object to about them, which is a good thing, because if they did – or should I say, if we did – this is a hill we’d definitely die on.If you have a dog and a child, or just a dog, or neither but have had a dog in the past and have also met children, you’ll know that, far from being fungible objects of love, they’re actually the opposite of one another. While once people talked about the history of canine domestication via the wolf, it has since emerged that dogs and wolves are not that similar, and as much as we domesticated dogs,they also domesticated us. They taught us how to commune with another species, surrender to the unknowable, driven by nothing more or less complicated than love. Dogs can also sit and, often, give you their paw. Children, by contrast, are completely untrainable, and by the time they have trained themselves in ways that are very surprising (this could never be said about a dog), they’ll be on their way. Which, again, is not a thing that dogs do.Speaking for myself, if I wanted to unlock this conundrum, I’d look elsewhere. Are birthrates going down because of declining living standards? Or to put that more simply: can anybody afford a baby? If we wanted to create societies conducive to large families, would we need to rediscover ambition in public services, and generosity in state support? Is there a pressing global pessimism, rooted in real and observable catastrophes such as inaction on the climate crisis and impotence in the face of conflict? Could it be that the world increasingly looks like an unlovely place for an infinitely precious and fragile human?And if I were absolutely determined to bring dogs into it – for instance, if I were a specialist in dog-human relationships – I would still lean towards the social determinants of pet ownership over parenting. This could focus on the availability of family care, and economic and time constraints, which the paper mentions briefly, rather than individual behaviours, such as mistaking your dog for a baby.The real reason dog ownership can’t be seen as fulfilling “a nurturing drive similar to parenting, but with fewer demands” (as the authors put it), is that it’s not actually easier than having children. If there’s any parallel, it’s with the very earliest years of child rearing, when they have no independent universe of their own, look to you as their sun and moon, and will put literally anything in their mouth just to see what happens.As much joy as there is in this phase, it’s easily the hardest bit. Considering this post-pandemic world, in which dog ownership, in the UK at least, is through the roof –3.2m pets were bought during lockdownalone – you realise how much people relish having demands on their time and affection.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDogsOpinionParents and parentingPetsAnimalsFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

The breaches of trust have been so frequent, so vast and so decisive that the votersLabourhas already lost are unlikely to return. In one forum after another, I hear the same sentiments: “I voted for change, not the same or worse.” “I’ve voted Labour all my life, but that’s it for me.” “I feel I’ve been had.”It’s not dissatisfaction. It’s not disillusionment. It’s revulsion: visceral fury, anger on a level I’ve seldom seen before, even towards Tory cruelties. Why? BecausetheseareTory cruelties, delivered by a party that claimed to be the only alternative, in our first-past-the-post electoral system.Everyone can name at least some of the betrayals:cutting disability benefits;supplying weaponsand, allegedly,intelligence to the Israeli governmentas it pursues genocide in Gaza;channelling Reform UK and Enoch Powellin maligning immigrants; slashinginternational aid;trashing wildlifeand habitats whileinsulting and abusingpeople who want to protect them; announcing yet anotherdraconian anti-protest law; leavingtrans people in legal limbo; rigidly adhering to outdated and socially destructive fiscal rules; imposingfurther austerityon government departments and public services. Once the great hope of the oppressed, Labour has become the oppressor.Like many people, I was wary of Keir Starmer.I had limited expectations, but I willed Labour to succeed. So I’ve watched aghast as he and his inner circle have squandered one of the greatest opportunities the party has ever been granted. They seem to despise people who voted for them, while courting and flattering those who didn’t and won’t.The results? Last week, the polling company Thinks Insight & Strategy found that 52% of those who voted Labour in the 2024 general election areconsidering switching to the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. That’s more than twice as many as might migrate to Reform UK. The research group Persuasion UK estimates thatLabour could lose 250 seatsas a result of this flight to more progressive parties (again, more than twice as many as it could lose through voters shifting to Reform). Figures compiled by the progressive thinktank Compass show that Labour would lose its majority on justa 6% swing. Already, while it won a massive majority on a measly 34% vote at the election,it now polls at just 22%.Labour’s strategy is incomprehensible. Experience from the rest of Europe shows that when centrist parties adopt far-right rhetoric and policies, theyempower the far right while shedding their own supporters.What explains this idiocy? Labour has succumbed, quickly and hard, to the defining sickness of ourundemocratic political system: the sofa cabinet system of close advisers. Opaque and unaccountable government favours opaque and unaccountable power. Ever receptive to the demands ofrentiers,oligarchs,non-domsandcorporations, Labour’s oh-so-clever strategists are moronically giftwrapping the country for Nigel Farage.Governments don’t start conservative and turn radical. The cruelty will set like concrete. The likely result is annihilation in 2029. On this trajectory, it might not be surprising if Labour were left with seats in only double figures.Perhaps it’s a blessing that Starmer has shown his hand so soon, as we now have four years in which to prepare. I’m not a party person: for me, it’s a question of what works. And now we can clearly see the shape of it.The Compass analysis, published in December, reveals extreme electoral volatility. This is caused by a combination of public fury towards austerity, exclusion,rip-off rentsand startlinglylow rates of wellbeing, and the “democratic mayhem” resulting from a first-past-the-post system in whichfive parties are now polling at 10% or more. Small vote shifts in this situation can cause wild fluctuations in the allocation of seats.The report points out that the UK is an overwhelmingly progressive nation: inall but one election since 1979most voters have supported left or centre-left parties. Of 15 nations surveyed, the UK has the extraordinary distinction of being both the furthest to the left and the most consistent elector of rightwing governments. Why? Because of our first-past-the-post system, which is grossly unfair not by accident but by design. Labour refuses to change it, as it wants to rule alone. The result is that most of the time it doesn’t rule at all.The thinktank was hoping to mobilise the progressive majority around a revitalised Labour party, but that moment has passed. What the figures show, however, is massive potential for more radical change. A YouGov survey reveals thatalmost twice as many people want proportional representationin this country as those who wish to preserve the current system. So let’s build a government of parties that will introduce it.Here’s the strategy. Join the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP or Plaid Cymru. As their numbers rise, other voters will see the tide turning. Encourage troubled Labour MPs to defect. Most importantly, begin the process in each constituency of bringing alienated voters together around a single candidate. This is what we did before the last election in South Devon, where polls had shown the anti-Tory vote evenly split between Labour and the Lib Dems. Throughthe People’s Primarydesigned by locals, the constituency decided to back the Lib Dems. The proof of the method can be seen less in the spectacular routing of the Conservatives (as similar upsets occurred elsewhere) than in the collapse in Labour’s numbers, which fell from17% in 2019, and26% in a pollbefore the primary began, to6% in the 2024election. The voters took back control, with startling results.Whether you fully support any of these parties is beside the point. This coalition would break for ever the lesser-of-two-evils choice that Starmer has so cruelly abused, and which has for so long poisoned politics in this country. Game the system once and we’ll never have to game it again.No longer will we beheld hostage, no longer represented by people who hate us. It will be a tragedy if, as seems likely, Keir Starmer has destroyed the Labour party as a major political force. But it will be a blessing if he has also destroyed the two-party system.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElectoral reformOpinionKeir StarmerLabourHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

Everything is a fight, but this feels like a fight too far. If Labour goes ahead with itsproposed benefits cutsto tighten the eligibility criteria for personal independence payment (Pip) and reduce or lose the health element of universal credit, many people in my community don’t know how they will survive. Make no bones about it: this could be amatter of life and death for some people.I am in tears reading the stories of what might happen if these further cuts, after years of austerity, go ahead. People who are currently choosing between using their electricity for breathing equipment or charging their wheelchair will no longer be able to afford either. People who need encouragement to eat will be left alone; people with mental health illnesses will be severely impacted, losing so much of their support alongside those people who are unable to wash or dress their lower body. Overall, households could lose up to 58% of their income, and these are the householdsalready in poverty.Already in the last six years, homelessness among disabled families has risen by 75%. Three-quarters of food bank users have at least one disabled household member. What’s going to happen when people can’t use their Pip or the health component of their universal credit to top up their rent and bills? These disability benefits are crucial support that help towards the extra costs incurred with a disability or long-term health condition.Today I learned about a young woman with cerebral palsy whose family had been evicted. The temporary accommodation provided to them was not accessible, forcing her to use the toilet at the local bus station as her bathroom. This is the realitybeforethe proposed funding cuts. Accessible housing is already rare; accessibleemergencyhousing is almost nonexistent. Disabled people are routinely left out of planning decisions. We’re not considered in everyday policies, let alone in times of crisis.Our £5bn disability benefits cut will stop welfare state collapsing, says KendallRead moreDid you know that the last round of cuts stripped people of their basic right to full care? Many lost vital support, including help simply to use the toilet. In some cases, individuals who are not incontinent have been forced to rely on incontinence pads because there is no longer enough staffing or time allocated to assist them properly. Care packages were reduced to as little as six 15-minute visits a day, barely enough time to support someone with eating, washing or using the bathroom, never mind living their life. Evening and morning care were cut so severely that many adults can no longer choose when they go to bed or get up. Essential support for tasks such as food shopping or cleaning was also removed entirely.The government and the headlines keep focusing on getting disabled people “back to work”, yet the existing scheme to support disabled people in employment is broken. Access to Work already has nearly a year’s waiting list for new applicants, and, according to leaks, the support worker element may be cut next. Only last week, the wonderful Jess Thom, the co-artistic director of Touretteshero, had her support cut by61%by Access To Work.Those of us whocanwork want to work. Many people use Pip and universal credit to top up expenses that come alongside working. Some disabled people can only work part-time, and the benefits bridge this gap.Liz Kendall struggles to sell ‘immoral and devastating’ disability benefits cutRead moreThese proposed cuts won’t save money; they’ll lead to greater costs from the resulting damage, along with widespread distress and suffering. Did you know that the fraud level for Pip remains less than 1% and that46% of applications are refused– with a shocking 70% of those refusals that go to appeal being overturned. It’s a gruelling system to navigate. There are16 million disabled people in the UK– not even a quarter of those people currently receive Pip, and the ones who do are the most in need.We as a society need to stand together on this and demand that the government stop taking the Pip.Cherylee Houston MBE played Izzy Armstrong on Coronation Street and Tinsel Girl on BBC Radio 4.

You can see it on our roofs: more than one in three Australian homes now have solar. You can see it on our roads: nearly 10% of new cars sold in Australia last year were electric.But the greening of Australia is creating losers as well as winners. While wealthier households are saving on their energy bills by installing solar panels and switching from gas to all-electric, many people have no choice but to stay with more expensive fossil fuels.The newly returned Albanese government should urgently lead action to ensure all Australians benefit from a greener grid.People who own their own homes have the flexibility – and often the income – to upgrade their house when it makes sense. With solar panels and a battery, you’re able to draw less energy from the grid and use it when it’s cheapest. If you can afford to swap your gas stove for an electric one, or buy an EV, you’re able to save even more.But if you rent, you are eight times less likely to have solar panels on your house. That’s because most landlords aren’t interested in buying new tech, upgrading appliances, or switching from gas to all-electric when they’re not the ones paying the energy bills.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterSo, while wealthier Australians switch, everyone else is stuck. And the way our gas and electricity bills are calculated means the people least able to afford it will pay the most for their energy.On average, about 40% of your gas bill goes to maintaining the network, not the amount of gas you use. The more people that are connected to the same network, the cheaper your bill. Those who can afford to switch to electric will do so and save. Those who are left behind on the gas network will foot the bill. If you end up being one of the unlucky few who are still paying for gas – mostly renters and people on low incomes – your energy prices are set to skyrocket.When it comes to electricity, if you can’t afford to install solar panels and batteries, you’ll have to pay more to help maintain the grid. Customers are increasingly being charged different prices depending on when they use electricity or how much they use at once. That’s a big advantage if you own an electric vehicle and can charge it in the dead of night, or you can afford a battery so you can store your solar energy and use it when you need it.But it’s hard to change the time you cook dinner, and no one is checking tariff rates while they’re watching the footy. If you don’t have a battery to shift when you draw from the grid, you’re going to bear the brunt of peak-time prices.As the energy transition ramps up, Australia risks becoming a more unequal society. Here’s what needs to change to avoid windfall savings for the well-off, while everyone else gets whacked with the costs.First, governments need to create a clear plan to get off gas. It’s an essential step on the road to net zero. Each state government should set a date – following the lead of the ACT – for when there will be no more gas in homes. They should put these dates into rental standards, requiring landlords to make the switch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In public housing, state governments should pay for the switch to all-electric, and have solar panels and batteries installed where appropriate. The federal government should increase funding for upgrades to social housing and push the states to move faster. To help other renters switch, landlords should be given an instant write-off if they convert gas appliances to electric.The third step is to plan how to fairly share the costs of the energy transition. As the gas network is wound down and new poles and wires are built, someone will have to pay. If households pay the same way they have been, the result will be unfair. If networks wear the whole bill, they will go broke.The federal government needs to coordinate this process and, building on the work of the AustralianEnergyMarket Commission, reform the way we pay for electricity and the grid. The new rules should be designed to ensure costs are distributed equitably for all households.The energy transition is essential to tackle climate change, and it’s good for many consumers, who can save on gas, petrol and power. But without action, the transformation risks worsening inequality. Governments must help households to make the switch, and change the rules so that the benefits and costs are fairly shared.Dominic Jones is an associate in the Energy and Climate Change Program at Grattan InstituteExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

High up in the atrium, at the centre of this huge open-access repository of 250,000 objects, hangs a chunk ofRobin Hood Gardens, a brutalist council estate in nearby Poplar that was recently bulldozed to make way for less affordable housing. Deftly suspended from the gantry, the poignant fragment now seems as much a relic of a bygone age as the 15th-centuryIslamic domefrom a Spanish palace that is displayed across the hall. The estate’s precast concrete panels have been reassembled with just the same care as the dome’s intricate wooden marquetry, with doorhandles and letterboxes neatly arranged alongside memories of former residents, as well as artwork made with local kids exploring the “ethics of care”.Fancy a masterpiece? Just pop one in your basket! V&A’s new open-access outpost will thrill art-loversRead moreSuch striking juxtapositions, and the often contentious stories behind them, lie at the heart of the new £65m facility, which provides a thrilling window into the sprawling stacks of our national museum of everything. But it is much more than just a window – it’s a total immersion. Unlike other open-access museum stores, which tend to offera furtive peek through glass, the Storehouse thrusts visitors right into the middle of the action. You can roam the gantries while forklift trucks trundle to and fro beneath your feet. You might see someone unloading a porcelain statue, or polishing a priceless collection of spoons, or gingerly packing poison darts. And you’re right in there with them, at the heady coalface of conservation.We want people to be breathing the same air as the artefacts. So we’ve removed the usual glass prophylactic“I love looking at stuff when I’m not supposed to,” saysLiz Diller, with a mischievous glint in her eye. Her New York architecture firm, Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R), won the project in an international competition in 2018, promising to take the public on a “curated transgression” through the stacks. “We wanted people to be breathing the same air as the artefacts,” she adds. “So we’ve removed the usual prophylactic between the visitor and the work.”It’s a brave move. Wandering the aisles, between gilded altarpieces and tribal masks, all within touching distance, it’s a wonder that you’re not forced to don white gloves and a lab coat. “It does slightly keep one awake at night,” says Tim Reeve, the V&A’s deputy director and chief operating officer. “But if we had glass everywhere, it wouldn’t be a storage facility to which you have been invited behind the scenes. We had to commit to that philosophy.”View image in fullscreenLooking up … this 15th-century gilded wooden dome is now on view.Photograph: David Parry/PAHoused in an 80 x 80-metre area of Here East, a gargantuan hangar originally built as the 2012 Olympic broadcasting centre, the collection’s new home is the happy byproduct of eviction. In 2015, the government announced plans to sellBlythe House, the Edwardian former headquarters of the Post Office Savings Bank in west London which was being used as storage for the V&A, British Museum and Science Museum. The sell-off prompted an ambitious rethink of how to better manage and provide more public access to these national collections, about 95% of which were never on display. A decade on, Blythe House remains unsold, after the preferred buyer pulled out, but the pre-emptive eviction has spawned a new generation of inventive, multimillion-pound sheds.The British Museum’s archaeology department now enjoys a sleek £64mcluster of black barnsnear Reading designed by John McAslan + Partners. The Science Museum builta vast £65m warehousein Wiltshire with an interior cleverly configured by Sam Jacob Studio, to show off its dazzling haul of vehicles. Both of those allow some level of public access, but the V&A, leasing a highly public spot on the Olympic park, has really gone to town, throwing open its back-of-house for all to see. That’s if you can find the way in.At the southern end of the 275-metre-long hangar, an innocuous front door (that, perhaps intentionally, has the nondescript look of a staff entrance) leads into a lobby, with a cafe to one side, education spaces to the other, and a staircase straight ahead. Ushered up the stairs and through an airlock, you suddenly find yourself surrounded by open crates. The busts of assembled worthies are lined up either side to greet you while a vista of infinite shelves extends in all directions, offering tantalising glimpses of the artefacts that await. It’s like an Amazon warehouse, only stuffed with all the world’s treasures.View image in fullscreenA symphony of cypress … the Kaufmann Office by Frank Lloyd Wright.Photograph: Oliver Wainwright“We wanted it to feel like an immersive cabinet of curiosities,” says Diller. “So you land right in the middle, at the very heart of the building, flipping the usual progression from public to private.” The central atrium is conceived as an airy void sliced through the three main floors, artificially top-lit (no natural light allowed), with the end of each storage rack displaying a cross-section of collection highlights, freshly unboxed. One features historic toys including an abacus and a painted tiger; another, the arts and crafts fixtures of a CR Ashbee house; a third, props from the stage. A big glass window in the steel deck provides views on to the busy shop floor below, the ballet of technicians framed by a 17th-century carved marblecolonnade from Agra, newly restored and on display for the first time since the 1950s.View image in fullscreenThe Storehouse exterior.Photograph: © Hufton+Crow“It gives us the space to show things that we simply don’t have room for in South Kensington,” says Reeve as we progress upstairs tothe Kaufmann office, a complete interior designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the 1930s for a Pittsburgh retail magnate. It is a honey-coloured symphony of cypress plywood, full of Wright-designed furniture, with carpet and textiles by Loja Saarinen – all so intact that you half expect to find Edgar J Kaufmann sitting behind his desk. It has the same theatrical stage-set quality as the 1920s Frankfurt kitchen nearby, a pistachio-painted dream of modernist domestic efficiency, designed byMargarete Schütte-Lihotzkyfor the city’s Municipal Building Department and installed in 10,000 flats.“It usually takes a year to get signoff for a museum display,” says Brendan Cormier, chief curator of V&A East, which also includes a purpose-built museum opening on the other side of the park next year. “But here we can be much more agile, reflecting the energy of the research and new discoveries happening in the collection.” He points out that the explanatory texts are credited, giving the usually anonymous museum workers a voice for a change. Elsewhere, QR codes allow a deeper dive, thankfully without having to download an app. A new “Order an Object” service also enables visitors to summon items to a study room for closer inspection. DS+R had fantasised about a robotic retrieval system, but it was ditched on grounds of budget and practicality. As demonstrated by their $500m (£369m)“movable” Shed arts venuein New York, which hasn’t moved much since it opened, these are architects for whom big budgets do not always mean happy outcomes. Restricted to relatively modest sums here – and playing to their strength of working with existing buildings – they have pulled off a light-touch, supremely elegant result.There are none of the firm’s usual flashy fireworks, but there are intelligent touches throughout. The walkways that ring the central space, says project lead Bryce Suite, are scaled to the width of Robin Hood Gardens’ famous “streets in the sky”, a section of which you walk across as you pass the concrete facade. Another space is designed like a projecting vitrine, providing tantalising views down into a conservation lab, where overhead cameras and headsets will enable conservators to talk visitors through what they are working on, as if they were watching a live surgical procedure. Other games are played with jumps of scale. One narrow corridor leads to a vast black box space wherea 1920s stage cloth by Picassofor a Ballet Russes production hangs atmospherically spotlit. You might find the immensely long storage crates, tucked behind, just as captivating as the curtain.View image in fullscreen‘We can be much more agile’ … a robotic item retrieval system was abandoned in favour of a manual one.Photograph: © Hufton+CrowWhether the pick-n-mix nature of the display strategy will chime with visitors remains to be seen. Walking the aisles, which are arranged by the sizes and weights of the objects rather than by department, can feel like restless channel-hopping, or flipping through a magazine. One minute you’re looking at pre-Raphaelite vases, the next, modernist doorhandles and Mamluk plaster casts.But there is hope that the sheer cacophony of stuff, and the whirr of activities around it all, will inspire young minds. “We’re peeling back the curtain, showing how museums actually function,” says Cormier. “From curation to conservation to technical services, this building is going to be training the next generation of museum workers.”The V&A East Storehouse,Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, London, opens on 31 MayExplore more on these topicsArchitectureV&AMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I heard it in Richard Hell’s band at CBGB. I heard it at block parties, in the Cuban music bleeding through the walls of my Lower East Side apartment. I heard it in Haitian rara, in Croatian wedding music. I couldn’t figure out yet what all this music had in common, but I was ready to go to war for this cause. I wanted to reach people’s souls and make them dance, or cry, or puke.”Marc Ribot is on a phone call remembering the kaleidoscopic sounds of the New York he moved to in the late 70s, in an acerbic New Jersey drawl that melts with the warmth of the memory. In the decades since, Ribot has gone on to become a wildcard sideman treasured by icons and iconoclasts includingTom Waits, Marianne Faithfull, Robert Plant and many more. He’s a guest instructor at the New England Conservatory, and has released dozens of collaborations and solo albums exploring his various fascinations with Latin pop, jazz, avant-noise, protest folk and much more. Now, he’s made his first vocal album at the age of 71: Map of a Blue City, which has been in the works for three decades.View image in fullscreenMark Ribot performing in 1993.Photograph: Frans Schellekens/RedfernsBut this restless and charmed career would have seemed a pipe dream during his early days in New York, when he was a 24-year-old jobbing guitarist clinging to his belief that “jazz was the music of freedom” and gritting his teeth through gigs with veteran bebop organist Brother Jack McDuff. “He would fix me with his infamous death-ray glare across the bandstand every night – I was not, and have never been, a good bebop player.”He persisted, his nights spent transcribing solos by freethinking jazz artists such as Eric Dolphy and Albert Ayler, his days spent earning $50 a session for novelty albums starring kids’ characters such as Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake. It wasn’t until he saw jazz-adjacent No Wave groups – James Chance and the Blacks, DNA and the Lounge Lizards – that he found the kind of scene he’d moved to New York for, and Ribot ended up joining the latter band.Led by painter John Lurie, the Lizards charmed the hip cognoscenti of New York, and on New Year’s Eve 1984, Tom Waits clambered on stage for their punk-jazz rendition of Auld Lang Syne. Waits invited Ribot to play on 1985’s Rain Dogs, and amid a starry cast of guitarists – including Keith Richards – Ribot was the most idiosyncratic, duelling ribcage-rattling marimba on Singapore, etching the gothic Cemetery Polka and channelling southern soul on the sorrowful Hang Down Your Head.Waits wasn’t interested in musicians who simply played the parts he assigned them. “We were all involved in the process of creating,” Ribot says. “There were no written charts or orchestrations; Tom would play guitar or piano or congas, set a rhythm and a vibe, and then we’d come up with parts. He conceived his songs theatrically, asking the listener: who is the singer? What kind of bar are they singing in? Are they breathing their disgusting breath into your ear? It’s like as a guitarist, you’re always making choices: play loud or soft, simple harmonies or discordant tone clusters. Are you a remote god atop a mountain, bellowing commands to the faithful? Or are you whispering in somebody’s ear? We always tailored our playing to support the stories the songs told.”View image in fullscreen‘I usually play better on other people’s records’ … Marc Ribot.Photograph: Ebru YildizRibot also joined Waits’s live band. “We rehearsed 60 to 70 songs. And Tom could call off any one of those, or something we hadn’t rehearsed, and you had to roll with it. Tom was a demanding bandleader – he needs stuff to groove, and if the band is being wishy-washy, it wounds him personally and physically. You’ve seen footage of him in concert, banging the mic stand on the stage? That’s not a gimmick, that’s him telling us toget with the program. But he was always respectful. Tom understood the difference between a musician and a servant.” Ribot has continued to work with Waits over the years since, though Waits hasn’t put out an album since 2011. “Tom’s processes are a deep mystery to everyone, probably including himself. But he knows that if he wants to jam, I’m here.”After Rain Dogs, Ribot’s session career blossomed in myriad directions, working with Elvis Costello, Madeleine Peyroux, proto-industrialist Foetus and many more. “The few people who’ve hired me as a one-size-fits-all player or asked me to play like I do on Tom’s records have been quickly disabused of their concept,” he says. “What I try to do is make sense of what I’m hearing. I didn’t play what I played on Tom’s songs because I think that’s ‘good guitar’ – it made sense on those songs.”He has the unflappable confidence of a hotshot sessioneer who’s held his own alongside absolute legends. But when T Bone Burnett invited him to play on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss’s 2007 album Raising Sand, Ribot was “totally intimidated”, he laughs. “My junior high rock band was called Love Gun! Like every other guitarist in the world, I always dreamed of playing Whole Lotta Love! I took 20 different fuzzboxes in with me: finally, I get to play some metal!” Raising Sand was, however, an exercise in Americana, which nevertheless suited Ribot’s playing perfectly. “Still, whenever I’d hear Plant’s voice in my headphones, I was like Dr Strangelove when he can’t stop doing the Nazi salute, my foot twitching towards the fuzzbox. But Alison’s such a great singer and storyteller. I was so carried away by her voice and the story she was singing that I straight-up forgot to play. That had never happened to me before.”Ribot then jumped aboard The Union, Elton John’s 2010 album with legendary musician and songwriter Leon Russell, who gave Elton’s career a crucial boost early on. “Leon was ill, it was towards the end of his life,” Ribot says. “But towards the end of the sessions he came out of surgery and overdubbed his parts. Elton was very much in the room all the time. I remember walking into one of the isolation rooms to find Elton playing bebop piano, and he had great chops. And that’s why that record made sense, because you could hear the strong New Orleans roots in both their playing. Elton’s absolutely a closet jazz musician!”View image in fullscreen‘It’s how I pay the rent … Marc Ribot playing in Oberhausen, Germany, in January.Photograph: Imago/AlamyWhen not sharing the rarefied air of rock royalty, you can find Ribot downtown, shredding with the likes of far-out composer John Zorn. “John really understands extended technique,” he says admiringly. “It’s one thing to ask someone to play guitar with a balloon, and another to actually make music playing with a balloon, to own that language, as we did on The Book of Heads”. And his interest in Latin and Caribbean music – which began when he was a 10-year-old, taking guitar lessons from family friend Frantz Casseus, “the father of Haitian classical guitar” – has become another area of specialism, as he’s recorded albums of Casseus’s pieces, played for Latin stars like Caetano Veloso and Marisa Monte, and won a passionate following in South America with his band Los Cubanos Postizos (The Prosthetic Cubans), reinterpreting the music of Arsenio Rodriguez, who Ribot says “was both the Duke Ellington and Jimi Hendrix of Cuban music”.“I usually play better on other people’s records,” he says, “because on my own records I’m dealing with so much more than playing guitar.” Map of a Blue City began in the mid-90s as sparse demos recorded in his apartment. Rejected by punk-rock label Epitaph Records for being “too dark” (Too Dark for Epitaph became the album’s title for a while), the project was later helmed by legendary producer Hal Willner, who secured a budget and a string section to fully realise Ribot’s early sketches. “But I liked the demos better,” Ribot winces. “It got shelved, and I paid Hal back over seven or eight years.” Ribot then lost the original multi-tracks – but another producer friend, Ben Greenberg, used modern technology to recover the lost music.“It’s like chamber music: intimate,” he says, of the album. Alongside his own songs, Ribot covers the Carter Family’s apocalyptic vision When the World’s on Fire, and adds music to Allen Ginsberg’s Sometime Jailhouse Blues; For Celia is inspired by Heinrich Heine’s poem The Lorelei, and Holocaust imagery. “The song is about not trying to impose a romantic narrative on history,” he says, “and instead looking upon it like the disaster it is.”The ongoing disaster of the present is increasingly occupying Ribot, who in in 2018 released Songs of Resistance 1942-2018, featuring friends including Waits, Steve Earle and Meshell Ndegeocello. “I don’t often go in for straight-ahead agitprop, but Donald Trump is a fascist,” he says, gravely. “We are on the edge – or over the edge – of a crisis of legitimacy.” In response, he’s seeking translators so he can publish Italian-language “histories of what the Italians calllaresistenza lungaagainst Mussolini. We’re searching for a language of resistance, and that’s a good place to look.”But even during wartime, life goes on. Marc has to set off for that morning’s class at the Conservatory, and after that, no doubt, begin work on the next additions to his epic discography. I tell him that Discogs.com lists Ribot as having performed on an astonishing 576 individual releases, from Barbie’s Country Favourites in 1981, to this year’s Music for Roads by Finnish duo Tuomo & Markus. When does he sleep?“I like playing on records. I’ve been lucky, it’s how I pay the rent,” he chuckles, softly. “There are corners of what I’ve done that evenI’mnot familiar with.”Map of a Blue City is out now on New West Records.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This is Smith’s first UK tour since 2018, when, at just 21, her raw, atmospheric debut album won Grammy and Mercury nominations, Brit awards and a host of celebrity fans. Glitzy features with Drake, Stormzy and Burna Boy followed, but otherwise Smith resisted the playbook for sudden fame. She left London for home town Walsall, spent five years on her follow-up album, 2023’s pointedly titled Falling or Flying, and only now, another two years later, is she touring those songs.Her searing, smoky voice is used sparingly to start, sometimes even drowned out by the power of the band’s two drummers. But by Feelings, a duet with rapper J Hus whose verses are covered well by a backing singer, Smith drops the wall. She beams mega-watt charisma through the track’s lyrically chilly push-and-pull, and slinks between risers, glamorously at ease.Falling or Flying expanded her sonic palette with serrated guitar, unusual textures, and a theatrical sense of scale. Tonight even her older tracks benefit from this new ambition. Backing singers bring lush, Solange-esque harmonies to a reimagined version of February 3rd, and there’s a rich, bassy funk to Where Did I Go? The double-drummers inject pure adrenaline into Go Go Go, a rock track with a new wave swing that seems to unlock something in Smith: the intensity suits her.By now, those belting vocals are bringing the room closer, rather than holding the audience at a distance, and when Smith’s singers join her centre stage for a closing run through her poppier, non-album singles such as flirty Be Honest and straight-talking bassline hit Little Things, it feels like a house party instead of a point to prove. Shining and loose, Smith coos to the front rows. “I won’t leave it so long next time,” she promises, with the confidence of a star who knows she can have this whenever she chooses.Jorja Smith plays Manchester Apollo, 29 and 30 May,then touring.Explore more on these topicsJorja SmithPop and rockSoulDance musicR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Dressed in May abundance, the sandySomersetvillages radiate genteel nothing-doing respectability. Yet culture, of an invigorating and experimental kind, has penetrated these sun-slowed lanes. Where TS Eliot once meditated on ageing, death and modernisation, the south-west has its very own bite-sized biennale, the Od art festival.View image in fullscreenA new past … an exhibit at The Museum of Roadside Magic.Photograph: © Katy DockingOd isn’t really odd, at least by West Country standards (it’s the name of a crooked stream that runs through the villages). The theme of this fourth edition is Thinking in Circles, evoking seasons, migration and life cycles. There is a link, too, to the starts and failures, death and dung of Eliot’s 1940 poem East Coker (encircling lines from which are inscribed on village signage.) Cumulatively, the 24 artists in the festival raise timely questions about the intersection of the rural and the industrial, the invention of traditions, and the global networks of people and goods through which England is sustained.Star turn isLibby Bove’s Museum of Roadside Magic. Occupying a customised truck, it has toured the south-west off and on since Bove’s graduation from Bath Spa last summer. The peripatetic archive contains the invented ephemera of songs, dances and esoteric practices used in “vehicular maintenance, repair and journey making”. Artefacts include maypole-type figures whose coloured ribbons represent “the wiring arrangements of a seven-pin plug”, a photograph of the font of “St Dunlop” used for the immersion and retreading of rubber tyres, and costumes worn for the blessing of vehicles ahead of an MOT.Bove’s attention to the dowdy aesthetic of local museum displays, and the language of their signage is immaculate. From “historic” photographs of dancers in pearl-buttoned costumes that apparently prefigure motorway engineers’ hi-vis, to field recordings of “traditional” chants, the whole presentation is so thought through and deadpan that it is hard not to believe it’s real. This muddying of the waters is affectionate but pointed – in the world of folk custom, the distinction between ancient tradition and recent invention is seldom a sure one. The past for which nationalist politicians invite our nostalgia is as much a creation as the artefacts in Bove’s museum.View image in fullscreenRed Hot Haystacks by Simon Lee Dicker.Photograph: © Katy DockingThe Museum of Roadside Magic is parked beside a small industrial estate, but other locations are more picturesque. A glowing haystack occupies the 15th-century great hall of the manor house, perfectly echoing the arc of its gothic roof. Illuminated by ultraviolet light and smelling sweetly of the field,Simon Lee Dicker’s Red Hot Haystacksnod to the territorial intersection of agriculture and the military. In Orkney in the 1960s, cumulative contamination by atmospheric nuclear tests became evident once hay drying in the field was gathered in stacks.Beyond the wellies in the manor’s entrance hall playsAdam Chodzko’s The Pickers. Chodzko commissioned four Romanian migrant workers – then engaged in harvesting strawberries in Kent – to view and edit archival film of crop-picking. Images on screen flip between early 20th-century documentation of workers on stilts setting up twine frames for hops, jolly families pulling the flowerheads off the resulting vines, and groups of Londoners gathering Kent harvests on a working holiday. The Romanians, who were recorded while editing, are fascinated by these bygone visions of contented labour and liken them to the collective farms of the Ceaușescu era.Their own workplace more closely resembles a factory or laboratory than a picture-book farm. Within the tightly regulated climate of a plastic-roofed shed, strawberries grow in elevated beds from which stems full of fruit dangle for harvesting. “Imagine in the future that the British come to Romania to work in one of your companies because their economy has collapsed,” fantasises one of the pickers. “They would have nothing to do in their own country. It would be interesting if they came to us. I would like it.”View image in fullscreenWaypoints by Emii Alrai.Photograph: © Katy DockingInternational relations of a different kind are imagined byEmii Alrai, whose dioramas of ersatz archaeological fragments are arranged in a long loft first used for the fabrication of ropes. West Coker was once famous for its rope and sail-making, connecting the village to the fortunes of Britain’s imperial and merchant fleet. Alrai’s half-buried pots and shards imagine the cultural plunder that occurred along these voyages, linking distant soil back to the Somerset fields that grew the flax that made the rope.More esoteric works occupy the cemetery chapel. Arranged in an inward-pointing circle, the ceramic hands ofChantal Powell’s A Summoning, sprout ears of corn like tiny flames and carry engraved emblems of woven corn stalks. Its blend of ancient symbols suggests uncanny power. You might think twice before standing at this circle’s centre.Ella Yolande’s Find Us in the Slip Spacesis a gauzy suspended archway embroidered with pouches of fragrant herbs, leaves and seedheads. In this place of transition between life and death, it hangs as a symbolic (or perhaps hopeful) portal between realms.Explore more on these topicsInstallationArtFestivalsSomersetreviewsShareReuse this content"

Not every new entry is a Bohemian Rhapsody-level smash; some, like the dreary Amy Winehouse biography Back to Black or the misbegotten Whitney Houston movie I Wanna Dance With Somebody, outright flop. But there are still enough success stories like A Complete Unknown ($140m worldwide, eight Oscar nominations) to assure every pantheon pop artist in America will probably receive this treatment eventually.‘I’ve had murderers try to find me. I’ve had armed people say they’ll shoot’ – Dan Reed on the fallout from his Michael Jackson filmsRead more“Eventually” has become the operative word for Michael, a biopic of the globally revered but controversial pop star Michael Jackson. The film from Antoine Fuqua was supposed to have been released by now; it was originally set to come out in April 2025. After an initial delay to October of this year, it’s now looking likely to shift tosometime in 2026, not least because it has scheduled 22 days of additional shooting in June. Two months after its intended release, it’s going back in front of cameras for nearly enough time to shoot an entirely separate film.That may be the eventual result, though it’s not the intention of the additional filming this year. The plan now seems to involve reconfiguring Michael into a two-part movie; the new material will be used to expand the first half of the story, which – for “part one”, anyway – will leave off around 1980. That’s before Thriller, before Bad, and well before the 1993 allegations of child abuse, which gave way to a 1994 settlement and a separate trial over child molestation charges in 2005. The movie apparently included scenes with a Jackson accuser whose settlement with his estate included the provision that he not be included in any dramatizations. As is often the case with modern musical biopics, the estate is signing off on the film, and their lack of proper oversight has turned a dramatic decision into a legal problem. Turning one movie into two buys the film-makers more time to figure out how to fix the later stretch of the film so that it’s no longer in breach.View image in fullscreenJaafar Jackson as Michael Jackson in Michael.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/LionsgateAnd, hey, maybe it’ll also double the box office – eventually. Another sign of musical biopics leaning into their status as event movies is their apparent willingness to embrace modern-day franchise tropes. Hence an upcoming quartet of Beatles biopics, one for each member of the band, and film-makers turning the Jackson estate’s carelessness into an opportunity to treat his story like a YA fantasy.The dissonance, of course, comes from the fact that this particular case of eventizing is meant to better address multiple accusations of child abuse against the King of Pop. That these accusations are included at all is surprising and, at first, sounds downright bold for a subgenre that favors legally agreed-upon narratives of questionable veracity. (Even a film as initially electric as Straight Outta Compton eventually settles down into feeling like a mutually beneficial talking points hashed out by lawyers and producers, rather than a story with genuine meaning.) But that’s just it: there’s no chance the ultra-protective (and lucrative) Jackson estate has signed off on a biopic that is anything short of deeply sympathetic to Jackson’s side of this upsetting story. The actor playing Jackson, for example, could hardly be more estate-approved: it’s Jaafar Jackson, the musician’s nephew. Does that sound like a casting choice aiming for an unflinching portrait, or one that indulges the spectacle of allowingMichael Jacksonto live again?A Jackson semi-hagiography that still manages to include child-molestation material – whether treated carefully or with legally actionable cruelty to Jackson’s accusers – seems like a worst-of-both-worlds proposition. It’s notable that some of the biggest recent biopic flops, both financially and creatively, are those that must contend with some degree of tragic, relatively recent history: the early death of Amy Winehouse; the addiction issues that the Whitney Houston movie gracelessly sanitizes. Those films still felt like legally fussed-with estate agreements – like authorized merch, in other words – while also bumming audiences out with the unavoidable sadness at their center.On top of that, Jackson’s story has that early-death factor alongside accusations far more troubling than the self-destruction of Houston or Winehouse. To unapologetically celebrate Jackson would mean skewing some details of his final decade-plus of life beyond recognition – or simply ignoring much of it. There are signs that Jackson is so beloved, so close to a kind of pop martyrdom, that this is a winning strategy. The success of MJ the Musical, a jukebox accounting of Jackson’s creative process, suggests that there are plenty of people willing to overlook Jackson’s personal demons in favor of a de facto greatest-hits concert. That Broadway show has raked in millions over the past three years, expanding toLondon and Australia, while conveniently orienting itself in 1992, the year before the first public allegations against Jackson.Maybe that’s the strategy behind making Michael into a two-part epic. No matter what the second half may bring (and it sounds as if the film-makers may legitimately not know how or if that will pan out), a movie that ends shortly after the release of his solo debut Off the Wall can get away with peddling nostalgia, otherworldly talent, and triumph over adversity. Then a second movie can provide the illusion of due diligence while also selling itself as a sequel to a blockbuster crowd-pleaser. (It’s also not too far removed from the old music-industry scam of counting double albums as two sales instead of one.) On paper, the details of Michael sound like a potential fiasco: an involved but careless estate, a money-sucking repair job, a first-time actor in the lead, and material that tests audiences’ willingness to tolerate in their theme-parky tributes. Yet in reality, it could be a gamechanger in further eroding the boundaries between the art of biography and the business of legacy-making. Jackson changed music history in his lifetime; now he’s being given a chance to change movie-music history from beyond.Explore more on these topicsMichael JacksonBiopicsPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his new book he says he’s “most at home in the idiom of the ironic switchback, an educationally enhanced version of something that still [comes] under the broad conversational church-pub known as banter”. You can hear the banter in the title of his 2003 bookYoga for People Who Can’t Be Bothered to Do It.Banter’s trickier with a childhood memoir. If you were relatively happy growing up, as he was, in Cheltenham, the only child of parents who loved him, and you want to be honest about your upbringing, then you can’t muck about too much. Dyer’s humour has never precluded seriousness – about jazz, film, photographs, paintings, DH Lawrence and much besides. But as the title suggests, Homeworkis a duty in earnest, a task he’s compelled (if only by himself) to complete.As a book about beginnings, it’s also chronological, moving from infancy at the end of the 50s to his arrival at Oxford as an undergraduate. Straight-line narration isn’t Dyeresque: telling the story of the early years means breaking with the late style he used so winningly in his 2022 book about endings,The Last Days of Roger Federer, which was arranged in numbered sections. A nonfiction Bildungsroman is more of a challenge. It’s a while before he hits his stride.To outsiders Cheltenham sounds posh, but the end-of-terrace house he grew up in was a modest two-up, two-down. His father worked as an aircraft engineer; he’d been in India during the war but after that his only trip was on a coach to France in his 70s. He had no time for royals or religion and hated spending money: if petrol was needed for the car, a sky-blue Vauxhall Victor, he’d only half-fill the tank. Life meant the allotment and submission to his lot. “I was home-schooled in notions of acceptance I later found entirely unacceptable,” Dyer says, rejecting the “subsistence existentialism”, to which his mother also adhered. Born on a farm in Shropshire, she’d have liked to be a seamstress but worked in the school canteen and as a cleaner.Toy soldiers, conker fights, fizzy drinks, Wall’s ice-creams, chicken-in-a-basket pub lunches, swimming lessons (plus verrucas), trips in the family car to see relations, programmes on the black-and-white telly: his recall of period detail and brand names is exceptional. Perhaps it’s an only-child thing or that the re-discovery of two boxes of small, semi-educational cards (the kind that came with tea and cigarette packets) has helped him access his past. As a boy he was an avid collector and as a writer he’s the same: back then he’d be completing a card sequence or building an Airfix model, now it’s “the process of compiling and organising the work you are holding in your hand.”As he documents childhood minutiae, Dyer moves slowly. With half the book gone he’s still finishing primary school. Then comes the 11-plus, which he passes (“the most momentous event in my life, not simply up to that point but for its duration”) and embarks on the path that will separate him from his parents. The clash he describes, between a boy’s growing desire to be “with it” and his parents’ dour commitment to “go without”, is one all boomers will recognise, especially those of us brought up in the provinces. He quotes the poetTony Harrisonon how “books, books, books” create a chasm. His parents were tolerant of him as a “less than nice adolescent” but what he thought, felt and experienced became increasingly “incommunicable” to them. He is, he says, “a grammar‑school boy through and through to the core of my being”. He means it proudly.As a high achiever at school, he wasn’t much of a rebel and has few dramas or traumas to report. There’s a scary ride on his racing bike and the occasional near fight, but more often it’s the teenage boredom of having “nowhere to go” and the problem of how to meet girls. His collecting urge moves on to Athena posters and LPs. Then things pick up – and the humour does too. He has sex (in those days, for a boy, a matter of “resistance overcome by negotiation and sleight of hand”), becomes a boozer (“men with huge guts were almost role models”), and gets a Saturday job in a shop selling Airfix kits (“I became a born-again modeller”). More eventfully, he’s part of a crowd that goes on a post-pub rampage; through ill-fortune – his shoe-print is found on one of the cars they clambered over – he’s the only culprit charged and fined, an episode that leaves him feeling the shame of a loser who, on the verge of going to Oxford, has let his parents down.Here and there he holds stuff back, like the nickname he was given at school (“I hated mine so much that I won’t even repeat it here”) or the reason he was taken to the GP about problems with his “toy-oy”, his father’s name for the penis. But he doesn’t spare himself embarrassment, whether it’s failure to inherit his father’s craft skills (he describes himself as a “wildly impatient, cost-cutting, tantrum-prone bodger”) or the night he locks his parents out of the house after a heated row. “Presenting myself in a consistently poor light has been more than a source of pleasure over the last 30 years,” he says, but he takes care with others. Some of the names here have been changed.What does make him feel guilty of betrayal (“nothing has ever been more painful for me to write about”) is telling the story of his mother’s horrendous birthmark, which stretched from her left shoulder to her left hand; surgery in her 20s removed it up to the elbow but she couldn’t bear a second operation to remove the rest. Dyer leaves this revelation until late on in the book but as he says, sympathetically, it explains so much about his mother: her privacy, powerlessness and lack of self-worth. His portrayal of his father is no less affectionate: his feeling of being “hard done by” was wearisome and “yes, he was unbelievably tight but he was also and always, at the deepest level,honourable”.Dyer worries that the book will read “like the biography of someone who went on to become a minor British painter best known for seascapes’’ or “the memoir of a forgotten jazz man”. He wouldn’t want it to be just another Gloucestershire childhood memoir, either, in the shadow of Laurie Lee’sCider with Rosieor Dennis Potter’s Blue Remembered Hills. What lifts it beyond routine reminiscence (and makes the excess of cigarette cards and Airfix kits more bearable) is its evocation of a lost era, a postwar culture eager to embrace new freedoms while still recovering from the privations of the 1930s and 40s. The grown-up, cosmopolitan Dyer doesn’t miss the place yet he does, intensely: “England, my England: that has felt mine more than ever, since I’ve been living where I’ve always dreamed of being, in California, where I’ll never feel at home.”Homework by Geoff Dyer is published by Canongate (£20).

Combs wasarrested in September 2024and has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.On Tuesday, the prosecution called Capricorn Clark, a former employee of Combs, to the witness stand.Clark, who started working for Combs as a personal assistant in 2004, said that on her first day on the job, Combs became enraged upon learning that she had once worked for his rival, the record producer Suge Knight. Clark testified that Combs told her that “if anything happened he would have to kill me”, she said.Clark also described another time where she was subjected to five days of lie-detector tests after three pieces of jewelry went missing.She said that she was taken by a bodyguard working for Combs to a locked vacant Manhattan office space each day where an unnamed man wouldadminister the tests and told her that if she failed, “they’re going to throw you in the East River”.Clark testified that she left the job in 2006, after she said Combs physically pushed her after he heard that she had told another employee that she was dissatisfied with her job. She later returned to work for Combs.The prosecutionasked Clark about what happened when Combs discovered in December 2011 that his on-again, off-again girlfriend – the singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura – was dating the rapper Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi.Clark testified that Combs showed up at her house, “furious” with a gun in his hand, and asked her why she hadn’t told him about the relationship between Ventura and Mescudi.Clark alleged that Combs, while holding the gun, then kidnapped her to go to Mescudi’s house with him, allegedly telling her: “Get dressed, we’re going to go kill” Mescudi, despite her protesting. (Combs’s lawyers have denied that Clark was kidnapped.)Clark claimed that she was then made to get into a car with Combs. One of his security guards was driving, and there was a gun in Combs’s lap, Clark said.When they got to Mescudi’s house, Mescudi was not home. Clark testified that Combs and his security guardentered while she stayed in the car and called Ventura on a disposable cellphone to tell her what was happening.When Combs returned, Clark says that he directed her to call Ventura and to say that he would not release Clark until Ventura came.Ventura was picked up, and they returned to Combs’s home, where Combs allegedly told them not to speak to the police. He also allegedly said that they needed to get Mescudi to not tell the police he was involved.Clark also testified that she witnessed Combs kick and beat Ventura when she arrived at his home that day.Clark told the court that she was fired in 2012. And she said that, after she was terminated, Combs allegedly told her that she would “never work again”. He also told her that “all these people weren’t my friends and he would make me kill myself”, Clark recalled.Clark said she laterreceived a settlement from Combs’s attorneys over allegations of wrongful termination.In 2016, Clark said she returned to work for Combs as Ventura’s creative director, explaining that she had struggled to find other employment. She testified that Combs had final approval over everything when it came to Ventura’s career.During cross-examination, Combs’s lawyer emphasized Clark’s repeated returns to work for Combs over the years, pointing out that even as recently last year, after federal investigators had already begun investigating Combs, Clark met with his legal team and expressed interest in working as his chief of staff.Combs’s lawyer also challenged the kidnapping allegations, suggesting that Clark voluntarily accompanied Combs to Mescudi’s home in December 2011 in an attempt to prevent her boss from doing “something stupid”. The defense lawyer claimed that Clark had told Combs’s lawyers this during the meeting with Combs’s attorneys last year.Clark responded that she did not recall making that comment and insisted that she did not want to accompany Combs that day.Clark’s testimony wrapped just after 3.30pm ET on Tuesday and the court adjourned for the day. Prosecutors plan to call four witnesses on Wednesday.Clark’s testimony came after Mescuditook the standlast week and alleged that Combs broke into his home in 2011 after learning about his brief relationship with Ventura.Kid Cudi testifies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs broke into his home at sex-trafficking trialRead moreMescudi told the court how, a few weeks after the apparent break-in, his car was set on fire with a molotov cocktail, and that he believed Combs was responsible. Combs and his lawyers have denied the allegation.To date, more than 15 witnesses have testified so far in this trial. In addition to Mescudi, witnesses have includedsinger Dawn Richard,two of Combs’s formerassistants,Ventura’s former best friend,Ventura’s mother, anexotic dancer, amale revue manager,a hotel security officer,a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations(HSI), aforensic psychologist, amakeup artist who worked with Combs and Ventura, thegeneral manager of a Beverly Hills hotel, and acomputer forensics agentfrom HSI.Ventura, the prosecution’s key witness, spent four days on the stand detailingyears of physical and emotional abuse she says she endured by Combsduring their 11-year on-again, off-again relationship.She testified that Combs orchestrated and directed drug-fueled sex performances with male sex workers – encounters that he referred to as “freak-offs”. She also testified that hecoerced and blackmailedher into participating.Attorneys for Combs have tried to undermine Ventura’s credibility and have sought to portray her as a willing and consenting participant in the freak-offs.The trial is expected to continue for about six more weeks. If convicted, Combs could spend the rest of his life in prison.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

In barely a minute, the characters gab in the way you’d imagine adult-adults imagine young-adults speak, breezing through exposition, getting high, being broke and not having enough hot water to shower.This being New York, there’s also a subway masturbator, which Issa (Amita Rao), the loudest and bawdiest of a loud and bawdy group, handles by over-engaging, attempting to out-masturbate the creep. “Is this the world you want?!” she shouts, to the horror of everyone else on the train.Overcompensating review – an exquisite frat bro orgy of shirt-ripping, chest-thumping … and self-loveRead moreTo my horror, as well – there’s a fine line between cringe comedy and just cringe, and Adults, created by ex-Tonight Show writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw and executive produced bycoming-of-age comedian extraordinaireNick Kroll, is often on the wrong side of it. The barnstormer of an entrance – cue a joke about the progress of feminism – succeeds in setting the tone for the rest of the series (or at least, the six of eight episodes made available to critics): aggressively profane, a little off-putting, onto something but overdone, altogether doing too much. The television equivalent of the friend champing at the bit for inside jokes –Overcompensating, one could say, to borrow the title of another recent twentysomething comedy, albeit one set at US college, that has a better handle on its tone of heightened hijinks and egocentrism during a formative time.Which is a shame, because the viewing public is starved for a good show about one’s miserable and magical 20s in post-pandemic New York – or, believably for a group of genuinely broke post-grads, an hour-plus train ride away from Manhattan in outer Queens (as played by Toronto). The archetypically messy group living for free-ish in Samir’s (Malik Elassal) childhood home inhabit a recognizable world of post-Covid precarity and interconnectedness. Samir is chronically unemployed and struggling to assert himself. (His parents are off on a post-retirement jaunt.) His childhood best friend Billie (Lucy Freyer), the go-getter of the group, works at a cartoonishly bad media company with no health insurance. Even Anton (Owen Thiele), the house’s resident charismatic gay and admitted “friend slut”, doesn’t know what his job is besides chiming in “uh-huh” on Zoom (an update on the Friends bit about Chandler’s job). Issa appears to have made a career on hijacking social justice protests for personal gain. Her boyfriend, Canadian transplant Paul Baker (Jack Innanen) – always Paul Baker, never just Paul — is the group’s resident softboy, the enthusiastic golden retriever to the over-contrived scheme of the day, such as air-tagging a man as a potential solution to Anton’s dry spell.Over 20-ish minute episodes – Adults at least keeps it short and snappy – the crew flail about in ways both relatable and obnoxious. The gags are always a notch or two above necessary, such as an over-emphasis on a lack of physical boundaries (don’t you remember letting your best friend pee through your legs?) or Issa and Anton convincing themselves that they annoyed their therapist to the point of suicide. (Issa, in particular, is a too-grating parody of narcissism, as if Marnie Michaels had negative shame and was also a socialist.)The show hits all the expected bases – a go-around on sex-positive app Feeld, an inadvertent and exorbitant hospital bill, the phrase “defund the police and all, but … ” – and some unexpected ones, including guest turns from an admirably game Charlie Cox as Billie’s former teacher/older paramour and Julia Fox as her bleached eyebrow self. From house rules to a disastrous attempt at a roast chicken dinner party, all of it tastes overcooked, invoking the classic paradox that the harder one tries to make things look natural, the more contrived it seems.It’s not that Adults doesn’t have its moments, particularly as the season goes on and distances itself from a turkey of an opener. The cast, a mix of stand-up comedians, internet personalities and screen actors, eventually settles into a more level-headed groove, with Elassal and Freyer in particular demonstrating some emotional texture to their characters. (Thiele gets the award for comic timing). The less the writers strain for ego-centric, no-boundaries twenty-something-ness, the better; the funniest long-running bit is a simple gag about the gang referencing movies they haven’t seen.But these are too few and far between, and likely too late after the overkill of the first episode to win over its target audience, though if Adults shares one thing with today’s young people, it’s a formless, ambient sense of anxiety. Perhaps that will diffuse if the show is given time to grow, and these young adults learn what most twentysomethings do: in the game of winning friends and influencing people, one needn’t try so hard.Adults starts on FX and Hulu in the US on 28 May and Disney+ elsewhere on 29 MayExplore more on these topicsTV comedyTV reviewTelevisionComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

In oenological terms, you can really taste the terroir – the land on which it’s made – with notes of nostalgia and melancholy and a tangy, slightly humorous spice. But there’s also maybe a touch too much sweetness in the blend, given writer and director Antonio Sequeira’s script occasionally slips into a tannic, sentimental theatricality. If it weren’t for the fact that the stunning landscape plays such an integral part in the film’s atmosphere you’d assume that this must have started as a stage play given the tidy scene breaks, dividing the story into four consecutive seasons.In the first act, Otávio and his wife, Susana, (Elsa Valentim) are busy preparing to say goodbye to their eldest child Tomas (Salvador Gil), who is about to go off to university in London. As Tomas packs and Susana fusses trying to find the mislaid bongos he wants to bring with him, Otávio comforts himself by treading his grape harvest with his own feet – an old-school method that could be done in seconds, as Tomas says, if he hired in some equipment. Younger sister Belinha (Beatriz Frazao, who does the most convincing job of ageing over the course of the movie), worries about surviving the coming year with her annoying parents without Tomas around to take some of the heat. The act ends, like each of the subsequent segments, with the family seeing Tomas off on the train. By the spring, he’s back home with a new girlfriend (Krupa Narci Givane) whose Portuguese is not good enough to understand Otávio’s racist jokes, much to the younger characters’ relief.So this study in mild generational conflict goes on, in which no one is really a bad guy, not even Otávio for all his maladroit joshing. The dialogue is pretty conventional, although perhaps more expressive or interesting for native Portuguese speakers, while for the most part Sequeira doesn’t try anything too tricksy. That said, there’s one striking flashback to when Otávio and Susana were young (played by Ricardo de Sa and Sara Barradas), and we see them age up to the present over a series of deft edits in which every time Susana is carrying Tomas: first a baby, then as he grows older until poor Valentim is carrying the fully adult Gil piggyback, as an apt symbol of a mother’s self-imposed martyrdom. A few more expressive touches like this might not have gone amiss, but as it stands Autumn is a sturdy if not especially distinguished work.Autumn is on digital platforms in the UK from 2 June and in the US from 3 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFamilyPortugalEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

This trio of short, vivid works has also quietly established Moss as a revered chronicler of the political present. Though Ripeness bears many of the hallmarks of her recent fiction – evocative descriptions of the natural world abound, no speech marks used, chapter titles plucked suggestively out of the narrative – it also departs from it. It is longer, slower, European in setting, and its political critiques are ultimately muted.Ripeness is structured in alternating narrative strands, both following an English woman called Edith: one as a septuagenarian living comfortably in the west of Ireland in the post-pandemic present, and another as a bookish, Oxford-bound 17-year-old travelling to Italy in the late 60s. These strands are initially connected by stories of babies given up. In the present, Edith’s best friend Méabh is contacted by an unknown older brother who was adopted and raised in America and now wants to “see where he comes from”. In the historical strand, Edith is travelling to help her older sister, a professional ballerina, pregnant with a child she will almost immediately relinquish. Together, a textured and affecting story about place and identity emerges.Edith is sickened and wonders briefly if she can remain friends with ‘someone who thinks the problem is refugees’Early on we learn that Edith has four passports – English, Irish, French and Israeli – and that her French-Jewish mother was granted refuge in England in 1941 while her grandparents and aunt were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. Edith’s “Maman”, an artist and “iconoclast” to her friends in rural Derbyshire, advised her to always “leave before you’re certain, because if you wait until you know, there are boots coming up the stairs and blood on the walls”. While her mother’s migration was driven by genocide and trauma, and her grandparents before had fled Ukraine for France, she and her sister were able to travel freely around Europe, and the young Edith’s only real concern was that “the rising hemlines of the mid-60s had not reached the thigh of Italy”. But in the novel’s present, military aggression is again forcing migration. Edith reflects on the cyclical nature of conflict, noting that the “great grandparents of the people now fleeing Russian invasion and taking refuge here in the west of Ireland were the aggressors from whom her great-grandparents fled Ukraine”.A central tension is established when Edith discovers that while Méabh is sympathetic to their village’s Ukrainian refugees, she is actively protesting at the use of a local hotel as emergency housing for African refugees. Edith is sickened and wonders briefly if she can remain friends with “someone who thinks the problem is refugees”. Quickly she decides she can, though Méabh’s position continues to trouble her. She supports her plans to meet her brother, but stews over her own belief that “national identity isn’t genetic, that blood doesn’t give you rights of ownership”, that “Méabh’s brother can’t just come here and call it home, say he belongs, when nothing the Ukrainians do will ever entitle them to say such things, when the lads at the hotel aren’t even allowed the air they breathe”. These convictions are not unconsidered, and Edith gives much thought to various claims to and erasures of identity – including the Jewishness of her unknown nephew, adopted by nuns, and her Maman’s traumatic experiences of loss and migration. Yet, despite her personal connection to histories of genocide and displacement, her dismay at Méabh’s position fades.Edith’s convictions about “blood and soil” logic are betrayed by her lack of reproach to Méabh, and the novel’s shifts in narrative perspective allow us to view her critically. The chapters depicting the present are narrated in the third person, while those depicting Edith’s trip to Italy are in the first person. While the latter invite us to see the world through her eyes, the former allow some detachment between Edith and the reader and emphasise her privilege, biases and uncertainties. Edith is also increasingly reflexive and self-deprecating, eventually describing herself as having “remained more of narrator than a participant”.This evocative distinction between storytelling and action aligns with the novel’s dual narrative, which both connects us to and distances us from this compelling and at times frustrating character. However, because of her increasing self-deprecation and reflection, and at least partial awareness of her mistakes, Edith is ultimately presented as sympathetic. Her flaws are human and relatable and by its conclusion, the gap that has opened between the novel’s politics and its protagonist’s views has shrunk. Just as Edith’s dismay at Méabh’s comments fades, the anger of Ripeness wanes too. But while its critiques of contemporary attitudes towards migration, and failures in historical thinking, and the ways some refugees are accepted while others are not, do lose some force, it remains a powerful and beautifully written story of family, friendship and identity.Ripeness by Sarah Moss is published by Picador (£20).

All three films never deign to tell viewers much at all about Williams, who spends great chunks of the film doing almost nothing, like sleeping by a tree, taking a bath, or just pottering about at his home, Bogancloch in Aberdeenshire.However, there are oblique hints in plain sight if you look closely. In the bric-a-brac of Williams’ digs and the closeup shots Rivers inserts of some of Williams’ scratched and smudged photographs of places around the world he’s once visited, one of which shows the subject as a young man with a resplendent head of red hair. These days, his scalpline has much receded and both head hair and luxurious beard have turned white as a goblin, which at least makes him of a piece with the silvery black and white 16mm film stock Rivers shoots the film on. When he cuts away to those rumpled photographs, everything suddenly goes into colour. If that stab of pigment doesn’t shake you up, wait until Rivers breaks out the drone for a spectacular final shot.Not quite a documentary and not quite a work of fiction either, this is a contemplative curio that gets across that Williams himself leads a liminal life on the edge of society but not entirely separate from it. We see him meeting hikers in the wood and enjoying a visit from a choir around a campfire who sing a spectacular folk song in Scots dialect that’s about an argument between life and death. He even teaches some schoolkids about the solar system with an assist from a giant umbrella, although they all clear off as fleet as foxes when the bell rings.But Jake seems like a happy soul for all his solitude, happy to sing a song to himself and have a friendly conversation with his talkative cat, with whom in one early scene he shares a roadkill feast. It looks like a pretty mellow, content sort of life from where I’m standing, and not much different than that of your average self-employed home-based worker, but with more snow and silence.Bogancloch is in UK cinemas from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBen RiversScotlandRural affairsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now swimmers await the whistle to hit the pools againAthina KontosTue 27 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 27 May 2025 11.13 EDTShareThe vastness of Tarlair lido is hard to comprehend. Just a mile east of the town of Macduff, in Aberdeenshire, the lido’s three bodies of sea water are supplied by a tidal filling system and divided by a concrete wall, slippery with seaweed. The water’s reflection announces a striking mint-and-cream art deco pavilion, and a cinematic sea view. From the pavilion’s roof terrace, where dandelion-coloured tables and chairs are set out, it’s easy to lose a few minutes gazing beyond the salty outcrops to a northerly horizon.Originally commissioned by Macduff town council in 1929, the pavilion and pools – a paddling pool, boating “lake” and swimming pool – were designed by architect John C Miller and opened two years later as one of only three art deco lidos of their kind inScotland. The site reopened in late March after 30 years of closure and a decade of work costing approximately £2m. Momentum is building around the pavilion’s heavily anticipated summer comeback and it is hoped that the pools will eventually be able to welcome swimmers again, too.Tarlair trustee Reg Connon fondly remembers swimming here as a child in the late 1950s. “We used to come down as a family on weekends. We’d arrive at 10 in the morning and that was us until five at night … weather permitting,” he laughs.View image in fullscreenCold-water swimmers have also gathered for centuries at the nearby Salmon Howie cove.Photograph: Athina KontosGala days, swimming championships and even concerts catapulted Tarlair into a top leisure destination between the 1950s and 70s, serving communities and visitors alike as an attended pool from May until late August. It kept up its reputation until the 1980s and, on occasion, the water was emptied to host crowds for bands such as Jethro Tull, Wet Wet Wet and Celtic rockers Runrig.However, the early 90s saw a mass transfer of staff to an indoor pool in neighbouring Banff, which led to the lido’s gradual closure. Then, as rival attractions held sway, it crumbled into an abandoned playground until 2012.It’s haunting, serene, saturated with nostalgia – a panoramic portal to another time“The indoor pool at Banff changed everything,” Connon says. “Around the same time cheap flights abroad became available and it was never the same again.” In the high season, Moray Firth tourists were ushered instead to Speyside whisky distilleries, bottlenose dolphin lookout points and lifeguard-monitored beaches.Tarlair’s revival has been an arduous and inspirational 12-year effort by theFriends of Tarlair, a loyal band of 34 volunteers with the sole aim of restoring this once-thriving marine haven. The pavilion renovation project is a finalist in theScottish Design Awards.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Athina KontosOverseeing a pot of cullen skink for the pavilion’s lunch menu, Pat Wain, a former art teacher and chair of the trust, reflects on the process. “We’ve been messing around here for 12 years, but seriously trying to gain funding for 10 and, in that, many attempts were thwarted,” she says.A decade of funding has been granted by the Scottish government and Aberdeenshire council, rooted in the conservation of its status as an A-list property, but several conflicts meant its future was threatened continuously.“At one point two proposed outcomes were to turn it into a lobster hatchery or do nothing,” Wain laments. “I was just so incensed that doing nothing could be an option that three of us got together and formed the beginnings of the committee.”Registered charity status for the Friends of Tarlair followed in 2013, after the trio were told they couldn’t officially speak at a district meeting. They eventually acquired a 99-year lease on the pavilion and haven’t looked back since. It took a further eight years for a feasibility study to become a priority on the council’s agenda, with tireless campaigning from the trustees to keep the lido. “We carried on doing other things – keeping the rights of way clear, weeding the roads in the bay area, even though the road down here was well broken.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He visited on a bleak day in February and quickly became fixated on the site. A year later, Pat called, asking if he and a business partner atStudio Octopi, James Lowe, would take on the pavilion renovations. Closed since 1996, the mesmerising pools are now a visual spectacle only, and stand next in line for extensive renovations. Planning permission for their restoration will be submitted this summer.It’s still early in the day, yet streams of visitors circumnavigate the water, their curiosity – like mine – piqued. As a whole, the space is a crater of sorts, nestled below a jagged face of quartzite and limestone, framing a natural inlet once known as Loch Craig. It’s haunting, serene, saturated with nostalgia – a panoramic portal to another time and almost enough to make you forget your train of thought. Yet we’re all wondering: when can we get in?Cold-water swimmers have been a feature of this bay for centuries, gathering at Salmon Howie, an enchanting sandy cove on the inlet’s edge.“The lido – it’s as if it grew from the rock,” says Pat, who volunteers on the site six days a week. “Swimmers were always meant to be here.”Tarlair lido pavilion is opendaily, 9.30am-2.30pm,friendsoftarlair.co.ukExplore more on these topicsScotland holidaysSwimming holidaysUnited Kingdom holidaysHeritageScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the real secret is just practice, practice, practiceAnna BerrillTue 27 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the bestloaf tobake for sandwiches, and any filling ideas?“Obviously I’m biased, but soft and squishy sourdough makes the best sandwiches,” saysMartha de Lacey, sourdough teacher and writer. “The flavour is so much more complex and exciting than anything else you could use, and the crumb can have a slight moistness to it, which really contributes to the mouthwatering lushness that you want in a sandwich.”That’s not to say sourdough doesn’t come without some provisos, mind. First, you want a loaf that’s been baked that same day (“Several hours earlier, ideally,” De Lacey says), with a tender crumb and a nice, thin, crisp crust that “isn’t too teeth-pullingly chewy”. As is often the case, success comes down to the quality of your ingredients: “Use really good flours, not just supermarket basics,” says De Lacey, who favours an 80:20 mix of strong white and granary, and “a pretty high hydration for the requisite soft crumb”. Then, try and try again. “Really practise your preferred sourdough tekkers until you can do it in your sleep. Honestly, the main trick to excellent sourdough is practice – boring but true!”Phil King, executive chef ofPophamsin London, meanwhile, stands by his bakery’s tin loaf made from a mix of white and 20% rye flour. “It needs to be recognisable as a white sandwich tin loaf, while also giving that earthy, nutty flavour associated with rye bread, only without the denseness.” To achieve something similar, King suggests taking a white bread recipe, cutting the yeast by 80% and using a two-stage rising process: “One before you shape it, then knock it back, put it in the tin and let it have another rise.” This will produce a fluffy texture and even crumb structure, so “you’re not left with large gaping holes that the filling falls through”. Alternatively, try something with a crust on both sides, says Richard Snapes, author ofBread & Butter: “An Italian-style bread such as focaccia or ciabatta, say. People are often scared of them, because they require a wet dough, but they’re not hard to make at home.”Sandwich construction, meanwhile, should be carried out as close to eating as possible, King says, starting with a fat barrier (butter, mayo, cream cheese) to stop moisture getting into the crumb, and balancing the fillings with the same attention you would give to a main meal. Snapes combines ricotta, olive oil, lemon zest and parmesan to spread on focaccia, then tops with charred asparagus (“if you eat meat, put some speck in there, too”).And, as summer rolls in, tomatoes are always on De Lacey’s agenda, with a very good home for them being a BLT with plenty of mayo (“homemade orHellmann’s, and absolutely nothing in between”), a load of crisp smoked streaky bacon and crunchy iceberg lettuce. “Anything you put in a salad will also be excellent in a sandwich,” King says, adding that you won’t go far wrong with tomatoes, a good dressing, loads of fresh herbs, maybe a few capers and definitely seasoned “to the max, because the bread will temper those flavours”. Otherwise, cool things down with cucumber: “Big chunks with fresh coriander chutney and loads of cream cheese.”It’s also worth considering sweet and savoury combos – think rhubarb jam, peanut butter and pancetta, which, King says, “is every shade of wild”. But sarnie satisfaction ultimately comes down to one thing, De Lacey says: “Be liberal with the moistness. There’s nothing worse than forcing a dry sandwich down your gullet.” *Shudders*Got a culinary dilemma?

Sure, it’s a made-up meal, but on a bank holiday, when that extra day feels like the best gift ever, it’s a meal that I like to adhere to. A slow morning, hopefully featuring some sun and all the socialising. There also seems to be less pressure with a brunch, compared with, say, a roast dinner. Whatever time you serve it, your guests will be thrilled. Throw in a bit of drama with this Dutch baby. You can even make the batter and spiked creme fraiche in advance, so it’s pretty stress-free, too, leaving you to have a natter with friends or curl up and read the paper. Heaven.Spinach, trout and caper dutch babyPrep5 minCook45 minServes43 large eggs100g plain flour150ml whole milk50g baby spinach1 big bunchsoft herbs(I like a mix of dill, flat-leaf parsley and chives), finely choppedSea salt andblack pepper30g unsalted butter3 tbsp capers1 lemon200g creme fraiche2 avocados(optional)150g smoked troutHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Crack the eggs into a blender jug, then add the flour, milk, spinach and half the herbs, and season generously. Blitz to a smooth batter and set aside.Put half the butter in a large ovenproof frying pan and pop it on a medium heat. Fry the capers for a few minutes, until crisp, then transfer to a plate.Put the remaining butter into the hot pan and pop it in the oven for three to five minutes, until the butter has melted and the pan is very hot. Working quickly and carefully, pour the batter into the pan, return it to the oven and close the door. Don’t touch it for 25 minutes – have faith.Meanwhile, prepare the accompaniments. Finely grate the lemon zest into the creme fraiche, then squeeze in the juice. Season well and stir in most of the remaining chopped herbs. Peel and slice the avocados, if using.When the Dutch baby is cooked, sprinkle over the crisp capers and the remaining chopped herbs, then take it to the table in its pan and serve with the lemony creme fraiche, sliced avocado and smoked trout on the side.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.
